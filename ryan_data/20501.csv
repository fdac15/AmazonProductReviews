"I serve Accent-enhanced dishes to people who are ""allergic"" to MSG all the time. Sometime after the meal I hand them a can and enjoy the stories they come up with.It makes food delicious. Use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFYXURU5KBXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017TN3UC#wasThisHelpful","R2XFYXURU5KBXA","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an odd book, and you should know what you're getting in to.Cons (yes these are before the pros):-This entire book has one actual project in it. To be fair the one project is a neat one, starting with the basics of what the BeagleBone is and going all the way up to using a web page on your computer to control flashing LEDs on your board. But honestly you could jam all that project work into a three-page pamphlet.-Who is the audience? The book waffles between a bare-bones beginner approach (appropriate for a child who's barely used a computer before), and a long-time computer pro approach (whole chapters are just long diatribes on technical errata that a general audience can't wade through). Pick an audience, and stick with it.-Most chapters are purely theoretical, with no immediate application. The chapter on connecting to BeagleBone with your mobile device basically boils down to, ""this is beyond the scope of this book"". There's a lot of good information in there, but zero that a beginner can use, and no beginner can possibly wade through all the arcane technical bits without some practical applications.Pros:-Covers Both BBB (black) and BBW (white).-All examples and code given are correct, and are given appropriate troubleshooting so that someone with a basic familiarity of code debugging can get the examples running.-Lots of advanced information. The aforementioned section on connecting a mobile device to your BeagleBone covers TCP/IP, and cellular networks, and security, and lots more. Good information- but zero application.Really this book is for a computer professional who has a project in mind but needs a quick introduction before continuing. This book will prep you on safety concerns, voltages, what capes are and what they do, and why you're probably going to want a boilerplate solution for connecting your board to your Android device rather than attempting it from scratch. That's where this book shines. It is not for beginners, and it is not for people who are already familiar with the BeagleBone who are looking for some new project ideas. It doesn't have any.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV4TM7Y3TCXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RP13BOE#wasThisHelpful","R2KV4TM7Y3TCXX","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They're okay. I don't think I'm going to buy any to replace my review bag, but if I was hungry at work and someone had a bag I wouldn't turn them down.Pros:-Good amount of protein. 7g per 180 calorie serving.-Definite blueberry and wheat flavors, doesn't taste like a ""health food"".-Tastes sort of like oatmeal cookie batter? Like if you made a batch of oatmeal cookies and took them out of the oven before they really firmed up, you'd get these. It's a little odd but not bad.Cons:-Very little fiber, 1g per serving.-Some people have noted this is basically just a Nature Valley soft granola bar chopped into pieces, and that's pretty accurate.If you think you'd like the taste of blueberry oatmeal cookie batter, pick these up. Personally I'm trying to think of a way to get them into the oven to finish baking them. These aren't for me, but they're not bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UIIFH23BPBCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNOL6#wasThisHelpful","R2UIIFH23BPBCV","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these wipes.Pros:-Handy canister. The containers are high quality and work well, some wipes will have problems like the lid pulling off before towels separate, these seem like they're built better.-The wipes are strong, so they don't tear apart during use.-Yet they're gentle, and feel comfortable one face and hands.-No residue! This is really nice, as many competing products leave behind a sticky feeling, or oftentimes wipes will have a little baby powder mixed in so you get that powdery feeling. These wipes are balanced enough not to leave behind a noticeable residue.Cons:-The smell of the wipes is a little odd and chemical out of the canister, but again there's not residue, so this is a minor quibble.Overall highly recommended. It's the quality you'd expect from Purell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MGGOSNSVA1F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WK262NK#wasThisHelpful","R2MGGOSNSVA1F8","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent towel set.Pros:-Soft, yet strong. The mat is comfortable yet seems sturdy enough to take some odd poses and slips.-Absorbent. The mat and towel are more than capable of handling the average workout.-Attractive. It's useful to have a comfortable setting when you're doing yoga or any other exercise you might use these towels for, and they're certainly attractive enough to suit your workout.-The floor mat even has rubber contact points to help prevent slipping, which is a nice touch.Cons:-Finish is merely okay. While the edges certainly don't seem like they'll unravel anytime soon, the stitching shows some loose threads in spots, so eventually it will give out. The construction could use just a bit more care.So this is a great yoga towel set. It's certainly a step up from reusing a beach towel. The good looks and the anti-slip feature are more than enough to warrant a look.And to counter some bad science going around, the facts on triclosan:-Yes, triclosan is a pesticide. So is peppermint oil, and capsaicin (the ingredient that causes peppers to be hot). Something can be both a pesticide and also be safe for humans to use, that's why it's called ""pesticide"" and not ""poison"".-As of writing, some tests have shown triclosan to cause health problems in lab animals. There is only very limited data relating to tests on humans, and these tests focus on accumulation of triclosan in the body from environmental sources.-So as of writing, there is currently no reason to suspect that using these towels will give you cancer. The major concern with this chemical is that triclosan is widely used on farms, leading to runoff in the water supply.-See your country's governing health organization for further recommendations if you have a concern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107YMJSCB9UV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYJWXMS#wasThisHelpful","R107YMJSCB9UV8","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warning: I cannot find an ingredient list for these cups anywhere. No nutrition label, no ingredients, nothing. These products are produced by Brooklyn Beans, who don't even post nutritional information on their website so far as I can tell. I'm not even sure how that's legal? Giving minimum stars for this. What if someone has a food allergy and has serious health problems thank to the improper labeling? This is ridiculous.The closest I could find was off the website OKCups, which lists the ingredients for the Mexican Hot Chocolate as: PURE CANE SUGAR, NON DAIRY CREAMER (CORN SYRUP SOLIDS, HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL, SODIUM CASEINATE (A MILK DERIVATIVE), DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, MONO-AND DIGUCERIDES, SALT, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM SILICOALUMINATE, SOY LECITHIN, ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, ARTIFICIAL COLORS). MALTODEXTRIN, COCOA, CINNAMON, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, SALT, SILICONE DIOXIDE AND CAYENNE PEPPER. CONTAINS MILK MANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT PROCESSES SOY.The Brooklyn Bean website specifies that some of its Hot Chocolate K-Cups were mislabeled and do in fact contain aspartame so this may not be an accurate ingredient list. Brooklyn Beans does not specify what products were affected.Really, I'm leaving it at that.

"The K'NEX K-Force Dual Cross Building Set certainly has some plusses and minuses worth considering before you buy it. Overall I like it, but see below for details.Pros:-HUGE! It's actually pretty surprising how big this set is when constructed. Anyone who gets this set will be pleased with the result.-K'NEX quality, I haven't had a broken or snapped part yet.-Strong dart launchers. The included darts go a decent distance, comparable to NERF products, allowing for a decent degree of range and accuracy.Cons:-HUGE! Parents are going to want to encourage kids to download and build the smaller sets just because the main one is so massive. It's so big you might actually have to worry about smaller kids trying to use it- the grips are way back on one end of the large launcher so it's pretty cumbersome to wield.-Kind of wasteful. The actual dart shooters are just the little neon yellow bits on the end, the rest of the shooter is just rigging. Anyone who thinks about this enough is going to either just use the dart shooters by hand, or build a much smaller contraption to fire them.-K'NEX instructions aren't as clear as LEGO. I'm a decades-long veteran of various construction kits and I was still left scratching my head a little in places, or having to redo a bit I mounted incorrectly on the first try. Colors in the manual are also very fussy- try telling the dark blue from the dark gray from the black from the dark purple, they really need to work on their instruction systems.Overall this is a very cool toy. A fun dart launcher that's still as safe as any NERF product. The only complaints are that the darts don't have suction cups on the end, and the large kit on the box is so huge it may actually be hard to wield or store. Download and build the smaller launchers- and then you can have to for shootouts- and you'll probably be happier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UW7WCP9U2HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YA2U8#wasThisHelpful","R12UW7WCP9U2HU","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice gift soap.Pros:-HUGE! This bar of soap is maybe a baseball and a half at a guess? It's gigantic, but manageable. Very interesting shape.-The gift box is gorgeous, and generously scented. The soap comes in a bit of Easter-style grass, making it look like an egg all safely nested into its nest.-The scent is strong, but not overwhelming nor unpleasant. I agree with other reviewers that it has a hint of old lady perfume, but in a very nostalgic way, no males who've smelled it have had any issue with it.-Real soap. Sometimes products advertise ""real soap"" but in practice they're awful chemical concoctions. You can tell this really is soap.-Durable. Although the butter content means this isn't the longest-lasting kind of soap, it also doesn't completely melt in the shower. I expect this to last a decent while.Cons:-The smell is slightly old lady and floral, which might be unappealing for some. Everyone I've handed it to has found it pleasant, but be aware.-Pricey. Obviously this isn't an everyday soap, but as a gift it's great.I like it. This is a wonderful gift for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RVV0LPH32Y54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9NR476#wasThisHelpful","R1RVV0LPH32Y54","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a perfect kitchen set. No complaints. OXO started with a simple philosophy, put easier to use- large and rubberized- handles on kitchen appliances so they're more comfortable to use. They paired that with good quality products at reasonable prices. And that's my review of this entire set in a nutshell.Pros:-Everything you need for a small kitchen.-The OXO vegetable peeler is one of the best out there.-The spatula is already the workhorse of my kitchen.-The whisk is sturdy, so many cheap sets have painfull weak whisks that cause problems, no such issues here. It's just what it should be for this size and price.Cons:-The measuring cups and spoons feel a little cheap. They work, but they definitely wouldn't take much abuse.-The tongs are a little small, really only working with smaller pans, but if I had to pick between these or paying more I'd take these.-I'd prefer a microplane to a grater, but that's nitpicking.I'd say if you're a single person starting to furnish your apartment, this is an absolute must-have alongside a set of cheap wooden spoons. It's everything you need, and nothing you don't (although I personally won't make much use of the grater). Great quality, good price, and most of the set will remain durable for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZL8H30OTGL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G7TNW4#wasThisHelpful","RQZL8H30OTGL4","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The moment you unzip the heavy zipper on this lovely leather case, you realize that your money was worth it. Smelling the new leather alone is a treat. Every piece is excellent, beautiful, and works wonderfully. I wish I could give this a bit of a star off as I had a very small decorative defect in my kit- and if I'm paying this much I hope my kit is perfect- but that's as nitpicky as I can possibly be about this set.Included (left-to-right):-Small nail clippers. Interestingly, these are completely straight whereas the larger ones are curved. There's a nail file built into the handle.-Nail scissors. Whether you have tough nails or prefer the old-school method, these scissors feel surgical-grade. I like that the spring mechanism pulls out for storage, and a button fastener. Curved.-Large nail clippers. These are also curved and rather gently which I like, these actually don't have a nail file like the smaller version. The back of these clippers has a large pad that helps you hold them, they're gorgeous and very tactile. Also has a thin nail file down the back, although this nail file can only be used while the clippers are closed, whereas the one for the smaller clippers is used when they're open, odd but it works.-Nose hair clippers. Finally, nose clippers that work. Thanks to the fine grade of steel they're thinner so they reach everywhere easily, they work correctly, and they still have enough of a safety bubble on the end so you're not stabbing yourself. I really like these. Not to mention- a lot of cheap nose clippers I've used leave a smell thanks to the metal, and these don't have that issue.-Tweezers. These are beautifully crafted, with a good angle to make them easy to use.-Nail file. With two different patterns, one rougher and one smoother.I'm in love. This set is lovely enough that you'll be thinking about where it's going to go in your will when you pass it on.

"Wow, get this for your kid.REAL SCIENCE! Too many new science books for kids come with a limited selection of completely pre-fabricated bits, with all the ""experiments"" 100% planned so there's no real experimentation. This is completely different, the book gives kids a short list of things they need like ""milk carton, 4 paper cups..."" so kids are encouraged to explore, and try things for themselves, and there's lots of notes on alternate materials you can try- kids are encouraged to experiment and compare the results. Wonderful!All levels of challenge. Most experiments are given in a fairly simple form, then followed by a series of challenge questions or ways to improve the apparatus. An example is the ""nephoscope"", essentially you take a mirror and mark the compass directions on it. You place this mirror flat on the ground, and use it to see gauge the direction and speed of clouds moving overhead. One challenge question involves the fact that weather reports don't say what direction the wind is moving *toward* but what direction the wind is moving *from*, and challenges the experimenter to reverse the directions on their nephoscope. Questions like these provide a wonderful way to get kids to think critically- for example *why* do weather reports use the direction the wind is from? Good science books should encourage kids to formulate such questions for themselves.REAL DANGER! Science geeks complain constantly about how sanitized modern science kits are. For example, you can no longer purchase an off-the-shelf chemistry kit with strong acids, which limits children from performing many interesting experiments. It's a bit like trying to protect your kid from ever being burned, by getting rid of your oven- there are better ways. There is no such problem in this book. For one of course you're challenged to get your own materials, so the author can list any materials at all- even when they involve high voltage! Yes, this is a science book that includes serious warnings of chemical burns, electrocutions, and lacerations. I'm sure there's a ""helicopter parents"" somewhere who's hyperventilating at these warnings, but for anyone who cares about real experimental science, this is a blessing. Each experiment is carefully crafted to allow kids the maximum exposure to concepts with minimal risk- but risk is not left out of the book merely for legal reasons. Safety is in the hands of the experimenter (and hopefully an adult who's there to lend support without too much hand-holding).Age range? Nah. This book does not come stamped all over with an age range- nor should it. When I was a budding scientist kid, I was doing a lot of similar experiments in gradeschool. Other kids might not get into this until their teens. The appropriate age range for this book begins when a child is old enough to ask questions (with the help of a guardian of course), and ends when they've gotten too crabby to experience any more wonder. I'd say ""5 to 105"" is a good range. Parents can benefit too- I know a lot of adults who can't manage to build half the things in this book, when a lot of interested children will breeze right through. This is something parent and child can enjoy together.All in all, this is a wonderful book. If you love your child / nieces and nephews / grandchildren / child you mentor, get it for them today. Then open up your junk bins so they can find some old parts, and maybe even dig out that old radio so you can play with the transistors. Generations of America's best scientists and Nobel prizewinners grew up this way, and your kids should too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXUYTRPM6ZI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457186896#wasThisHelpful","RGXUYTRPM6ZI9","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good mouse with a curious feature set, the MX Anywhere 2 might be just what you're looking for, if you're a very specific type of user. The ideal user for this mouse is someone who regularly connects to up to 3 different Bluetooth-enabled devices (one of which can be via the included wireless dongle), but who doesn't switch their ""home"" device often (see below), and who doesn't need to use the middle mouse button very often. That's a specific user profile.Pros:-Premium feel. Rubberized surfaces and executive-style metallic accent on the scroll wheel will assure you that this isn't a cheap mouse.-Great battery life. The box promises months on a full charge, and given the size of the battery pack that's very believable.-Generic Bluetooth compatible. Although the device has one wireless dongle in case you need to work with a computer that isn't Bluetooth-enabled, it also connects to generic Bluetooth at the press of a button, meaning you can connect to new devices with the press of a button.-Plug-and-play. Although this is standard on modern devices, it's nice to see there's zero hassle with setup, my computer detected it instantly like any other mouse.-Great sensor. I haven't found a surface yet that this mouse can't read accurately.-USB rechargeable. Connects with an included USB micro cable, and given that awesome life you won't need the cable often. Neat.-Robust scroll wheel. Up, down, left, right, although oddly no middle click, that's on the gesture button. In fact the scroll wheel still clicks, but doesn't seem to register any functions. Weird. Oh wait, I read online (due to the lack of documentation) that clicking the wheel switches between a free-wheeling or resistance mode, so the scroll wheel is either ""clicky"" like most mice or allows you to throw it for extended scrolling. Weird.-Gesture button. Takes the place of a middle mouse click, and supposedly allows the use of gestures. Not something I'm sure I'll use especially since there's no included manual telling you how to use them (more below), but maybe other people have a use for it.-Back-forward buttons on the left side.Cons:-Back-forward buttons are only for right-handed people. Sorry, lefties.-Lack of documentation. How do you use the gestures? Look online. What does clicking the scroll wheel do? Look online. I wish this had a manual.-One wireless dongle. Should you need to connect to multiple devices that aren't Bluetooth-enabled, you'll be moving around the dongle like times of old.-No spot to store the dongle. This is pretty puzzling, as most any mobile mouse will have a little slot for storing the wireless dongle when not in use. Since this mouse connects with Bluetooth you might not need to use the dongle at all- in which case where does it go? Or if you switch devices often where you need the dongle, you'll have to sort out a way not to lose it.-No wired mode. It's a little weird that the device recharges via USB, but won't connect through USB, so even though there's a cable running from your computer to your mouse it won't work until you also connect via dongle or Bluetooth. Counterintuitive.Overall, it's a bit of a weird package. As a mobile user I certainly appreciate the feel and the battery life. As a power user, I'm left scratching my head about the feature set. Why isn't there a spot to store the dongle? Why isn't the scroll wheel the middle mouse button by default? It's hard to make a general recommendation because I could see some of these issues being deal-breakers, a lot of professionals need a strong middle mouse button and this one is just too cumbersome.If you're a regular mobile user looking for a good mouse, this one certainly works, but so does the bargain Logitech mouse you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price. I can only recommend upgrading if you're frustrated having to change batteries (although modern mice rarely need changed very often), or if you have a lot of trouble with different surfaces (this mouse's sensor is definitely a step up). This mouse just doesn't seem to suit a lot of users.If this exact same mouse had a few small engineering fixes put into place it'd be an absolute winner, but as-is, read the feature set carefully and see if it's for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FOMHXT8QEAOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y09IWGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FOMHXT8QEAOJ","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice bag, even for a tall guy it's perfect.Pros:-I'm a big guy, 6'+, and the bag fits me just fine.-There's a hood you can zip on or off, which is very nice especially if you ever get hit with sudden severe conditions and need to bundle up.-There's a removable ""middle layer"" which you can sleep on top of, or put over you like a blanket, or remove altogether. This allows for a great variety of setup options and temperature control, it's brilliant.-Quality is good. As some have noted this is a fairly heavy/bulky bag, but honestly the ultralight bags some people are looking for cost multiple times this price- for the price, this bag is gorgeous.Cons:Does come tightly jammed into its carrying pouch, so it could be a hassle trying to get it back in for long-term storage.

"This is an excellent knife sharpener to accompany the Victorinox line of kitchen knives, and it has an undocumented trick a lot of people seem to be confused about- combo surfaces.YES IT HAS TWO DIFFERENT SURFACES! Opposite sides of the steel are in two different patterns. There's a ridged ""sharpening"" side, and a smooth ""honing"" side. Most consumer kitchen ""honing"" rods are actually slightly abrasive like the ridged portion of this steel. This results in a less than perfect edge, but it performs a slight amount of sharpening so you can maintain a ""good enough"" edge for most kitchen use longer in between having to give your knives a professional resharpening. Smooth rods are less common, they perform no sharpening and only help to realign the existing cutting edge- this will only help maintain an existing edge longer, it does not ""resharpen"" the blade. Professionals often prefer smooth steels because they have an in-house program to get their knives professionally resharpened whenever they need it.Pros:-Long. At 12"", this steel should be long enough to safely sharpen any home knife.-Two different surfaces, a ridged sharpening side and smooth honing side.-Adequate construction. Victorinox often use inexpensive plastic handles to reduce cost. They grip well in any condition, and the cheaper price is worth it.Cons:-Honestly I'm sure they could make the handle a bit nicer without affecting the price. It still grips well, but it's enough of an eyesore that I stash it away in a drawer between uses.-Doesn't come with sufficient documentation, leaving people confused about what the different surfaces are for.Overall highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJO0Q7SU0SBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MF2RTK#wasThisHelpful","R1XJO0Q7SU0SBC","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One secret all good bakers know is that the cheapest way to get a great pan is to go to your local restaurant supply store, where you can find a ""quarter baking sheet"" for around around a third of the price of this Doughmakers pan as of writing. This will be an even heavier-gauge aluminum pan with thick side walls to make the pan more rigid, and it's what any good baker uses for small batches of cookies or biscuits or whatever.Overall this Doughmakers pan is a fine and attractive pan, but the next time I wanted to bake some biscuits I went back to my quarter sheet as usual. If I damage my quarter sheet or burn something on it, then oh well I'll get another one. This Doughmakers pan is too expensive so I don't want to abuse it like that, and it doesn't offer much of a performance upgrade to justify the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R378CQN0ZG75QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QCMFYG#wasThisHelpful","R378CQN0ZG75QE","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent, if fairly bulky, mount.Pros:-Spring-loaded grippy claw holds phones up to 6"" screen size or thereabouts. I loaded in my Galaxy S5 (5.1"" diagonal) with an Otterbox Commuter case, it fits easily and holds well. The grips have protective foam so they won't scratch your phone, and the foam provides extra grip.-Durable construction. If anything, the base is over-engineered. The ""head"" swivels 360 so handle any phone orientation, and it also has some freedom to rotate left-right-up-down, meaning it can suit pretty much any position you can imagine. The stem leading to the base even has a hole in case you want to thread your power cord through it for cable management. They thought of almost everything.-Dual mounts. The unit itself has a locking suction cup mount which is large and sturdy for locking to glass or appropriate surfaces. You also get a small base which can attach to your dash with a sticker, and the unit then suctions itself to the base, making it removable even if dash mounted. Very nice.Cons:-Fairly large and bulky. I have a dual-level dash where I can sneak a GPS unit between the two levels if it's mounted directly to the bottom half. This unit is too tall, so I can't do that. The only adjustment this unit doesn't come with is height, so your phone will always be a good distance off whatever surface it's on, this is designed so your phone will fit in even with power plugged in, but it is quite tall.Note on sizing:The smallest and largest sizes this mount can hold are almost exactly defined by a credit card. So long as the width of your device is between the short and long sides of a credit card, it will fit this mount.Overall:So long as you've got room for the overall size of the mount, you won't find a better universal mount on the market. It's strong, attractive, and adapts to most devices. I'd prefer if the unit were shorter or had a height adjustment, but I admit I'm looking for a fairly rare mounting option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWKQL8EIAWNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLY9VC#wasThisHelpful","R3RWKQL8EIAWNL","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent curtains, but the picture doesn't convey what an ""old lady"" design these really are. They look more like the lace doily your grandma might have for her china teacups, than an everyday curtain.Pros:-Good quality. The curtains are heavy enough that they don't flap too much in the wind, proven when a storm hit recently.-Let plenty of light through.

"You can really feel the difference. I suppose the closest comparison I'm familiar with is the DR coated strings, such as the ""DR Red Devil"". The coated DR strings have a light coating that doesn't really alter the feel of the string very much, but they do slightly protect your strings and they come in awesome colors that are usually UV-sensitive (or, they look great under a blacklight), so those strings are both for protection and looks. The Elixirs focus only on protection, and they seem to do that job better.Pros:-Work like normal strings, I can't hear much of a tonal difference, there's certainly not enough of a muting effect to know this is a coated string versus merely being a difference brand of string.-Feel smooth. Imagine if your strings were made of smooth plastic. It's a nice feeling, and will be nicer with time as where normal strings would start getting a little rusty the Elixirs will still be ""like new"" for longer.Cons:-None.I see a lot of people complaining about the range of strings included in the pack- there are several packs for light/medium/heavy, and each has its gauge printed on the pack, so this is a case of buyers not doing adequate research. The included range is fairly standard, so do your homework and get the strings you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1XE0WZ5TMGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E1O6I#wasThisHelpful","RZ1XE0WZ5TMGC","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This should really say ""decorative towel set"". These towels are thin, scratchy, and the designs are obviously going to be destroyed by even light use.

I'm glad this is just from a review copy, because if I'd purchased these on my own I probably would have returned them. Not worth the cost, decorative-only towels.They do work, since they are cotton.

"Anyone who thinks the tiny solar panel on this could charge a cell phone, doesn't know much about solar panels. Sorry folks, but cell phones require a lot of juice, so don't buy this if you expect to be streaming video all day. The instruction say you'll need to use the hand crank vigorously for 5+ minutes just to get a minute of talk time, and that's more in line with reality. That aside, this is a great radio.Pros:-Attractive design. The red case has good visibility, all the controls are clear, and the case has an almost rubberized finish, it's a pleasure to hold.-Easy to use. I found the dials easy to operate, tuning into a couple of local stations readily, so the sensitivity is good.-Good reception. I had no problem hearing any station I tried, this is as good as you can expect of any pocket radio.-All the bells and whistles. Sturdy case, all the bands, hand crank or solar, flashlight, and yes even a way to hand crank a cell phone.Cons:-No battery backup. Once the small built-in rechargable runs out you'll have to charge it by hand or wait for solar.Overall:Highly recommended. This is a perfect emergency radio. Get one today.Solar Power for Dummies:It's kind of amazing how little people seem to know about solar. Here's your quick guide to understanding solar on this radio. The solar panel is tiny, we're talking the sort of power you're used to seeing on a pocket calculator- and those don't have speakers for a reason. A solar panel large enough to power your average phone would have to be larger than this device (people make smaller ones, but they don't work very well!). If you've ever used a solar pocket calculator, you have an idea what you're getting here. You should also know you need pretty strong light coming from directly overhead to get decent results. The sun needs to be fairly high in the sky (or the device tilted toward the sun) to get much power at all, and even then clouds or a low seasonal sun will limit the maximum power you can get. Just placing this in a window probably won't do much. You're placing the solar panel flat (not tilted toward the sun), you're probably not doing it at high noon (sun is at a low angle), and it's behind a window (all glass blocks some light, and you may also have a bug screen too). The solar panel is really only for emergencies- you'd have to leave the device outside in the high noon sun for a few hours to get some decent listening time, and then the device isn't fully waterproof! Basically just always leave this radio somewhere where it can get some ambient light, so it'll be fully charged if an emergency hits, but in actual use, you're going to need to use the hand crank almost exclusively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKATHPHO7J0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QTXKCE#wasThisHelpful","R2XKATHPHO7J0J","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the 4-person tent, and WOW. I'm impressed. A tip for beginners: always order a bigger tent than the label shows. A ""2-person"" tent really means it can sleep two people in an emergency, if you want to be comfortable, you want to order a tent with double the space. Another way to think about it is that one person plus their gear (backpack, food, etc) is basically two people. I'm expecting to have one guest, so two people plus two packs = 4 person tent.Pros:-Instant setup. Really just zip open the bag, toss it in the air, and it lands unfolded. That's it. And it comes from the factory with the rain cover already attached, so it's done. Of course you should stake it down so it resists wind, but honestly you could just throw gear in the corners and you're finished.-Great size. I'm over 6 feet tall, and this tent is HUGE. I certainly can't stand up inside, but it's more than comfortable for 2 large people to sleep in with extra space for gear.-Full features. Includes removable rain cover, which protects a huge area of breathable bug net- this tent should ventilate very well. Has two doors, one is an opaque rain cover, the other has breathable bug net. Also has a small device pocket inside to keep important items off the ground, great to protect electronics from any sudden problems. Comes with all the stakes and tie-downs you need.-Easy to put away, if you're physically sound. It takes some practice and some careful reading of the instructions, but once you know what you're doing, one person can fold this tent up and store it in seconds. Note that you do need to be fairly limber to put this one away as you're dealing with a springy item, so anyone with physical limitations will want to have two people for the job.-Attractive, high-visibility colors. If you ever need rescuing, this is an easy tent to find.Cons:-Cheap zippers. At this price, you do have to be careful, as material may get caught in the zippers and lead to snags. Just be careful and you'll be fine.-No ""porch"" area. The door opens at a fairly low angle, so if you're getting in or out in the rain you can expect a lot of water to creep into the front. I'll probably remedy this by hanging a tarp, but it's worth noting that you may want to consider holding an umbrella over the door if you can.Overall:Really a brilliant design. It truly does pop up, it's very full-featured for its price range, and the quality is certainly acceptable for a cheap tent.

"This is a decent product, but I'm not sure why you'd buy it over standard Febreeze.Pros:-Light scent, maybe even a little lighter and more ""clean"" smelling than the original-Basically works the same as Febreeze, eliminates orders (although it doesn't have ""six-hour"" protection, it just works on contact)-Spray bottle is very effective, maybe even better than the standard squeeze bottleCons:-More expensive than regular Febreeze. This to me is a killer. Although the ""Unstopables Fresh"" scent is nice, it's not so nice as to warrant a price increase. I'm going to stick to the regular scent, and save money. They both work equally well.Overall:-This certainly isn't a bad product, and it might be perfect if you think the scent of Febreeze is a little overpowering, but otherwise it's the same product at a higher price.

It's definitely Lipton tea.Cons:-More expensive than making your own, and more expensive than using a powdered mix.-Lipton flavor. I always think Lipton tastes a little off, like a Chinese gunpowder tea or something, I'd prefer a more neutral flavor, something like an English breakfast tea.So there it is.

"First impressions? High quality, smart storage.Pros:-Although it says it's a soft case, the shell is quite rugged, sort of a rubberized plastic that'll definitely take some beating.-The zipper feels robust, almost to the point of being sticky, but I haven't had it catch so it seems fine.-Comes with both a carrying handle and carabiner clip.-The lid has a padded compartment to store small items, sort of one flap goes over the other so just stuff your item under them. The only downside is the mesh isn't see-through so you have to remember what you threw in there.-I didn't notice on purchase, but the elastic bands for holding things to the bottom are on a pad with hook-and-loop fastener, so this false bottom can be removed if you don't need the straps, gaining a bit of extra space- maybe you can even find another use for the elastic outside the case by sticking it to something.-The elastic bands seem to be decently arrayed, I threw three items in and they're all held securely.Cons:-As said, the zipper is a little tough, so don't expect a speedy open. The zipper does however seem to have a robust construction, so I'm willing to take this trade-off if it doesn't snag.Overall recommended. This is an attractive, sturdy case which could hold a variety of items thanks to its universal set of straps- or pull that piece out if you just need a padded box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQRKDSMXVYEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIDKMOM#wasThisHelpful","R2HQRKDSMXVYEN","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As of writing, the list price for the 8-plant kit is over $1 a plant, although each does come with what I assume is Miracle-Gro fertilizer. The problem is, you can go to any home store and get whole pre-grown plants for not much more, so it's a little hard to justify the price.The pod selection is also pretty weird. I'd assume the pods are meant for apartment living, but a lot of the plants aren't best grown in pots, so this is a bad idea for apartment dwellers. And if you have space to grow plants, you should just buy seeds and do it properly.I'll update my review after giving the plants time to grow, but I just can't recommend these pods. They're relatively expensive, they don't really cater to any specific market, and they take all the fun out of gardening. They don't even mention how much sun/shade each plant needs!

"In short, this is a very good wireless adapter.If you don't know much about computers:-Do you want to connect to WiFi, but your computer doesn't do wireless? Plug this into a USB port, and you're set!-Does your computer seem to have trouble connecting to WiFi, even when other people nearby are doing fine? You might want to try this product!-Note that this adapter only comes with software for Windows out of the box, so only get this if you have a Windows computer. It does not work out of the box with Mac, and I'm not at all sure whether there would be Linux drivers.If you're a computer tech:-It's dual-band, USB2.0, does all the latest standards, has a real antenna, WPS button, includes a USB extender cable, and it's plug-and-play on Windows. This is a nice package, although the antenna is a bit weird for a USB dongle, it's not very mobile-friendly.My review setup:-My bedroom is right at the edge of the wireless range in my house, so devices in my bedroom can connect but just barely. I'll be watching something from YouTube and get random buffering on most devices. So far, this TP-LINK adapter has done significantly better than most other devices, right now I'm listening to an audio stream that's had zero buffering issues. Just to further the comparison, for my test I plugged this adapter into a laptop that normally has issues connecting with its internal WiFi. So plugging in this dongle went from a merely so-so connection, to a fairly bulletproof one.Overall I definitely recommend this adapter. This company really thought of everything, down to the included USB extender cable just in case you don't want this this poking out the side of your laptop- and with the big antenna, you probably don't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8YEGT51XN73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZRVY12#wasThisHelpful","R1S8YEGT51XN73","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It appears as though a few different products' reviews are being jammed together, so note this is for the Turtle Beach Impact 100 keyboard, the base model in the line. In short: it's merely adequate, which doesn't justify the price.Pros:-Allows up to 30 keys to be pressed simultaneously. This is far more than anyone should ever need, but it's definitely sufficient for any game.-Weighted base so the keyboard won't slide around.-Comes with a fairly robust cable with a reusable cable tie included. Nice touch.Cons:-""Smart Guide Keycaps"" are a gimmick. The keys don't feel any different from any other cheap keyboard.-The key travel feels far too rubbery for typists. I could only recommend this keyboard if you only ever intend to use it for gaming and never for actually typing.-Wow that's heavy. This is easily the heaviest keyboard I've ever held, it must have weights in the base. Personally I don't see a need for even a fraction of this weight as I've never had a problem with a sliding keyboard before, but maybe somebody out there needs it?Overall, I can't help but feel this keyboard is just a gimmick. It's a cheap plastic keyboard they've tried to increase the price on by putting weights in the bottom and ensuring it can register 30 keypresses at once. I'm sure you can do better elsewhere. Only recommended if you need a purpose-built gaming-only keyboard that you'll never type on, where you need to mash a lot of keys at once, and for some reason you need lead weights in the bottom?

"The problem with this ""Thai red curry paste""? It's not Thai, it's barely curry, and it's not a paste. That's about as wrong as you can be.Authentic Thai curry paste, first of all, should be a paste. It's kind of in the name. This product is mostly canola oil, so it's more of a chili oil. Authentic Thai curry also contains many ingredients not included here, such as galangal and lemongrass. This product is also made from Jalapeño and not Thai chiles.

"There's one thing that sets Irish Spring apart: The invigorating smell. There's one thing missing from this product: That invigorating smell.Pros:-Has a mild, but manly/musky scent. It's hard to mix musk and mint, as the two can quickly add up to ""old man slathered in Icy/Hot"". But this product manages to smell masculine without being medicinal.-Lathers like mad.Cons:-Doesn't rinse easily. In anything but the softest water, this takes some effort to rinse off.-Smell is merely okay. This doesn't have the eye-opening smell of original Irish Spring, merely a generic and short-lived musk.There's not really a lot more to say.

"I'm a programmer, so I appreciate any product that can give my hands a break. These exercise balls do the trick.Pros:-Three levels of resistance. Personally, I don't think the level of resistance matters nearly as much just doing the exercise, but especially if you have multiple typists in your household (and everyone is typing at this point) then the selection could benefit different people.-Definitely works. I've been on a major work project lately and I've noticed a marked difference in hand pain since using these exercisers.-Appropriate size. I have oddly proportioned hands, so I'm usually the first to notice if a product isn't very ergonomic. I find these very comfortable.Cons:-The same slightly sticky, pliant nature that makes these exercise balls so good for a workout also makes them dust magnets. It would be nice if they came with some way to keep them dust-free, but I suspect they would rinse well.Overall, recommended.

"I'm not entirely sure this product offers much in the way of benefits over regular Head & Shoulders, but it's at least as good as the original- and quite different in terms of scent and feel- so someone looking for an alternative might want to give this a try.Pros:-Same active ingredient as Head & Shoulders.-More ""shampoo-like"". I think most people are familiar with the standard formula of head and shoulders, which is sets it apart from regular shampoos and clearly marks it as an anti-dandruff product. This ""hydration"" formula is more creamy in color and form, like other hydrating shampoos. Someone looking for that ""salon shampoo"" feel instead of Head & Shoulders, would like this.-New, coconut-based smell. Again, this smells more like a ""salon"" shampoo. It's a bit floral, and a bit more like... well, other hydrating shampoos.Cons:-None to report.Overall I can't really say whether this has much of an effect on my hair, as I'm sporting a very short cut. However, the dandruff formula works the same as it ever did, and the new smell is an interesting change. I'll probably go back to the regular formula, but I could see this product appealing to people who don't like the smell and feel of tradition anti-dandruff shampoos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ZW7Q63VEAPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP26H0Q#wasThisHelpful","R23ZW7Q63VEAPW","AC6LV5D2RKTIR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6LV5D2RKTIR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neutrogena tends to be a pretty solid company for basic skin supplies. I've been using their sensitive aftershave balm for a while, and I'm always happy to try new products. I got this one ""for a friend"" but there are always a few spots I can try on myself. The results are exactly what they should be.Pros:-Good packaging. This product doesn't pretend to be much more than it is, maximum strength benzoyl peroxide.-The formula applies cleanly and washes off readily, I didn't have any residue after a quick wash and a pat dry.-Works as advertised. Benzoyl peroxide is the ""big gun"" of acne treatment, whereas the more common salicylic acid tends to be for more sensitive skin.Cons:-Maximum-strength benzoyl peroxide is caustic stuff, so be careful. Test it out on a small area of skin before applying it more thoroughly. This stuff can bleach fabric and hair, so please don't get it near your eyes or other mucous membranes.Neutrogena hits another one out of the park.

"I often wonder where authors get the ideas for their books. This book in particular was one of that kind. It concerns an attorney who causes a horrific automobile crash that would kill or maim several people, including his young daughter. Before everything turns out badly, time appears to be stopped and two people give him the option of reversing what happened, but in return he must agree to kill random folks to save his daughter and the other in the accident. When he agrees, everything changes as if the accident never occurred. The plot goes on to detail how this man goes about attempting to not only save his daughter and the others, but also to find some way of getting free of his agreement. The story races along, particularly toward the end, where I stayed up way past my bedtime because I could not wait to discover how the book would end. There are some religious aspects to the plot, but you don’t necessarily have to have a belief system to enjoy the book. I can highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8SDH0RTOIB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160809135X#wasThisHelpful","RT8SDH0RTOIB9","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again we have the annual addition to the ""Killing"" series by Bill O'Reilly and his collaborator. This one concerns Ronald Reagan and the aftermath of the assassination attempt on him. As with the prior books, there is a biography that tells the reader how Reagan got to be where he was: the president. His Hollywood days revealed a man who was a big star and then declined, but it didn't stop his drinking and womanizing. His period of early political activity and his hatred for communism are quite detailed. Once he married Nancy, his life turned around, apparently mostly due to her influence. We are also given a biography of his would-be killer and how he came to be at the place where the shots were fired. It's a chilling part of the book, and shows the possibility of a neglect of his potential mental health issues, both by his parents and a psychiatrist. After the recovery from his bullet wound Reagan carried on his duties, but slowly and insidiously the strain on his body took its toll, and we are told of his slow but inexorable descent into Alzheimer's. That part is quite sad. As usual, I'm going to assume that there are those who haven't read the book and will praise it because of who the author is, just as there will be those who trash it because of its author. (I haven't read any of the reviews). That's unfortunate, because this book gives both sides of Reagan the man, being neither a hagiography nor a ""gotcha"" book.

"It’s always a pleasure for me to discover a new author, especially one who exhibits a talent for telling a good story in a quite readable fashion. This book, by a young (about 20) first time author, intrigued me when I read a blurb about it and also learned about the multi-talented young man who wrote it. The plot takes place in an (obviously) imagined world, where several nations exist side by side, but not in an especially friendly fashion. One of the nations, the Salt Empire, plots to defeat its neighbor and to do so has made a deal with a noble from that other nation. Into this thicket travel a boy in his mid teens and his younger brother. They are sent to stay with their uncle by their mother to escape the destruction of their home. Unknowingly, their mother has sent them to live with the very noble plotting to destroy his own country for personal gain. The two boys discover their uncle’s plan, and also learn that he is engaged in the summoning of a powerful force that will assist him in his plot. The younger of the two boys begins to try to learn how to acquire magic of his own, to help to thwart the uncle’s plans. The older brother, who has no particular talent except the ability to clearly understand what happens around him, meets and becomes entranced by a girl of about his own age living in the town of the title of the book. There is a lot of action., some deaths, and a whirlwind story line that races along like a runaway freight train. The author has an unusual insight into the human condition for one of his age, and his writing at times becomes almost lyrical. The book ends in what seems to be the middle of the story, but that only assumes that the author has already planned a sequel. I, for one, look forward very much to reading the next installment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DN6KTKJCAD7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153V2QXO#wasThisHelpful","R1DN6KTKJCAD7P","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This very well written book tells of a world order collapsed, with few regular survivors, but quite a bit of zombie-like flesh eating former people (the “hungries”). It opens in a secure location where a team of researchers is searching for a potential cure for the “hungry” syndrome. Unfortunately, to do this they must obtain live children only partially infected with the virus, and dissect them. Not a fantastic way to get a solution! The main protagonist is a young girl who, initially, does not know that she is an infected person, and subject to turning into a hungry at the smell of human flesh. Before this happens, the base is overrun and most inhabitants are killed. The girl escapes with her female teacher, a female researcher, and two military guards from the base. To potentially save themselves, they must travel quite a way to a place called Beacon, which  seems to house other uninfected people. It is a very strange journey, fraught with many dangers, particularly from  the hungries, who can zone in on them because of the trail they leave of the meat essence. There is plenty of action, some quite gruesome scenes, and ghastly deaths before the book comes to an end. I found the ending very interesting, and it appears to be the appropriate one for a book of this type. Granted, this is not a book for everyone, but for those who can imagine a post Apocalyptic future, it’s one well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBY8438IAXG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316334758#wasThisHelpful","RGBY8438IAXG3","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“To Kill A Mockingbird” is one of my 11 most favorite books, so I undertook to read this “sequel” with trepidation, especially considering all of the uproar over the portrayal of Atticus Finch. Having finished it, I can say that I think the editor in the ‘50s who didn’t want to publish it had a valid point. Don’t get me wrong: the plot is interesting and the characters relatively well drawn. It just seems to me that some judicial rewriting could have made this a much better book, but ff course the author never undertook that task. Flashes of the excellent writing encountered in “Mockingbird” show up on many pages, and some of the humor reminded me of the other work. It just seems to me that the author set out a plot and then, not knowing quite how to end the book, just rushed into something that was rather unsatisfactory. I’m not even going to insert myself into the “Atticus Finch is a racist/bigot” dispute going on at this time. He is what he is, and a reader should take a character in the way an author presents him or her. Make what you want of him, that’s the man Harper Lee wrote into the story. All in all, it’s not an especially bad book, but it does pale in comparison to its companion book. I don’t say whether you should read it or not, that decision is up to you. For myself, I’m content that I did read it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RODU1I338E0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R3RODU1I338E0C","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ireland in the years shortly after the ministry of Saint Patrick was not necessarily a place in which it was easy to live. There were constantly warring kingdom’s, and the old druid religion still held sway despite some inroads by the Catholic church. This story concerns the theft of the bones of a saint that were taken from the altar where she was at rest. The theft promised to be drastic for the little community of nuns who worshiped there, in an order founded by Bridget. It was imperative that the bones be recovered, and that task was given to a nun who had been a Bard, which was a very respected position at that time, prior to becoming a nun. She works diligently, suspecting, and potentially eliminating, several suspects. Her search for the bones takes here many places throughout eastern Ireland, and many encounters with a wide variety of folks, both pagan and Catholic. It’s no secret that the bones are eventually found and returned to the chapel, but the journey to find them is the interesting, and very readable, part of the book.

"Quite a few years ago my wife and I were traveling north on Interstate 61 through the Shenandoah Valley. We stopped for breakfast at a restaurant in a historic building. Sitting down we happened to look up and noticed that several of the beams holding the ceiling were blackened. There was a plaque on the wall which said that the beams were burned by General Sheridan’s troops during his campaign in the valley. When I opened this book I immediately thought of that. Reading a new book by Ralph Peters is always a treat for me. I’ve gone thorough his Owen Parry series, and I just wish that he could continue that line. This book, of course, while fictionalized, is an excellent way to understand the Shenandoah Valley campaign waged by Sheridan against the troops of Confederate General Early. As usual, the story is divided among several different and distinct historical characters. It’s a compelling book, very difficult to put down once begun. As a history major I was fascinated how deftly Peters weaves conversations into the narrative. It’s almost as if he had been there and was taking notes! The reader feels a part of the story, and that’s always an indication that the writing is first rate, which this definitely is! I was afraid that this was going to be the last of a trilogy, but to my surprise and pleasure, in his afterward we learn that there will be at least one more book.

"I often went to Boston in the ‘90s and early ‘00s when my daughter was a student in college and grad school there. One of the constants appeared to be the Big Dig, which didn’t appear as if it was ever going to be finished. In his new thriller Joseph Finder uses the Big Dig as a background to his extremely well written and exciting novel. The main character is a former magazine writer out of a job and living in the shabby confines of his family home. When work is going to be done on the house, he finds more than three million dollars in cash secreted in the walls. The obvious questions are :”Whose money is it” and “Why is it in the house”. That’s the beginning of a roller coaster ride of a book that just keeps on getting better and more exciting as it goes along. There are characters in the book that are quite well drawn, and they are believable in the context of the novel. The chapters are short enough that, if you like, you can read a few before bedtime. Of course, to me the book was so good that I almost couldn’t stop reading, and therefore lost quite a bit of sleep!

"Failure to capture Jack the Ripper has left people in London dissatisfied with their police, and they feel unsafe. Because of the problems pursuing the Ripper the police department has established a Murder Squad whose sole duty is to investigate and solve murders. Into this group comes a young man from Devon, and he arrives just as the body of one of the Murder Squad is discovered in a trunk left at a railway station.

Investigating is a tedious business, and a constable assists the detective in this “grunt work”.

"This story takes place in Philadelphia in 1869, and, oddly enough, I purchased this book in that city. I had not heard of it before, but the cover intrigued me so I purchased it, and am very glad that I did. It is a strange and quite well written book about mediums, both false and (possibly) real. A young reporter is given the task of reporting on these mediums, and it leads him to be involved, involuntarily, with a beautiful medium who is definitely a fake. There is a murder of a medium, and some very strange things happening throughout this book, which certainly kept my attention throughout. I hated for the book to end because it seems that the author (perhaps deliberately) left some plot lines open, so I hope that this is an indication that there will be another book about this young fellow and the beautiful medium.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MGSBG9T3FXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476761728#wasThisHelpful","R37MGSBG9T3FXJ","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas De Quincey and his young daughter become involved in a series of murders that have an eerie similarity to ones that took place many years before, and that the famous writer composed a book concerning. He is suspected of possibly being the murderer himself, no matter how far-fetched the idea may be, so he sets out to solve the crimes and therefore clear his name.There is a lot of action and suspense involved from beginning to end, and the reader leaves the work satisfied that this is an extremely well written book.

"I have always hated clipping my toenails with the small clippers that usually come in manicure sets. Invariably the clippers are difficult to grip and usually slip out of my hands. That's why I finally decided to order these clippers, and I am extremely happy that I did! This clipper is large (but easy to hold) and doesn't slip when I use it. In addition, it doesn't require much pressure, for it is extremely sharp and cuts with little effort. I also use it to clip my fingernails and it works equally well on them. I'm never going to go back to the old manicure set clippers. If you have problems with your small clippers, I can highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7R4X5VBUMWH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7Q1AV6#wasThisHelpful","R7R4X5VBUMWH9","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a fan of musical theater and can listen for hours to my favorite songs from many of the shows. This album seems to have been put together (almost) for me, since it contains several of my favorite songs: Try To Remember from ""The Fantasticks"", You'll Never Walk Alone and If I Loved You from ""Carousel"", to name a few. Also it contains one of my all time favorites: Anthem from ""Chess"". After listening to this album I can add a new song to my list of favorites: Gold Can Turn To Sand from ""Kristina"". Josh Groban has a truly marvelous voice, and he uses it to its fullest on these songs. This is not an album to play at a normal sound, but should be cranked up to fill your room or your car with the excellence of the singing. I can only hope that Mr. Groban decides to do more albums with songs taken from shows, as I have many more favorites that I would love to hear him sing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFG5DEHAP5ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCFVIDQ#wasThisHelpful","RRFG5DEHAP5ND","A3PGGI7A6XCNF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PGGI7A6XCNF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, so there are quite a few books and websites out by vegan athletes. Guys like Rich Roll, Frank Medrano, Brendan Brazier and so on. This is an awesome trend, and has inspired even hardcore meat eaters like my former self to switch to a 100% plant based diet. But while they're incredibly inspirational and even have some recipes and sample days of eating (for that person of course) there has been a big gaping hole in terms of a simple how-to. They leave you hanging by basically leaving it to you to figure out how much of what to eat for your goals.Enter this excellent how-to. It gets right down to business. Simple formulas to determine how many cals to eat and what your macros should be. How to eat and lift to gain muscle with minimal fat gain. How to cut fat step by step, week by week to lower your bodyfat and get shredded. No vagueness, it's a manual. And of course everyone is different and responds differently. But that doesn't mean say try every approach. Marcella and Derek give you a proven method and mention how to experiment based on your results. And it's detailed in how to, not just 'If this doesn't work try reducing calories' it's 'if this doesn't work drop 200 more calories and measure again after a week. If that doesn't work add more of this type of cardio.'I love that it's light on supplements and heavy on real food. I love that it's a no shortcuts or gimmicks method. It's about doing it right for specific goals but also lifelong health. Highly, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJCYNREWXMNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGKQ8RO#wasThisHelpful","R1WJCYNREWXMNT","AM58ZMD6N093G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM58ZMD6N093G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These pedals perform very well for this. They don't collect much mud and are easy to clear. They're not the lightest but on the upside that means they fairly durable in crashes.

"Some reviews mention seat height. We got this for our 2 year old daughter (she's tall for her age) and even with the seat slammed it's JUST a bit big for her. Seat height from the ground to the low part of the saddle is 35cm or 13.77 inches if that helps others out there.The 'padding' for the stem/bars is a joke, it's basically decorative and offers no real protection. I'd recommend cutting a piece of packing foam out and putting the velcro cover over it.That aside, the bike is well built! When you look at a lot of the balance bikes available online and in stores you'll find the construction flimsy, especially the use of plastic wheels. That is no good, especially in a wet environment like the PacNW. This has real rubber wheels and tubes, the seat is well padded and the frame is solid. It's not ultra light, but IMO that isn't important for this level of riding. You should be able to get multiple sibling use handing it down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EANRYD55K5CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXZ4CIW#wasThisHelpful","R3EANRYD55K5CR","AM58ZMD6N093G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM58ZMD6N093G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reading several books in the same vein lately, and this one stands out as one of the more practical to everyday life. The philosophy is excellent and Jay's passion for the subject is evident. If you're leaning towards this way of living her enthusiasm and easy method will likely spur you into action.I have one gripe with the book, and it deals with the very repetitive nature of the chapters on applying the rules to each room in the house. We already went over the system and a single example 'how to' would have ben fine. Specifics on each room could have been a page of bullet points instead of many pages saying basically the same thing as the chapters before. That, after all, is minimalist. :)That came off as more critical than maybe it deserves, because this is the best book on applied minimalism to the average American/Euro that I've read.

"I was very interested in this book as a way to be more environmentally conscious and thoughtful about what I and my family consume. The book is not preachy in tone at all which is nice, although Korst is clearly passionate and probably takes reducing waste a lot further than most will.I will say that I didn't get as much as I thought I would from it in terms of techniques, as a lot of the suggestions are already common practice where I live (curbside composting, reusable grocery stuff, cook your own stuff, etc...) With that said the mindset put forward is very helpful when it comes to even further reducing the amount of stuff you put in that gray colored trash can as opposed to the other two.Also, I think it's worth mentioning that backyard compost might not be a good idea in all areas even if you have the space. Korst says she had no real animal issues, try it in Tahoe and you'll have a bear and coyote party in your back yard every night. :)All told a good read with good practical and philosophical information.

"I travel for work frequently and wanted some good headphones for the plane and hotel room. Not interested in active noise canceling, just over ear with good sound so I can listen to movies and music instead of engine noise and chatter. I was amazed even listening to music on my iphone, you can clearly pick out guitars, drums and the bass where before with earbuds it was just 'music' all muddled together.Works equally as well with movies. You can hear all the individual effects like bugs buzzing, footsteps crunching, etc... Very immersive.I'm not an audiophile so I'll describe pros/cons as best as I can:Sound pros :Highs are crisp but not harsh, mid is clearly defined, bass is boosted but not overwhelming.Sound cons: If you're looking for audiophile reference headphones the bass boost will rule these out.Product pros: Very light and comfortable, especially the earpieces. The detachable cables are well designed (rotating plug!). The construction and style is great and you definitely won't be mistaken for a trendy 'beats' wearing kid.Product cons: If there is any it's only that the carrying case is BIG and will take up a lot of bag space for a traveller.

"I was using lock on grips on an AL bar and switched to carbon. Someone gave me a tip to check these out and I'm so glad they did. They're very light, but I must say more comfy than standard rubber grips. Once they're on, they're *ON* and any worries about slippage because of the material is misplaced.That's actually the only real downside of these grips. They are extremely tight and difficult to put on and taking them off? Haha, I'll just cut and buy some new.FWIW I installed them using soapy water and some zip ties through the grip.

"My one gripe isn't with the product at all, but with the instructions on the tub. They recommend 2-4 scoops for most occasions and for pre-workout 4-6 scoops. 50 mg of caffeine per scoop, if you don't want to do the math thats 200-300 mg of caffeine! :-0For reference, a 16oz can of blue monster energy drink is 140 mg. If you're doing 6 shots of this stuff you're slamming TWO cans of blue monster, and you serious? Watch your dosing and ignore the instructions. Otherwise an excellent product.I picked this up to use when I was trying out intermittent fasting, as BCAA's are recommended in the morning and before fasted workouts. I started out taking two scoops with some zevia grape soda (double grape, awwwwwww yeah!) in the morning. I found it did indeed help with feeling full and giving energy throughout the morning. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee extract.Now that I'm done with IM, I've kept on using it. I do one scoop with water in the morning and one after lunch in a small blender bottle. It mixes well with just the blender bottle, no clumps. Extremely fine powder. Watch out if you mix with soda, as it will fizz like crazy! Taste is awesome if you like grape. I've stopped buying energy drinks because a single scoop isn't as much caffeine and other junk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJC9DBG1WDEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R76WK2#wasThisHelpful","REJC9DBG1WDEZ","AM58ZMD6N093G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM58ZMD6N093G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First I want to say that I'm a fan of Tim Ferriss' ideas in general. His original book inspired me to go off the beaten path and start working remote, living more the lifestyle I wanted. I'm also a fitness geek and enjoyed the 4 hour body even though I differ on some things with his philosophy. So it was with some excitement that I ordered this new tome.I was a little disappointed to discover how disjointed the book is. I really enjoyed the snippet about learning languages and how that fed into 'meta learning' although the actual method was a little thin. This could be Tim not wanting to give away some secret sauce he'll use for a future book, or it could just be he didn't have time to flesh the idea out in more detail since he had to get back to writing the rest. I googled for more and found that this chapter is little more than a slightly expanded version of one of his blog posts, and I suspect many of the sidetracks the book takes are the same.The survival school part is also a little funny. Tim shows his 'city boy' colors, talking about various boy scout level outdoor skills as if he just discovered fire.With those downsides out of the way, if you can forgive the ADD writing style there are a lot of gems to be found here, particularly how to build a proper kitchen for not a lot of money (or a lot if you want), how to make easy versions of restaurant style dishes and how to keep them relatively healthy as well.As I wrote this review I started out giving it 3 stars, but by the time I'd typed to..... here, I've gone back and given it 4. It really is good if you read it as even the author suggests. In chunks and on the areas that interest you at the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VACSL3RSM4ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NJU8PA#wasThisHelpful","R2VACSL3RSM4ZI","AM58ZMD6N093G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM58ZMD6N093G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally, a jersey that fits true to size. At least for me, I'm not fat but I'm not tiny like a pro cyclist. A lot of jerseys are either 'race fit' and wear super tight if you're not 125 lbs or 'club fit', meaning made for chunky recreational riders.

"This book 'changed my life' so I wanted to throw in my two cents to the review pool. I went from being a fairly typical corporate 9-5er to the top of my field and working from home (actually working from anywhere, sometimes I work from the ski slopes), setting my own schedule, financially well off, etc.. And this book was the catalyst. Note that I said catalyst. I think that many of the more negative reviews get hung up on the book not being some kind of step by step blueprint to fame and fortune. It's about mindset and kicking off the idea in your head that will get you where you want to be. Sure there are some specific tips which may or may not work in your situation. Duh, there has never been a successful person who didn't work from their own unique situation and who didn't overcome their own unique hurdles. I don't think the book tells you that you won't have to do some hard work (especially up front) to get rolling either.For me there are 3 big take home points:#1-Defining what kind of lifestyle *YOU* want in a concrete way, writing out a plan and what it will cost to get there.#2-Thinking creatively of ways to free up your time and energy. You can then use that time an energy to execute your plan *AND* leave plenty for play time.#3-Use technology and cheap professional services as 'multipliers'.

"The Breville BBM800XL (hereafter called ""the 800"") is an elegant bread maker. It has good looks for sure. Mine arrived with no cosmetic defects and was well packed to survive the journey. The brushed steel housing is a bit thin and flexes with just a little pressure. I would think for the price it could be a bit more substantial but that's just my opinion.  I have other Breville appliances and this machine is a nice match.I have been baking bread the old fashioned way for at least 40 years. Although the old way is still best, a bread maker is often a better alternative for me than turning on the oven and heating the entire kitchen on a summer's day.I would like to compare the 800 to the Zojirushi BB-PAC20 (hereafter called ""the Zo""). These are not the only bread machines in town, but I do have experience with both. I think people looking for a high end machine would like a comparison.This Zo is a bit heavier. It feels more solid than the 800. The Zo sits lower and is a bit wider. The 800 can wander around while it kneads. This can be a disaster if you are not prepared for it. I found that if I use a damp rag and wipe the feet clean as well as the counter top beneath it that it will stay firmly in place. Things should be clean in the kitchen anyway, right?My 800 worked fine right out of the box. My first two Zo's were duds. Briefly, there was a bad noise problem with two units. The third one works properly. Thanks to Amazon for helping with this.I suppose the main question to answer is how well do these two machines bake bread? I think the Zo is the best performer. Bread from the Zo is evenly browned and well formed.  The Zo has a heavier bread pan than the 800. The 800's loaf is a bit dark on the bottom when set for ""medium"" crust. It turns out as medium at the top and dark, but not burned, on the bottom. The Zo's two-pound loaf is of ""normal"" dimensions and fits my bread slicer. The 800 is a wider loaf about 5-1/2"" inches wide. The Zo is a bit short of 5 inches wide. The Zo can make a tall 2-pound loaf, though, whose slices do not really fit a normal toaster. They stick out an inch in my Breville toaster. So those are a job for a toaster oven to toast.After using the 800 a few times, I found there to be absolutely no problem with keeping the folding paddle clean. When the pan cools I fill it with warm water and a drop of detergent. A half hour later the paddle is easy to remove from the pan. (I do the same soaking routine with the Zo.) I use a brush to scrub out the paddle, rinse, and that's that. I wish the Zo had a substantial paddle like this. With care, this paddle should definitely last and not wear out around the shaft like the the Zo's paddles.I believe that if the paddle is ever put away without a thorough cleaning the dough inside the slot will harden and cause a problem. So once again, just keep it clean as you should be doing anyway.The 800 is not a quiet machine. The pan is only held down by gravity where the Zo locks into place. While kneading the 800 emits slamming sounds. Since it only has one relatively large paddle, the dough ball tends to get slammed around. It is louder than a properly working Zo. This was disappointing since so many reviews said the machine was quiet. The Zo tends to keep the dough more in place while it kneads because it has two paddles. On the other hand, one defective Zo I had was the noisiest bread maker I'd ever heard and I returned it.It is tricky to remove the hot pan from the 800. It has only a flimsy thin wire handle that flops from one side to the other when you try to grasp it with a pot holder. This handle is about as thick as coat hanger wire. It doesn't latch in a straight up position. It is really hard to get a pot holder or mitt onto it when it is lying down flat in a hot machine. I use tongs to assist in getting the handle up a bit so I can grab it. Even then, I always manage to burn myself. True, the lid could be left open for a long while and let the thing cool first. However, I like to remove the bread from the machine when it's done and not let it soak in the heat. The Zo has two substantial handles which make it supremely easy to remove the pan. Just rock it toward you so it unlatches and then pull it out of the machine. No drama at all.The 800 control panel puts the Zo to shame. It is head and shoulders above the Zo. It is easy to see the settings. It works differently from the minimalist panel on the Zo, but not in a bad way. I find it easy to operate. I think it is the best feature of the 800.The 800 has an excellent interior light. Too bad that most of the time the viewing window is obscured by condensation so that you would have to lift the lid to wipe it clear to see. That kind of limits the usefulness of the light since you've got the lid open.The Zo pauses automatically whenever the lid is lifted and restarts automatically when the lid is closed. The 800 does not care if the lid is open. I just keeps on chugging or baking away. If you want to pause the 800 you push a button. Tie score on that one, I'd say.The dispenser works but I don't use it. You will hear it noisily pop open near the end of the first knead cycle whether you are using it or not. The Zo has no dispenser.The 800 emits beeps that are inaudible to me. The frequency is too high for my old ears. The Zo has lower pitched beeps that I can hear if I am in the same room with it.The 800 has handy posts at the back to allow wrapping the power cord neatly out of the way. The Zo does not  have any kind of cord management.Both machines have delay start. The feature is nicest on the Zo where you have to do no head math at all to know when the delayed start bread will be ready. The 800 lets you set the amount of delay and it is up to you to figure out at what time your bread will be ready.The 800 gets much too hot on the outside while baking. If you should touch it you will quickly pull your hand away in pain. Strangely, the lower 3 or 4 inches of the skirt stay cool so you can safely grasp the machine and take it to another place after baking. The top is still very hot so care is still needed. The Zo seems better insulated, keeping the heat inside. The Zo only feels hot if you touch the view window. (Trust me, it's hot!)The Zo comes with a colorful recipe book with large type. I like it by far over the smallish monochrome book that comes with the 800. I especially like that it describes exactly what each program (Zo calls them ""courses"") does and spells out the length of each cycle and its steps by using a little graph for every group of recipes. Very handy. The 800 pretty much omits this type of information. It does explain the limits of the custom programs but you don't really get to know the workings of each program. The 800 has a much wider customization range than the Zo. This feature may be very important to some. I am OK with the limited variations available on the Zo.The 800 is a nice machine but I do favor the Zo. I like the even baking of the Zo and I like the more normal size of the loaf. I like that the Zo has two paddles. I can only opine that I think it mixes better. It takes the 800 quite a while to bring the dough together while kneading. The Zo is more thorough, quiet, and faster. Overall, I see no real problem with either machine in this regard. I do think the 800 has to work a lot harder than the Zo to mix things up effectively with only one paddle and perhaps that is why it is noisier.As I've said I have other Breville appliances. I have found their customer service to be helpful and genuinely concerned when I've laid a problem at their feet. Zo, on the other hand, has a somewhat arrogant and off-putting tone in their response to questions. Zo also seems to have terrible quality control. It took me 3 tries to get a machine that works.You will not be disappointed if you buy the 800. The paddles are really not a problem if you care for them. I don't know why they are an obsessive target of condemnation in the reviews. It bakes good bread and it is very versatile. As I've said I happen to prefer the Zo by just a little bit. It mixes and bakes a more attractive loaf. I must caution, though, that in my experience the likelihood of getting a defective Zo are high. Be prepared for disappointment if you order one. However, Amazon will make it right if you want to return it.How about for gift giving? Both are good choices but consider that the Zo comes with a nice booklet and an instructional DVD. If you are giving to a novice baker, this could be helpful. On the other hand, a Zo probably needs to be checked out before you give it as a gift or you may cause disappointment. It's sad that I can't say otherwise, but I had to return two already. For the least fuss, I'd say the 800 is the best  bet. It looks nice and is maybe less likely to be a lemon. As always, these are just my opinions. I don't consider myself biased either way, these opinions are borne from what I have experienced.I would rate the Zo at 3 stars. I give it only three stars because although it bakes great bread it caused me a lot of grief with poor quality. Had I not had quality problems with the Zo I would have given it a 5 star rating.Happy bread making!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBIECM4JBIMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RCNJA0#wasThisHelpful","R1RBIECM4JBIMM","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe that Sensi is the smart alternative to more expensive Wi-Fi thermostats. It keeps the conditioned living space just as comfortable as the more expensive Honeywell and much better than the even more expensive Nest. Sensi has a sparse but effective display. No fancy colors or animation. A glance at it will tell you the status of your system. After the initial setup, just about all the important thermostat controls are in the app. I find that the internet connection is very reliable and reconnects quickly after an outage without user intervention. Since I connected the Sensi with a ""C"" wire I am able to have the display illuminated constantly. I have foregone that option because the light is a bit too bright for my taste and if I ever need the light I can simply press the button on the top of the Sensi.  I like that the app background is blue when cooling is on and red when heat is being called. I also like being able to set many temperature setpoints during the day. Mine are seldom more than a degree apart but the fine tuning this allows keeps my home comfortable. Despite it's relatively low price the Sensi does not feel cheap or flimsy. Sensi will send e-mail alerts for high and low temperature, high humidity, and loss of cooling or heating. The values are not adjustable but are sensibly chosen. An alert is sent for temp above 99F and below 45F. Also if the temp rises by 5 degrees when cooling or drops 5 degrees while heating. An alert is also sent if the humidity hits 78%. All that needs to be done is to enable e-mail alerts in the app. I miss the filter reminder but I am vigilant about filter cleanliness anyway so this is not a great loss to me.It's very understated appearance does not call attention to itself. I like the Sensi, I've had absolutely no trouble with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27YGF1J5X3O98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHE60CE#wasThisHelpful","R27YGF1J5X3O98","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased mine from a home improvement store. I had an emergency need for it and could not wait for shipping. Too bad for me as I would have saved many dollars buying it here on Amazon. I paid more but it works so well that I still feel good about the purchase.This thermostat does everything I wanted. My two primary concerns are that I want accurate and responsive temperature control and I want Wi-Fi access. I give this stat the highest rating for these functions. No complaints at all on those points as this stat delivers flawless performance. My home is so comfortable now. One more consideration I have is that I wanted a stat that had relays in it. It seems more and more thermostats are relying on solid state components in the switching that can open or short causing components to not run or run ""forever."" Such design is not acceptable to me considering the cost and importance of the equipment a thermostat governs. Surely relays can fail too, but I think that's a rare failure and I'm willing to take my chances along with millions of others.So many have reviewed this unit that I'll defer to all those many reviews and just mention a few things that I feel I can add that may be helpful to you should you install this device.The first thing is the outside temp/humidity obtained over the internet. If you are stuck at ""waiting for update"" for many hours simply delete your total connect account. You can immediately re-register with your same username and password. Yes, it's an annoyance but that makes the device update almost immediately. Even Honeywell does not seem to understand this and I've read lots of complaints from folks who have gone around and around with customer support for days and never got this resolved. Try the account deletion ""trick."" It worked for me. I believe this problem is caused when one first establishes the account and completes the thermostat installation. At that point the device receives a software update and at that point the connection to the temp/weather seems to go out the window.Another point I'd like to mention is setting the temperature differential. If the thermostat is not reading the indoor temp correctly be sure you have given it about an hour to settle down after first installing it. Also do make sure to caulk or fill with insulation the hole behind the stat where the wires emerge from the wall. There can be wicked temp differences from inside the wall to the living space so be sure to address that. Finally, if you do decide you must tweak the temp differential setting only do it one degree at a time and give the stat a half hour again to settle down. The reading usually does not update immediately. If you are not patient you will just be chasing the reading around and getting very annoyed and grumpy. Ask me how I know. If the stat reads low, adjust the difference to the plus side to increase it and do the inverse to decrease it.In conclusion I just want to say that Honeywell knows how to make thermostats and has been doing it a long long time. Compared against the expensive and unreliable (perhaps) newcomers I feel safe and comfortable with this thermostat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25V2ZI22F3LNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLZEQH2#wasThisHelpful","R25V2ZI22F3LNP","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remember a thicker syrup from years ago. I used to love this stuff. It tasted like coffee and it was a nice alternative to chocolate syrup in milk. This syrup now is now a mildly coffee-flavored watery fluid. You have to use a lot to get a coffee flavor going and by then the drink is too sweet to enjoy. How disappointing.

"There are a lot of reviews here so I'll just state my main points and be gone.Nest was easy to install since I had a ""C"" wire. It does jut from the wall more than most thermostats I've seen. I have to be sure to maneuver around it as I walk through the hall where it is installed. The temperature display sometimes reads 5 degrees higher than actual. Then, on next glance, it will have dropped down 3 degrees or so. Eventually it will coast to the right temp over a few hours but you never know when it will go nuts again. That is not helping my power bill at all. I've tried insulating the wall behind it but that did not help. Temperature control for cooling is not good. If I set the A/C for 78 the unit powers on at 79 and turns off at 77. The temperature just never feels right and I feel uncomfortable most of the time. My Honeywell thermostat allowed a tighter band and even had a feature that would randomly kick on the fan to help even out the temp in the house. The difference in the ""feel"" of the properly conditioned living space is substantial and remarkable. Nest, with all its elegant fine points notwithstanding, is fundamentally a poor thermostat based on my experience living with it.Furthermore, I've decided that I will not trust my system to the Nest. Since installing, I've read too many reports of failures of the solid state switches on the base plate. Many claim their A/C compressors or heaters were run continually or even at the same time. There seems to be a problem with this, but Nest does not address it nor provide encouraging words in support of this design. I have decided I did not need to spend all this money to buy a problem. I'm going back to my Honeywell. It is also Wi-Fi but has actual relays to control the components and not tiny solid state switches. Relays are more reliable, I think, and failures won't necessarily damage my system.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCDTMMIBBUNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GDHYPQ#wasThisHelpful","RHCDTMMIBBUNL","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no complaints about this cable. The colors are vibrant and easy to differentiate if your color vision is normal. The outer jacket is not form-fitting as the product illustration shows. It is just a typical jacket tube holding the wires. The wire is easy to cut. The jacket is easy to peel back. It has the appropriate markings for well-rated thermostat cable and should meet all codes. I find that the wires are what one would expect from copper wire.

"For the price, I would have expected this fan to be a little more than it is. It is crudely painted and mine arrived with many scrapes and gouges in the paint from shipping. The paint chipped off down to shiny metal. The prominet ""Air King"" decal on the front shroud is not centered and portions of it are well outside the recess meant to hold it. The 6 bolts holding the rear fan guard to the motor are exasperatingly hard to get started and torque down to the fully seated position. There is no hope in tightening these with a screwdriver. I had to use a wrench on them. I believe the problem is the heavy coating of black paint on the threads. It would have been best if I'd run a tap to chase out the threads first but the manufacturer should have done that and not left it for me. I believe one reviewer suggested that but I neglected to heed the good advice. Snapping the fan guard together is another unpleasant experience. It is a very tight fit.  The instructions tell you to use a screwdriver and not bend the guard. I wish you good luck with that. A large screwdriver bends the shroud like a knife through butter. I ended up using a body shop trim removal tool because it applied a wider area of contact than prying with a screwdriver. The pedestal tube is crude, requiring a wrench to adjust the height while the very heavy fan assembly must be supported. A spring assist would be nice here. Even worse, it is a wobbly fit into the base and leans alarmingly unless the set screw is tightened. Adjusting the height is a two-person job if you value your spinal health. The knob that cinches the motor tilt seems barely adequate for the task. Trying to get the motor level is a trial and error method as the heavy motor sags when released from the grasp. Truly alarming force must be used on the knob to cinch the motor body in place. I could easily strip it while cranking it by hand. This is a poor design and you need to be cautious when tightening it. Further annoyances are that the instructions I received were a poor copy. The illustrations I needed to refer to were barely visible in some sections. Lucky for me I could turn a few pages to the foreign language instructions and see the illustration there. For some reason, a little bag of amber grease is packed with the motor however the instructions say nothing about it and the maintenance instructions say never to lubricate the machine.I've said a few negative things but there are also positives. The motor seems very rugged and powerful. It definitely feels like a powerful motor. I had no trouble with the oscillating mechanism and it seems strong judging by its visible components. The best positive thing is that the fan does move a great volume of air. Also the drone of this fan seems somewhat subdued and not as loud as I had expected. However, it does sound like a shop and is very audible but the sound is not annoying to me at all. I like the 3 speed selections and the ability to turn the oscillation on/off and change the amount of sweep with the use of a wrench.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NTWEJEUR8I7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T00MJA#wasThisHelpful","R1NTWEJEUR8I7Q","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know from experience that Korky makes a fine flapper. I recently tried using these adjustable Korkys and they are not at all what one would think. I was hoping to prolong the tank draining into the bowl by adjusting this all the way down as the instructions state. What happens, though, is the valve does not stay open any longer than a ""normal"" Korky for a very simple reason. As the water level drops, the adjustable float can't float so the valve closes. This happens at the same point, perhaps even a bit earlier, than a normal Korky would close. On the plus side, it does work well for adjusting in the opposite direction by allowing the valve to close quite early. So if you are trying to save water by flushing with the least amount of water that does the job then working a bit with this valve should give you the least amount of water to flush. How little water usage you can get away with really depends on your toilet design so the adjustable feature may not be all that great for you but you still have basically an excellent flapper without the float.I'm still giving it 5 stars because it is still a great Korky flapper. The adjustable feature was lost on me, but might be what you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQE2PJDAZOTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DAZM8#wasThisHelpful","RYQE2PJDAZOTV","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try to buy the best tool I can afford when I have to buy one. This is the one I chose. It is said that 3 feet is all that is normally needed to clear a clog but I am glad that I got the 6 foot version. The first clog I worked on would not clear up with only 3 feet. It took the additional 3 feet to push the clog further down the line where it was sent on its merry way. I'm not a professional plumber but I would say that this tool seems to be to be heavy duty and made to do much more work than I may ever be able to give it. These are not so simple to use as they appear. You have to do a lot of cranking and pushing and tugging. The clog may take several attempts to clear even though you are able to run in the entire length.My only dissatisfaction is with the many sharp edges.

"It seems people like to review these zappers, but few, if any of them, report their geographic location. That makes it difficult to decide if this is right for you in your particular region. Let me say up front that I am in Houston. Where I live is heavily infested with mosquitoes. There is a duck pond a quarter mile away and the woods and soggy ground are rife with the biting buggers. Too bad none is attracted to this 80-Watt zapper.I use the Octenal, I have the zapper hanging from the first story eave 7 feet off the ground and horizontally 25 feet from my patio as instructed. At night, we zap an occasional moth or a fly or two. We get some mosquitoes but I think they simply blundered into the light. I leave the thing on all day and night and it does, essentially, nothing.So it looks to me that this is a great thing for you if it works in your area. Where I am, it is useless. I've read that Lurex is a better attractant, but neither Flowtron nor anybody seems to make it for this type of zapper. If it is so good, there should be a great market for it but where is it? One would think the manufacturer would be champing at the bit to make the product work on more varieties of bug. This makes me think this zapper is more snake oil than a solution for mosquitoes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEZEAX2CT67B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R9VV#wasThisHelpful","RBEZEAX2CT67B","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What happened to pencil sharpeners? Does anybody make one that really works these days?Honestly, I am willing to pay the price for a quality sharpener. By ""quality"" I am talking about a sharpener that keeps the lead centered and shuts off or at least quiets down when the pencil is sharp. I'd like it to handle more than just one diameter of pencil too, if that's not too much too ask.I have already tried and returned 3 sharpeners here at Amazon. All had glowing reviews. I am so very, very disappointed.When this sharpener arrived on my desk I was happy. It is hefty and it looks like it means business.I was also happy to see that it contained two helical cutter units which makes it a lot like the manual sharpener my folks had at our home 60 years ago and is still working great today. I pushed in a Ticonderoga #2 and stupidly let it grind it down about 3 inches before realizing that this thing was not going to stop grinding or signal that the pencil was sharp. Sure, I can pull the pencil out every second and look at the point but that's not very automatic is it? Besides it will be an off-center point anyway, so it really is hard for me to care. I demand a centered-point from my sharpener.You can just keep light pressure on the pencil and grind it all the way down to the eraser. The motor sound does not change. This sharpener is an incompetent thing that leaves a long length of wood on one side of the point. This is completely unacceptable. I had hoped that by having two cutter assemblies it would stay centered. It seems the mechanism is so poorly engineered it is no better than the single cutter sharpeners.This is solid hefty hunk of a terrible sharpener. Because it seems to be ruggedly built, it is nice to know I can possibly use it to grind hundreds of nice pencils to a lopsided point before it finally quits.I'll never know because I really hate this sharpener. I hate it not so much for the incompetent piece of you-know-what that it is, but mostly for the expectations I had that will not be met by this paper weight.I am returning this for a refund. It is awful and I am angry about it.

"The extender will not give you a stronger signal by ""adding"" to the base unit signal. If you are NOT experiencing signal drops or disconnects with your handsets, then save your money. Your phone must experience marginal signal strength to the base unit before it will take an alternative route through this extender.As an example, if you are getting a sufficient signal in a room but the strength is not so much as to turn on the ECO boost indicator, then this extender will not change that. Why? It's because your phone is still communicating sufficiently well directly with the base unit. The extender is out of the picture.Now, if you were to travel much farther from the base unit until the signal barely works, then connecting the extender will help from that point onward. This is why so many reviewers report success (because they have locations far from the base unit) and others say it does not help or does nothing.

As others have mentioned, the edges are hazardously sharp.For as much as this costs, I could have made a better one and I wish I had.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M84YNR1KXHG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AI45T#wasThisHelpful","R3M84YNR1KXHG4","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I frequently have to deal with o-rings smaller than a penny. This tool is handy for digging them out without scratching the metal groove, housing, whatever.This tool is not very well finished. It has some knife-sharp edges at the working ends that will slice into an o-ring. This is not a problem if you know you are putting in a new o-ring. But, if you are just removing an o-ring to inspect it you can damage it.I had to do some work on this tool to make it friendlier to o-rings. I used a small file to take down all the sharp edges and then I used fine wet-or-dry sandpaper for an all-over smoothing. Finally, I used a polishing wheel to bring the tool to the state that I wanted.So now I can work the tool around the groove and work the o-ring out without damage to rubber or metal. The tool is certainly strong enough for o-rings.The main point is that it will do the job. It should be better finished and I debated on whether to downgrade it for that. I decided to go with five stars since it is not that difficult to improve and the way it is probably is all that many people are wanting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OXBMY38KMWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDPEE5W#wasThisHelpful","R26OXBMY38KMWB","AW07NZ2EGA8PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW07NZ2EGA8PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first kit I received had a bound up 1/4-inch side so I had to send it back. I held off on writing a review because I felt this was just bad luck. After all, I have a complete set of GearWrench automotive wrenches and flex handles and have never had a problem.Well, the replacement set is also bad. The retaining clip for the 1/4-inch side is installed incorrectly. One end of the clip is protrudes about  1/8-inch into the socket well. No tools can be inserted on that side because they are blocked by the clip. I used an  awl to try and push the clip into place with moderate success. The clip is still bent from being installed wrong. I can insert tools now, but they tend to get stuck. I suppose that's better than having them be too loose.I expected to love this kit since none of my other GearWrench tools has ever been a problem.

"This is an absolutely stunning watch!  The quality is amazing, It comes packaged in a box, then inside is another box and inside that box is another box that holds the watch.  The watch comes wrapped around a small pillow, even the case for the watch is gorgeous.There is also a gift bag inside the package, so if you are planning on gifting this watch then it has a very nice modern looking bag inside.  There is also an envelope with the instructions included.  Everything you need to learn about this watch is included and set up instructions.The leather straps are made out of great quality calf skin leather, it's stunning, durable and has lots of slots for different size wrists.

The watch doesn't track months and years so you will need to reset it at the end of each month before 31 days.The dials are easy to use but also easy to maintain so they won't turn by mistake.

"I tried the brush with a wooden handle from this company and I like it very much, but this back scrubber is not made as well.  I have only used it three times and though it works on my back, some of the fibers are getting so loose already.  It is really hard to wash the soap off the fabric part - maybe because I use a bar soap instead of liquid?? So it takes me quite a bit to rinse it off and squeeze the excess water.  The scrubber is quite long and I am not a very tall person so I have to hold the scrubber from the fabric rather than the handles.

"My teen daughter has eczema but she also has mild acne especially on her back.  I got this brush for her to do some dry brushing.  Dry brushing is very helpful for people with eczema because the dead cells get removed (gently) and moisturizers absorb better.  Also, dry brushing is good for cases of mild acne and clean the pores a little deeper.We have tried brushing with plastic brushes and though they have worked ok, they seem to be too rough on her skin.  A more gentle brush is what we needed and this brush seems to be working.The bristles are made from natural fiber though I don't know for sure what kind.  The handle detaches which we really like.  Just now, my daughter is struggling with some eczema around her wrists and she uses the brush without the handle, much easier to maneuver.Pleased with the results of the brush.  Don't know how it compares to the regular wooden brush that you can get at the store for less than five bucks, all I know it's that this brush works for my daughter, I hope it lasts a while - we've only seen a couple of bristles come off.Product provided for testing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HN1WHUDNSHIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01310R634#wasThisHelpful","R2HN1WHUDNSHIG","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with the quality of these goggles.  During the day, snow looks slightly greenish/blue-ish, and when it's a little darker, the snow looks more like a blue-ish color - note: we don't snowboard when it's too dark.They are a perfect fit for either my teen daughter or even an adult like me.  My daughter wears glasses so these are even better for her.  We have a pair of goggles that we like a lot (made in Germany) and these goggles seem to have as good quality, very impressive.One thing I really focus on, is the foam/cushion inside.  Some goggles have very light cushion or it crumbles so easily over time.  This set seem to have good cushion that would last for a while - we haven't found a way to fix goggles which cushion is partially gone.

"These tongs are so easy to use and they adapt to my small hands better than what I normally use - aka cheap tongs.  I like to use tongs a lot when cooking and baking, even with some indoor grilling with my cast iron grill.  My regular tongs are just too awkward to use, these tongs are just easy, simply push the ring (which I do on the counter) and they open, then pull the ring and they lock in perfectly.  I have a couple of pictures to illustrate a little bit of what I have been dealing with - in case you have a similar issue.The first picture shows how nice and tight the tongs are when they close up.  The way they come together is just perfect - when the tip of the tongs are off, food easily falls.  You can also see how these tongs (compared to my cheap tongs which are now in the trash can) don't open too much.  This is great for me with small hands.  The largest of the two tongs opens up to 5 inches vs the 9 inches of opening of the cheap tongs (I was always dropping the large tongs, almost never used them)The second picture shows a couple of angles of the tongs lifting up turkey sausage.  Sausage can be a little slippery so I had to give it a good grip while flipping when I was grilling them.I am very pleased with the results of these tongs - finally retired the clumsy ones.  The Roybens tongs are easy to clean (I do it by hand), and easy to use.  Price is competitive at the time of this review (~ 12 dlls), highly recommended.*Product provided for reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31AW4CLUV9WG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPEZFDI#wasThisHelpful","R31AW4CLUV9WG4","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered a size larger for my daughter and glad I did.  The fabric is almost as thin as the fabric used for slips except that this fabric is not soft and wrinkles very easily.  The dress has elastic around the waist area.  There are no pleats on the top so if you are a little busty it might look a little odd.  My daughter tried it on with a light jacket and it was ok.  The dress itself is not very well made, the stitching is very poor.  It might last a few times, but I am afraid it is going to come apart in the washer and have told my daughter to only wash it by hand.

"I really wanted to like this product - I like DBPOWER products in general.  We have a 7"" tablet and though I knew this case would be bigger and not quite fit perfectly, I wasn't too much concerned about it - what I really needed was the keyboard.  We currently use a 10"" Bluetooth keyboard that works well with our Android devices.  I figured that having something smaller would be a better choice for my teen daughter and her tablet.The size of the keyboard is great, just perfect for small hands and practical.  You can easily take it everywhere and not worry about carrying anything bigger.  The Bluetooth connection is easy to pair, only a code and you're ready.  It is comes with its standard charging cord (USB-micro USB), no problems.  The light indicator does not show when it's fully charged so that's kind of a guess but not a big deal for me.They keypad on the other hand is terrible.  The cover is all one piece of silicone.  It's like those 99c silicone calculators that don't last.  Under each key you can feel a small button switch that is so small you need to press it just right to see the key appear on the screen of your tablet.  It's almost impossible to try to type while you have the keyboard on your lap (non hard surface) AND using more than two fingers while typing.  So...if you only use your index fingers to type, this works - but don't type too fast.

"I have mixed thoughts about this set.  The brushes I received are really nice.  Very well made and tight - no loose hairs, perfect! I have sensitive skin and brushes are something that it's hard for me to use, especially synthetic.  These brushes are so soft and gentle.  I had no problem with using them and my skin just liked them.  My daughter has eczema and she tried some of the brushes as well - we ended up dividing all of them.The PU leather case is another matter - and I'm not talking about the smell.  I received the set when we had 45 degree weather.  The scent was almost gone by the time it got here and it didn't bother me at all - probably a huge difference have I received it in the middle of summer.  My biggest issue is the poor quality of the case.  The stitching is terrible.  One of the compartments that held a large brush was half way unsewn with no easy way to fix it - since the compartment stitching does not show on the other side of the case.  There are also loose threads on the other compartments which it's a matter of time when they come apart.  I really like the brushes, but if I had gone to the store and looked at the stitching of the case, very likely wouldn't have purchased the set and miss on some really good brushes for my sensitive skin.  So....3.5 stars.Product provided at a discount for reviewing purposes","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V54LG1ENXWVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SQ476I#wasThisHelpful","R3V54LG1ENXWVI","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a microplane (grater) very often when cooking or baking.  I tried this zester hoping that it would be my to go tool from citrus, to cheese, to spices.  It worked in almost all my uses except spices.  The zester is very light weight.  It is extremely sharp which makes my job easy.  When washing, be sure to wipe towards you - if you want to keep your sponge and fingers.  It is ergonomic and has bent edges underneath.  I think they are meant to aid food flow, which works most of the time unless the food is too wet, like citrus zest, garlic, or onion - more on that later.  It is long and has 8 inches of grating area.  The green color is neat and it also comes with a protective cover that stays put.TestsChocolate:  Really nice curls, no residue underneath.  Only a few passes and I had all the shavings necessary to top my dessert.Cheese: I tried Asiago and Parmesan.  The zester made good looking ribbons and I had no problem cleaning the zester afterwards.Citrus zest: I worked with orange (pictured), lemon, and lime.  They all worked really well except that I had residue under the zester inside the bent edges.  I had to constantly shake or hit the grater against the counter to get the zest.  The more I used it, the more residue underneath.Garlic, onion: We often use grated garlic and onion in our cooking.  This zester grates both perfectly well using a large (elephant type) garlic clove and onion but they release so much juice that both of them stick too much to the grater.  I think I'd continue to use a garlic press and a regular grater for the onion.Spices: I tried cinnamon and nutmeg.  They didn't work.  There were coarse pieces that were too hard to bite.  I'll stick to my spice grater that gives me powdered cinnamon and nutmeg every time.Overall it's a good zester.  It really depends on what your needs are.  I like that it fits in my drawer and it's easy to spot.  Competitive price at the moment of this review (8-9 dlls), good to try.Product provided for testing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39D3PQ3K6EVB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ORD7C0#wasThisHelpful","R39D3PQ3K6EVB1","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice charging station.  I like multiple USB charges they are so practical, but some of them can be a little disorganized.  As we continue to include more electronics in our home, our needs for organizing them (plus all cables) have increased.This charging station is a space saver.  It comes with an adapter (shown in pictures) that can sit hidden behind a desk.  There is about 45 inches of cord between the charging station and the adapter - that's almost four feet of length, meaning the adapter won't be dangling in mid air when the charging station sits on a desk.  There is another 44 inches of cord between the adapter and the plug that goes to the wall.  So there are neat ways to set this up.I have included a few pictures of my temporary setting - planning on taking this to a different area later.  As you can see, I have several long cords, I used some of the Velcro ties included (comes with a total of 5) and the cords kept in one place.  The last picture shows how my station would look if I only use short cables, which is probably what I am going to get for all of them, besides, the devices charge faster with shorter cables.We only have Android devices so it's easy to keep the same kind of cords for all USB ports.  One last note, the first dock is wider than the rest, if you can see in the pictures, I have a battery charger at the very front, that's the only place it fit.  Overall, very good charger, quick to set and quick to charge.  It does not come with cables but I highly recommend purchasing them.  It will be much easier to use and would look better especially if using at an office setting.Product provided for testing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSA33N2J84PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170L322E#wasThisHelpful","R1TSA33N2J84PP","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sprayThis spray is much more effective than other harmful aerosols that don't work.  This spray simply works.  Spray about 5 times directly to toilet water - the water should look cloudy.  The oils in the product would create a thin barrier in the water so when you drop number two, the ""two"" gets encapsulated preventing the release of stinky smell.  All you get is the scent of this spray.  It works, IT-JUST-WORKS! and if you are like us and only have one working bathroom, this becomes an awesome necessity.The scentI really like the way this smells.  It is a clean scent.  Like ""I just cleaned the bathroom"" scent.  It is not overpowering it's just right.  This is probably one of my favorite scents (in addition to baby powder scent), because it just smells clean without a chemical after scent.InnovationI really like the new way of dealing with bathroom sprays.  Natural and not harmful to the environment.  It is a new thing so I hope the price comes down a bit.  Even though it might last longer than your regular aerosol spray, the amount of these new sprays is quite small for the price.  It's only 2 ounces - 1/4 cup.  Yes, you only need a few sprays so you get a lot of sprays, but it's still a bit high.  Like I said, it's a new product, hopefully it would become a bit more affordable - that's because I want to give one to each one of my friends and my wallet is small!!OverallWorth the try.  Highly recommended to those who want something natural, have allergies, or just need something that truly works!++Product provided for testing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTOVFMHI8Y8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014C99Z82#wasThisHelpful","R1PTOVFMHI8Y8G","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really looking forward to trying this treatment.  I have done different oil treatments and they've all been really good for my hair.  This oil treatment smells really good but unfortunately it has too much Paraffinum Liquidum - which I didn't know it is a refined mineral oil.My skin gets irritated with any kind of mineral oil product, so I was sure to only use this oil on the last two inches of my hair before washing.  I warmed up the oil, applied it on the ends of my hair, let it sit for about half an hour and then washed it.  I was hoping that the other wonderful oils in this product would bring up their great benefits and maybe outweigh the heaviness of the mineral oil but it didn't work well for me.  My hair didn't show much improvement - maybe because I washed it too soon?  I only tried this treatment three times.On the other hand, my friend who has coarse hair (and no allergic reactions to mineral oil) tried a few drops on her short hair and it looked really pretty.  She had a nice shine without looking too greasy at least for the day she used it.  If you don't have mineral oil allergies you might like this product.  It smells quite nice, I was hoping for more macadamia oil though.**Product provided for testing purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV5N0DCFCVKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOM18G#wasThisHelpful","R1UV5N0DCFCVKC","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this product for three weeks now.  I have two teeth that are very sensitive due receding gum lines.  I didn't know I'd been brushing too hard but when I found out that this was the problem, I changed my technique.  Still, the gum lines were taking a little to long to come back and the gum around these two teeth was becoming sensitive as well.I began to use this solution by simply applying a few drops directly to the base of those two teeth and a little more on the gum.  It was very sensitive at first and I wasn't sure I liked it.  But with time and consistency, the area became less and less sensitive.  At this point, I thought that maybe it was just healing on its own and this product was not helping so I quit using it for two days and the sensitivity came back - those two teeth are showing some dentine at the base.  I started again and it helped.Another thing I noticed was some quick healing after hurting my gum with popcorn hulls.  I flossed but my gum was still irritated.  Normally it takes several days for my gum to heal on its own especially since I keep on hurting myself when I eat.  I used this solution and in two days my gum was back to normal.  I was very pleased with that.Overall, the product is natural and works but takes very long and the price is a bit high at the moment.  It could REALLY help some people in serious need of healing or people that just want to go back to natural remedies that work.  I know everybody is different and the seriousness of the issue matters.  So far, I am glad I had the opportunity to review this product, it came at the right time.**Product provided for testing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4FDRUAQPFBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DGH3U6#wasThisHelpful","R2H4FDRUAQPFBX","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Samsung Xpress SL-M2070FW monochrome printer.  It has been very beneficial to our projects.  This is the first time I have had to replace the toner cartridge since we use the Eco mode for printing.  The toner is very similar to the original.  They have the same length and width except for a small tab that sits on the front while installing the toner - the tab does not affect installation nor performance.The compatible toner comes very well sealed, very pleased with that.  There is a paper that needs to be removed (with instructions to remove) and a covering on the side of the roller.At first, the printer did not want to recognize the chip that comes with this toner.  The printer immediately displayed the not compatible legend but this legend went away as soon as I started printing.  The first few pages were a little smeared on the top, but by page 5 I saw a complete clean page with nice color on the letters - no smudging.  My system then seems like it did a self reset or something because I was able to see the new ink levels, as if the toner was an original.I am attaching a few pictures to show the comparison of the original Samsung cartridge vs GT cartridge.  And a picture to show the first few prints (sorry I accidentally tore the page before taking the pic) plus the system at now 98 percent.*Product provided for testing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UD5IM447H61D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N1B34A#wasThisHelpful","R2UD5IM447H61D","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 16 year old daughter was interested in reading this book.  As she prepares to head out and look for an opportunity to getting in the working field, she thought a few tips would be helpful.Some of the things she read, we had already discussed in the last few years.  The part that she liked best was how to act in an interview - I think this had her a little nervous.  She is a little more confident now after reading the book.  The author makes some comments about easing stress in a teen's life suggesting yoga and meditation.

"This hub has been very beneficial for my husband's office setting.  As he expands his capacity with a laptop, the need for USB ports has increased.  The files are transferred fast and the speed for a duplicate monitor and a nano mouse shows no delay or drag.The hub is very light, slightly less than four ounces - without the power cord.  It is very easy to use and our laptops had no difficulty recognizing the ports right away.  I think we like the fact that it has enough space to charge other electronics while working on the laptop.

"Most eye gels or serums come in small amounts, bottles, dispensers.  This gel is definitely an exception.  The bottle is quite large and the price is affordable (at the time of this review ~15-16 dlls) for the quality and quantity of product.I am a fan of Hyaluronic Acid and Vit C serums - I take both of these supplements orally.  I have seen really good results with other products but I have to admit, this is the first product I have tried that the results have been noticeable very quickly.The product feels sticky, so you only need a very small amount.  I use as much as what a couple of grains of quinoa would look like, really, that's all I need.  Since it has aloe vera and some glycerin, the product can create a thick layer if you use a lot, so in this case, less is better.I have very sensitive skin and yet, I am able to use this gel everyday without any issues.  My eyes feel smooth and they don't look too puffy in the morning.  I definitely recommend to test a small amount around the jaw (or neck) before applying it to your eyes, just in case you have a reaction to an ingredient.  There have been few people that have had a small irritation after using Hyaluronic acid (for example), so please test it somewhere other than your eye, just in case.Overall this is a wonderful product to try at an affordable price.  I am very pleased with the results so far and that's only after about 5 days of using the product.  Definitely one of my favorite eye gels.Product provided for testing purposes, my words are my own honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MP2QPDO6812O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HEZ236#wasThisHelpful","R3MP2QPDO6812O","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We make pizza every Friday since it is our family night.  Most of the time I make a 16 inch pizza so this peel is a bit small for it.  Once the pizza is baked, I could remove it from the pan easily with the peel - to place it on a wooden board to cut.  I still think that the pizza peel should only handle smaller sizes, it would feel more comfortable.  It seemed that my 16 inch pizza was too heavy for the peel, it just felt like it was bending a little.The cutting blade comes with a protective (rubber) sleeve.  The one I received was not very sharp so I was sure to run my knife sharpener several times before I used it.  Even though I made a larger pizza, I was able to cut it with a couple of rocking motions on each end.  It worked great.  For me, just the cutting blade is worth the money.  I can sharpen cutting blades, I cannot sharpen cutting wheels (at least, not very well)Overall is a good set for my needs.  It is too large to store but I am finding ways near my pizza stone.

"After purchasing another product from bulk supplements, I had the opportunity to receive a small bag of stevia to try it out.  I have use stevia from different brands, most of them have a sugar alcohol in them, but not this one.I really like the sweetness of this product is definitely extreme.  I have to be so very careful when sprinkling this in my coffee because just a pinch can be too much.  I don't like my coffee very sweet (I take it without sugar most of the time) so really, just a tiny sprinkle is necessary.I use about one teaspoon of stevia in a gallon of Ice tea.  My family has never been crazy about the stevia aftertaste but with this particular brand, they like it.  I think the secret is just to have the right amount or your drink can be easily overwhelmed by 'sweetness' that could have an 'off' taste.  I'm glad I was able to try it, now I know what to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHMNZK54W1ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSQZNF0#wasThisHelpful","RTHMNZK54W1ZN","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the WH-B05 model for reviewing purposes.  I'm an avid baker and use a kitchen scale a lot.  I currently have a scale that has only one decimal for ounces so this scale is actually better for me.  We bake dozens and dozens of dinner rolls that need to be perfectly divided for even baking and selling.  Each roll is around 1.25 ounces and this scale has helped with accuracy.The scale itself is very light, it weighs just below 6 ounces (with batteries)  The surface on top has a diameter of 4.25 inches which if you need to place a large bowl, plate, or any object on top, it could be difficult to read the display.  Also, the display is a bit sensitive and everytime I press the buttons to either change from grams to ounces or use the tare function, the display reacts - like when pressing hard on the display of a calculator.The scale does not have an on/off switch, it turns off automatically after a couple of minutes of idling.  Overall it seems to be a good and accurate scale but it's not a heavy duty scale.  It is simple and compact, and could be useful when traveling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKGO8RO0DIQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HGDEE4#wasThisHelpful","R3CKGO8RO0DIQO","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags work well with soft items.  I am showing step by step pictures of the compression of two small pillows.  I used the ~17x27 inch bag.  The system works but the quality of the bag is not as what I necessarily expected.  The plastic feels more like cellophane, not quite as thin but very similar.  I am concerned the bags will puncture easily but I also know that simple tape would fix a small hole.The vacuum hole is about an inch in diameter without the valve cap.  The hand vacuum I used was slightly over an inch in diameter so I had to press firmly to keep a good seal while vacuuming - it worked well though.  The bag won't inflate when you take the vacuum off the valve, it is sealed.  The cap is to ensure the sealing but you don't have to rush to put the cap on, there is no hissing sound ;)All in all, the bags are good and they are functional.  Not sure about the longevity of the product but so far they work.  Price is about 15 dlls for all three bags at the moment of this review.  Might be a little on the above average price.Product provided for testing purposes","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MV3ZJCYHE7KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ULPCVM#wasThisHelpful","R3MV3ZJCYHE7KC","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great experience with the Peak Reserve opener.  It is so easy to use and the entire job goes so smooth.  First of all, the foil cutter makes the most precise and level cutting edge on the foil.  It is just perfect all the way around no matter how clumsy I am.  The cutter sits at a certain height and it cuts all the way around uniformly and perfectly clean.The wine opener itself goes down very smoothly.  I thought I was going to need full force to go through the cork but the worm went in so effortlessly.  This was the first time I'd tried an opener this style, but it happened that a few days ago, I went to a wedding where the bottle opener happened to be a similar model -happened to find out it was a $$$ model.  I had to try it and find out if it was any different than $$ Peak Reserve.  No difference.  They were both as easy and neat to handle, they both look classy and elegant, the only difference was the price.  It also comes in a super neat box, definitely an elegant gift for the wine lover.Very pleased with the results, glad to have the opportunity to review this opener as provided from the manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C423SSIU9IA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4D1P3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2C423SSIU9IA8","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kindle book is very simple and easy to follow.  I have a couple of friends who got married this year and I recommended this book to them (especially since they have kindle unlimited, which makes the book free)I tried a few of the recipes and they are tasty.  They are all for beef.  So if you eat a lot of beef, this is a good book to give some variety.  I think my favorite is the citrus marinade because it is simple, I have all the ingredients (all the time) and it enhances the flavor of even the most simple (cough, cheap, cough) piece of steak.Most of the recipes are basic and not very extreme -which for a new cook, makes it affordable and tasty.  There are other more expensive marinades like one that includes bourbon, or whiskey, or wines.  I think I rather drink those alcohols than put them in my meat to marinate, BUT, they give a delicious flavor to the meat (we often use Port wine on lamb, for example)The book is only for beef recipes, but if you are a little bit more experienced in the kitchen, you'll see that some of the marinades will work well on other meats like lamb, veal, and even pork.  The proportions seem to be balanced as far as we have tried them.Our favorites so far:- Orange juice (or what I call 'citrus')- Spicy jalapeno- Scrumptious garlic (gotta be a garlic lover for this one, yum)- Pineapple- Red pepper balsamicWe have tried a combination of others with what we have in hand.  I have had the opportunity to review this book for a month and this is what we've done.  So far so good, best for people who are beginning to get creative and definitely eat lots of meat!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119ENTO8VR4ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ILIRSG#wasThisHelpful","R119ENTO8VR4ED","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My teen daughter is preparing her pirate custom that includes a wig of color.  So when I was offered the opportunity to review one of this wigs, I chose the purple one for her.  It fits her nicely but she needs to secure it with pins underneath.  We brushed the wig with a short bristles hairbrush and there was some strands that came off but not as bad as I thought.

"I accepted to review this set with the hopes of improving the circulation in my legs.  I bruise very easily so I thought that a good massage will help.  Well, it sort of does but not much.  The round massager was not very good for me, it has very stiff rubber teeth that just feel very rough.  I tried using oil or a moisturizer and it helped but it still felt too rough.  So I opted for the angled massager.  It works better except that I need to be very careful how much I press.  The first time I ended up with tiny little bruises all over the inside of my thighs - which is where I normally bruise the most.  So I released the pressure while massaging and that helped a little.I have been using the angled massager for almost two weeks and I have noticed just a little less bruising when I hit myself with the corner of a table - for example.  So I know it will take more time.  I am not using this for the purpose of eliminating cellulite but to improve circulation.

"This is a great item.  We have successfully plugged into an MP3 and a CD player and then paired it to a pair of Bluetooth headphones and speaker.  Very easy to pair (no codes required) and fast.  The device is so small, it's 2 inches long by 1 inch wide.  It is less than half an inch thick.  It doesn't disturb any of the settings we had, it looks nice an classy.  Definitely a great device when you still have items around your house that are in 'transition' mode, ha! Now we can enjoy our Bluetooth earbuds with any device around the house without disturbing the rest of the household.  Price is not bad at around 25 dlls if you have several items that can use this TX-RX or one that you really like.  It is discrete enough to fit in a shirt pocket with corded earbuds if necessary.  Range was about 25-30 feet for us - also depends on how straight the path is between your device and your receiver.

"I have tried other products from Joyal Beauty and they have all been of good quality.  When I was offered this eye cream for review I was happy to try it.  I have used this gel for 24 days, twice a day without a miss.  I am very diligent with products like this because I know how important it is to see how long they take to begin seeing results.This gel smells delicious, like fresh cucumbers.  It takes about 30 seconds to absorb and it goes really well under your regular moisturizer.  I use a pump and that's enough for both eyes and even a little extra that ends up on my forehead.  After 5 applications, I was able to notice a change on the puffiness of my eyes.  Let me tell you, I look like a raccoon with puffy eyes in the summer.  Our days are pretty long here at our small farm and I don't get enough sleep.At two weeks I was able to feel softer skin.  And at three weeks I noticed the skin around my eyes was brighter.  Vitamin C serums brighten up the skin but they can be too strong for your eyes and cause irritation.  This gel is gentle.  Doesn't have a huge amount of Vitamin C but for that reason, it takes a bit longer to work.Now, 47 applications later, my eyes look much better - even though I still don't get enough sleep.  But I have to say that the gel surprised me when I began to see some fine lines look smoother, not quite disappeared but wow...just wow.I was also curious to know how long this bottle would last.  The container is not transparent so it is difficult to guess.  I opened the bottle and I seem to have around 3/4 of gel left.  I also weighed the amount of gel that comes with one pump (very consistent amount) to see if I could get an average.  I think that at this rate, the gel would last me approximate 2 months - give or take a week.  This is with two applications everyday.In conclusion, natural, fairly balanced gel, good for even delicate skin, and good price for it - a bit less than 18 dlls at the moment.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPV6Z3D9NEE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131T8LIE#wasThisHelpful","R3SPV6Z3D9NEE8","A2YW1MG1GKU8XD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YW1MG1GKU8XD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this after deciding I needed a bit more carry on room than my normal tote, but didn't want to get something that might get turned away at the gate as I often times carry my camera, lenses, laptop, etc... in my carry on.  To be safe, I wanted it to fit within the carry-on dimensions even including wheels and handle - something most 22"" uprights don't.  This fits perfectly, and is easy to maneuver.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I have not had any issue with the wheels, even on slightly uneven pavement.  If you go over a bump, just lift a tiny bit on the handle - or if the ground is particularly uneven, roll it behind you on two wheels like a normal case.  The integrated lock is a nice plus, and the bag is also well organized.  That said, I do have two complaints with the bag - neither one major, but the reason for subtracting a star.First, I was hoping the hardside spinner would be a bit more... well... hard sided.  These sides might provide a bit more protection against sharp objects, but are still limited protection against crushing.  I suppose they were also trying to keep the weight of the bag reasonable, but I'm not sure I would have made quite the same trade-off.Second, the zipper can be a little bit of a pain to get started.  It's a nuisance at the most, but not an issue I have with my other bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7FIPOASRT6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLI317G#wasThisHelpful","R2D7FIPOASRT6T","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great investment - far superior to an Omni-Bounce or other portable alternatives.  I got one of these to keep with my flash instead of the Omni-Bounce I used previously.  I trimmed a small amount off each edge of the reflector panel so that the overall width was the same as my flash and it could be easily slid into its pouch along with it.  Then I stuck a bit of velcro on the back of it and ordered Demb's Mega-Flip It diffuser panel (you can purchase it separately from Demb).  With those two minor modifications I now had a diffuser that was portable to carry with the flash, and if I needed a bit more surface area, I could simply attach the Mega-Flip It.Even without the Mega-Flip It modification, it provides great light control.  Angled a bit towards the subject it provides solid lighting with much softer shadows than a direct flash.  Pointed more toward the ceiling it produces a catch light while the ceiling bounce provides soft lighting.  It also feels less clumsy to attach than the fold-up soft boxes and doesn't require you stick any velcro on your flash.For what it's worth, my wedding photographer also used a Demb Flip-It and I was quiet happy with the photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1181TRT5WL90F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089NBPO0#wasThisHelpful","R1181TRT5WL90F","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The stoneware fits both requirements - the top and base can go through the dishwasher, and it looks so much better than the plastic fountains.  My only complaint is with the filters.  The charcoal filter seems to plug up more often than it should really be replaced.  When this happens the water flow slows to a trickle, I have to take it apart, rinse out and shake the filter, put it back together, and hope it starts flowing again without needing to replace the filter right away.

Another lever frees the rod to either collapse the support or quickly extend it to the approximate length you need (and then a squeeze or two of the handle will tighten things up).

"This is as much a review on Samsung's support as it is their Gear series of devices.  I don't make a habit of cross-posting reviews, but the experience I've had with Samsung is bad enough I think it warrants sharing, even between different devices in the same line.  Device failures I can tolerate, but a manufacturer refusing to stand behind their product I can't.Short of it though is this - after just 7 months, there are multiple things wrong with my watch (dead Bluetooth, delaminating glass, won't boot, and won't charge), and Samsung won't repair any of them under warranty.  While there are no cracks in the glass or other signs of physical damage, they're calling the delaminating glass ""physical damage"" and are demanding $149 to repair it.  Further, unless I pay them to fix the glass (which isn't even a major issue yet), they refuse to repair any of the other issues.  Here's the general timeline though:~ 3 months: Bluetooth starts getting flaky. Have to periodically disconnect it and reconnect it from my phone or reboot it for it to find it again.~ 5 months: The glass starts to delaminate from the LCD with no clear damage or cause - it isn't chipped, cracked, or scratched. It began in one corner and started working its way around the edges.~ 7 months: The Bluetooth dies completely and will not turn back on. When I'd try to turn it back on in settings, it would pop up a ""Processing"" message, then turn back off. So I factory reset the watch back to original settings. After factory reset, the watch booted to an ""Unknown error"" screen and would boot no further.~ 8 months: Watch stops charging, so now I can't even boot it back to the ""Unknown error"" screen to show anybody. Fortunately I took a picture first.~ 10 months: Finally get around to opening a ticket with Samsung and send the watch in for warranty service. After they get it, I get an email telling me the repair price has changed from $0 to $149, with no explanation. When I call in (since their website wasn't working), I'm told the ""certified engineer"" categorized the screen as physically damaged.

"I bought this to support my lens when shooting macro photos with lens extension tubes.  The tubes, especially when stacked, tend to allow the lens to sag a bit, so this helps support it in the proper position.  It screws on securely to the end of my rail and serves that purpose well.  However, some of the other options out there feature a Velcro strap that goes over the top of the lens (not present on this design), which I'm subtracting 1 star for.  Originally I also was disappointed that the rings which the lens rested on are hard - I had been hoping for something more akin to rubber O-rings - but in retrospect that may not be a bad thing (for example, on zoom lenses the lens can slide smoothly on these as you zoom in and out).I've included a photo of it on my macro setup while I was fit-testing everything.  Obviously in the picture with the camera pointed straight downward, the lens support isn't serving much function.  However, it gives you an idea what to expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ72V1I8HCO10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JOXR76#wasThisHelpful","RZ72V1I8HCO10","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this to expand my storage a bit.  I already owned a Craftsman top chest and bottom cabinet in dark grey.  Unfortunately, Craftsman no longer offers dark grey, and at the time of my purchase they only offered this deep version intermediate chest in red.  As near I can tell though, Waterloo makes the chests for Craftsman, and Waterloo had this option in black.The shelf is sturdy and spacious, with deep drawers (vs the normal 12"" depth on a lot of middle chests).  They open and close smoothly on their ball bearing slides.  They don't feel like they close as firmly as my existing chest and cabinet (which has a nice satisfying thunk into the full closed position), but that's nitpicking a bit.All that said, I did have one issue with my chest though.  The retaining nut or clip that should be on the back of the lock to keep it firmly installed in the front panel of the chest wasn't installed or present in the packaging.  As a result, the lock falls out of mine.  When it falls out, the bar that connects to it falls down and gets in the way of the operation of the top drawer.  I will need to write Waterloo to get the right parts sent out to me.UPDATE: I emailed Waterloo, and less than a day later they responded, apologizing for the missing part, and they promptly shipped it out, no questions asked.

"Love these mugs.  There are just a couple caveats to be aware of though:First, the plain stainless steel versions can be run through the dishwasher on the top rack, but the colored ones need to have the metal body of them hand washed.  While I like the colored ones better, this resulted in me returning my colored ones and ordering plain stainless ones to replace them - I prefer ease vs aesthetics in this case.Second, these 20oz versions are fairly tall, and they won't fit under many coffee makers.  For example, I can't place them under my Keurig.  I have to either brew into another cup and pour into these, or hold them at an angle under it.

Also, I took a look at my old Honeywell OEM bulb, and it very clearly has the same markings as the Philips bulbs, so it appears Philips makes them for Honeywell - you're getting the same thing at a fraction of the price.

"I formerly used Giotto's clamps and plates, but recently changed plates on my camera to an L plate from Kirk.  Like many other Arca plates, the Kirk plate features stop screws to keep it from sliding out of the clamp.  Unfortunately, those stop screws were not compatible with my Giotto's plates, which led me to search for a reasonably priced Arca clamp that mated well with the Kirk plates.From my research, it seemed like SunwayFoto might be the best compromise between price and quality, and I have not been disappointed with the real world results of these clamps.  They tighten up quite securely on my plates, the knurled knob is easy to grip, they're lightweight, and feel like they're machined well.  The slot on the bottom is fairly standard among several brands, but you'll still want to take a look to see how it will pair with your gear (in my case it worked well with one head, but I had to mill it out wider for one of my other heads).My first DDC-60i was a Christmas present, but I was happy enough with it that I bought a second to use with another head.

"Bought the FB-28 to use on my travel tripod.  The tripod (a 3 Legged Thing Punks Vyv) already came with a very solid head, but the clamp on the head didn't tighten down as well on my camera's Arca plate as I wanted (it was secure, but took less than a full turn to go from tightened all the way to being able to lift the camera straight out of it).  Unfortunately, while the FB-28's clamp worked great with my Kirk plate (all the SunwayFoto clamps have worked well for me in that regard), the ball on it doesn't tighten up quite as much as the head that came on the 3LT tripod.  To be clear, it does tighten up quite well (hence the 4 stars) - just not quite as good as the head I already had.  That made it hard for me to justify removing the existing head (in the end I just bought another clamp and milled the bottom out to mate with the stem on the 3LT ball head).I also considered the FB-28 for use on my table-top tripod, and in that regard it would have been more solid than the mini ball head I already had paired with the table-top tripod.  It was also larger though - just enough so that I didn't want it for table-top use.All that said... If you own a travel tripod which didn't come with a head (or which didn't come with a good head) and you want a solid mini head with an Arca clamp on it, the FB-28 might be a great fit for you.  It is solid, the base diameter is small, the clamp is wide enough to be secure but narrow enough to be compact, and it is light weight.  Under other circumstances I would have kept mine.  With a decent pro-sumer SLR this should tighten up sufficiently, even with a 70-200 f/2.8 lens on it (though with a large lens like that it will likely sag slightly after tightening and there might be some unusual angles it won't lock down at well).  I would have no qualms recommending this to a friend with that need, and in general I've been happy with the quality of SunwayFoto for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TDTD5CPHPTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AST1EUI#wasThisHelpful","R17TDTD5CPHPTK","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was torn on how to rate this clamp.  Like all SunwayFoto gear I've purchased, it is well machined.  It also clamps securely, and the knurled knob is easy to operate.  The 37mm width and its light weight make it perfect for mating with a mini ball head on a tabletop or small travel tripod.  Unfortunately, SunwayFoto designed the DDC-37 to mate specifically with their FB-28, and designed both to use a non-standard clamp screw (it's neither 1/4""-20 nor 3/8""-16).  I understand they're compact pieces of gear, but the screw isn't so much smaller than 1/4""-20 that they couldn't have chosen to go with the standard screw even thought it is slightly larger.  As a result, this clamp really isn't that useful without extra work.In my case, I drilled the center hole out slightly larger, than tapped the hole to accept a 1/4""-20 screw.  While I couldn't be happier with it now, I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place, and I think departing from accepted standards is enough to warrant the loss of 2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5C102EPFT2DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFD7Y4Q#wasThisHelpful","R5C102EPFT2DC","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like all Sunwayfoto gear, the DDH-03 is well machined.  It feels well put together and pans smoothly for a fraction of the price of RRS or Kirk.  However, the markings on mine are off by a considerable margin.  The center marks on either side of the top half of the clamp are about a degree off of being straight.  When mounted, if I align the marks with 0, 90, 180, or 270 on the base, it is visibly not straight.  For that matter, it has center lines on either side of the clamp, and not only are neither truly aligned as they should be, they don't quite match with each other either, with about a quarter degree difference.  Given the low cost, I don't expect the markings to be accurate within a mil of where they're supposed to be, but they should be close enough that the clamp is visibly straight to the eye when the center marks are aligned with one of the cardinal angles.

"Bought a pair of these to use with a 72"" Faztek T-slot extrusion which I will use as a heavy duty cutting guide.  The clamps lock down very securely, with the handle on the rear of them adjusting the tension or clamping height.  The screw on the bottom of the clamps fits the T-slot on my guide quite well, and the clamps come with a plastic shim that sticks to the bottom of them (almost like a washer for the screw) to act as a bearing so that they slide easily in the slot.  Also included is a no-mar rubber pad to use with the clamp.  All in all, a very well thought out and well built clamp.As much as I love the clamps, I'm even more impressed with Kreg's customer support.  I discovered the no-mar rubber pads were also a perfect fit for some other locking clamps I own (which never came with pads), so I reached out to their customer support to find out where I could buy additional pads for my clamps.  Customer support was nice enough to mail me some of them at no charge!

"This is as much a review on Samsung's support as it is their Gear series of devices.  Short of it though is this - there are multiple things wrong with the watch, and they won't repair any of them under warranty unless I also pay them to fix the screen, which they are demanding $149 for even though it is clear there's no physical damage (the glass is delaminating from the LCD, but there's no chips, scratches, or cracks).~ 3 months:  Bluetooth starts getting flaky.  Have to periodically disconnect it and reconnect it from my phone or reboot it for it to find it again.~ 5 months:  The glass starts to delaminate from the LCD with no clear damage or cause - it isn't chipped, cracked, or scratched.  It began in one corner and started working its way around the edges.~ 7 months:  The Bluetooth dies completely and will not turn back on.  When I'd try to turn it back on in settings, it would pop up a ""Processing"" message, then turn back off.  So I factory reset the watch back to original settings.  After factory reset, the watch booted to an ""Unknown error"" screen and would boot no further.~ 8 months:  Watch stops charging, so now I can't even boot it back to the ""Unknown error"" screen to show anybody.  Fortunately I took a picture first.~ 10 months:  Finally get around to opening a ticket with Samsung and send the watch in for warranty service.  After they get it, I get an email telling me the repair price has changed from $0 to $149, with no explanation.  When I call in (since their website wasn't working), I'm told the ""certified engineer"" categorized the screen as physically damaged.  In addition, they refuse to fix any of the other issues with the watch unless I also pay them to fix the screen.Samsung has just sold me on either Motorola or Apple (the latter of which I never envisioned as possible, but since I regularly hear of awesome experiences with Apple support...).  Way to go Samsung!... As for the watch itself... Was functional, but clearly still a bit rough around the edges given wearable technology is still new.  In particular, the heart rate monitoring function never worked well.  It was finicky when I was sitting still, and absolutely untrustworthy if I was exercising.  While going up stairs it told me my pulse was in the 50's (I am usually closer to 75 when I'm resting...).  Similar experiences with it other times as well.While I it was a Gear 2 Neo specifically that I got, the heart rate monitoring is likely going to be similar to the others in the line, and of course the major issue - their support - is going to be consistent regardless of which watch you're looking at.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKXADOQ6W66V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTR5HP6#wasThisHelpful","R2YKXADOQ6W66V","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review got rather long, so figured I'd list out a quick summary at the top:Pro's / Features* Extremely lightweight (under 3 lbs w/ head), and folds very small (about 12"")* Comes with a fairly nice carrying bag - not padded, but heavy duty nylon.* Head locks quite tightly despite its small size - my D7100 with a 50-150mm/F2.8 or 18-200 fully extended are zero issue.* Head includes a separate knob for pan lock.* Leg sections also lock quite securely.* Legs can be set to three different angles to account for uneven terrain, get closer to the ground for macro work, etc...* Center column and one leg detach from the tripod and then connect to each other to make a monopod.* Center column reverses for low / macro photography.* Center column does have a hook to hang ballast.* Designed in the UK.Con's* Clamp requires less than one full turn of the knob to go from securely tightened to lifting the camera out of it with my Kirk Arca plate.  This can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it.  However, it's also not true with their own plate (which requires about 1-1/4 turns to remove)* Not as stable as a larger, heavier tripod.  Partly that's a weight thing, but the long, telescoping center column and many leg sections are a major factor.* With 5 leg sections, it also takes a bit longer to setup than a 2 or 3 section tripod.* Ball stem not totally compatible with RRS / Sunwayfoto / Desmond / Neewer clamps (in no way unique there - plenty of others, like Giotto's or Manfrotto, also aren't).  You can attach them, but the land on the top of the stem is wider than the groove on the clamp.  Will have to machine the slot wider on my clamp.In all honesty, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better travel tripod at this price point, or even close.  However, between the magnesium version (Vyv) and carbon fiber version (Rick), I'd lean towards the magnesium version.  It's stiffer, tested better for me (side-by-side less impact from vibration), less expensive, and only 2oz heavier.So, without further ado, onto the full review....------------------------------------------------------------------I love having a tripod with me for photos where I need that extra stability.  However, I don't love toting one around.  While I've got a Benro that is built like a tank that I got for a prior holiday, it also is about the size and weight of a tank.  As time has passed, I've found I don't carry it very often - it just isn't worth the trouble of lugging it around, and the most stable tripod in the world doesn't do any good if you leave it at home.When I recently needed to purchase a new tripod for taking macro photos, I decided to splurge on a carbon fiber version of the Vanguard Alta Pro, figuring the weight savings would allow it to double as a tripod for carrying around.  The reality though is that even in carbon fiber, most tripods just aren't right sized to carry as an every-day tripod or go hiking / backpacking with.  I decided to return the Vanguard, get an end-of-model-life Manfrotto 055 in aluminum, and use the savings (plus a bit more) to get a travel tripod.  To that end, I was initially looking at the Mefoto tripods, but the Backpacker model was only rated to 8 lbs (few tripods and heads perform well at their limits) and the Roadtrip model was neither as small folded as I wanted nor weighed less than the target weight I'd had in mind.Enter the 3LT Punks.  It was rated to a higher capacity than either Mefoto, folded as small as the Backpacker model, weighed under 3 lbs, and could be converted into a monopod (one more heavy item I could stop packing!).  It seemed almost too good to be true.  I'd never heard of 3 Legged Thing, but the limited reviews all seemed generally positive and it seemed a perfect fit for what I wanted, so I pulled the trigger, eventually buying both the magensium version (Vyv) and the carbon fiber version (Rick), to try head-to-head, after the latter went on sale for little more than the magnesium.I could not be happier.  It's literally half the size and weight of my Benro w/ a head on it.  Despite the low weight, everything still feels solid - the legs, center column, and ball head all lock securely, with the head also featuring a separate pan lock.It really is worth noting how securely the ball head locks for a head this size.  I have zero problem with it with my 50-150mm/F2.8 or my 18-200mm full extended, even at unusual angles.  I don't know that I'd trust it with its full rated capacity unless you were able to keep it level and the weight centered over the head, but for most reasonable loads it clamps quite securely (and if you were carrying a much bigger lens you could also carry a bigger tripod... this is a travel tripod after all).  I tested it against Sunwayfoto's FB-28 mini head, which is similar in size (just a tiny bit shorter), and the 3LT Airhed is an improvement over it in how tightly it will clamp.I also love the versatility of it.  The 3LT Punks is a touch short compared to its larger cousins, but it's still adequate for portraits, landscape photos, etc...  The center column is reversible, so in a pinch it can be used for macro photos or shots you want to take from a low perspective.  Unscrew the hook on the bottom of the center column to remove the column, unscrew the leg with the leg warmer / foam sleeve, and then screw the column and leg together - WALA! you now have a monopod (I love that I now don't have to choose between them when I'm packing!).That said, it does have some limitations, but there are certain things which one reasonably should expect in a tripod this size.  As mentioned above, its height is a bit limited.  At that height it also does not have quite the solid-as-a-boulder feel that my other tripods do (the Benro or Manfrotto).  Part of that is simply its lower weight, part of that is needing to extend the center column all the way, and part of that is the five leg sections - you'll generally get more stability from fewer leg sections (but then you'll also have a much less compact tripod).  However, you can hook your bag or some other ballast off the bottom of the center column for additional stability.  3LT also makes a stone bag that straps onto the legs.  Or, if you don't need the height, simply lower the center column or don't extend the legs so far.I also find the clamp on the head to be a bit less secure with my Kirk plate than I'd like.  While it's fine with the included plate, using my Kirk plate, once tightened securely (which it does do), a quarter turn of the knob allows the camera to slide, and an additional half turn (so less than a full turn in total) lets me lift the camera off the clamp.  Some people may honestly like that, as it's definitely quick to operate the knob - enough so that a lever clamp wouldn't be much benefit.  But I tend to be a bit paranoid, and without a separate button or lever safety (like my older non-Arca clamps) I prefer the security of having to turn the knob a bit more.  As a result, I decided to keep the head (which is fantastic for this size), but replace the clamp.Which also leads to my last minor quible with the tripod - the ball stem doesn't have the same land width as what has become common on many Arca clamps.  Sunwayfoto and Desmond (looks like Neewer as well but I can't confirm that) seem to have adopted the same cutout on the bottom of their clamps as RRS (and possibly others - haven't worked with some of the other premium clamps), which makes it easy to exchange clamps (and Sunwayfoto makes fairly quality stuff for a budget - I have not qualms with their clamps).  Unfortunately, the land on the top of the ball stem on the 3LT Airhed is not just differently sized, but it's wider than the groove on those clamps.  While you can attach them still, it never feels quite as solid, because it doesn't fit into the groove on the clamp.  In my case, I'm going to be machining the groove on one of my clamps a bit wider to fit this head more exactly.  Still, since it is sold as a package and includes the head and clamp, I can't judge the tripod too harshly for this.The company is also a pleasure to work with.  Prior to the purchase I was going back and forth between the magnesium and the carbon fiber version.  I wasn't worried about the difference in weight between the two (which is minimal), but wanted something that would endure the elements well and would be durable.  They responded quickly, and I appreciated their direct advice without anyone trying to upsell me into the carbon fiber version or some other model.  I also love that the product is designed and engineered in the UK (to be fair, there is a lot of decent stuff coming out of China nowadays, like Sunwayfoto, but I do still appreciate a product that's designed in the US or UK).Now... between the magnesium version and the carbon fiber version...They're very comparable in terms of size and features.  The heads appear identical.  There is a slight, but negligible difference in height.  Likewise, there is a slight, but negligible difference in weight (about 2oz - with the carbon fiber obviously being less).  In cold weather the carbon fiber will feel warmer as it transmits heat less easily.  The magnesium version theoretically should be more impact resistant, though if you dent a leg and can't telescope it, I'd say that's just as bad as cracking it, so I'm not sure how much benefit that really is.The real difference is that the magnesium version is much stiffer.  If I fully extend the legs and center column, hold the head in one hand, and then push on the center column, the carbon fiber version flexes considerably more - less force results in a greater deflection.  I don't have tools to measure that, but it is enough of a difference to easily observe.So I decided to test them head-to-head to see which was more vibration resistant.  I setup a test target (a steel ruler with 0.5mm divisions) on my door, then setup the tripods (one at a time) approximately 9 foot away.  Two legs were firmly on the floor, while the third leg I set on top of a Honeywell air filter running at high speed as a vibration source.  I then photographed the steel rule using a remote shutter release with my D7100 at ISO 100, 200mm, f/8, 4 second exposure, with image stabilization turned off.  I took 3 exposures, switched tripods, and then repeated the test, for a total of 6 exposures with each tripod, with a re-setup in between.After the first test was done, I repeated the test, but this time without the remote shutter release, the aperture opened up to f/5.6, ISO bumped up to 200, and the exposure shortened to 1 second.  Again, I took 3 exposures (but did not re-test - so 3 total exposures per tripod versus 6 with the other test), holding the camera as I depressed the shutter button.Consistently, the magnesium version of the tripod (Vyv) outperformed the carbon fiber version in both of these tests (Rick).  With the remote shutter release, for each trial the best 2 of 3 from the magnesium version outperformed the best 1 of the carbon fiber, and the worst of the magnesium was middle of the pack for the carbon fiber.  Likewise when the remote shutter release was not used.  Without having seen how much stiffer the magnesium version was side-by-side, I would not have expected that result, and even after seeing the extra rigidity, I thought perhaps the flex in the carbon fiber version would act like a spring to dampen the vibration.  At least in these tests though, that was not the case.To be fair, most people are unlikely to setup their tripods on top of an air filter, and I don't know how representative that is.  Most real world vibration sources are likely to have much longer moments.  In many cases they're also likely to be single impulses (such as a gust of wind or a nearby footfall).  However, I don't have a repeatable way to test something like that.  What I can say is that against something like a gust of wind, the improved stiffness of the magnesium version should help (as it did when I didn't use the remote shutter release - the extra stiffness resisted the shake of my hand), and against vibration coming through the legs, I think the test is valid even if the frequency is different.If I can, I will upload a couple photos from the test.  I'm confident I can on the Rick page, but since I previously reviewed the Vyv, I'm not sure I can add photos to it (if you're reading this from the Vyv page, check out Rick).Either tripod is still a great performer, and the mix of features at this size make them great for traveling.  Between the two, without some other reason to get the carbon fiber, I'd get the magnesium version, even if you find its carbon fiber brother on sale for little more.  The weight difference isn't significant, and the magnesium version is stiffer and tested better.In either case though, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better travel tripod.  If you're looking for a portable tripod that is still stable and very versatile then take a serious look at the 3 Legged Thing Punks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5TO3S4VA5R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPXTIAS#wasThisHelpful","RO5TO3S4VA5R6","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this exact model vise at a hardware store chain.  Bottom was not machined flat - had a rocker to it which would have required additional effort to level to ensure holes would be drilled vertically.

"Does not live up to its rated weight capacity.  With my Nikon D7100 and 18-200 lens (combined definitely less than 6.6 lbs), it is only able to support the camera when it is reasonably level or slightly elevated.  It struggles, but has thus far held it in portrait.  However, at other angles the weight of the camera pulls the ball down.  I have a Bogen / Manfrotto 3009 head that is rated at a more modest 4.5 lbs capacity, and it locks down the same gear quite tightly, even at unusual angles.That said... This is a very tiny ball head, so it is quite portable.  While the Bogen / Manfrotto 3009 is more secure, it is also considerably larger.  Used with a smaller camera or smaller lens the Giottos MH1104 should be plenty secure.  I haven't decided whether to return this head or not yet, but the main factor that might cause me to keep it would be the small size.  The angles where it isn't secure I'm unlikely to be shooting at, especially given this really is for tabletop use in my case.It's also otherwise well enough built.  Still... I can't give it 4 or 5 stars when it doesn't come close to its rated capacity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1DJL8BCD012/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00193YD7I#wasThisHelpful","R2V1DJL8BCD012","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to get a focusing rail for taking macro photos of a diamond I was examining for a potential engagement ring (I was buying it online and they had shipped it to me to check out for a week before making any final decisions).  Given I don't yet do a lot of macro photography otherwise though, I didn't want to spend a fortune on it.  At this price I wasn't sure what to expect, but also figured I couldn't go too far wrong with it either - limited downside at this price point.On the whole, everything is reasonable made and feels solid.  One knob tightens down to lock or unlock the rail while the other moves the rail forward and backward.  I use mine with a quick release plate on the bottom (to mount to the clamp on my normal head) and a clamp screwed down tight on the top.  With two of these you could conceivably have adjustment on both X and Y axis.That said, don't expect to make particularly fine sub-millimeter adjustments with this.  While it's theoretically possible, the teeth and gearing aren't really built for that sort of precision.  If you're using it vertically, you'll also need to hold the camera to keep it from moving when you loosen the lock screw to adjust it, and when you add the holding and multiple screws and such together, you'll probably be limited to precision of a couple millimeters.  For some purposes that will be fine, but for higher magnification close-up with very limited depth of field, it may be insufficient.In my case, I found it easier to simply hold the diamond in locking tweezers and move the object instead of the camera, although only part of that can be blamed on the rail (the other part is that it would have been difficult to find something so that I could position the stone at just the right angle to photograph the inclusions I wanted to note).Given the low price, I can feel comfortable giving it 4 stars for value, but I can't give it 5 stars with its limitations.  If you're looking to make precise adjustments keep looking.  If you want something inexpensive because you're either just getting started with macro or won't use it often, then it's worth considering if the limited precision is not a factor.If I decide to do more macro work, I think I'm going to get a small machinist's table (like a Proxxon KT 70) and mount an Arca rail on it.  With the table, rail, double clamps, hardware to mount it, etc... it will probably set me back $250 if I go that route.  However, it will be a lot more precise than this, but considerably less than two axis solutions from Kirk, RRS, or Novoflex.  If I do end up doing that, I'll update my review to note my results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WOTFTVZK0W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY89V8W#wasThisHelpful","R33WOTFTVZK0W1","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple camera chargers that have require a cord with an IEC C7 connector.  For travel though, I prefer to keep things as portable as possible, and that means eliminating as many cords as possible.  So I set out to find a direct plug-in adapter that had an IEC C7 in as flat a form factor as possible.  Initially I looked a straight models, but then I realized this form factor worked even better.  It was still just as flat when packed in a pouch with the chargers, but the right angle makes it so that my chargers lay flat against the wall when it is plugged in.

Prior to the purchase I was going back and forth between the magnesium and the carbon fiber version.  I wasn't worried about the difference in weight between the two (which is minimal), but wanted something that would endure the elements well and would be durable.  They responded quickly, and I appreciated their direct advice without anyone trying to upsell me into the carbon fiber version or some other model.  I also love that the product is designed and engineered in the UK (to be fair, there is a lot of decent stuff coming out of China nowadays, like Sunwayfoto, but I do still appreciate a product that's designed in the US or UK).Now... between the magnesium version and the carbon fiber version...They're very comparable in terms of size and features.  The heads appear identical.  There is a slight, but negligible difference in height.  Likewise, there is a slight, but negligible difference in weight (about 2oz - with the carbon fiber obviously being less).  In cold weather the carbon fiber will feel warmer as it transmits heat less easily.  The magnesium version theoretically should be more impact resistant, though if you dent a leg and can't telescope it, I'd say that's just as bad as cracking it, so I'm not sure how much benefit that really is.The real difference is that the magnesium version is much stiffer.  If I fully extend the legs and center column, hold the head in one hand, and then push on the center column, the carbon fiber version flexes considerably more - less force results in a greater deflection.  I don't have tools to measure that, but it is enough of a difference to easily observe.So I decided to test them head-to-head to see which was more vibration resistant.  I setup a test target (a steel ruler with 0.5mm divisions) on my door, then setup the tripods (one at a time) approximately 9 foot away.  Two legs were firmly on the floor, while the third leg I set on top of a Honeywell air filter running at high speed as a vibration source.  I then photographed the steel rule using a remote shutter release with my D7100 at ISO 100, 200mm, f/8, 4 second exposure, with image stabilization turned off.  I took 3 exposures, switched tripods, and then repeated the test, for a total of 6 exposures with each tripod, with a re-setup in between.After the first test was done, I repeated the test, but this time without the remote shutter release, the aperture opened up to f/5.6, ISO bumped up to 200, and the exposure shortened to 1 second.  Again, I took 3 exposures (but did not re-test - so 3 total exposures per tripod versus 6 with the other test), holding the camera as I depressed the shutter button.Consistently, the magnesium version of the tripod (Vyv) outperformed the carbon fiber version in both of these tests (Rick).  With the remote shutter release, for each trial the best 2 of 3 from the magnesium version outperformed the best 1 of the carbon fiber, and the worst of the magnesium was middle of the pack for the carbon fiber.  Likewise when the remote shutter release was not used.  Without having seen how much stiffer the magnesium version was side-by-side, I would not have expected that result, and even after seeing the extra rigidity, I thought perhaps the flex in the carbon fiber version would act like a spring to dampen the vibration.  At least in these tests though, that was not the case.To be fair, most people are unlikely to setup their tripods on top of an air filter, and I don't know how representative that is.  Most real world vibration sources are likely to have much longer moments.  In many cases they're also likely to be single impulses (such as a gust of wind or a nearby footfall).  However, I don't have a repeatable way to test something like that.  What I can say is that against something like a gust of wind, the improved stiffness of the magnesium version should help (as it did when I didn't use the remote shutter release - the extra stiffness resisted the shake of my hand), and against vibration coming through the legs, I think the test is valid even if the frequency is different.If I can, I will upload a couple photos from the test.  I'm confident I can on the Rick page, but since I previously reviewed the Vyv, I'm not sure I can add photos to it (if you're reading this from the Vyv page, check out Rick).Either tripod is still a great performer, and the mix of features at this size make them great for traveling.  Between the two, without some other reason to get the carbon fiber, I'd get the magnesium version, even if you find its carbon fiber brother on sale for little more.  The weight difference isn't significant, and the magnesium version is stiffer and tested better.In either case though, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better travel tripod.  If you're looking for a portable tripod that is still stable and very versatile then take a serious look at the 3 Legged Thing Punks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Y61LTW53HYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPYDSQ2#wasThisHelpful","R14Y61LTW53HYY","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great portable charger.  I wanted a charger that would fit easily into a camera bag or small pouch, with flip-down prongs, would charge AA and AAA batteries without taking excessively long, and had individual charging slots.  This was one of the few available models that fit all of those requirements, but I was initially a bit hesitant because I didn't recognize the brand and there weren't many reviews.

"The Vanguard Alta Pro line is extremely versatile.  If you do any macro work, the tilting center column that can be positioned at just about any angle is a great idea.  While other horizontal column tripods can have their columns tilted at an angle other than flat by adjusting the other leg angles or lengths, the Vanguard makes it trivial to adjust exactly how you want it, without needing to reposition the tripod.  Tilting the column is as easy as extending it all the way, pushing a small button release on the bottom to pull it up past the point where the legs meet, and then sliding a lever to unlock the tilt clamp.  The design is definitely one of the more innovative ones out there.The tripod is also notably less expensive than its counterparts from more premium brands like Manfrotto, Induro, or Gitzo.  For less than the cost of the tripod alone from one of those manufacturers, the Vanguard includes a solid head and a bag (which admittedly may not be padded but at least it is included).  The quality of the tripod is nothing to sniff at though.  Nothing felt cheap or loose on it, and I had no issues with any of the releases or clamps.That said, while this is carbon fiber, and it is lightweight compared to similarly sized aluminum tripods (like the aluminum version of this tripod or the Manfrotto 055), it would still be a stretch to call it lightweight or portable.  The 4 leg sections help without really impacting stability, but if you're looking at carbon fiber with the idea of carrying it around, and you can sacrifice a bit of stability, then you might want to consider a backpacking tripod with legs that fold up over the head, such as the 3 Legged Thing Punks.In the end, I returned this.  I was able to pick up a Manfrotto 055XPROB in aluminum at the end of its model life (Manfrotto has a new version of the 055 out now) for significantly less than the Vanguard.  To be fair, the Manfrotto in question is MUCH heavier, doesn't collapse as small, the column only tilts to horizontal or vertical, and it didn't include a head (though I don't need one).  But the Vanguard was already bigger than I wanted to carry anyways (so the weight difference isn't a big deal), and I was able to use the money I saved to buy the previously mentioned 3 Legged Thing Punks Vyv, which folds to about 12"" and weighs less than 3 lbs with the head.Still, if you want a solid tripod with great macro capabilities, then you can't go wrong with the Vanguard Alta Pro.  If money were no object, I would have kept it (instead of getting the cheaper aluminum Manfrotto) and the 3LT Punks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BK5BRXJGZBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SRCZN8#wasThisHelpful","R33BK5BRXJGZBR","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present.  I'd initially purchased the Picnic at Ascot Cheshire basket.  However, after looking at the other pieces I wanted to include in it, I realized I needed a basket with a little bit more room.  Like the other basket, the Picnic Time basket is excellently crafted and quite attractive.  The basket is large (read the dimensions) and heavy, but if this is the ambiance you're going for, then this basket will fit the bill quite nicely.  Just don't expect to take it on a hike - if that's what you're looking for, there are several alternatives in backpack form.Compared to the basket from Picnic at Ascot Cheshire basket, the Picnic Time basket is a bit roomier inside and I prefer the Picnic Time's lid with the rim of the basket that seats inside of the lid when it closes.  That said, I did like the appearance of the wicker on the Picnic at Ascot Cheshire basket batter - but that's fairly subjective and a matter of preference.  Both pieces have silverware that's a bit substandard - which is the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  At this price they could include nicer looking flatware.  I also feel like a basket which will be toted around (even if not very far) would be better served by polycarbonate glasses and melamine plates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVFL1KG1ZD2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017ZB0R4#wasThisHelpful","RMVFL1KG1ZD2A","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.  It was pricier than some of the competition, but the workmanship is excellent, and the basket is attractive.  It is a touch heavy, but a basket like this is more about the ambiance and feeling it lends to the picnic.  If you're trekking 2 miles over uneven terrain, this wouldn't be the basket you'd choose.  It is worth taking a close look at the stated dimensions though and evaluating if that's the size of basket you're looking for.  If you want something more portable, they make some picnic backpacks that might be a better fit.  For what we wanted though (a basket for Shakespeare in the park, botanic gardens, etc...) this is perfect.4 stars out of 5 though for the included pieces.  The silverware is ok, but at this price they could definitely do with pieces that look a little less cheap.  I considered replacing them with a different set.  While Picnic at Ascot is not alone in this, I also tend to feel like picnic baskets would be better suited with acrylic or polycarbonate stemware and melamine plates.  I believe they do go that route for their backpack based picnic sets.  Nothing was broken, but if you're going to tote this around (or in our case potentially strap it onto a rack on a bike) it seems like a more durable material might be a better choice.

"Great digital picture frame for the price (really for any price).  The image is clean, bright, and saturated.  The auto shut-off is handy, either to extend the life of the screen, or in a room like a bedroom where this would otherwise be way too bright (just don't put it someplace where rolling over in bed will turn it back on).Also appreciate it being able to do random order for the slideshow.  However, the random order playback is also where I've encountered two deficiencies.  It isn't like an MP3 player's shuffle - it picks the pictures at random, but doesn't ensure every picture is shown once before it repeats.  If you've got a couple hundred photos on it, you will notice it occasionally displaying the same photo as not long before.  It also doesn't remember the order of the displayed photos, so if one pops up that you want to point out to someone who missed it, hitting reverse doesn't pull it back up.Regardless, I am very satisfied with the frame.

These have the more common, and not as attractive, fake plastic flame - which looks fine when lit, but is not as nice if you're leaving these out on a table.Still, they're a good value, flicker nicely, and look good with the wax - I have no problem justifying 4 stars for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRNSF6Y9WTDT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUTSX4A#wasThisHelpful","RRNSF6Y9WTDT9","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was also a bit of a defect in the print of the pattern on one of the two plates I purchased (which almost like a thin line or run), but it's relatively small and not very objectionable.  Together those are sufficient for me to give the plates 4 stars instead of 5, especially given the price (two of these cost more than four of some other plates I purchased to go with them), but on the whole I'm happy with them, and she loves the splash of color and pattern they add to what I picked out (using them either as a standalone plate, or as a charger for some of the smaller plates I included with the basket).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1QA9SPSLZ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OKD5DK#wasThisHelpful","R3H1QA9SPSLZ67","A39GJJT0H2BZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39GJJT0H2BZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I suppose you get what you pay for.  While this is a serviceable tripod, compared to its more expensive brethren, it is definitely lacking.  Stability of the base does not compare to higher end Manfrotto, Giotto's, Benro, or others.  The head is functional, but there's no way I'd expect to put anywhere near the 15lbs on it that the description here states it is rated for (perhaps if you used it landscape only, with little elevation, and ensured the center of gravity was over the head) - it might hold it, but doesn't feel like it would be very secure.  The latches on the legs also feel cheap compared to the more expensive tripods I've worked with.That said... The tripod with head is less expensive than you'd pay for a decent head alone from a more expensive brand, and about a third of what you'd pay for another head and tripod.

"There's nothing like hanging out at the airport, watching your iPad's warning your battery is at 5% as you play your favorite game or surf the net using free wifi to banish the mind-numbing wait for your flight to board and every outlet in sight has a crowd huddled around them with their electronics tethered to them. I hate that. Well, with this little pack, not only will you be set to power up your iPad, and your cell phone, but your laptop (if your power cord is compatible, since it's made for HP) as well, all at the same time. Sweet.When I first plugged the battery into the charger, two lights lit up, indicating it had half a charge. There are four little lights total, each indicating 25%. One light=25% charge, Two lights=50%, Three lights=75% and Four=100%. It only took a few hours to fully charge the battery. Once it was finished, I tried connecting my iPad and cell phone to it. Both devices indicated they were charging and I let them stay tethered until they were fully charged. There was still 75% of the charge left, so not too shabby.The bag the battery comes in is super handy. It's great to shove all you necessary cables in it so everything is all nice and neat and ready for when you need it. It's not too heavy to tote around, about 2 1/2 lbs. This no doubt will come in handy at the airport, on a car trip or anywhere you find yourself with a drained battery and no power source to charge your device with. Just don't forget to charge the battery before you leave the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CFR5Y7G9R17J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016EWK5LQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CFR5Y7G9R17J","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're big fans of Gravity Falls at our house, so we were super excited to get The Legend of Gnome Gemulets 3DS game. This isn't an arcade game, which isn't my favorite type of game anyway. This is a quest game, with finding objects for Gruncle Stan through many of the familiar Gravity Falls areas such as the Mystery Shack and the Gravity Falls forest.What I like:-Very nice graphics-you can play as Dipper or Mabel-The music is mainly light and whimsical, keeping in line with the series-The dialogue is humorous, again keeping in line with the seriesWhat I don't like:-Too short, easy to win (about 3 hours)-No voice over dialogue from the much loved voice actors, all of the dialogue is in speech bubbles-The boss you must beat a through the game is a variation of the same creatureThis is a must have for Gravity Falls fans, but the regular consumer that doesn't follow the series might be disappointed, except for maybe a younger player. But because of all the written dialogue, the younger player needs to be a strong reader. Because this has such a strong underground type fan base, this game has the potential to turn into a collector's item. Because I adore Gravity Falls, I'll probably play it again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. This might night be the case for every player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYONCDVTYXNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01180EA2E#wasThisHelpful","R3OYONCDVTYXNE","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't like to cook, mainly because of all the cleaning up. Put this little scale really helps keep you from having to lug out different bowls, measuring cups and measuring spoons. When I got the scale I was surprised how compact and unobtrusive it was. It's just a small, round white base with a silicone top. After I downloaded the ""Drop"" app from iTunes, I chose a recipe and followed the steps. It was pretty easy. I chose to bake banana muffins. Each time I added an ingredient, it told me when to stop. No measuring. Nice. The scale and your phone/iPad are connected via Bluetooth and the scale tells you what ingredients to add as you go along. The fact that they're added by weight means you have less of a chance of messing up your recipe.You can also to make larger servings, and it readjusts for you. It even acts as a timer so you know when to pull those cookies out of the oven. That's pretty cool. Another nice feature is if you're not sure if you have enough of one ingredient (say flour), you can weigh the flour and rescale the entire recipe by tapping a button.There are three reasons I didn't give this five stars. One, it's not compatible with iPad 2 (boo hiss). I had to use my son's iPhone 5, which is difficult to read on such a small screen. I'll be using it when I get a new use iPad for Christmas. Second, I'm not an iSnob, so I also have a Galaxy Note.  The Drop Kitchen company should have considered giving the scale the ability to link up to Android phone/tablets as well. Third, it doesn't have a small screen to use as a regular scale. You have to view the measurement with an iPhone or iPad. Come on, Drop Kitchen Scale makers, for the money, there should be a little screen that allows non-tech Grandma to be able to use this scale in the kitchen when she wants to whip up a special treat for the grandkids. Also, for the cost, they should have thrown in a little matching iPad stand like they have on one of the Amazon pictures. But, I just use a wire book display I bought for like a buck at a library sale. It works great.

"The ZAGG Limitless has replaced my Toshiba Satellite keyboard, which drives me crazy (I'm using it now). Although I love my little Toshiba laptop and it's really long battery life. But the keyboard is the pits. I suppose to save money, Toshiba designed their keyboard with very shallow keys. It's so hard to use  for anything other than typing in a few words in a search engine. The ZAGG paired up nicely and without any problems with both my Toshiba Windows Laptop and my Ipad 2. You can pair the keyboard with up to three devices.The keys are responsive, clicking appropriately and with enough depth so I don't have to keep rehitting keys to make them respond. The backlighting is very hand when the room is dim or the lights are out completely. The light shines from around the keys and through the actual characters, which are opaque. The one problem I had with the keyboard is not how the keyboard functions, but on the lack of instructions. The keyboard only came with a very simplistic quick start guide.There was nothing about how to charge the keyboard, how long it holds a charge and how to make the backlighting work. I couldn't even find anything on the ZAGG website.Well, I figured it out. First the keyboard needs a good charge. I discovered that once you plug the charger in, there is a small light on the upper right hand side that turns red for low charge and green for a full charge. Once it's charged properly, you push FN and < simultaneously to turn the backlight on/off/brighter/dimmer and FN and > to change the color. The variety of colors is kind of cool: white, blue, turquoise, green, yellow, red and purple. I like the turquoise color. It can, of course, be turned off completely to extend the battery. From what I've managed to find, the battery last 3 months. That's pretty impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBBUD26OUBS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016QO5N1O#wasThisHelpful","ROBBUD26OUBS4","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son's iPhone 5 was no longer holding a charge for more than seven hours. I ordered this kit because of the high ratings and the warranty. The kit came quickly. The tools were all high quality, except for the suction cup. The suction cup was useless. Luckily, I had some inexpensive suction cups for Christmas window decorations. The spudger and the tweezers were indispensable and really helped get that pesky screen off. Also, youtube videos really helped with understanding what to do. The hardest parts were getting the screen off (spudger took care of that) and getting the battery that is doubled taped to the case (pry up with the tweezers). Once the entire process was complete, I charged the battery and it held a complete charge for fourteen hours with lots of game and video playing.

"This puzzle is heavily constructed with large puzzle pieces for small hands. I work with special needs students, and one boy in particular with autism loves puzzles. He jumped right in when I handed the box to him and seemed to enjoy the puzzle's challenging colors (the colors are repeated throughout the puzzle, making it slightly more difficult). It was challenging enough to be fun without too challenging to be frustrating. With 25 pieces, I'll have to move onto more difficult puzzles for him, but some of the other less able children enjoyed the puzzle with some help. The finished image appealed to both the boys and girls. The boys liked the construction scene, while the girls seemed to enjoy the animals driving the vehicles.

"I have a bathroom that is super cold in the winter. I usually use two inexpensive space heaters to heat the room when I shower (of course, I always keep the heaters far away from water sources). This usually takes 12-15 minutes. The Vornado heated the room in 7 minutes. Not too bad considering I didn't have to drag out two heaters.Features:-Carrying handle-Thermostat that is in the form of a dial-Power indicator button-High heat (1500 watts) /low heat button (750 watts)-Cord wrapping enclosure on the button (brilliant!)-Easy on/off button-Safety bottom that turns the heater off if it tips over. It works very well.The heater itself is very easy to use. There are not even any written words, just visual indicators to set things where you want it. Once the room reaches the level set, it cycles off and on to keep the ambient temperature at the correct setting. It's a bit pricey, but it heats a large room better than a space heater since it acts as an air circulator. I've bought $15 space heaters at least 3 times in the last 5 years after they died. So in the long run, this does a better job at keeping a whole room warm for a bit more in price. But, I'm sure it will last longer than the 5-year warranty, so it may actually be cheaper over an expanse of years. I have 3 Vornado Vortex fans that are still in excellent condition after daily use (My family all sleep with fans on) over 10 years. Vornado is always a solid choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2623FH1LDGA3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVIPVHU#wasThisHelpful","R2623FH1LDGA3N","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both my dogs adored this kibble. I mixed it with their regular food (which is high quality, no corn), and they pushed the other food around to get tho the Eukanuba nuggets. They had no digestive problems with the food and they get excited when I open the bag. So two paws up for Eukanuba Excel Adult Dog Food with Lamb. However, taste isn't the entire story.Dog Food Advisor gave it 3/5: The dashboard displays a dry matter protein reading of 26%, a fat level of 16% and estimated carbohydrates of about 51%. As a group, the brand features an average protein content of 26% and a mean fat level of 14%. Together, these figures suggest a carbohydrate content of 52% for the overall product line. And a fat-to-protein ratio of about 56%. Near-average protein. Below-average fat. And above-average carbs when compared to a typical dry dog food. Even when you consider the protein-boosting effect of the flax meal and brewers yeast, this looks like the profile of a kibble containing just a moderate amount of meat.The kibble is considered moderate in meat because although lamb is a quality item, raw lamb contains about 80% water. After cooking, most of that moisture is lost, reducing the meat content to just a fraction of its original weight.So, Eukanuba Excel might be palatable to my dogs, but it still doesn't beat Kirkland Brand that I usually feed them, which gets 4/5 stars on Dog Food Advisor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OWK00MU7OZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRE5AHE#wasThisHelpful","R20OWK00MU7OZV","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very comfortable bras, but you should know their limitations.What I like:-Almost all seamless, with only stitching at the shoulders. Seams are evil as far as I'm concerned because they can itch like crazy.-Double thickness. This helps keep things up (within reason, this isn't a push up bra)-No wires. Yay! No wires to poke me. This of, of course, means the bra will ride up a bit and you won't have that extra support many woman want from wires. So, it's a personal preference.-Comfortable hooks in back. The large has 3 hooks, the medium has 2. They don't scratch or dig like the hooks on other bras I've worn.-Color. The flesh color works well under tshirts.-Soft and silky. No chaffing against sensitive skin.What I don't like:-Snug, They run small for their size.  They do stretch, but the 29 inch band on the large would probably be more comfortable on someone who wears a 36. I wear a 38 and the large was too snug for my tastes. The 27 inch band on the medium would probably fit someone who wears a 34.-No padding. I'm not a big fan of tons of padding, but I do want just a bit to keep nipples from screaming, ""Look at me.""Overall, I love these bras. But, you have to be aware of the fact that they run small, there is no padding and they are not going to give support to large busted women. I run B/C and I'm pretty comfortable with the support they give. The look they provide is a natural profile. Your girls are not going to be cupped and boosted like you're wearing a push up bra. But on the other hand, you won't feel like you're wearing a push up bra, which is a suffering trial I don't wish on any woman. These are so comfortable, you won't mind wearing one all day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGB42M3EDVJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCOL09U#wasThisHelpful","R1EGB42M3EDVJH","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read some of Heather Brewer's work in the form of the Vladimir Chronicles. She's an accomplished writer with well paced novels. The Cemetery Boys leaves me with mixed emotions.What I liked: Atmosphere--the writing leans towards a Stephen King feel. There is no doubt Heather was looking for that ""Children of the Corn"" small town weirdness and she found it successfully. I can see King influences in the writing, and that's not a bad thing. The pacing went fairly well, the story pulled me in, but it was the atmosphere that Heather did a really outstanding job. She created a small creepy town with we-have-a-secret-from-outsiders feel that works very well in the horror genre.Cara and Stephen's relationship-it was sweet and I could relate to the two grasping onto each other in a world that has left them with emotional scars. Despite Stephen's insta-love (which really is more infatuation, and very much the teen way of doing things), the relationship progressed realistically and made for a believable connection.Their encounters were endearingly clumsy and awkward as one would expect with young love.What I didn't like: Stephen as a character- Stephen spent so much time whining about himself and his predicament without much thought for his suffering father that I had a hard time connecting with the character. Throughout the book he was contemptuous of everything and everyone (except his insta-love girlfriend, Cara). I really wished Stephen had been a little more empathetic to his father and mother. I realize teens can be resentful and hostile when displaced, but this is a book and not real life. The main character needs me to root for him, which means showing personality traits worth connecting with way before the end of the book. I actually felt more empathy and interest towards the dad and another character, Marcus.The presentation of the town-I wish Stephen had been more of  an interested observer in the ways of the small town people rather than a cynical, judgemental teen. This put the distrust and dislike of the town immediately on the table and didn't allow it to unfold bit by bit to add to the suspense. If the town's people had been more endearing, quirky and appearingly good-natured, it would have made for a more satisfying reveal. Think of the comedy Hot Fuzz. That reveal was so delightful because of the juxtaposed appearance of the villagers with the reality.The ending-I can't deny I was glued to the last 25 pages. I really wanting to see what happened. Unfortunately what promised to be an exciting, pulse-pounding, monster-revealing conclusion, ended up being nothing like my expectations. I was actually crushed at how let down I was by the ending. The one thing I, as a reader, was waiting for, never happened, instead I was given an anti-climatic, monster and a disappointing, no closure,  rushed ending. It was enough to consider giving the book three stars, but the atmospheric writing balanced it out to four.Overall, the book was a quick, enjoyable read. There was some cursing, but not gratuitously so and mild sexual scenes. Nothing that raised my eyebrows. The premise and the writing style had the potential to make for a wonderful story, unfortunately the execution just missed it. Well worth the read, just be aware the ending may leave you wanting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHZ6U6ZOWH9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062307886#wasThisHelpful","R1JHZ6U6ZOWH9W","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great dish towels. Not only is the color (I have the wine colored ones) and pattern attractive in the kitchen, they do a great job wiping counters, cleaning glassware, washing windows, washing the car, cleaning eyeglasses, dusting and wiping spills. They are the size of a regular dish towel, which makes them even more versatile. And at about $2 a piece, that's a pretty good deal.Things to know:-from what I understand, the microfiber towels use static to collect dust and lint, so you are not supposed to use fabric softener or dryer sheets. And since they cling to other items in the dryer like a leeches, you may have to play hide and seek to find them all if you put them in a large load of laundry.-if they come in contact with items like wood shavings (thanks to my husband taking them into the garage) or leaves (thanks to my son taking one outside), it's a pain to get those things off.

"At less than $2.33 a piece, these hand soaps are a pretty good value. Each has a pump and is a little over 10 ounces. The soap lathers well enough, but the fragrance on your hands doesn't last incredibly long. The glycerine does leaves my hands feeling soft, so that's nice.Almond Extract- orange colored, mild, clean soapy smell reminiscent of Ivory soap, with a tiny hint of almond fragrance.Olive Oil- green colored, again, mild soapy smell, hints of olive oil fragrance that is stronger than the almond fragrance in the almond extract soap.Blueberry- lavender colored, a bit too candy smelling for me,no real blueberry fragrance, but overall not off putting.Cherry Blossom- light pink colored, most artificial smell out of the bunch, sort of cherry cough syrup smelling, most disappointing fragrance of the group.Cherry Pie- darker pink, lovely cherry fragrance, neither too heavy or light. They got this one right.Mango Ice Cream- pearl white, delicious, scrumptious mango fragrance with a light undertone of cream. The best out of the bunch. Mango Ice Cream could rival hand soap you get at Bath and Body Works.Overall these soaps do what they need to, clean your hands and leave them soft. Some fragrances are better than others. For a bit over $2 a piece, don't expect expensive smelling soaps like Yardley of London (which is about $6 for 8 oz on Amazon at the time of this review). This is a nice sample pack to try. It's good to know that the Mango Ice Cream soap sells as a bar soap and as a pack of 12, 10 oz bottles here on Amazon.

"I've had some yellow spots on my large toe toenail. After trying many products, some of which I bought on Amazon, I saw little improvement in the color or thickness of the nail. I didn't have high hopes on Probelle, but much to my surprise, after a couple of weeks of using the Probelle product, the nail color almost looks normal, with the yellow fading. The nail thickness also doesn't seem to be increasing. I did file down the nail to allow the Probelle to absorb properly, so I'm sure that helps. If you use this product, I highly recommend you buy a pack of 24 emory boards and just toss each on after every use. They are fairly inexpensive, so it's no big deal. The Probelle liquid goes on pretty easily with a dropper. It takes about 10 min. to dry, and they you're good to go. There's no smell, it doesn't really feel greasy and the bottle is huge compared to the tiny 10 ounce bottles you get with other products.This is working so well, I might chuck the prescription bottle of medication that gets painted on and stick to the Probelle.*Update It didn't completely get rid of the fungus like I hoped, so I bought a Salon Edge Nail Light. Stuck my toes in it once a day for 5-30 min. depending on what I was doing on the computer. And all my nails grew back healthy and pink.

"I'm a fan of some mineral powder products, others not so much. Some seem to get into the lines of your face and just sit there, emphasizing age. Others (mainly eye shadows and blushes) do a pretty good job of lightly sitting on the skin, adding color without emphasizing the lines. Scott-Vincent's ended up being one of the later. Trying it as foundation was no good for me. The white powder added when you turn the dial (boy that took me a while to figure out) makes it too light for my complexion and trying to scoop up the darker powder without the white powder was just too much of a hassle. So, I mixed up the two colors and tried it as a finishing powder. This seemed to work fairly well. The powder went on smoothly, but at times the white powder left my face splotchy with white puffs, even when I mixed it well in the compact.  It think they should redo the powder colors so one is just a light cream color and not white.Overall the powder performed well, lasting as long as my usual $10 mineral finishing powder, so no complaints there. I only put it on once in the morning. I have dry skin, so my face doesn't require reapplying of powder since there is no shine and it doesn't wear away. I didn't notice my skin looking anymore youthful and unlined than usual, but I didn't use it as a foundation, so that might of made a difference. I didn't use the mask, either there wasn't one in my package or I missed it and threw it away. I wouldn't have used it anyway. It just seems plain silly and reminds me of a creepy skin mask from Silence of the Lambs. The brush is really nice and soft, two thumbs up for the brush. It is rather small and narrow, giving you more control I suppose. Overall this was a nice foundation/finishing powder, but the price, ouch. I'm on a teacher's salary. This was fun to try, but paying almost $80 for foundation just isn't going to happen in my household. Hello L'Oreal and Mary Kay foundations, good to see again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMX7IL7HKL1T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH8YXTQ#wasThisHelpful","RMX7IL7HKL1T4","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me some colognes are like garlic to a vampire--makes my nose burn, makes me sneeze, gives me a headache and sends me fleeing. Axe is one of the worst offenders. So when I sprayed this on my husband I was pleasantly surprised. The scent was lingering, yet subtle enough for me not to recoil. In fact it was pleasant enough for me to want to bury my nose into his neck (he found this amusing). The top notes are a woodsy botanical, without being too feminine and floral, The middle notes add a bit of spice without being too sharp and the base is a rich, deep, mellow fragrance with a touch of musk. But not enough musk to turn me off. I'm a fan of musk to a point and then it just starts to smell too much like a gamey ferret. Overall I thought this scent was a nice combination that worked well with my husband's chemistry. The bottle was a fair size for the price. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YC1KSI57PMY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWXJQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1YC1KSI57PMY0","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's working, After  a week, I'm seeing some small little bits of green budding up. The area I put it in has daylight about four hours a day and then goes into shade. Before I put the seeds down, I raked the area of all debris, pulled up any dead grass that would block the way of the seeds hitting the soul, prepared the soul with a rolling spiky thing (not very technical, I know), put the grass seeds down with a spreader and then put some fertilized dirt on top. I also watered it a couple of times a day.The blue coloring in the seed was a nice feature, I was able to see where I was adding it and how thick each coating was.Now, I'm just waiting to see how strong the grass is. The last time I tried this the grass I bought popped up green and lovely with little effort. However, it was like chia seeds--sprouted anywhere you laid a seed, greened up nicely for about a week, grew thin and tall and all died when it was mowed. I think it was for a short term solution and was meant to grow quickly and hold up only as long as it took to sell your house or some such special event. Hopefully this will take hold and last through our blistering San Antonio summers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BS8LMR59Z5PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002FZAV2#wasThisHelpful","R3BS8LMR59Z5PO","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a DIY kind of person, including replacing toilets. When we put tile flooring in all our bathrooms we replaced the wax ring. This led to leaks. After replacing the wax ring with a thicker kind, the leaks seemed to stop. But after a few months the old problem came up again. Replacing wax rings just isn't as easy as it looks on youtube. I'm not sure if it was due to the tile creating an uneven floor or because part of the pipe was now slightly below the tile, but I guess I stink at replacing the wax seal ring on toilets. So, thinking maybe we needed an upgrade in toilets, we recently replaced our toilets with cool-looking modern, stream-lined toilets.The same leak happened again on one toilet. Sigh. This time I decided to go with the industrial-looking Perfect Seal. Success! It was very easy to install, met up with the pipe with no problem and no leaks. I had help, but only because I needed my husband to do the heavy lifting since the toilet is one piece. But really it was an easy installation. There are several videos on youtube to help you out and give you an idea of what to do. So that's always nice. I'm ordered two more to replace the other wax seals just to be safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIWKKWDINMQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHSLV2G#wasThisHelpful","R3SIWKKWDINMQ8","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To quote a Pysch episode, are you a fan of delicious flavor? Then buy this. I love smoked foods, but I have neither the time nor the skill to smoke like the professionals. I bought a Brinkman bullet smoker hoping it would give me the smokey food of my dreams. It was not to be. So, hoping to stop giving the local smoked meat restaurant wads of my cash, I continued my search. and it led me to the Oster Smoker Roaster. I received it last week within days of ordering (I have Prime). I bought a chicken and ribs, put water on the bottom of the pan, stuck both meats in (no rubs or anything) loaded the side cups with hickory chips, put it on the patio, set it at 220 and plugged it in (the cord is really short, so an orange extension cord is a must). Oh my gosh! Best ribs and chicken EVER! The chicken was succulent, falling off the bone and oh so smokey-flavored. The ribs were just as tender and the hickory flavor was spectacular. It took about 2 1/2 hours for both meats to be done. I added extra chips about half-way. Towards the end, I lowered the temp and let everything smoke another thirty minutes or so. I may never barbecue again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0YV0GVS03G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBKTS2#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0YV0GVS03G","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This comes in handy when you're crammed under the kitchen sink in a tight spot while replacing the stupid leaking faucet and trying to use a flashlight that points anywhere but where you need it. Unfortunatly I didn't have this light when I actually did replace the faucet, but now I can see how the potential is huge. I did, however, need to check for leaks on said replaced faucet and the streamlight worked wonderfully. It directed the light where I need it and shined bright enough to look for any leaks (none, thank goodness). Charging it was straight forward. Take the bottom cover off, push the little metal recharging thing sticking out into the provided ac wall adapter and plug the adapter in. You can also charge it with your computer via a usb prot, although I'm not sure if I'll ever use that feature. The bulb is LED and it is pretty bright on high (70 lumens). There is also a low setting (10 lumens). The battery life states 3.5 hour and 24 hours, respecively.. I haven't tested it since I use the light only on occasion. It is very light weight, so it doesn't weigh my hat down when wearing it. I'm not sure what the red light is for, but it works.

"This is not for every parent. Either they like these funny little dolls or they are offended by them. If you're like me and get a kick out of these ""emo"" dolls, then by all means get them for your kid.I hope they find them as adorable as I do. If there was a hip, modern day Tuesday Adams, this is what she would look like.Cleo de Nile and Howleen Wolf are of course, fashionably adorable. Cleo wears a cute, striped, one-shouldered dress with little ruffle on the sleeve and a purple necklace. Her platform shoes are gold, gladiator style, sandles. And like all the dolls, her arms and wrists are jointed so you can actually bend them (try that with Barbie). Howleen is rocking a mini-skirt outfit with bold colors and cat's claws on the blouse. She also sports a pink bracelet and pink wedge booties. Two dog ears sprout from her pink and blue cotton-candy colored hair, with one drooping at an adorable angle.The cafeteria features a lunch counter with decorative pink ooze and assorted foods to choose from. There is also a table and stools with decrotive spider webbing and claw feet. The table is coffin-shaped and the stools are pink spider webs. You gotta love the guillotine sandwhich chopper. It's such a fun and crazy addition. And the coffin trays! Oh my gosh, I almost didn't want to hand this over to my seven year-old niece. But once she saw it, it was a done deal.

Although he thought it was pretty cool for a kid toy, he soon lost interest. But to be fair, his phone does just about everything the smartwatch does.What I like:-Touch screen that is intuitive for little ones-Takes pictures and video-Voice recorder w/ 5 fun voice changing modes-Sturdy and splash-proof-Analog and digital watch with 50 different faces (great for learning how to tell time)-Stopwatch, alarm clock and timer-Can put special effects on the pictures-Uploads pictures and video via USB-Can hold up to 800 pictures-Pictures are a nice universal jpeg (640X480)-You can download more cames from VTech-Recharges via USB cord-Charge lasts all day (varies depending on game and video usage)-Four games included (the time telling game seems to be the most useful)What I don't like:-A bit bulky. But this is so minor, it's really a non-issue.-128 mb memory. Get with it VTech. That's only enough for 6 one minute videos.

"My son LOVES Transformers. When he pulled  this out of the box there was a definite wow factor.  No, it's not your typical transformer toy that takes an engineer to transform the thing and back again. What you do get is a huge bad-a dinosaur whose eyes light up, makes awesome sounds, carries a smaller Optimus Prime on it's back and pops up into a fierce-looking Transformer with the push of a lever. But wait, there's more! His tail pops off and becomes a sword. A sword!And  the Stomp and Chomp Grimlock figure recognizes whether the figure on its back is an Autobot or Decepticon character and will activate different lights, sounds, and weapons depending on which side you choose. But seriously, who would choose to be a Decepticon? You can also choose the more boring, yet inexpensive method of activating lights and sounds by pushing down on the handle, or press the button hidden in the dino's jaws. But that doesn't stop you from wanting to run out and get more figures to try the other way.  Well played, Transformer Toy maker, well played.Overall my son was well pleased with this toy. The giant Lego  replica of The Pirates of the Caribbean Black Pearl was rudely pushed aside to make way for Grimlock who is now proudly displayed in a prominent area of his room.

Caught in this struggle is Paige's love interest, Logan, her best friend, Dotty and Logan's friend, Ajax (my favorite character. He's a hoot).I really like Cara Shultz's writing style. She has a great world building talent and fleshes out her character's well. Paige is tough, but with a vurnerable side and Logan is a real gentleman. They complement each other well and the romance doesn't seemed forced. There is plenty of demon fighting adventures and good amount suspense. What I really liked, was Paige's snarkiness and all around run attitude even in the face of danger. I particualry the two friends of the main characters, Dottie and Ajax. The interactions with these two put demons and ghosts in a whole new light.The ending is satisfying, leaving room for the next book, which I am anxiously waiting for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PSWJ5J1ZSRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211201#wasThisHelpful","R27PSWJ5J1ZSRB","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this for a small residential pond. Initially after pouring the enzymes in, the water stunk to high heaven. I suppose the algea ws being eaten away. The water appeared clearer a few days laer, but there is still a slight brown murkiness.This may be my fault since I wasn't 100% sure on the math. I'm going to add more to see if the murkiness disappears. There is no green algea, so in that respect ths is a fine product. Warning: the container is very heavy and in liquid form. Be careful when poring it out. As I was pouring it out, a small bit splashed up into my eyes. It didn't sting, but I flushed my eye out immediatly. There is a 1-800 number on the side in case of chemical emergancies. Luckily there was no damage. You might want to wear saftey goggles until the container is light enough to handle with control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZRH8HXNKIAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3YJ2V4#wasThisHelpful","R2FZRH8HXNKIAQ","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iams Healthy Naturals Weight Management boasts lower fat in order to keep your dog's weight down. However, it also has lower amounts meat, a dog food's main usable food ingredient. Instead of chicken, the main ingredient is sorghum. Sorghum is a starchy cereal grain with a nutrient profile similar to corn. Iams could keep the fat lower by simply leaving out some of added fat, which is added to all dog foods. Instead they make it appear fat is lowered by putting in less meat. Considering the meat is already dehydrated before it is cooked into the kibble, thus rendering most of the fat out, all they are doing is compromising the quality of the kibble. My dogs ate this without any problem, but a good quality kibble with meat as your number one ingredient and less corn and sorghum will provide more nutrients and less junk food, keeping your dog's weight down without a compromise to health.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SM869R9MI1RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY9UT3S#wasThisHelpful","R1SM869R9MI1RG","A3V55DVYU80LDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V55DVYU80LDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great set of tools with the best channel-lock pliers on the market.  The tool assortment is perfect for a great assortment of jobs, and the case makes it very convenient to be sure that you have all the needed tools with you.  The grips on the tools are very comfortable and the fit of the tools in general is very nice.If I could change anything about this set, I would change the case to include a flap to fold over the top of the tools.  As it stands, the tools will fall out of the case if you carry it with the open end down.  I accidentally did that just tonight, in fact.  I have other multi-sets of things such as files and things of that nature that have a flexible case like this, but there is a flap that folds over the top to keep items from falling out.

"This is a great idea that could have been executed better.  I understand the need to make the product affordable, but the fact remains that making something less expensive also (often times) makes them less durable.  The plastic construction of the chopping handle (for lack of a better word) allows it to flex and thus puts extra stress on some areas.  My wife and I chopped an onion on the device and it worked well.  You have to cut the onion in half and you have to use a decent amount of force to push the onion through the blades, but it works.  While it works, the handle will flex, thus putting extra strain on part of the hinge.  With the hinge and the handle both made of plastic, it is only a matter of time before this breaks.The grater attachment works for small jobs, but I will stick to our food processor for grating cheese, or for grating much of anything.  The mandoline slicer works nicely as well, and it has a constantly-variable depth adjustment that allows you to get very thin slices if you choose.  I really like the mandoline part of this unit, but it won't replace our better mandoline.  With this said, you will be very satisfied with this if you don't already have a slicer.In addition to chopping onions and trying to grate cheese, we tried to dice a tomato.  Strangely enough, it worked quite well.  The only problem is that it shot juice out the front.  We put a paper towel around the front and chopped tomatoes very successfully.  It would work better for this if the blades were sharper, but it does work.If I could change anything about this unit I would make the top out of metal instead of plastic.  I do not feel that this will last very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HHMWB6E1PWO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXKQQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HHMWB6E1PWO8","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 11:37 Mins I have tried to get a good result with this scanner and have been unsuccessful.  The unit does work, but it is just a real pain to get a good result.  You can scan in a side-to-side and back-and-forth manner and the software will tell you if you need to reposition the scanner.  All you do is put it over previously-scanned areas of the document and it figures out where it is.  This works, but not that well.  The software needs a lot of work.  My wife and I have tried scanning a lot of things and we are just not satisfied with the performance, as it does NOT perform like it does in the videos the manufacturer puts up for view.  Perhaps they are using a dedicated computer that is only running the scanner, but that is not the situation people will have when using this.The software is sluggish and will not launch automatically when you press the scan button.  I have to go to the applications folder and launch the application, then it will respond.  There seems to be no resident program that makes it launch.  The software download was 501 MB, so it is not a small program.  The stitching function works at times, but fails a lot.  The text will get crooked, or pictures will be offset (this can be seen in the video I uploaded).  The software stutters, even when scanning very slowly.  I attempted to scan at higher speeds and the image gets choppy, so you need to scan at a slow-to-medium speed.The unit is slightly larger than a business card, and it is about 1"" thick, so women can keep this in their purse quite easily.I would recommend waiting for a major software update before buying this.  The idea is great, but the execution is poor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOG217DR112L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UHFJD2#wasThisHelpful","RJOG217DR112L","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This player works fine for my intended use.  This player works okay for playing movies in bed, but I wouldn't recommend it for your living room.  The picture is Blu-ray quality at times, and falters at other times.  The audio is the biggest concern, however, as it actually doesn't feed a good signal and will distort the audio at times.  This is with the audio set to bitstream to the receiver.This doesn't make a huge difference to me in the bedroom, as I just set it to repeat and watch until I go to sleep, but it would be a deal breaker anywhere else.  This player DOES have a title repeat function, unlike some others out there, so you can set it to repeat a movie over and over.  This is good for those of us who are incapable of sleeping without noise, or for those who need a player to loop movies in a business environment.The player is extremely small and the remote is even smaller.

"This is an attractive little microphone with a very good sound.  The microphone sounds excellent on vocals (at least for my voice), and it does a great job recording guitars.  I have a bunch of microphones and I am definitely in love with this one and would put it up against my AKGC414 without hesitation.  The AKG has multiple patterns, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, but the Baby Bottle sounds better to me.  I like it so much that I bought another one that should be arriving in a few days.  The AKG was my go-to microphone until I tried this one.When comparing to the Blue Bluebird, the Baby Bottle is better for my vocals, as it doesn't have the bump in the top end.  The Bluebird is nice for a lot of things, but the Baby Bottle works better for me when recording vocals and guitars.  From what I have been told by others, some prefer the Bluebird because it is more forgiving and it has a bump in the high end, so keep this in mind too, as the Bluebird is $100 less.The Blue Baby Bottle absolutely destroys my CAD Equitek E200.  The sensitivity is much better on the Blue, the sound has more character, and there is more warmth.  As with the AKG, the CAD is a multi-pattern microphone, so it is a different animal, but I greatly prefer the Blue.The Blue is a lot better than the MXL V67G, but it is also a lot higher level of microphone.  I don't hate the MXL, by the way, but the Blue is in a different class.  If you can afford the extra money, get the Bluebird or the Baby Bottle over any of the MXL microphones in the lower range.The Baby Bottle has a similar sound to the Blue e300 microphones I have, but it bests them easily.  To be fair, the e300 is a live and studio microphone, so it is far more versatile for people who want to use a microphone for live and recording.  The e300 is definitely a capable microphone, so I am not knocking it.THE BAD:The Baby Bottle is VERY prone to pops from ""P"" sounds and the pop filter does not help.  In fact, the pop filter is not very useful at all and I would recommend buying a separate pop screen, or, if you are so inclined, you can make your own with panty hose and a needlepoint hoop.  I like to get a bit closer to the microphone in order to get a better capture of the low-end spectrum of my voice, but the pop screen with the Baby Bottle doesn't work well enough to allow this.  The shock mount is good, but, once again, the ""P"" sounds can cause a resonance in the shock mount if you are close to the mic.  I have simply ditched the Blue pop screen, good looking though it is, in favor of my old standby.BOTTOM LINE: 4.5 stars.  HIGHLY recommended.  Keep in mind that many people might be happier with the Bluebird for $100 less, as it has a brighter sound.  I prefer the warmer sound of the Baby Bottle, but your mileage may vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MG4J0ON2W9OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RLF7HI#wasThisHelpful","R2MG4J0ON2W9OI","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am pleased with the performance of this hub.  I have other hubs that claim to provide quick-charge capabilities to devices that do not work properly.  When plugged in, these other devices provide low power.  For instance, plugging an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HDX into the high-speed port on the AmazonBasics 7 Port USB 3.0 Hub with 12V/3A power adapter and the Kindle invariably says that it is connected to a low-power source.  The same goes for Samsung Galaxy S5 phones, although they just charge extremely slowly.  I connected devices to this hub and they charge quickly, as they should, and the Kindle does not give me the message about a low-power source.The throughput on this device is also greater than the Amazon Basics hub, so it is a win for me, although it doesn't have many ports.  The small number of ports is likely the reason it can supply enough current to devices on the quick-charge ports, as it doesn't have to provide as much power to other devices.I definitely recommend this little hub if you don't need many ports.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMCM28ZVMTW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046TML4E#wasThisHelpful","R3AMCM28ZVMTW8","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The price is right, and the game is a lot of fun.  This is basically a tower-defense game with iconic cartoon characters.  You set up various kinds of defenses around the board (and there are a number of different boards), then try to keep waves of enemies from destroying your toy box.  You can take control of any of your emplacements at any time, and you can use heroes to do serious damage to enemies.  The overall concept is fresh, as it is not simply a tower-defense game, but something more.The one thing that keeps this from being a five-star game for me is the pay-to-upgrade option.  You can buy tokens to upgrade your soldiers, emplacements, etc.  I know that this makes extra money for developers, but I am not a fan of pay-to-win gaming.  Your mileage may vary and you might well find that this is a point that you like about the game, so this is simply my opinion.This edition comes with all the characters available, unlike the downloadable version where you have to buy a separate pack of characters.

"I will preface this by saying that I am not a professional electrician and I don't have a use for 3000 amp testing, nor could I test this unit with a 3000 amp source.  With this said, this tool allows you to use a standard meter to test 30, 300, and 3000 amp sources without blowing the fuse in your tester unit.  This is a great idea for electricians who already have a professional multimeter that doesn't accommodate higher amperages.  This probe definitely did what it is advertised to do, as I was able to use a 10 amp multimeter to test a 30 amp circuit (this is the highest amperage I had access to) without blowing the meter fuse.  The design of the probe is great, as you simply unscrew the right side of the probe, snake it around the cable run you are testing, then screw it back in.  You need to set the amperage on the unit to the expected amperage in order to measure properly.  The results are displayed on your meter.

This is a bit of a disappointment if you are into playing online, but won't matter for solo play.  The microphone retracts when not in use, so it stays out of the way.  This is a nice feature and it should help keep the mic safe.The battery seems to last about 12 - 13 hours, which is pretty decent.

Dennis Hopper does his usual incredible job as Feck, the drugged-out, insane murderer who supplies the kids with ""the Feck weed.""  His character actually manages to be sympathetic and full of sorrow.

Thompson-inspired character and he steals the show.  The interweaving of H.P. Lovecraft's ""From Beyond"" with the MK ULTRA experiments was perfect and it worked great.For a low-budget movie, this one delivered more than major motion pictures.By the way, the ""Lonely Traveler"" station that is featured in the movie is an actual unknown number station called ""Swedish Rhapsody"" in the community.  You can find actual recordings of that station on the internet if you search for ""Swedish Rhapsody Station"" or ""Conet Project.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11T9613RAGJG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB0OQ3U#wasThisHelpful","R11T9613RAGJG2","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is hard to go wrong with this disc if you like Grim Reaper.  The first two albums fit perfectly on one disc, and you WANT both of the first discs or you wouldn't be looking at this.  The audio quality is good, and the discs have not been remastered (also known as compressed to death) in order to make them louder.  This is a good thing as far as I am concerned, as the loudness war has done more to destroy the integrity of recordings than anything.If I have any complaint at all (which I really don't), I would have made the cover where it had the full cover of ""See You in Hell"" on one side and the entire cover of ""Fear No Evil"" on the other so you had full artwork for both albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SUTFRLU6CW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000HX5H#wasThisHelpful","R17SUTFRLU6CW5","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:48 MinsUPDATED: 08-17-2015:I think I am about done with this vacuum.  The navigation is working now, but it cannot figure out NOT to try to climb on top of things.  I have just been running it upstairs in my music room and it has climbed on top of a microphone stand and a keyboard stand no less than 10 times.  I have picked the unit up and moved it away from the stand and it will turn around, drive back to the stand and immediately try to climb it again, getting stuck.  This thing pays NO attention to its surroundings and it will frustrate you greatly if you have things around that it can attempt to climb.  I love this vacuum when it works and actually avoids things, but I hate it when it doesn't.  You would think that it would sense that it was climbing something and reverse, but no... it doesn't.UPDATED 07-24-2015:I tried cleaning the sensors according to the directions (with a dry Q-tip) multiple times and the navigation did not get better.  I finally used a damp Q-tip and was able to actually remove all the dust in the sensors (there was not much dust there) and the navigation improved drastically.  This tells me that it doesn't take much dust to make the navigation fail.  I would recommend NOT following the directions and to use a damp Q-tip instead, as that is the only way I was able to get the navigation to start working.  The dry Q-tip just moves the dust around on the sensor and doesn't fix the problem.UPDATED 07-21-2015:I have reduced the rating to three stars.  The navigation on this vacuum is really not good at all.  I have been testing it every day since I first reviewed it and I can now say that it does a very poor job of covering area.  The navigation is scattershot and the unit constantly gets stuck on top of things or in corners.  It actually climbed up the legs of two different microphone stands in my recording studio.  It couldn't figure out that it was trying to climb the base of two microphone stands.  The navigation also covers the SAME EXACT area over and over and skips a ton of other area.  I am currently watching it go over an area that it has vacuumed at least ten times, while there is a ton of space in the middle of the room that it hasn't even touched.I cannot recommend this unit over the more-expensive Roomba vacuums, as they navigate a LOT better.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:The suction on this vacuum is really excellent and it does a very good job on carpets.  The bin is a bit small and it will fill up pretty quickly if you have pets or messy kids.  This wouldn't be an issue, but the vacuum does not stop when the bin gets full.  It just continues trying to vacuum when the bin is full, but it displays a message saying ""bin full"" or something of that nature.  The problem with this is that it is a robotic vacuum, so you wouldn't expect to have to follow it around to check and see if it needs to have the bin emptied.  There should be an alert sound when the bin fills and it should stop and rest until you clean the bin.The navigation of the vacuum when it is on carpet under a table is extremely good.  I have tested many different robotic vacuums and this one does the very best of any when it comes to navigating around chairs.  It gets between the legs and gets very close to all legs when cleaning.  It does absolutely great at this task.The navigation of the unit when on hardwood floors is not perfect.  We have about 2500 square feet of hardwood, so this makes a difference to us.  The unit seems to get confused and doesn't follow any logical pattern when cleaning.  It might go over a small area over and over and over, and then move out of that area for a couple of minutes before returning back to the small area it was doing before.  I had to pick the unit up and move it from area to area to get it to clean larger spaces.  The Mint Automatic Hard Floor Cleaner, 4200 is the best we have ever used for hardwood floors, but it is not a vacuum and only dusts the floor.The video I uploaded show this vacuum panicking in a corner and having a lot of trouble figuring out what to do.  This has happened more than once, so it is something that happens with this unit.The Neato will stop when it comes to stairs, but it (like all other robotic vacuums I have tested) will drop off the hardwood when coming into a tiled room.  The drop is only 1.5"" for the 3/4"" hardwood and the 3/4"" underlayment, so the sensor apparently doesn't have enough distance to stop it from going forward.  This means that you must either close doors to tiled rooms (our bathrooms, laundry room, fireplace, and an accessory room are tiled), or use the stop strip to block the unit from falling into an area it cannot get out of without help.The unit seems to have a hard time finding the base station to charge if it gets too far away, and we have had to take it back and put it on the charger manually.  The iRobot Roomba 880 Vacuum Cleaning Robot For Pets and Allergies was able to find the base without issue.BOTTOM LINE: 3 out of 5 stars.  The unit is okay on carpet, but questionable on hardwood.  The vacuum suction is great, and it does a great job on pet hair.RECOMMENDED","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0SR731UBCKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XELDQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R3L0SR731UBCKO","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say much negative about this product for what it is and what it is supposed to be.  If you are looking for an air purifier for a low price to use in a very small room, this should do the trick.  Holmes recommends that you use it in a room of approximately 100 - 109 square feet.  This can be deceiving, as rooms with higher ceilings have more cubic air footage, and will require a larger purifier to turn the air.  With this said, this purifier will work fine in a small bedroom, but not much else.  The fan is not terribly loud, but you will definitely notice it on the higher settings and it will be even more noticeable in a small space, such as a bathroom or something.  The filters are super easy to change and they should be readily available for some time to come.BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 stars - it is an inexpensive unit and it is only good for very small spaces, but it will work if that is what you require.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBT8MQGTSMP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DK35B#wasThisHelpful","R2GBT8MQGTSMP6","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are certainly better and worse tools out there.  These will do the job, but the adjustable wrench is of lower quality than the cheapest adjustable wrench I had before this kit.  The moveable jaw moves around quite a bit more than others that I have used and it does not inspire confidence.  The finish on the adjustable wrench is also problematic, as it is just paint.  The paint was already coming off when I first tested the wrench.  I don't care about the paint, but some might.  The better move would have been to just leave it as bare metal, to acid etch it, or to have a rubber grip on it.I would have liked for the locking pliers and the adjustable wrench to have had rubber grips on them, as there are certainly times when the grip can make a difference.As far as the three pliers included in the set go, they are all pretty good quality, and each has a solid fit and finish.  There is no play in the hinge on any of them and they feel fine and tight.  I have no complaints about these at all.Overall, I would give the set a 3.5 star rating.  I can't say how good the deal is on these, as Amazon currently doesn't have a price on them, but I wouldn't pay more than $25 for the set, as you can get tools of at least this quality at your local hardware chain for that amount.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHM0BU18Y2BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQOCKME#wasThisHelpful","R1UHM0BU18Y2BU","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 829LM works straight away with any garage door opener with native MyQ technology.  It also works with all Liftmaster openers manufactured after 1998 as long as you have the Liftmaster 828LM Garage Door Opener Internet Gateway and the LiftMaster 888LM Security+ 2.0 MyQ Wall Control Upgrades Previous Models 1998+ connected.My opener is a Liftmaster Professional that was made in 2010, and it does not have MyQ built into the unit.The 829LM will definitely work with the 888LM and the 828LM. I just set this up in my house and it works fine. The instructions that come with the 829LM do NOT cover the setup for this, so here's how it is done:Ensure that your 828LM is functioning and connected to your 888LM.Plug the 829LM into a wall outlet and ensure that the lights on the front are blinking.Press the learn button on the back of the 829LM. You will hear a beep.Press the learn button on the face of the 888LM.The 829LM will beep and the lights will go solid.That's it. You are now set up.There have been no problems since I figured out how to get the device connected.

"I am comparing these to other hearing protection I have in my range bag.  The Howard Leight by Honeywell R-01902 Impact Pro Electronic Shooting Earmuffs are the closest to these that I have, but these have similar performance, while being more comfortable on my head.  You can talk with others at the range with these on and still protect your hearing, as the electronics immediately stop the microphone when a shot is fired.  This works as well as the Howard Leight that I have, and they do a great job overall.  The Howard Leight have a -30db rating, while these only have a -21db rating, so the Leight are better overall as far as protecting your hearing goes.There is a noticeable difference in the noise reduction between the units, but both make it comfortable to shoot for long periods without any ringing in your ears.  The 3M protectors are more comfortable to me and I think that they have a great design for storage.  The Leight do not fold up like the 3M, thus taking more room in the range bag.Right now, it is a toss up as far as which one I like best goes.  I love them both.  I like the additional noise reduction of the Leight, but I love the feel and storage of the 3M.Take your pick... both are excellent.BOTTOM LINE: You cannot go wrong with these hearing protectors.  If you need more reduction, go with the Howard Leight, otherwise, these are absolutely great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZWX8SC8L076/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R2SZWX8SC8L076","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Echo is a pretty cool device and I really like it for what it is.  The sound quality from the tower is considerably better than expected and it will definitely fill up a room without a problem.  My wife uses ours downstairs in the library and she loves to be able to access our personal cloud library and play our own playlists.  The Echo will connect with your Amazon Music library, Prime playlists, Pandora, etc.  The voice recognition is quite good and doesn't fail to understand what you are asking for very often, although it doesn't know everything.One example is playing music from Roky Erickson.  In order to get the Echo to play Roky Erickson (pronounced ROCKY), you have to pronounce Roky like Row-Key.  The Echo will find the library and play it if you mispronounce the name.  I would say that this is down to the phonics engine, as Amazon can't program every possible pronunciation in the software.The list function is pretty cool, as it allows you to tell the Echo to make a note about something you need to remember and then it stores it so you can look at your note on your cellular phone or tablet with the Echo application.  This makes it easy to make grocery lists or notes to retrieve remotely.You can ask questions and the Echo will try to answer them.  You can't get too out there with the questions, but it will do your basic measurement translations, etc. for cooking, or you can look up general trivia stuff.  The Echo doesn't replace a computer for searching, as it isn't meant to fill that role; it is just for quick questions that you might need answers to, not research.  I like to ask it the weather instead of looking on the internet.  That's the kind of thing it is great at doing.The great thing about the Echo is that Amazon is continually updating it and adding or tweaking features.  I expect great things from this device in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386WWZAVC1KYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R386WWZAVC1KYZ","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have now tried steel and nickel strings from Elixir and I can say that they are both great strings and that they last a LONG time compared to other strings on the market.  The nickel strings don't have quite the brightness of the steel, so they are a good choice when you want a rounder sound, while the steel are great for a more biting sound.  The feel of the strings is great and the coating doesn't change the way your fingers feel on them.  The light-guage strings won't be my go-to, but they are still good...

"Our dog absolutely loves Beggin' Strips Bacon - 3lbs (48 oz), but she loves these even more.  The Beggin' Strips have been her go-to snack for a couple of years now, but she is completely crazy for these chicken treats!  She has a routine where she runs downstairs to go out before bedtime, when she gets her nighttime treat.  I fed her the chicken treat earlier in the day to see if she liked it... she loved it.  So, we went to bed last night and she sprinted downstairs as usual, but instead of going to the back door, she ran directly to the bedroom for her chicken treat!  My wife and I had to convince her to go outside for her bathroom activity... she sprinted back in and into the bedroom for her treat.  We also have a routine in the morning where she gets up, goes outside to the bathroom, then runs upstairs for her treat... this morning she ran straight upstairs, just like last night.She loves these things!Now for the details: These are NOT made in China.

"These knives have the look of more expensive knives made of solid steel, without the feel of those more expensive knives.  I am not terribly fond of the feel of these, as they are quite light and I prefer a bit more heft out of my knives that have steel handles.  This is just a personal preference and it does not cause the knives to perform poorly.The knives came fairly sharp, which is a good thing because they did not come with a sharpening stick.  I have honing tools at home, but I would have liked to have a sharpening tool with the knife set.  A knife is only as good as the edge on it, so it would have been advisable to include a sharpening device.The steak knives are housed in a separate knife block, allowing you to take them to the dinner table in the block.  While this is a neat presentation, I don't think that most people will use the block, as most will set places with the knife, fork, etc.  Still, it is nice that you can store it in a different location instead of on your counter, allowing you to keep just the cooking knives out for cooking.You will be happy with these unless you are really in need of the best steel. Sure, these are not Wusthof or Henckles, but the price is much lower. The steel is nice and you can get a great edge on these. I have a ton of knife sets and these still see use, even though I have Wusthof, Henckels, and Mercer knives.Good, but not great... worth a look if you don't need a lot of cooking knives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZT3S8T0FHXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06DKIY#wasThisHelpful","R22ZT3S8T0FHXY","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another great set of songs from the boys from down under.  King Parrot's sophomore release, produced by Phil Anselmo (DOWN, Superjoint Ritual, Pantera, etc.) hits the mark on every track.  The grindcore foundation of the band is in full effect, mixed with the slower elements I loved from the first release.  The production is crisp without being over-produced and sterile.  The new drummer, the stellar Todd Hansen (The Berzerker, and too many other bands to list), fits in perfectly and provides an extremely-solid foundation for the band.There is not as much overt comedy on this release, but the boys will definitely bring that element in their videos and live shows.  I did, however, miss the Slatts commentary from the first album on this one.  I would have liked it if he had another little snippet, as he has the best delivery going.  Still, the video for ""Like a Rat"" sees our hero provide his trademark comedy stylings, so I will eagerly await new video releases and interviews.BOTTOM LINE: The aggression, speed, slowness, and delivery of the first album are here in full effect.

" 1:27 Mins The vice works, but the design, while clever, has a fundamental flaw that makes the unit less reliable.  The quick-release mechanism that allows you to move the carriage forward or backwards quickly also causes the screw mechanism to bind frequently.  You will want to snug the carriage to your workpiece before you attempt to rotate the handle to move it, otherwise you will encounter binding on a consistent basis.  The video I uploaded demonstrates this failing.I would give this unit a 3-star rating at this point. If the mechanism worked as it should, this would be a five-star unit.  The fact is that there are MANY times that I need to clamp something down in order to drill it and this vice WILL provide that capability.  I have been using self-made jigs to do this so far and this is MUCH more convenient, so it is definitely a recommended product, but be aware of the shortcoming of the design and work around it.BOTTOM LINE: 3 stars - recommended with caveats","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4B3C65VF578X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5XU07A#wasThisHelpful","R4B3C65VF578X","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the wrenches and I feel that the ratcheting mechanism works very well, but I am concerned about how they will hold up under high-strain applications.  I have an absolute need for a ratcheting wrench that will fit into tight spaces, but, as any mechanic knows, there are many times when a bolt is stuck/corroded on, etc. so bad that you need penetrating fluid and you still need a hammer to break the thing loose (even worse cases need a torch to heat the bolt).  I am not sure that these will hold up to being hit with a hammer without breaking the ratcheting mechanism, but they will be amazing for anything where the bolt is not stuck.I was able to loosen a number of different bolts without issue and the wrenches performed as they should.  I would like to see a larger set of these that covered more sizes and combined both metric and SAE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZY8ZDLEBWNPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L895JO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZY8ZDLEBWNPN","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have multiple socket sets, as I do a lot of mechanic work for my family and friends.  I have pass-through sets from Bostitch, Crescent, and Husky.  I would rank the quality in that order as well.  The Bostitch have a more solid feel overall, but they do not feature the multi-surface sockets that will work with hex, spline, external Torx, and various other head types.  This feature alone makes this set a valuable addition to your tool kit.  I tested the fit on various heads and I can say that the performance and feel is top notch.  The grip on the head is really great and it even did a good job on slightly-rounded hex heads.I searched Amazon and Crescent's website and was unable to find a larger kit, and I think that this is a shame.  My go-to set is the BOSTITCH BTMT72287 Pass Through Socket Set, 65-Piece, as it contains the vast majority of all sizes I need to work on cars from multiple manufacturers.  I hope that Crescent comes up with a larger kit to cover more head sizes.Now for the problem with the kit.  There is no extension for the sockets, so you will NOT be able to access recessed bolts.  There is no way you can use this set in a tune-up situation on a car, nor can you use it to remove most bolts associated with removing heads or anything of that nature, as the missing extensions make it impossible to access the recessed bolts.  There are also many situations where you will not be able to use the pass-through sockets to work, as the ratchet will need clearance.  This problem is resolved by the addition of a 3/8"" insert that allows you to use standard 3/8"" sockets and extensions with the tool, but this also eliminates the pass-through ability.I would definitely recommend the Crescent version of the pass-through socket set, as long as you already know that the socket sizes and depths are appropriate for your applications.  This kit is good for basic work, but it will definitely not replace your larger kits if you do mechanic work.  This is recommended for basic home use.BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 stars (rounded to 4)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUET5GFKNKTFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L8GEPM#wasThisHelpful","RUET5GFKNKTFJ","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent little set that will be okay for some tasks but keep in mind that you have a very limited selection of sockets.  You have a 3/8"" ratchet, an extension and the following sockets:3/8""7/16""1/2""9/16""5/8""11/16""3/4""13/16""7/8""The connection between the ratchet and the socket is not perfect, and the socket will rock side to side when attached.  This won't stop you from being able to use the tool, but the connection is not as solid as any other socket sets I have (and I have four others from various manufacturers).  The quick-release mechanism works very well and allows you to change sockets easily.The set comes in a nice case that keeps things organized and secure.  The case is small enough that it will be easy to store in any tool kit or in your car.BOTTOM LINE: RECOMMENDED for people who don't need a full selection of socket sizes.  I would recommend a larger kit for most people, but this will work well if you know that the sockets in the kit will do what you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LKM0MYOQNCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFL03J8#wasThisHelpful","R19LKM0MYOQNCA","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have another Hitachi cordless drill (Hitachi DS18DBL 18-Volt 3.0-Ah Lithium-Ion Cordless Brushless Driver Drill) that I am extremely pleased with, so I had high expectations for these and they didn't disappoint. These have the strong motors that I expect from Hitachi, although they are not quite as strong as the 3 amp DS18DBL. Although these are 2.5 amps instead of 3 like the DS19DBL, I don't think that anyone will have an issue with this unless you are a contractor who needs to drill large screws and lots of them. Both of these drills are somewhat compact and fairly lightweight, so you will be able to control them better than heavier units.Each drill has an LED light that shines from that base up toward the tip of the drill, allowing you to see your mark much better when drilling pilot holes. The light can be turned on without the drill operating, so you can line up and get ready before starting the motor. The only problem is that this is a touchy operation that often results in the drill motor engaging when you don't want it to start.The torque of the driver drill is good, but it does not compare to the torque of the contractor-grade DS18DBL. The DS18DGL has 400 in/pounds of torque, while the DS18DBL has 600 in/pounds. The WH18DGL, however, has an incredible 1,280 in/pounds of torque! The combination of the DS18DGL and the WH18DGL is a formidable package that will handle pretty much any job you can come up with. You will NOT be disappointed in the performance of these.The warranty on these units is among the best in the industry, with a lifetime tool warranty, a two-year battery warranty, and a one-year charger warranty. The lifetime tool warranty is the big deal here, as you are covered against defects for life.The only thing I would change would be the case for the drills. There has been a trend over the past few years where manufacturers put their tools in nylon doctor's bag-style cases instead of hard cases. I do not like the nylon bags at all, as they are not very protective and cannot be stacked on shelves. In the case of this set, you have both drills, batteries, and the charger in a case where they can bang into each other and are not protected from outside forces. I would pay extra just to have the manufacturer include hard cases for the units again. Hitachi is not the only one doing this, so it is not a knock solely on them. I have a new Porter Cable circular saw, a Bosch reciprocating saw, a DeWalt combo kit, etc., all with the nylon bags. I don't really fault Hitachi, but I wish that they had a solid case like the DS18DBL.Bottom line: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNHHJJAJSE10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3W70P0#wasThisHelpful","RKNHHJJAJSE10","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup on this unit couldn't be any easier.  I unboxed the device, plugged it into the power outlet and into my router with ethernet, then powered it on.  The device light blinked for about a minute and then ""Personal Cloud"" showed up in the ""Shared"" section of the Finder on my Mac.  There is an internet shortcut in the root directory of the drive.  I clicked the link and the drive opened in Safari and it immediately started a firmware update.  This was an automatic process that took a few minutes, but will not cause anyone any issues, as it is completely automatic and requires no action on the part of the user.After the firmware update completed, the screen changed to the Seagate Personal Cloud setup wizard.  The setup lets you register the device as part of the owner settings, so your product will be registered immediately (if you choose).  You will receive an email with a confirmation code that you use to confirm that you are setting up the device properly.  You will then be presented with a screen that who's your device username and your Seagate access ID.  You will use the password you set during the setup process to access the device from the internet or your computer.You can use the Seagate Media application for direct playback on your Roku device, Kindle Fire, or Samsung Smart Hub devices.  The XBOX One, XBOX 360, PS3, or other DLNA devices can access the Seagate device via DLNA.  This allows you to stream music, movies, etc. to your DLNA-enabled device.  NOTE: The PS4 does not currently support DLNA.I connected my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" tablet to the cloud by downloading the Seagate Media application.  The application scans your network and locates your drive immediately.  I was able to stream videos and audio immediately without even the slightest hiccup.  The setup was equally easy on my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone.  It was immediate and flawless.The biggest disappointment to me is the fact that there is no application for the Amazon Fire TV.  I would like a good DLNA service for the Fire TV and the application would have served that purpose if it existed.The Backup Manager tells you how to set up Time Machine (Mac) to use the Seagate device as the backup drive.  Additionally, you can set up Time Machine to work with multiple drives to keep multiple backups.  There is also an App Manager that allows you to install server-side applications to your device that can be used for varying tasks.  At this point there are not a lot of applications available for installation, but we can hope that a good set of applications come to reality.  This is similar to the way my Synology DiskStation 5-Bay 15TB (5 x 3TB) Network Attached Storage (NAS) with iSCSI (DS1513+ 5300) works, but the Synology device has a considerable set of applications for installation.I would prefer a RAID setup to the single-drive configuration of the item being reviewed, but I feel that this device is very solid.  The software works well and all my devices (barring the Amazon Fire TV) connected to it immediately and work as they should.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended, but I would still recommend the Synology product over this one, as you can use quickconnect.to in order to access it from any device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFO90HS4H7Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZZZN84#wasThisHelpful","R1OFO90HS4H7Z0","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty unique design and I find it helpful to be able to push the handle to open the door.  If you are coming in the back door with packages, groceries, etc, you can just bump the handle with your leg and open the door.  What's not to like?The installation is simple, but it does require a door with a deadbolt hole, and you will need a drill to put a third hole at the appropriate place at the bottom of the handle, as it secures on the bottom as well.  This is very simple to do and you should have no issue doing it at all, especially if you are replacing a front door handle that had the long handle already, as the hole is in a standard location.  If you are installing elsewhere, just drill a quick hole and you are good to go.TIP: when drilling the hole, you can put a level on top of your drill to ensure that you are drilling a hole through the door that is level.  This is also the proper way to install a keyhole in a door if you ever do that.  A miniature level is all it takes to ensure that your hole is nice and clean.The finish is clean and nice and the build quality is very high.

"The oven works great and has excellent features.  I gave it a five-star review for multiple reasons:It looks great, it performs great, and it has a glass touchpad instead of pressure-sensitive buttons.  The cooking temperature is displayed on the front of the oven as it heats, showing you how close you are to cooking temperature, and the unit beeps when the temperature is hit.  The bottom heating element is enclosed and is not exposed to the oven interior.  This makes the oven much easier to clean and to keep nice.  It comes with three shelves and multiple rails for adjustments.  It has a full Sabbath setting menu for Jewish users who observe Shabbat.The convection fan is not very loud and works exactly as it should.  The oven allows for convection roasting as well as convection baking and the instruction manual tells how you should set the oven to prepare various food items.  The cooking temperature (actual temperature) is user adjustable to plus-or-minus 35 degrees, allowing you to correct any disparity in the actual temperature and the cooking temperature displayed.The oven makes clicking noises very often, but this is normal operation.  The manual states that the oven has very strict tolerances for heat and the clicking is the oven adjusting to maintain a perfect temperature.  You will also hear a fan when the oven is on, even when you are not using convection, this is because the oven has a fan that helps keep the internal electronics cool when it is operating.  The fan will remain on for some time after you are finished cooking as it cools the unit off.One thing to note is that this oven is quite deep and it might not fit in your opening if you have a gas line in the recess.  Our gas line is in the opening and the oven would not fit.  I had to make an extension to my cabinet in order to accommodate the deeper oven.  This is something that the average homeowner will likely not be able to do, but I have a wood shop and was able to build the extension to make the oven fit.  This is something to think about, so be sure to measure carefully (which I didn't) before buying the oven.I installed it along with a KitchenAid gas stovetop (KCGS550ESS) and the mounting brackets for the stovetop went down too far and the oven hit them, so I had to modify the brackets in order to get the oven to install as well.  This included remaking the brackets so that they were nearly flush to the bottom of the stovetop.Please measure better than I did before purchasing anything, as it is not a trivial matter to modify mounting hardware and to build cabinet extensions to accommodate a larger oven if the depth is restricted because of a gas pipe.Bottom line: Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33N8H4O7MDDVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXJPFNI#wasThisHelpful","R33N8H4O7MDDVO","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I debated on 3 or 4 stars for these and I ended up at 3.5, and rounded up to 4.  The sound is better than you might expect for an inexpensive set of headphones and the battery seems to last a while, as they have been going for a while without going dead... without charging them.  I have read that they will last 12 hours or so with a full charge and I am not finding that hard to believe.The biggest problem I have with these headphones is the fact that the earpieces do not move.  You cannot adjust the angle of the earpieces, so you can't get a perfect fit on your ears and it allows external sounds to get in.  On top of this, there is more pressure at the bottom of your ears than the top, so they can get uncomfortable after a long session of listening.What I have found nice is that they connect easily to your Bluetooth device or phone and work as a hands-free device for cellular phones.  There is a button on the side of the headphones to answer calls, pause music, etc.  You can use NFC with Samsung Galaxy phones or anything else that uses NFC. The convenience is definitely there.If I could make a change in the design, I would put a swivel/hinge mechanism above the earpieces so that they would be able to fit more comfortably.Bottom Line: Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AB0BHUC3S12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA1IAWG#wasThisHelpful","R26AB0BHUC3S12","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will be happy with these unless you are really in need of the best steel. Sure, these are not Wusthof or Henckles, but the price is much lower. The steel is nice and you can get a great edge on these. I have a ton of knife sets and these still see use, even though I have Wusthof, Henckels, and Mercer knives.The only real problem I have with these knives is the black coating.  I don't really see a need for the coating, as it simply begs to be scratched up when sharpening the knives or if they are scraped against something.  I like my knives to look nice and these definitely look nice when new, but only time will tell how the black coating holds up with repeated use.The knives came pretty sharp from the factory, but they could use a bit more honing to get a great edge.  Still, they are easily sharp enough for most kitchen work right out of the box.  They won't cut through thick meat like a scalpel out of the box, but you can do good work right away.  The handles have a different kind of grip that has a texture that leads your thumb to a grip by the blade.  The handles don't feel as nice as more expensive knives I have, but I will put these into rotation to get a good feel for them.  I will update the review if I decide that there is some problem with them, but they get a 4-star review at the moment.I think that you will like these if you are not absolutely in need of Wusthof or whatever.

"I would give these towels one star if they didn't note that they are aiming to be the same quality as the ""value brand from your local grocery store.""  These are not really quite as good as the cheap towels my wife buys for her cleanup with her wax business.  These towels are thin, weak, and they won't hold much liquid.  I tested these towels against the cheap store brand from Kroger's my wife has in her wax room.  These towels were unable to absorb the exact same amount of liquid that the other store brand did.  The store brand is not nearly as good as Bounty, and these are not nearly as good as the store brand.  These towels are also very loosely rolled on the tube, apparently in order to make the roll look larger.  This strategic decision allows the towels to shift up and down the roll.  I was able to make a basic funnel shape.Since these are sold in cases of 30 for $30, I cannot recommend them, as the better towels my wife uses cost her .89c per roll.

"I don't know that this is really a necessary accessory. I installed it (i.e. put it on top of my console and plugged it in) and it went to work. The temperature was measured at 115 degrees as the fan started working. The fan has been running for about 30 minutes and the system temperature now shows 104 degrees. The reduction in temperature is certainly not 30% as is claimed in the advertising, as that would bring the temperature of the console down to 80 degrees, which would be virtually impossible without the unit being an air conditioner. What I have experienced is approximately a 10% change in temperature instead of 30%.The device itself is designed smartly enough. There are rubber pads on the front and back to keep the unit in place and to keep it from scratching your console. The USB passthrough allows you to use the unit without losing a USB port on the Xbox. The fan is very quiet and does the job it is meant to do, if not as well as is claimed by the manufacturer. It is unobtrusive on top of your console, as it blends right in with it. I would have preferred it if they would have had the temperature display on the front of the unit instead of the top, but that's a minor concern. Having the display on the top allows the unit to be less obtrusive, as it is just black and doesn't stick out, so that is probably why it is on the top.The vent comes out the back and blows fairly strongly. This moves a decent amount of air, so you are getting a good pull through of air into your console. This device will not really do anything for you if your system is in an enclosed rack or entertainment center, as all it will do is draw warm/hot air back into your console. I would not recommend this for anyone with their system in a closed area, as it should do no good at all.Bottom Line: it is inexpensive and worth buying if you believe that you need a system cooling device and you have your console in an exposed area instead of an enclosed cabinet of some nature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34F1XVJX6IAXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P45U43O#wasThisHelpful","R34F1XVJX6IAXB","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The ball-type base (not exactly like the Dyson - I don't know what to call this... it is a swiveling ball between the wheels that allows the handle to lean side to side) works as it should and it allows you to turn easily, like any other ball-type vacuum.  The hand tools are okay, but they suffer the same problems as Dyson vacuums.  The handle is not very comfortable to use when using the attachment.  This is NOT a knock on the Samsung, as it works the same as the vacuum I am comparing it with in this review.I greatly prefer the beater mechanism on this vacuum to the Dyson vacuums I have, as you don't have to bend over and rotate the bare-floor selector switch.  The Samsung has a button on the left-hand side of the unit by the handle that lets you turn the brush on or off.  This is a far superior design to the Dyson.The large wheels on this vacuum make it roll easily and smoothly, so it is not difficult to cover area.  The weight of the vacuum is also slightly less than the Dyson vacuums I am comparing it with.  I have absolutely no problems recommending this vacuum.BOTTOM LINE: I rate this unit exactly the same as the more-expensive Dyson vacuum cleaners I have.  This one does the job very well and does it for a lower price than Dyson.  A more maneuverable wand for attachments would make this a five-star cleaner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7TSJGFI1ING/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOD3FM0#wasThisHelpful","R3A7TSJGFI1ING","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:04 Mins The video I have uploaded demonstrates the remarkable non-stick quality of this pan.  I cooked an egg and burned some cheese in the pan with no oil in the pan at any point.  Nothing will stick to the surface of this pan.  I found the pan to be incredibly easy to clean and of very sturdy construction.  The handle is nice and is stiffer than Kitchen Aid pans that I have, so I was definitely happy about that.  The surface is supposedly able to handle metal utensils, so long as they are not pointy, so this should be nice for some people.  I will continue using non-metal utensils, as I just prefer it that way.  The manufacturer states that the pan should always be hand washed (which we do with all our pans anyway), so please be mindful of that and do not put it in a dishwasher.Bottom line: I am going to order a set of these pans and I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who is in the market for new pans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1BZQKZ9W3FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO2YK60#wasThisHelpful","RV1BZQKZ9W3FE","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent laminator for a good price.  The lamination sheets are easy to use and with the 12 1/2"" width, you can laminate multiple items in one sheet without much issue.  The sheet feed is nice and smooth and I have had no problem getting things to feed properly.  The machine heats up very quickly, so you don't have to wait more than a minute to get started.  Another excellent feature is the automatic shut off function, making the unit safe to use and very unlikely to cause a problem due to overheating.Note: my wife attempted to laminate a traffic ticket that one of our kids got and it turned out to be a bad idea.  Since the laminator uses heat, you will need to be sure that the item you are laminating does not react negatively to heat, as the ticket just turned completely black.Bottom line: this is an excellent laminator that I would not hesitate to recommend if you are in need of one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAF1J921VNHWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OILZNIG#wasThisHelpful","RAF1J921VNHWM","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice vacuum and it is easy to use and get around and under furniture.  The arm is extendable to allow you to reach under deeper furniture without issue, so you will get a cleaning that is much harder to get with a Dyson or other upright canister vacuum.  There are multiple power levels, including a power level that is meant to be very quiet and works very well for times when you don't want a lot of noise.  Multiple heads are included with the unit, including a bare-floor attachment, a beater brush head, and a couple of attachments for furniture and curtains.  The unit is small and lightweight enough to use comfortably in almost any situation.  It was not super easy to do the stairwell, but it was certainly easier and more comfortable than working with the Dysons we have, so it wins in this race.The problem with this vacuum is the bags.  I looked the bags up on the site here and they are about $5 per bag.  This adds up very quickly when you have pets, as the hair will fill the bag pretty fast.  If this was a bagless design, I would be in love with it, but the expense of constantly buying bags makes this a vacuum that you need to think about.  The purchase price of the cleaner is not low and the continual need to buy bags on top of it make it a pricey option, but a good and powerful unit.Bottom line: Very good vacuum if you don't mind buying bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ODJZAAOEP2E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGWW#wasThisHelpful","R3ODJZAAOEP2E3","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great sound: The sound is really quite good for a small package. There is more than adequate bass response and good high-end response as well. I didn't expect the sound to be as good as it is and I think that everyone with reasonable expectations will find the sound pleasing.High-quality construction: This thing is built like a tank. There is not even a tiny deviation in the lines around the unit and the fit is completely even all the way around. No loose-fit parts can be found on the unit anywhere. The fit and finish are about as good as you could hope for in a product.Multiple-format power adapter: The speaker comes with a switching power supply and tips for multiple power formats from various countries. This is an international-power-ready speaker right out of the box.Weight: This is a fairly heavy speaker, likely because of the batteries. You can use this without connecting it to power and you can even use it to power your cellular phone to charge the battery.Bluetooth: Go completely wireless with Bluetooth and even use it as a speaker phone with your cellular phone.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a portable speaker system that does a LOT more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZ8UEUV4KF4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1SHBOO#wasThisHelpful","R2FZ8UEUV4KF4V","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent table if you know what you are getting.  This is NOT a deep table and you will NOT be able to use it as a picnic table or something of that nature.  It is a great utility table that is extremely sturdy and well made.  The depth of the table is a about 18"", so it is not going to have room for chairs at the ends if you want to use it as a table for eating.  We are using this as a utility table and it is fantastic.  The latches are very solid and the legs are absolutely straight and level without any adjusting.  This is not a light-weight table and it weighs in at about 35 pounds.  This is a good thing, as the weight keeps it sturdy.I would definitely recommend this table, but you need to be aware of the weight and size before purchasing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M4HEN2TFF9WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YZX1H6#wasThisHelpful","R3M4HEN2TFF9WU","A2WA8TDCTGUADI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WA8TDCTGUADI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These boots have a lot to like!  Nub on back of the heal for easy off.  Tab on back of ankle to help pull on. Bright pretty look made from  printed fabric behind clear shell. Quality materials and sealed seams - this is a step up from your average rain boots.  Sadly I will be returning because I do not like the angled toe box.  If you have worn pointy shoes and your foot already has taken that shape - well these are cute and will work fine.  I have worn European style healthy box toe shoes all my life and it's very uncomfortable to have my big toe pushed in.

"I believe in healthy feet.  Shoes must have a nice arch and a wide toe box.  These do not.  They also forced my big toe to lean in.  I already had another pair of shoes that did that and it cause my toe to permanently lean in.  If your toes are already like that from wearing pointy shoes maybe may not a problem, but I consider it essencial to toe stability when walking and running.  I am very upset to see this trend and I always look for a straight edge going from the heal (skipping the arch) and going on to the top of the big toe. The foot should be held back by the top of the shoe over the arch, not the toes being jammed.  And these shoes are not to short - just too pointy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7K2CGOC19NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087SXKJ0#wasThisHelpful","R3T7K2CGOC19NW","A2UWIWD56X2Z5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWIWD56X2Z5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also choose to use these on a bookshelf due to the bottom slipping around.  On a desk I would definitely want to add little rubber spots to keep it from sliding off - but there is no place to put them.  Since we have ordered sit stand desks and stability is an issue, plus I prefer the look of the Safco Mesh - I will not be reordering these unless I plan to use them in the bookcase.

The grippers on top of this are substantial and strong even though they are deep.  I measured them at just over 1/4"" tall.

I think if you want to sink some money into cleaner air and you are willing to have a unit this size, you should go with the biggest highest model number you can afford.

I simply apply to both hands and then stack and spread my fingers.  It works great because there is a wide opening.I only have two concerns:1: Skin damage long term from the lights - so I will wear my fingerless sun protection gloves with this in the future.2: Light does come out of the wide opening and this light can damage your eyes.  I plan to take a folded piece of aluminum foil and tape to the top over the opening, making a flap like the top of the line Gelish until that costs much more.I really enjoy the convenience and saving of doing my nails at home!!!  I have VERY thin nails that never help regular polish even one day.  This has been wonderful to have such a lasting beautiful gel polish and the bonus is it lasts longer than you need.  I generally redo every week and a half because the regrowth starts showing by then.An product I ordered and enjoy to work with this are: VIP Beauty Shop 200 Pieces Nail Polish Foils with the cotton attached,  I have reused them 3 times and will do so until they fall apart.I Also took the remover  Super Nail Pure Acetone Polish Remover 235 Ml  and put it in a spray bottle as it is easy to spill.  Now I just give 1 -2 sprays onto the above foils that are preformed do to being reused.  I pop my fingers in and find I SAVE A LOT OF TIME as well as $$ by reusing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2TXM6ROA6VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5IJ79Q#wasThisHelpful","R2V2TXM6ROA6VR","A2UWIWD56X2Z5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWIWD56X2Z5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for a playroom for my daughters wedding.  I wanted kids of all ages to be able to interact and have fun.  They preferred playing with this than watching the movie we had set up so that says a lot.  Little kids love holding the circles and dropping them in even if they don't understand the game.  Everyone else has fun too.  So few games are really great like this for all ages.  It is so sturdy and stable.  It is actually a Beast in it's construction.  It's plastic but it would take a lot to break it so that is why I think it costs so much, still I'd like to see it sell for about $50 less.  I plan to keep this at home, but already have friends wanting to borrow it for use in classrooms.  She said if the class gets answers right they would earn putting a disc in.

"I have mature skin and am sensitive to ingredients and occasionally have rosacea.  Due to a bad reaction with a product with SPF ingredient Oxybenzone, my face was having a bad Contact Dermatitis reaction.  I came to Amazon to read reviews and pick a safe product to use while I was so irritated.  I settled on this item and on Carapex Natural Anti-aging Night Cream with Elastin & Collagen, for Dry to Combination Skin, Fragrance Free, Perfect for Sensitive Skin, 2oz 60mlSebamed has a very faint floral scent.  It has a very silky texture and is easy to apply and rub in if you wish.  Since I was trying to protect my skin while not making my skin reaction worse, I applied the CARAPEX first with no serum r other products to be sure I was only evaluating one product at a time.  In the middle of the night my eye area was feeling very dry.  I was not able to apply the Carapex there due to it's thickness and now I also see the label says not to use on the eyes.But I saw no such warning on this product, so I applied a very thin layer most delicately to my eye area.  During the rest of the night my eyes swelled up.  I could feel it but did not want to get up again.  To my shock, by morning one was completely swollen shut and the other was very swollen.While I may LOVE this product after my dermatitis reaction is gone - I feel I need to warn others that this item WILL AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY UPSET SENSITIVE SKIN.In a month or two I will come back and do a patch test, and then full face if I can.  If this reaction does no repeat _ I will raise my stars.  But I feel I must warn others with very sensitive skin.  I will try to post a picture - I do not like leaving negatives unless they are earned.  I would like to point out that I did NOT get his cream In my eye, only in the eye area.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUFPANAYNOHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BRSHXE#wasThisHelpful","RJUFPANAYNOHE","A2UWIWD56X2Z5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWIWD56X2Z5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have sensitive skin and had a very bad reaction to CARAPEX Night Cream. CARAPEX has no smell and I researched extensively hoping I had found a great moisturizer that would not give me a bad reaction.  I previously reported that this item caused me no problems, thinking that the MAJOR case of Contact Dermatitis I got was due to another product. After a trip to the dermatologist and a round of steroids and RX creams and waiting SEVERAL Weeks to begin introducing items back one at a time - I CLEARLY had a bad reaction to this.I applied it in the morning and once again my face started to feel bumpy, then burn and turn red.  I did not wait and immediately washed my skin and applied the RX cream again.I have mature dry sensitive skin that needs moisture.  I am so sorry this item did not work.  I must also point out that I was not shipped what appears in the picture.  The wording is the same, and maybe there has been a packaging update since my order in late May 2014.For those still interested:  I found this Elastin and Collagen product to be thicker than I would like because it required quite a bit of rubbing and thus stretching of my skin to get it to spread. Perhaps it is because I am used to products with ""slip"" that spread easier and I just am not familiar with this type of cream - but it grabs like nothing I have seen in 30 years.  It dries mid-stroke and then grabs where it is and won't move.  I did not try it over a facial serum due to wanting to avoid all of my own products and wanting to test this out.  I did not dare use it near my eyes due to the spreading problem.I posted a picture of the different looking jar I got.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FMJJCMLUG0WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSAFH16#wasThisHelpful","R3FMJJCMLUG0WN","A2UWIWD56X2Z5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWIWD56X2Z5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these test strips because I was on the Adkins diet and wanted to see if I was in Ketosis.  The fact there are other tests on the strip is an added benefit, especially because these strips are less expensive than most Ketostix.  When I saw my results, I figured I might as well see what they all mean.The strip indicated there was protein in my urine.  The instruction sheet isn't very helpful.  Is it bad to have protein in the urine?  How much is bad, and how much is OK?  For that, you'll need to research on the Internet, because the instructions aren't very helpful.Well, what I found out is disturbing.  Protein could mean chronic kidney disease, because the kidneys aren't properly filtering protein, or it could mean that I work out strenuously and don't have kidney disease.  Since I didn't have any other indicators of kidney disease (eg, high blood pressure, diabetes), and I do work out strenuously, I was only mildly concerned but wanted to verify.I bought another brand of strips that only check for protein and glucose, and those sticks show I am 100% normal with no protein in the urine, while side by side the Phinex show the presence of protein.  I do think these Phinex strips are a useful tool and the other tests seem really accurate, but results need to be taken with a grain of salt.  The meaning of the results also need to be researched.So the strips are a four star product, with one star removed because results should be verified, and the instructions could be better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HRS56P12T86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099WTWTA#wasThisHelpful","R7HRS56P12T86","A1SHHQSPOWR00F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SHHQSPOWR00F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a fan of the original Rock Band when it first came out on PS3, and the PS4 version brings back a lot of fun family memories with a refreshed but very familiar look. The new drum set has been overhauled completely from previous versions, with thicker, more sturdy drum pads and an easy to adjust stand. The guitars have that familiar Rock Band feel, with responsive fret buttons at the top and at the base of the neck, and the no-click strum lever feels more like you're playing a guitar string as opposed to pushing a clicky-lever that Guitar Hero has.This 4th version of the game has a new ""freestyle mode"" where you can (kind of) play whatever you want during the guitar solos, but it's not completely open - the screen cues will still tell you the strum-type, and it's up to you to try to match it with your own selected notes... so it's not entirely independent, but it's a different feature that you can use, or disable for the more conventional guitar solos.I do like how the drums and the guitars were completely wireless this time around, and I would have preferred the USB Microphone to be wireless as well - but I suspect that it's wired to deliver the constant stream of voice data without lag (as opposed to quick ""blip"" signals that the instruments send).Graphics-wise Rock Band keeps it simple, with animated characters that you can customize to your liking without trying to bring in too much realism. The song list on disc has a wide range of music, and the best part is that you can go to the PSN store and re-download all of your previous purchases from previous Rock Band games without having to rebuy them. This feature let me play songs from the previous versions and only expanded the song library even more.It's been years since the last Rock Band came out, and being able to play again on my PS4 is fun for the family and friends. Other than the semi-independent freestyle mode and a tour mode that feels a little short, Rock Band 4 still delivers and is still just as fun to rock out like the original.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AB4X78WJAJPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9HS4Z2#wasThisHelpful","R3AB4X78WJAJPD","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you need added fuse protection for your vehicle accessories, you can't find anything better than what Blue Sea offers. Sure, it's normally a marine application, but a lot of people use them for vehicle purposes like me. The whole assembly is heavy and feels really strong, craftsmanshp is excellent, and you can tell just by looking at it that this fuse block means business. The built-in grounding block has identical connections (meaning for every positive terminal screw there's a negative terminal screw) so you can literally wire anything you need fused directly to this fuse block. No more add-a-fuses, no more splicing and extra messy wires all over the place; I have a pair of off-road lamps, my aftermarket horns, and two car audio processors connected to the Blue Sea.

"If you've played the first two games in the trilogy, it's only fitting that you finish with the finale. Arkham Knight doesn't try to reimagine or reinvent itself after the first two games - it continues on with the same formula but with current gen console power to deliver excellent open-world gaming (even if the ""world"" is just Gotham City). After playing through the entire campaign, it's safe to say that some of the puzzles are easy, the driving element is a little twitchy, and the graphics aren't hyper-realistic.

"After having great results with Mothers Reflections Tire Care, I decided to try out their Protectant for the interior trim and my tonneau cover. Unlike other protectants that have some sort of fuel-like smell to it, the Mothers brand also shares a pleasant, almost spice-like aroma to it which is nice considering that it's being used both inside and outside of the vehicle. It sprays on clear, and doesn't dry up quickly - so with only 2-3 sprays I can already wipe down half of my truck's tonneau cover. On the same note it isn't sticky or oily, and within a few minutes it is no longer ""wet"". It brings some life back into dull plastic, without having a ""wet look"" gloss. Just like the Tire Care, the protectant don't seem to pick up dust and dirt like other protectants I've tried.

"I needed some new trail/camping shoes, and after looking at other brands I ended up deciding on the AX2's. Once I got the right size (more on this later) the shoes fit nice and comfy. The inside has thin but noticeable padding; the flexible sides and toe area are great - the AX2's don't feel like other shoes where they make your foot conform to the shape of the shoe walls because they're stiff.I got to use these across a lot of varied terrain, from gravel, dirt trails, rock riverbeds, downed trees, and sand - and the tread pattern was very capable on any of these surfaces. On non-trail surfaces (concrete, asphalt) they tread actually acts as an impact absorber, and you can definitely feel it when you take a step, as they are very comfortable to walk in for long periods of time both on and off-road.Also, at $80/pair you would be mistaken to pass these shoes off as ""cheap"" compared to other brand ""trail"" shoes that seem to hover around the $100+ price point. They are very well made, feel great when laced up, and are very versatile. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the US sizing seems off; I normally wear a 10.5 in athletic and casual shoes, but when I ordered the 10.5 it was way too long; With medium thickness socks on, I could squeeze my last two fingers (ring and pinkie) in between my heel and the back of the shoe. I went to a size 10 though and they fit perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKH8T3XOUL7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZ5OW0#wasThisHelpful","R1NKH8T3XOUL7K","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this because of the claimed ""satin finish"" and it wasn't lying. Instead of the high gloss, shiny ""wet"" look, I prefer my tires to just look ""like tires""  should look, which is not dry but not glossy either. I'm glad that I tried the Reflections Tire care (kind of ironic since it doesn't reflect much) because it was exactly what I was looking for for my truck. RTC keeps my tires looking new, and unlike those ""wet"" oily tire gels and sprays, I do appreciate how my tires don't seem to pick up dust and dirt after a few miles of driving right after applying the RTC. On top of that, the RTC (like the other Mother's products I've started to use recently) has a fragrance to it, so you're nose doesn't suffer from that harsh chemical smell that other products have.

"Instead of going with the more ""usual"" car audio brands (Kenwood, Alpine, Pioneer, etc.) I did some research and discovered Image Dynamics. I went with these CXS64 V.2 components after reading reviews from car audio forums, and they do not disappoint at all. The CX-64 woofers build quality is excellent - carbon cones, super heavy magnets, and an option to mount the tweeters coaxially or as separates (all parts needed to do the conversion are included in the box). The XS-28 tweeters include both surface and flush mounting, and have removable grills for custom installs. The included passive crossovers are a little larger than I expected, but in return they offer a lot of preset combinations for crossover frequency, tweeter level attenuation, and even crossover slope.After installing them, I tested the sound using varied music with a wide range of instruments and vocals - everything from percussion to jazz to EDM to rock and everything in between. I'm powering these speakers with an Alpine V9 that is feeding each pair of components 200-watts in bridged mode, and the CXS64 combination sounded amazing! Highs were crisp, midrange was clear, and vocals were very sharp. Even when playing dynamic tracks the CXS64's did the job and produced amazing sound. Needless to say, the sound quality was a huge step up from my factory speakers, and unlike the factory speakers I can crank the volume up now and the sound doesn't get distorted at all. My hi-fi addict friends told me that the sound will get even better after these ""break-in"" which is even better, because right now they already sound excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUDW8VLZIG05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XWBEEC#wasThisHelpful","R3LUDW8VLZIG05","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of all the Nightwish DVDs I've seen, this is my favorite music-wise... mainly because I think they got it right by having Floor Jansen as the lead singer. The way she sings Nightwish songs (previously performed by Tarja or Annette) meshes perfectly with the heavy rock and metal sound. Everyone rocks out on stage, and you can feel the electricity as they perform all of their hits. The added disc covering the behind-the-scenes events showing the process of bringing in Jansen to take over the microphone was an interesting bonus. This DVD set is worth the money for any Nightwish fan, although I only gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 because just wished that they spent more time showing Floor and the band performing - instead of splicing in hundreds of shots of random crowd surfers every 10 seconds or so throughout the whole concert.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUWQAM6KX3TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPM1BOC#wasThisHelpful","R1NUWQAM6KX3TK","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is nice considering that I've come across so-called ""14 AWG"" wire that was actually 18AWG with super thick insulation to pretend it was good wire.

"If you want to install this LED kit cleanly, be prepared to pulling seats, trim panels, and lifting some carpet. Why? Because the four LED light bars are hard wired into the controller box. That meant that during the first attempt at installation, we had to try to snake each light bar (approx. 8"" long) through the interior. This wasn't happening, so we ended up pulling the front two seats out of the car in order to install the LED kit. Sure - you could just install this quickly without running cable under the carpet, but then you'd have wires everywhere. If they added simple sockets to the end of each wire, it would have made installation a lot easier and with less hassle.Another thing - we could not put the controller box up front on the left side of the steering wheel column (where my friend originally wanted it) because of the hard-wired equal-length wires; with the controller up front, there would not be enough wire to run the LED bars all the way to the back of the interior. He ended up having to pick a spot in the center of the vehicle for the controller box.Aside from the installation woes, the kit itself works as expected; the lights are bright and the controller gives many lighting colors/options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R987IP3EHB571/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I04Z7Q#wasThisHelpful","R987IP3EHB571","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I needed this to be able to retain my factory steering wheel controls on my 2014 Nissan Frontier. I first tried the suggested wiring instructions as provided by Axxess, but it was for a 2013 model - and sure enough, the wire colors were changed for 2014. Since the included super thick yet super tiny ""instruction"" manual was of no use for troubleshooting, and since their website has nothing useful either, I tried calling the Axxess customer service (phone support only) but after being put on hold for 20 minutes I just hung up, recalling all of the negative comments I read online about the Axxess customer ""service"".  Luckily I found the correct wiring info on a forum - and after following those wiring instructions, I had the ASWC-1 working... almost. The volume buttons were mapped right, the mode select worked, and the tune/track up/down buttons were fine too. However the buttons for the factory hands-free were wrong. Here's a tip - if you have an Android device with a USB OTG cable, do yourself a favor and use the Axxess Updater App. I did not want to deal with the manual ""count LED blinks"" method to remap the hands-free controls to the correct functions, so I loaded up the Axxess app onto my Nexus 7 tablet, plugged it into the ASWC-1, and I had the remap done in seconds. In the end I got the ASWC-1 working exactly how I expected/wanted it to work, but I had to figure most of it out myself, the 3-star rating is because the unit works flawlessly once I figured it out; I would have given it more stars because it works well - except I'm taking 1 star away for each 10 minutes I waited on hold on the phone before giving up on asking the Axxess CSR for help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1L51LVK7WQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4PJC9K#wasThisHelpful","R1O1L51LVK7WQH","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This latest Nightwish album follows along the same vein as the others, but it's not the best. I've been a fan of Nightwish for a long time, and after a long wait I was looking forward to a full album with their newest lead vocalist, Floor Jansen. However when I finally received the new album and listened to EFMB, I wasn't impressed.Let me be more specific: It's not that I wasn't impressed by Jansen's singing - but I was more disappointed in the fact that NONE of the songs on this latest album took advantage of her dynamic vocal range and metal rock ability. Adding Floor to the group gave them a new dimension with the vocals, because in my opinion she's like an awesome mix of the previous two lead singers. I love how she is a trained opera vocalist like Tarja (check out some of her early opera work on the Internet and you'll see that she can even hit higher notes that Tarja can't), but what makes Floor special is how she can also bring it like a true heavy metal rock star - screams and all (unlike Annette who I felt didn't have much vocal talent).Maybe I was expecting more songs in the style closer to those heard on their last few albums (Imaginaerum, Dark Passion Play, Once) because it felt like Jansen would be able to bring the right mix of opera/metal like she showed she could do on the ""Showtime Storytime"" DVD, but that wasn't what I got out of this latest album. I should have seen this coming, as the first single released from this album (""Elan"") wasn't so much the ""rock out Nightwish"", but it felt more commercial, almost radio-friendly crossover-type music - as opposed to the chanting, the heavy metal riffs, and the symphonic formula that the better Nightwish songs tend to stick to.So in the end, this album to me is just ""okay"". It's not their best, and it's not their worst - but I feel like it is a waste in that they wasted a golden opportunity to use Floor Jansen's vocals to their fullest. Too bad, because at the rate Nightwish usually goes with album releases, we can't expect to hear more songs with Floor for at least another 2 years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUPMACP4M6Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6K4UMK#wasThisHelpful","RDUPMACP4M6Z9","ASREZFXN55U2R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASREZFXN55U2R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an exceptionally interesting Franco-Flemish programme. It is built around a parody Mass by Philippe Verdelot on the motet by Jean Richafort 'Philomena praevia' – this being also included on the disc, together with other motets, a few antiphons and organ works interspersed between the Mass movements. Richafort's motet, in turn, is a setting of an extract from the medieval Latin poem by the English Franciscan friar (and later Archbishop of Canterbury) John Pecham or Peckham. This extraordinarily imaginative poem tells the story of Christ's life and death as expressed through the empathetic song of a nightingale, who accompanies Christ on his journey through life; when Christ dies, so does the nightingale. Of course none of this narrative is contained in the text of the Mass; but a parody Mass often constitutes, at least in part, a reflection on the content of its model. In fact, Richafort's motet evidently attracted some attention and was parodied by several composers including Gombert, Verdelot and Sermisy; Sermisy's very lovely setting was recorded as part of the sixth and last volume of the Leiden Choirbooks.Philippe Verdelot (c. 1470-1552) was a younger contemporary of Josquin, and at least one contemporary writer considered Verdelot's music comparable to that of Josquin and Clemens non Papa. The substantial dose of his music on the present disc is very fine indeed. In addition to the sombre but splendid Mass itself, the opening item is a lovely and uplifting eight-part motet, 'Gaudent in coelis', performed in sonorous style by the singers and trombones of the early-music ensemble Delitiae Musicae. This mixed voice-and-instrument scoring of what was originally intended as vocal music is perhaps not to all tastes, but it suits my own very well and it is certainly finely executed here. In fact, the male single voices of this Italian ensemble, sometimes with trombones and organ, do an excellent job throughout the programme. Marco Longhini is an outstanding director of early music, as he has shown in many other recordings, and here again he brings style, panache and an overall vision to the music which result in a compelling, varied and well-organised programme.Other moments especially worth mentioning are Verdelot's 'Si bona suscepimus' (track 10), beautifully performed by solo countertenor Claudio Cavina with four trombones; the instrumental Offertorium (16) played by trombones, with organ joining in later on - and just in case you think four trombones sound like a bit of a bore, they're certainly not so here, played with expressive rubato in the right places and reaching a splendid climax. After the Agnus Dei, Verdelot provides another very lovely eight-part motet, 'Salve Regina' (22-24), and the disc ends with Richafort's model four-part motet. The short chant passages at a few points in the programme are also very nicely done, aided by the recording in a sonorous church acoustic with a lovely ambience.The booklet notes are well up to the standard of the rest, and offer a real enhancement to one's appreciation of the music. In addition to ample information about the composer, the essay traces the tradition and procedures of the parody Mass, not just in the present example but in historical terms. The one thing not covered is any explanation of the origin of Richafort's 'Philomena' motet text, so one needs to find this out from elsewhere. Texts and translations are all provided, except for the opening 'Gaudent' motet for some reason.This recording should be of considerable interest to renaissance enthusiasts, but unfortunately it's become very hard to find. At the time of writing it's still available here on the US amazon.com site at a reasonable cost, but from European sites only at ridiculous prices. It's also available as a download.

"Michel-Richard de Lalande, otherwise known as Delalande, was Master of the King's Music at the court of Louis XIV, and the king's most favoured composer after the death of Lully. Louis XIV liked, and could afford, to have music for all kinds of occasion, including sacred, secular and operatic, and some of Delalande's finest works are the sacred motets of which, like his great predecessor, he was a master.In a different category, however, are the 185 pieces composed to be played, as the title indicates, to accompany the king's suppers. They include a wide variety of forms and instruments, and were arranged into twelve suites. The present four-disc set was the first complete recording of all the Symphonies composed for Louis XIV; it was originally issued in 1990 and is now re-issued at a very handy price. Most of the suites begin with an Ouverture, and the subsequent movements include many short dance pieces, the more substantial forms of Chaconne and Passacaille, a few Caprices and the occasional Air. The latter are restored for this recording to their original version of airs for soprano.Instrumentation is varied, ranging from trumpets and percussion in the ceremonial, martial or hunt-style pieces to the more gentle, subtle tones of woodwind and strings and continuo where appropriate. There's a great variety of mood, pace and texture here, with Hugo Reyne's capable period-instrument band playing in excellent and spirited style throughout. The use of percussion provides further variety and colour in places, with some especially fine work on castanets to liven things up.And it does need livening up, for really this is mostly rather shallow music. It's no wonder because, while the Sun King undoubtedly had good musical taste, he wouldn't have wanted anything profound sounding forth while he was eating his supper and chatting away, as you do – and, judging by the contents of these discs, what the king didn't want he didn't get. There's plenty of light, graceful and superficially attractive music, with a few reflective moments. But the most interesting pieces for me are the more substantial Chaconnes, Passacailles, and the occasional Ouverture – and certainly not all of the latter, some of which are distinctly underdeveloped compared with those of Lully, Rameau, not to mention Bach, Handel, Telemann or a host of others.If you're irresistibly attached to the occasional music of Versailles, and fancy having more than five hours of it available to listen to, then this set will satisfy. But nobody in their right mind would want to hear it all at once – not even on the car stereo for a long haul on the motorway. I would stress that I don't want to knock a very fine composer, but I greatly prefer Lalande's sacred music, his motets whether 'grand' or 'petit'. He was also reputed to be an outstanding organist and keyboard player, and no doubt he would have been well able to craft some beautiful instrumental and chamber works; but unfortunately, as far as we know, nobody asked him to - or, if they did, none has survived.For me, the fault of this set lies with the music's purpose and with the Sun King himself, and not with his Master of Music. Reyne's Simphonie du Marais do the best they can with all this undemanding musical fare, and their performances really can't be faulted. The booklet notes are fairly brief, but informative all the same. No texts are given for the few sung pieces, but that's not a serious worry here. It's all in a nicely compact box, and won't take up much space on your shelves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8SMU0YACE1BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I5O0YY#wasThisHelpful","R8SMU0YACE1BN","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 was a key event in European history, bringing what at least was hoped would be an end to two centuries of almost uninterrupted warfare. It was much celebrated at the time, and this disc brings us two excellent works composed for the occasion: one from Handel - the so-called Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate - and the Ode for the Peace of Utrecht by Handel's contemporary William Croft. Also interesting in Handel's case is the fact that the commission for this work was a significant factor in prompting the great Saxon to settle in London.Handel's energetic two-part work has a youthful vigour ansd spontaneity about it, unlike his much later Dettingen Te Deum which is every bit as fine but more majestic and serene in character. Ithe Utrecht piece is deleivered here by the well-balanced choir and orchestra of the Netherlands Bach Society, directed in great style by Jos van Veldhoven. The instruments form a suitably substantial baroque band; the singing of the choir is excellent, spirited, and in excellent English with no discernible accents; the fine team of soloists are mainly British and do an equally good job. These are superb Handel performances, if anything even more impressive in the shorter Jubilate.The work by Croft, otherwise called by its opening line 'With Noise of Cannons', starts with an arresting and attractive instrumental Overture, and in fact the entire work sounds remarkably Handelian – which cannot be anything other than a great compliment. The title verse doesn't actually include any cannon, of course, but it's a vigorous, warlike piece sung here by bass Peter Harvey on excellent form.The alto aria 'Nor will we ev'n the Martial Trumpet spare', is nicely sung by William Towers, accompanied by fine passages for trumpet of which Handel himself would have been proud.The final chorus, 'Where, Mighty Anna, will thy Glories end' is written to a suitably grovelling text in praise of Queen Anne, but makes a rousing close for all that.Croft's enjoyable piece stands up extremely well in the Saxon's company, and should be of considerable interest to baroque enthusiasts who are unfamiliar with it. The booklet, apart from a few oddities, such as poor titling of some of the tracks and showing the choir singing 'serve the Lord with galdness', has all texts and excellent notes, and there are lovely illustrations in both booklet and CD pack. Recorded sound is first-class, and altogether this is a very fine, enjoyable and enterprising programme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MQ4OTG0FSJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KK7MIA#wasThisHelpful","R19MQ4OTG0FSJY","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Composers in the time of the English Civil War had a hard job plying their trade during those  miserable times, and their reputations have never quite recovered as a result. William Lawes, thanks to some very fine recordings, has come a long way towards overcoming that handicap, but Henry Lawes and Christopher Simpson, for example, are little known today compared with their Elizabethan and Jacobean forebears and their Restoration successors. This relative obscurity is entirely undeserved, and the present recording is a beautiful demonstration of this.Simpson's 'Twenty Ayres for Two Trebles and Two Basses' are here recorded for the first time, and their music is absolutely lovely. Arranged into several suites or sequences, each one starts with a solemn, contemplative or melancholy Pavin, followed by other airs and dances which are wistful rather than joyous - that wistful quality perfectly captured here by the players of the Chelys Consort of Viols. The Sarabandes, on the other hand, are more lively in the hands of these players than we might usually expect from the format; so each suite forms a remarkably integrated work. While the 'Ayres' of the disc's title refer to Simpson's publication, the 'Graces' reflect the manner of playing expected for the times, and indeed equally generously present in this performance.The sequences of Ayres are interspersed here with four sets of Divisions, again for viols. Each one of these is a small masterpiece. It's hard to pick out favourites, because there's not a single dull moment here, but I found especially lovely the two division sets on tracks 8 and 9 - captivating music, deeply involving and, again, played by the Consort with soulful depth and unity of feeling. The final sequence of airs, nos. 8-13 in D major (tracks 19-24), is absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. The entire programme is beautiful in melody and texture, and Simpson's superb music is played with love, sensitivity and total conviction.The booklet is nicely illustrated and the notes are excellent. I hadn't heard the Chelys Consort of Viols until now, but I hope they will bring us plenty more music of this quality. I've only just finished reviewing another early-music disc and felt compelled to write something like 'I'd give it six stars if I could'. But now it seems I have to say the same again about this one, so it looks as if star inflation is looming! Early music fans are sure to be delighted with this music and, if you are, then I'd also recommend Christopher Simpson: The Seasons, The Monthes & other divisions of Time - 1.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENDDGV36PQM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6GZVEQ#wasThisHelpful","RENDDGV36PQM5","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a collection of Italian instrumental works from the late renaissance and early baroque, illustrating the art of the wind band. A few of the pieces are transcribed from motets and other vocal works, as was common practice in those times. Composers represented include the two Gabrielis, Palestrina, Vecchio, Malvezzi, Bassano, Salomone Rossi, and a few others whose works have occasionally appeared on other recitals of this kind.Ensemble Ventosum are a French-based period instrument ensemble, here playing mainly cornetti and sackbuts. The best-known of them is the outstanding cornettist William Dongois. Their playing is mostly excellent, although in places lacking in panache or exhilaration. The chosen pieces, which were nearly all unfamiliar to me, range from very fine to a bit on the dull side. Some of the more sombre works, such as those for four trombones with nothing else to brighten the tone, are rather ponderous pieces which I didn't much enjoy.On the other hand, the items that are brighter in mood and texture work very well. These latter include Gussago's 'Sonata undecima' (track 9), its attractive melodies and harmonies enhanced by brilliant divisions from the two cornetti; and Andrea Gabrieli's 'Maria stabat ad monumentum' for cornetto and organ (11) is both graceful and enthralling. The last item on the disc, Neri's 'Sonata à sei', rounds off the programme very nicely – again, a cheerful and enjoyable work that is beautifully delivered here.The disc is well presented, with excellent notes and fine illustrations on the cover. The main drawback for me is in aspects of the choice of works, some of which are of dubious interest. But there also is some fine music here, and it's mostly very nicely performed and recorded.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0YJ13YFM1XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLDSC8Q#wasThisHelpful","RO0YJ13YFM1XT","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johann Hermann Schein (1586-1630), one of the so-called 'three Ss' of the German baroque although there were actually more than this, was an extremely talented and versatile composer. He was one of the early Thomaskantors in Leipzig and produced sacred and secular vocal, as well as instrumental music. I have liked everything I have ever heard from his pen, and this present disc is one of the best.The works of his 'Musica boscareccia' (woodland songs) are sophisticated, beautifully scored and melodic pastoral pieces in the Italianate villanella style. Their lyrical German texts are mainly love songs, addressed to the usual suspects such as Phyllis, Corydon, Tirsi and Delia. If that doesn't sound too promising, don't be put off; for not only are the texts touching and genuinely poetic, but the music is heartfelt, varied and delightful. The soloists are two sopranos and a bass, all three of them excellent; there are usually two singing an item but occasionally all three, and they're accompanied by a varied period-instrument ensemble. The German-based United Continuo Ensemble, although their name sounds a bit like an airline or a transport company, are in fact an extremely talented and stylish bunch of musicians. They include viola da gamba, keyboard, recorder and three more on plucking and strumming duties, with Thor-Harald Johnsen directing with great flair.The nineteen works here, mostly vocal but with a handful of instrumental pieces interspersed, are full of engaging melodies, delicious harmonies and varying, inventive rhythms. This is beautifully crafted music full of poetry, feeling and delicacy. Among my favourite items are 'Concordia zu jeder Zeit' (track 1), immediately winning over the listener with its attractive melody sung in duet by the two beautifully clear soprano voices. Others favourites include ''Unverhofft kommet oft' (5), 'O seidene Härelein' (O silken hair/your tight loops/ensnare trapped hands/with love./No chains of steel and iron/can be as strong./Who would tear your tresses,/tied so firmly round this lover's hand?) (7); 'Mirtillo mein' (9), 'Padouana' (11), Gagliarda-Courente (13), and the instrumental 'O Cordion' (15).Altogether, this is winning, sunlit music, all the more remarkable from a composer who died at the age of 44 after a short life of cruel family tragedies. What's more, these performances are a delight, and the recorded sound very nicely conveys the musicians' bright, bucolic tones. Notes are excellent, all texts and translations are given. An outstanding and heart-warming disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDPT7NNDHJQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TQQWDW#wasThisHelpful","RCDPT7NNDHJQB","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a programme of Polish baroque music for Christmas, including works by Marcin Mielczewski (c. 1600-1651) and others. It was recorded in a Warsaw church by a substantial ensemble of choir, soloists and instrumentalists, numbering around 40 performers in some of the items, directed by Robert Pozarski.The central item is the 'Missa pro Nativitate' by Mielczewski, but unfortunately it's not one of the better works I've heard from this otherwise extremely fine composer. The Mass movements, for choir, soloists and instruments, are in pastoral style and largely homophonic, with nothing in the way of striking or memorable melodies. While voices and instruments all do their work very well, the choir is too large for the purpose and the direction is ponderous and lack-lustre, while the recorded sound is muddy and remarkably boxy by modern standards, reminding me a bit of the early days of vinyl recordings.The movements of the Mass are interspersed with chant passages, a few motets and some instrumental pieces. The chant sections, sung variously by the lower male solo voices and choir, may be liturgically correct but are far too long for my listening taste, even though they are actually very well performed. The opening track, for example, consists of over 10 minutes of sung antiphon before we even get to the real music; altogether, there's around 40 minutes of chant in this 78-minute recording. Once I've heard these for the first time, I invariably skip them after that in order to get on with the real music.However, there are some decent works in this programme. Mielczewski's motet 'Currite populi' (track 2) is an attractive piece, well performed here by choir and players, but again compromised by the negative factors already mentioned above. The anonymous pastoral Christmas motet 'Parvule pupule' (sleep, poor country boy), which gives its name to the programme, is also very finely sung by two sopranos (female and boy) and beautifully supported by instruments (10). There are a couple of fine instrumental works too (14 and 17), as well as an enjoyable 'Pastorela' for soloists, choir and instruments (18), and a noisy, cheerful closing motet 'Gloria in excelsis Deo' by Stanislaw Szarzynski.Booklet notes and documentation are generally good but, oddly, the texts are given in Polish and English translations but without the Latin originals. Altogether the programme and its performance constitute an honest and dedicated effort by the musicians, some of whom are very good indeed; while the poorly-considered choice of works includes a few worthwhile items but with extended passages of little interest. If you really want to know what Polish baroque composers could do, I would strongly recommend these instead: Mielczewski: Virgo Prudentissima and Adoration of the Virgin Mary at the Polish Court.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA00C0HEI9TEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8LYQCU#wasThisHelpful","RA00C0HEI9TEL","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This substantial and sumptuously-presented pair of discs consists of two rather different projects. The first – and the more interesting of the two in my view – is a speculative reconstruction of the sacred music performed at that great meeting in 1520 of the kings of France and England and their vast retinues, known as the Field of the Cloth of Gold. It is not known exactly which works were performed for this occasion, but according to contemporary descriptions a Mass was sung, with successive movements from English musicians and composers on the one hand, and from their French counterparts on the other.It must have been a grand, as well as musically fascinating, ceremony – all the more so since both kings, enthusiastic and tasteful patrons of the arts in any case, set out to celebrate peace and at the same time to impress their erstwhile adversaries. For the purpose of the present project, performed by the early music ensemble Doulce Mémoire, their director Denis Raisin Dadre makes some astute choices. The Kyrie is taken from Claudin de Sermisy's 5-voice 'Missa Quare fremuerunt gentes', the Gloria from Nicholas Ludford's 6-part 'Missa Benedicta et venerabilis', followed by a 6-part Credo by the French Antoine Divitis. Then it's back to Ludford for Sanctus and Benedictus, and to Sermisy's Mass for the Agnus Dei, this time in 8 parts. The Mass movements are introduced by an instrumental Pavane by Attaingnant, and then interspersed with plainchant passages, motets by Jean Mouton, and spoken contemporary descriptions of the occasion.This amounts to a substantial and extremely impressive Mass performance, full of variety and lasting 70 minutes. For the French Mass sections, as was the practice at the time according to Raisin Dadre's excellent booklet notes, the voices are doubled by wind instruments, while Ludford's Mass movements are sung a cappella. In both music and performance, then, this Mass for the Field of the Cloth of Gold is unlike the normal unified entity of the renaissance Mass, but the rationale for the alternating multi-national procedure adopted for this programme is clear enough and in fact it works very well. Sermisy's Kyrie (track 4) alone is a magnificent structure, a considerable 8-minute movement in sumptuous sound, sung here with two voices per part doubled by cornetti, shawms and sackbuts. In contrast to Sermisy's Franco-Flemish polyphony, Ludford's Mass sections are in a very different style – his graceful, melismatic lines sung here by voices alone. Divitis' Credo is a fine work too, again receiving a sumptuous performance here from voices doubled by instruments. Sermisy's Agnus Dei is once again superb, and I would greatly love to hear the whole work one of these days. Voices and instruments all do a terrific job, performing with conviction and in excellent style. The recorded sound, in Fontevraud abbey, is superb, with a fine ambience as well as exemplary clarity enabling us to follow each voice.The second disc, titled 'La Chambre du Roy' and recorded in the magnificent Loire chateau of Chambord, offers a selection of the secular music forms favoured by Franois Ier. So we hear a sequence of chanson settings interspersed with instrumental pavanes, galliards and basses danses. The personnel, while still chosen from the Doulce Mémoire ensemble, are partially different here, with single voices for each chanson part, sometimes accompanied by instruments, and the instrumental pieces played by recorder consort with lutes and percussion. The works are well organised, but by no means all of great interest. One of the better aspects of the procedure applied here is the pairing of settings of the same chanson by two different composers, which makes for interesting comparisons.The star composer here, for me, is Pierre Certon, whose settings of chansons from his 'Meslanges' collection are superb; his song of lost love 'Je suis déshéritée' (CD2, track 3) is most beautiful; the performance of the engaging melody 'Tant que vivray' (14), for solo soprano and recorders, is delightful, and Certon's setting of 'Contentez-vous' (29) is absolutely lovely. Here again, it would be great to hear a complete recording of his 'Meslanges' collection sometime. However, I also have to say that quite a few other works on this second disc are nothing special. As for performance, most of the voices are OK, but I don't think much of countertenor Paulin Bündgen; the percussionist is also extremely irritating in places, for my taste drawing far too much attention to himself with unnecessary smart-alec flourishes.Musically, then, this paired programme is a mixed bag, the first part being a complete success while the second is far less so. Matters are almost redeemed, however, by the set's presentation, in the form of a lavish 130-page book with stunning illustrations making it a true visual delight – as well as detailed and absorbing notes by director Raisin Dadre and others, full texts and translations and all the documentation you could wish for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OX4U6KYEHKV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZ0ANM2#wasThisHelpful","R3OX4U6KYEHKV5","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"François Dieupart (c.1667-c.1740), his first name sometimes given as Charles, unlike many French musicians of his time was never a court composer. Rather, he was very much of an individualist who went his own way, and it shows in his music. From 1700 he moved to London, working mainly as a teacher and keyboard performer, and remained there until his death in poverty and relative obscurity. He didn't deserve such a fate - as his published work, admittedly limited in quantity, clearly demonstrates.His most important work was this set of six suites, published in 1701 (not 1717 as stated in the booklet notes). They were scored for recorder or flute and continuo, as in the present performance, but he also published a version for solo keyboard which I've reviewed elsewhere: Dieupart: Harpsichord Suites / Gremy-Chauliac. The suites make very fine keyboard music, but I still have a slight preference for the music in the present format. The six works, each consisting of a French overture and series of dance movements - of the kind now familiar from many works by Bach, Telemann and others - are very impressive pieces indeed. The Overtures in particular have a certain grandeur in spite of their modest scoring, each one both distinctive and inventive and containing thematic elements of the subsequent series of dance movements. The format thus results in a very satisfyingly unified work in each case, and it's not surprising that Bach greatly admired them.The six suites are played for this 1992 disc by Hugo Reyne on recorder, with basso continuo provided by viola da gamba, archlute and harpsichord. Reyne has become better known recently as director of the baroque ensemble La Simphonie du Marais. The small but impressive cast of players includes Philippe Pierlot and Pierre Hantaï. The playing is beautiful, stylish and elegant throughout, with, of course, a starring role for Hugo Reyne on two lovely period instruments - a 'flûte de voix' (tenor recorder) for suites 1 to 4, and a ' flûte du quatre' in the form of an especially fine B flat instrument for Suites 5 and 6. My own favourite movement here is the Overture to Suite 5, and in fact this whole suite is lovely; in addition to the Overtures to each suite, I found the Sarabandes beautiful too.Altogether, this is lovely music in a superb performance and recording. It's getting hard to find now, but fortunately it's also currently available as part of a two-disc reissue coupled with music by Purcell Purcell · Dieupart - Suites for recorder / La Simphonie du Marais · Hugo Reyne. There's also a 2001 recording of these Dieupart works by Colpron, Napper and Sempé on the Atma label, Six Suites, spread over two discs but providing strong competition with the present one. And then there are recordings of the keyboard versions as well. The comparison between the two scorings is fascinating in itself but, either way, this is French baroque music of the very highest quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC1W2JLUKEWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002532L#wasThisHelpful","R1QC1W2JLUKEWT","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her playing is energetic, stylish, subtle and brilliant in decorative facility. I especially enjoyed Suite no. 5, above all its magnificent Ouverture.My own personal favourites among the French baroque keyboard masters include Chambonnières, D'Anglebert, Forqueray and Louis Couperin, and I wouldn't claim that Dieupart's music necessarily measures up to that of these other great masters - not, at least, in these versions for solo keyboard in view of the preference I've expressed above. But there is a fascinating comparison to be made between the two scorings. In any case, Grémy-Chauliac's outstanding performance, her lovely instrument and the excellent recorded sound are such that it would be immoral to give this any less than five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGG5UVMLD0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JBDF#wasThisHelpful","R2YGG5UVMLD0I","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was prompted to read this excellent book after visiting modern-day Wroclaw and learning about its past – and, in particular, of the terrible ordeal experienced in the final months of World War 2 by the city formerly known as Breslau. There are already a number of detailed and thorough reviews here on Amazon, so I won't repeat too much of what others have written.I agree with the assessments of most fellow reviewers. This is a gripping and terrifying story, told in compelling and sometimes horrifying detail by Richard Hargreaves. The amount and quality of the writer's research are phenomenal; the story is greatly enhanced by his quotations of accounts from so many people, on all sides of the conflict, who were there and who witnessed and suffered the terrors of a great city under merciless siege by the Red Army – and under even more merciless orders from the Führer and his underlings to hold out at all costs.I must admit that, terrible as their ordeal was, I found it hard to work up too much sympathy for the civilian population. They'd been happy enough when the boot was on the other foot as Hitler's armies wrought death and brutal havoc on the peoples of eastern Europe, with little thought that they might eventually find out how it felt to be on the receiving end for a change. Likewise with the ruthless 'Vertreibung', the expulsion of German civilians westwards from what now became Polish territory. It was, of course, Stalin's will that Polish borders should be shifted westwards as soon as the war ended – and inevitably, at that point in history, what Stalin wanted, Stalin got. As a result, many thousands of Polish people arrived in the city from places further east such as Lwów, and treated the departing Germans with considerably more hatred and brutality than they'd suffered at the hands of the Red Army. Human nature being what it is, I don't believe the former Breslauers should have been all that surprised.Even today, the far right in Germany are still harping on about nostalgia for their former Schlesien and their alleged right to recover it and other lands they lost as a result of the war. It's a very dubious point, because the Germans had seized Silesia in the first place, under Frederick II in the 18th century, and other parts of Poland under Bismarck in the 19th century. Be that as it may, they would clearly need to start World War 3 in order to do anything about it. But for as long as people remember the use they made of Polish lands at the likes of Auschwitz, Sobibor and Treblinka, nobody is about to let any of that happen. So they may as well leave it alone.In a final chapter referring briefly to Wroclaw's post-war history, Richard Hargreaves touches on the nostalgia question, but perhaps more objectively than I have just done. The fact is that Wroclaw is now a modern Polish city, although still bearing some of the scars of war and of the quick-and-ugly approach to housing reconstruction under a communist regime in the fifties and sixties. But the city also has a busy and thriving population, one of Poland's great universities, a cathedral and other fine churches, a superbly reconstructed market square (Rynek) and old town hall (Ratusz), and - unlike Edinburgh, 20 miles from where I'm writing this - an extensive and practical tram network. It's a far cry from the misery, rubble, fire and destruction so vividly described in Hargreaves' fascinating study.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBK1069ES95Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848845154#wasThisHelpful","RBK1069ES95Z7","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Giovanni Girolamo Kapsberger (c. 1580-1651) is mainly known nowadays for his instrumental music, especially for lute. But this Venetian-born composer, of German parentage and moving on to a distinguished career in Rome, was a highly original and versatile musician who wrote in many formats. And, judging from the present disc, he was an outstanding composer for the voice.'I Pastori di Bettelemme' is a musical 'pastorale' in the then modern concertante style, an imaginative reflection upon the story of the shepherds and the Nativity. There are five shepherds here, a narrator (Testo) and an angel, as well as a handful of instruments to accompany the vocal pieces and to provide a few instrumental interludes. Most of the vocal music is for the shepherds – two sopranos, countertenor, tenor and bass – and it is all very lovely indeed, with a mixture of arioso, villanella-like songs and melodically engaging homophonic choruses. Although the atmosphere, as set by the instrumental introduction, is intermittently pastoral in flavour, the vocal music is sophisticated, demanding and beautifully embellished with many virtuoso solo passages.There are a few interspersed pieces by Kapsberger and his contemporary Giovanni Lorenzo Baldano; some of these are instrumental - Paso e mezo, Sinfonia, Corrente, Piva - and others are Latin motets such as the beautiful 'Hodie Christus natus est' (track 11) with lovely, complex embellishments for solo soprano. Later on, the lullaby for the baby Jesus, 'Dormi figlio' (22) for two sopranos, is quite captivating. Instruments used at various points include psaltery, strings, harp, chitarrone, recorder and organ; the instrumental works are judiciously interspersed, they greatly enhance both atmosphere and enjoyment, and they are all beautifully played.Apart from Kapsberger's music itself, however, the greatest assets of this recording are the overall conception, the scoring and the delightful performances by all six singers. On the first point, no director is named in the booklet, nor on the website of the Echo du Danube ensemble; but I would guess that viola da gambist Christian Zincke and psaltery-player Elisabeth Seitz may have had leading roles in the conception of the present CD. As for the singers, once again the booklet documentation lists them all but doesn't indicate who sings what, so I can only list them here - sopranos Constanze Backes, Chiyuki Okamura and Clementine Jesdinsky, countertenor Franz Vitzthum, tenor Christian Dietz, and bass Markus Flaig - and emphasise that they are all wonderful. I would reserve a special mention for the soprano in the part of Primo Pastore, if only I knew who it was!The booklet notes are excellent and all texts and translations are provided. However, there are a couple of frustrating aspects to the documentation. The first is, as already stated, that there is no indication of who is singing which role or item; so the three sopranos can get no credit where it's due, except collectively of course. The second is that the texts are not placed in the same order as the music on the disc; instead, those of the additional inserted works are shown separately at the end, so we have to keep on searching back and forth in the booklet if we want to follow the text – a stupid arrangement, and inevitably irritating to the listener.Musically, however, this is a fascinating disc of delightful baroque vocal music in a really outstanding performance. Full marks without a doubt!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OF5ZINN9JMRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042GNE60#wasThisHelpful","R3OF5ZINN9JMRJ","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first recording of one of Cavalli's lesser-known late works, not to be confused with the composer's beautiful 'Vespero della beata Vergine' of which a couple of superb recordings already exist, including Cavalli: Vespro Della Beata Vergine, also issues as Cavalli: Vespero Della Beata Vergine Maria. The present work, in my view, is well below par by Cavalli's standards; I found it distinctly prosaic, lacking Cavalli's customary expressive flair and melodic inspiration. Extended passages in most of the fourteen motets consist of little more than choral recitative, with no real continuity or momentum, let alone memorable melodies.The scoring is impressive, with double ripieno and favorito choirs, wind instruments and continuo. Director Bruno Gini uses substantial vocal forces, with each of the two choirs numbering about 15 voices - all this amounting to a total of about 50 musicians. Frankly, it's just too much for the music. The unremitting 'colla parte' accompaniment by cornetti and trombones of all the choir voices, and the equally obtrusive organ playing along with the soloists' 'favorito' sections, all result in a thick, unsubtle texture which deprives the singing of its expressive power. This is a great pity, because the singers themselves - both choirs and soloists - are very good; they simply don't get a chance to be heard at their best. It's true that there's a certain grandeur about it all; but exciting, or even graceful, it isn't.Things liven up remarkably well for the final item on the agenda, the Magnificat Quinti Toni. Some of the above criticisms still apply, but this time there is more contrast in pace and texture, and more effective use of the favorito groups. So it works much better here, and clearly it's a fine piece in its own right.Apart from this last work, however, the disc as a whole is a great disappointment - all the more so since director Roberto Gini has made some fine recordings, including a very good Monteverdi Vespers, and individually his musicians do their work extremely well. The booklet notes are good, and Latin texts are provided but without translations. Cavalli is one of my favourite composers, but I'm sorry to say that this is not among his better works and in the present recording - apart from that Magnificat - the music just doesn't come off.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSC7PR7TUL60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFMVJCO#wasThisHelpful","RSC7PR7TUL60","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a typically eccentric programme from the excellent early music ensemble Capella de la Torre, directed by shawm player Katharina Bäuml. I must admit I was a bit dubious at first, thinking that this idea of a programme of music relating to water, nymphs and sirens would be a somewhat artificial concoction. Well, actually it is; but, as it turns out, the quality of the music together with the flair and musicianship of the band soon won me over.The selection is a well-organised mixture of vocal and instrumental pieces from the renaissance and early baroque, with a strong but by no means exclusive Italian content. As is usual with this ensemble, a majority of the pieces are unashamedly rescored or rearranged to suit the band's personnel – in this case soprano and counternor, two shawms, recorder, trombone, bass dulcian, lute or theorbo, organ and percussion. As for the works chosen, they include a goodly number of fine pieces which I've never encountered before. Some of their connections to the stated theme are tenuous, but are boldly justified in the interesting booklet notes, supported by appropriate information on the mythology of water gods and other aquatic themes and creatures.The varied sequence of vocal and instrumental works, mostly secular, includes music from composers such as Michael Praetorius, Willaert, Josquin, Morley, Holborne, Gibbons, Victoria, Arcadelt, Marenzio and Ghizzolo. Among items of particular interest are Fabritio Caroso's 'Laura Suave' (track 3), which turns out to be a very charming version of the catchy Aria di Firenze, sometimes known as Ballo del Granduca, from the Florentine Intermedii 'La Pellegrina' of 1589 - so many names! Then there's Anthony Holborne's 'The Fruit of Love' and 'The Funerals' – the latter somewhat crudely scored for the present complement, whereas I much prefer to hear it played by the customary viol consort. Also, the rendering of Josquin's 'Nymphes nappés/Circumdederunt me' (10) is too light-hearted for my liking.Lorenzo Allegri's 'Quinto ballo detto le ninfe di Senna' is lovely (11), and the anonymous 'Les nymphes de la Grenouillère' (17) brings delightfully onomatopoeic frog noises from the instruments. Robert Johnson's 'Full Fathom Five' (18) is beautifully done by countertenor and instruments. There's a decent chaconne-like piece composed by the ensemble's lute player Johannes Vogt, 'Canto' for lute and percussion (21), which thankfully goes well enough with all the old stuff here. And the two 'swan' pieces, Arcadelt's 'Il bianco e dolce cigno' (20) and Orlando Gibbons' 'The Silver Swan' (22), are both absolutely beautiful.While I sometimes find it hard to take the drastic rescoring, and the lack of information or explanation about such measures, committed by Katharina Bäuml and her ensemble, there's no denying that the results here are mostly delightful. The musicianship in this programme is outstanding, with especially fine contributions from countertenor Benno Schachtner and soprano Cécile Kempenaers, both of them not only sounding good but sensitive and highly responsive to the texts, and with faultless English pronunciation where applicable. The booklet is very nicely illustrated with old maritime and mythological prints, as well as some session photos, and all texts and translations are given. The booklet notes are well translated into English by someone with the suspicious-sounding name of ??? (sic).Altogether, this collection offers an exquisite illustration of the power of music to move and to delight. As I mentioned above, I hesitated over it to start with but, once heard, it will certainly be getting plenty more hearings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377HBKEK1DGLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF7P1PQ#wasThisHelpful","R377HBKEK1DGLZ","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow (1663-1712), organist and director of music at the Marktkirche in Halle, is perhaps best known (when known at all) for having been Handel's teacher. He wrote numerous church cantatas as well as organ works; and, of the latter, all that survive are included on these two CDs.These are slight, short-winded pieces on the whole. There are around seventy works in all here, most of them lasting only a minute or two each. The majority are settings of Lutheran chorales, with a sprinkling of freely-composed works such as Preludes, Fugues and a Fantasia or two. The chorales are brief, decorated treatments of the Lutheran hymns, not developed or demanding in any way. Zachow's setting of 'Es ist das Heil uns kommen her' lasts just over two minutes – an extraordinary contrast, for example, to the masterly and supremely inventive cycle on the same theme by the earlier Hamburg organist Matthias Weckmann, which brings us around half an hour of stunning music in each of the various recordings available.Only in Zachow's 'Jesu, meine Freude' does the chorale tune get treated to a series of variations amounting to a good few minutes of joined-up music. This shows that the composer was perfectly capable of writing more extended pieces – as also do his cantatas, in fact – and a few of the freely-composed organ works here have the same effect. I can only assume that the requirements of his post, or the expectations of his congregation, imposed limits on the length of these chorale-based compositions. In fact they are unambitious but entertaining works, lively and inventive, with the result that for most of the time you're left feeling disappointed when they stop so soon.Organist Irénée Peyrot makes the best possible case for this unpretentious but enjoyable music, with able and stylish playing on two very fine-sounding late baroque instruments. This set won't take you very deeply into the world of great baroque organ music, but it was a worthwhile project and it's been very well carried out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHBOQJ6HFQEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YBTFQI#wasThisHelpful","RTHBOQJ6HFQEQ","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful programme of works by two Franco-Flemish composers and associates of the post-Josquin generation, who both made their names and careers in Italy. It's performed by an excellent group of singers, the Ensemble Jachet de Mantoue consisting of five male voices, joined here by a female soprano, and also in some of the works by the cornetti and sackbuts of Les Sacqueboutiers de Toulouse.Jachet de Mantoue, otherwise known as Jacquet of Mantua, provides the main work on the disc, a parody Mass based on his own motet 'Enceladi Coeique Soror'. The motet is also offered here (track 3). As is often found in such cases, the subject matter of the model motet is of crucial significance for the musical content of the Mass itself. As is well explained in the booklet notes, the motet text ostensibly concerns the mythological figure of Fama, messenger of Zeus, a fearsome winged creature who roamed the world proclaiming to all and sundry the intimate secrets of mortals. But it turns out that, for Jachet's purposes, the text is used here as an advert for the highly prized horses of the composer's patron, Duke Gonzaga of Mantua.The motet itself is beautifully sung by a capella voices, its lines clearly stated, easily followed and thus enhancing our appreciation of the following item, the parody Mass itself. The Mass is grander in texture, the voices supported 'colla parte' by the wind players, and this results in a highly effective contrast between motet and Mass. The music of the Mass, taking its cue from its model, is lively and bright in texture. The Mass is preceded and followed by a few motets by Jachet and by Adrian Willaert, and its movements are also interspersed with others. Some of these are of great interest, iincluding 'Dum vastos Adriae fluctus' (13), a tribute to Josquin which contains several quotations from the master's own motets, their sources being helpfully indicated in the CD booklet. A couple of items are played by instruments alone, especially fine being Willaert's 'Victor io, salve' (12), an energetic, triumphant piece. The two psalm settings which end the programme are curiosities which I personally found to be of lesser interest.Like the recent issue of music by Jachet/Jacquet sung by the Brabant Ensemble, Jacquet of Mantua: Missa Surge Petre, the present programme brings us music of the highest quality, beautifully performed, and it represents an extremely enterprising choice and arrangement of the composer's works. The varied combinations of fine voices and instruments work superbly, and it would really be hard to fault any aspect of these performances. Apart from the unfortunate omission of the first 'o' in the word 'countertenor', booklet documentation, notes and illustrations are excellent; texts and translations are given for the motets but not for the Mass - a forgivable omission, I suppose. This recording has been around since 2004, so there are probably only a few copies still available from European sources including Amazon; but it was also re-issued at some point as part of a three-disc set of Jachet's music by the ensemble.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q27OZHIHJF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH861FQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Q27OZHIHJF5","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Handel's allegorical semi-oratorio, impossible to classify any more precisely than that, is a marvellous example of music and poetry combined in the expression of man’s place in the world – this, of course, as viewed in the age of enlightenment. With a text by Milton, supplemented by additions from Charles Jennens to cover the 'moderate' element reconciling the first two extremes of mood, the result is a delightfully entertaining demonstration of the joy, versatility and expressive variety of music. Its protagonists are allegorical figures representing Joyfulness, Contemplation and Moderation, but the music of each one is shared among the singers rather than being consistently confined to a particular voice.The present performance, from Paul McCreesh and his Gabrieli Consort and Players, aims to recreate the premiere of Handel's original version of the work. So each of the three parts is introduced by a concerto, as was Handel's practice and his audience's expectation. For Part the First, McCreesh chooses the fine Concerto no. 1 in G, from Handel's set of twelve concerti grossi opus 6. The work, in this lovely performance from the Gabrieli Players, provides an excellent and fitting opening to L'Allegro's vocal music. There are many equally fine moments in the following sequence of recitatives and arias, so I will just mention a few of the musical highlights together with some examples of the outstanding musicianship in this recording. The five vocal soloists are soprano Gillian Webster, boy treble Laurence Kilsby, tenor Jeremy Ovenden, baritone Peter Harvey, and bass Ashley Riches; they are all excellent, with just a couple of minor reservations which I'll mention in a moment.As for the many musical delights, tenor Jeremy Ovenden sings his recitatives and arias superbly, the expression and drama of all the recitatives being an especially convincing feature throughout this performance. L'Allegro's air for boy treble, 'Come, thou goddess, fair and free' (CD1, track 8), is a delight, further enhanced by fabulous instrumental playing. For Il Penseroso's soprano aria and chorus, 'Come, but keep thy wonted state' (1/13), the lovely walking gait, again underpinned by beautiful instrumental work, is superb. Gillian Webster makes beautiful sounds throughout, but her diction is not all that clear at times. Her soprano aria 'Sweet bird, that shun'st the noise of folly' (1/17) receives a magical performance, and flute soloist Katy Bircher deserves a medal for her beautifully observed imitations of the nightingale's song; it's a long piece of 13 minutes, but there's not a single dull moment – a perfect juxtaposition of Milton's poetry and Handel's music.The short bass hunting aria, 'Mirth, admit me of thy crew' (1/19) is another great success, with Richard Bayliss' lusty horn playing somehow making it sound as if there's more than one of him. The closing number for Part I, 'Or let the merry bells ring round' (1/23) is a lovely team effort by treble, chorus and band.Part II opens with the concerto grosso in E minor, op. 6 no. 3; again it makes a fine choice, with ideal tempi for my taste in the Allegro movements and a supremely graceful Polonaise (1/27). The soprano aria 'But O! Sad virgin, that thy power’ is outstanding, enhanced further here by the superbly played cello obbligato. Part II continues on the second disc, filled with as many delights as the first. Tenor air and chorus 'These delights if thou canst give' (2/7) is a joyful movement brightly coloured by a pair of trumpets. Part II closes with an especially effective fugal movement, 'These pleasures, Melancholy, give' (2/10), launched by the organ, then with soprano voice and lower instruments, and finally the chorus joining in to bring Part the Second to a splendid climax.Part III opens with a tour de force for this recording: the magnificent organ concerto op. 7 no. 1 in B flat. Its stunning, chaconne-like opening Andante (2/13) proceeds with vigorous and compelling momentum, superbly played by organist William Whitehead and the Gabrieli Players. Unlike some other recordings, the work is here played on an instrument that is both colourful and beefy enough for the job, the splendid organ of St. Paul's parish church, Deptford. The exuberant Fuga (2/13) brings further delight, and altogether this is an exhilarating performance of one of the truly great concertos of the baroque. For the rest, Peter Harvey makes a distinguished contribution (2/16-17), although I could swear that he mistakenly sings the third word of the line 'Come, with native lustre shine' as 'nature', which doesn't make sense. In fact he does it twice, unless my hearing is failing me; of course I'm open to correction on this point by a more aurally advantaged listener. The well-known soprano-tenor duet 'As steals the morn upon the night' (2/21) is fabulous here, probably the loveliest rendering I've ever heard, and the work finishes with the characteristically Handelian closing chorus 'Thy pleasure, Moderation, give'.Comparing this with other recordings, the one from the King's Consort is also highly regarded by some. It is good, in some respects equalling the Gabrielis for sensitivity and for some of the solo vocal work, but not in either vigour or majesty where appropriate, nor in recorded sound quality. The King's Consort include some of Handel's later additions to the score, but they don't give us any instrumental concerti apart from one drastically truncated piece to serve as overture. The outstanding assets of McCreesh's recording include the excellent vocal soloists; exceptionally fine instrumental playing, especially in the obbligato parts; superb recorded sound; and an overall conception that is enhanced still further by those magnificent concerti. Altogether, the present performance is a delight from start to finish and a real treat for Handelians.Text and documentation are all provided in the CD booklet, and we also get a substantial and extremely informative essay by the Handel expert Ruth Smith, with additional and equally interesting comments from Paul McCreesh. There are also quite a few very nice photos, although I've no idea why they are all of Gillian Webster and one other guy whom I can't identify, but show us none of the other soloists, players or conductor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30AGAGJRO1KF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEFZ4PG#wasThisHelpful","R30AGAGJRO1KF5","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marin Marais, one of the favourite musicians of Louis XIV, was more highly regarded for his instrumental music than for his operas. This is well reflected in the listings of his music available on disc, nearly all of them instrumental, and especially the works for viol. While his opera 'Alcyone' was a considerable success in its time, 'Séméle' was not. I must admit that I hadn't greatly enjoyed the couple of complete Marais operas I'd heard so far on disc – when compared, for example, to those of Lully, Campra or Rameau. So it seems like a good plan to extract the instrumental movements from 'Séméle' and perform them on a single disc.By and large the task has been done effectively here by the period-instrument ensemble Montréal Baroque, directed by Wieland Kuijken. They start with a fine overture, played in vigorous and pointed style, and there are many colourfully orchestrated dances amounting to thirty pieces in all. The substantial Chaconne from Act II (track 16) is an excellent example of the genre, extremely varied and inventive; and the closing piece, Tremblement de terre, is also impressive.The trouble is that, perhaps perversely in view of what I wrote above, I find myself missing the stage drama and context of the works when faced with this succession of thirty mainly short pieces, most of them just a minute or two long and not originally intended to be heard in succession like this. I suppose I'm happy enough to have heard them a couple of times, but I doubt that I'll be taking this CD off the shelf very often from now on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11U9N8DCV7F4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IB0DJY#wasThisHelpful","R11U9N8DCV7F4E","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of a number of sacred oratorios written by Caldara during his time as composer to the Viennese imperial court chapel of Charles VI. Like most self-respecting Italian baroque composers, Caldara was an experienced hand in the setting of texts of sacred misery. The present work, receiving its first recording here, is a sequence of reflections on the death (part 1) and burial (part 2) of Christ, as seen through the reactions of various involved bystanders: Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, the Centurion, and Mary, mother of James.All the arias are melodically distinctive, strongly characterised and benefiting from powerful, independent and colourful instrumental participation. There is vigour, anger and misery aplenty in this score, and by and large it is well performed by Fabio Biondi and his team. This is not strictly a historically informed performance (HIP) - so, for example, by baroque standards the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra are a large band of around 27 players using modern instruments. But their playing is stylish and committed, and the approach is well suited to Caldara's muscular music. Of the five vocal soloists, the two sopranos have decent voices and expressive style, but with too much vibrato for my taste. Outstanding, though, are alto Martina Belli as Joseph, and Ugo Guagliardo as the Centurion. The instrumental Introduzione to part 1 is very fine, as are the two superb madrigalesque choruses which conclude each part of the oratorio.A bit on the short side to fill two CDs on its own, the oratorio movements are here interspersed with a few other vocal and instrumental works, mostly by Caldara, some more appropriate than others. The initial motet based on an Old Testament text, for example, seems somewhat out of place - the above-mentioned Introduzione would have made a better opening on its own. The short Sinfonia by Johann Joseph F-u-x (spelt thus to avoid Amazon's unintelligent electronic censoring system) is all right, but unnecessary in its place half-way through part 1. On the other hand, Vivaldi's well-known Sonata Al Santo Sepolcro makes a very good introduction to part 2. There are many other fine moments, including a superb aria for the Centurion with lovely string textures (CD1/12); a very Handelian melody for soprano (1/17); Nicodemus' aria full of vigorous fury (2/6); a lovely solo violin part for director and violinist Fabio Biondi (2/10) accompanying Mary Magdalene; and Caldara's all-too-attractive and cheerful Sinfonia Concertata (2/15).The present work is not quite on a par with the wonderful Caldara - Maddalena ai piedi di Cristo, especially in that stunning interpretation directed by René Jacobs; but 'Morte e sepoltura' is nevertheless an expressive and fascinating oratorio, and it receives here a mostly very fine performance of committed sincerity; Fabio Biondi's direction is energetic and convincing, and his singers and players respond very effectively to the demands of baroque style and expression. Recorded sound is excellent, as are Brian Pritchard's booklet notes covering background, composer and music. All texts and translations are provided.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SE8AUHW5OEZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SN6G8AE#wasThisHelpful","R2SE8AUHW5OEZ4","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jean Mouton, contemporary and compatriot of 'Josquinus incomparabilis', has not been served too badly on disc - especially his setting of the exceptionally beautiful 'Nesciens mater' - and  yet a great deal of his considerable output remains to be performed in modern times, let alone recorded. The present disc makes a useful contribution to this process. Its title, '1515', refers to an important date in French history for reasons explained in Fabrice Fitch's useful booklet notes; it's enough to say here that it was, among other things, the year of an important meeting in Bologna between the new French king Franois I and Pope Leo X. It is rather vaguely conjectured that music must surely have been performed for the occasion and, since Jean Mouton was a favourite of both king and pope, some of his music may well have been included.Irrespective of the pretext, this is a fine collection of the composer's music, including a Mass, a Magnificat and ten motets. The 'Missa Quem dicunt homines' is a parody Mass based on an exceptionally fine motet of that name by Jean Richafort. The Mass is a four-movement work with no Credo, its first two movements placed at the start of the disc and the Sanctus and Agnus Dei at the end. In between, we have the remaining works - the succession of nine motets in the middle perhaps offering a less-than-ideal arrangement for a CD programme. But there are many fine things, among which I especially liked 'Salva nos Domine' (track 13). Like many composers of renaissance and later times, Mouton produced some of his works in grovel mode, in other words not to sacred texts but in praise of some earthly bigwig - in the present case, one motet each for king, queen and pope.Best of all, however, is the Mass itself, a glorious work in spite of its all-too-brief eighteen minutes. Unfortunately we don't get Richafort's model motet here for our further enlightenment - but, as luck would have it, it's available in volume one of the wonderful 'Leiden Choirbooks' series Leiden Choirbooks 1, and it can also be heard on YouTube, nicely sung by an unnamed ensemble. Jean Mouton's Mass here represents the composer's work at its very best - a master craftsman with melodic grace and profundity to match.All these works are beautifully performed by the eight voices of two fine ensembles - Ensemble Clément Janequin and Ensemble Diabolus in Musica - directed respectively, but I presume not simultaneously, by Dominique Visse and Antoine Guerber. The high voices - one male, one female - lend an incisive edge to the vocal blend which some listeners may find disconcerting; but personally I like it, finding that it enhances presence and clarity while in no way overriding the excellent contributions of the lower voices. Clarity and expression, rather than sheer beauty of sound, are given priority here, and for me they suit the music extremely well. The sound and balance are discreetly rounded off by an organ accompaniment in some of the works, including the Mass - a fact that is nowhere mentioned in the booklet.All texts and translations are included. In spite of the above minor reservations about the choices and ordering of the programme, this CD is a worthy tribute to the music of Jean Mouton and a valuable contribution to the renaissance discography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DGN6PS2V2XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRU691C#wasThisHelpful","R28DGN6PS2V2XC","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Billed as Volume 1 in a series, this looks like an attractive collection of orchestral theatre music from the French baroque and in some ways it is. The Tempesta di Mare Philadelphia Baroque Orchestra are a substantial period band - by baroque standards - of around 28 players. At times their numbers work to their advantage, but at other times not; for me the problems start right away in the first set of pieces on the disc, Lully's instrumental suite for Molière's 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme'. Not only is the recorded sound somewhat muffled, but the playing, although in decent baroque style, is all too polite and rather listless, lacking the attack, energy and wit which to me are essential for this music. The movements of the 'Cérémonie des Turcs' section, especially the well-known March, fare much better on the whole; but for the rest, there's more courtly grace than spirit or sparkle. The closing Chaconne des Scaramouches, one of Lully's finest, goes well, although it's over all too quickly compared to the great chaconnes of the composer's tragic operas. Altogether I found this performance a great disappointment when measured against some very strong recorded competition - which I'll return to at the end.Things improve dramatically for Jean-Féry Rebel's extraordinary 'Les Éléments' sequence. The ensemble's rendering of the superb opening 'Le Chaos' description is brilliant, full of energy and commitment, and the rest of the work - especially the lovely Loure & Chaconne movement - goes just as well. This is an extremely colourful and entertaining work; again, there are other fine recordings available of the Rebel pieces - such as the one from Reinhard Goebel - but this time Tempesta di Mare are a match for these, or at least for the ones I've heard. Marin Marais' 'Alcyone' suite is more of a mixture again in the present performance. Again it's entertaining music, but it's not always given the full works and at times is just too genteel. Matters liven up impressively for the 'Tempête' near the end, however, with a starring role for the wind machine and the strings not far behind. The suite concludes with another familiar Chaconne, the orchestra here at their best with a rendering of real cumulative power and conviction.This programme has its good points, then - including very good booklet notes and documentation - but the wimpish rendering of the Lully work in particular is a serious disappointment. I can only think that, for some reason, somebody must have decided that Lully's music didn't need to be played with as much spirit and energy as that of the other two. If so, then this was a bad mistake, because Lully-Molière without the wit is a very poor deal in my view. 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme' is, after all, one of the great masterpieces of baroque theatre, and Lully's music measures up to it in every way.Fortunately, the willing enthusiast can rectify matters by considering several other recordings of the work. Among these are Jordi Savall's version of the orchestral music together with two other Lully suites Lully: L'Orchestre du Roi Soleil, available both in its original form and in at least a couple of reissues. Better still, in my opinion, are those recordings which also include Lully's delicious vocal music for the play, the most complete being a two-CD set forming part of the excellent French baroque series from Hugo Reyne's La Simphonie du Marais Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, comédie de Molière (LULLY ou le Musicien du Soleil, Vol. IV). Fabio Bonizzoni's disc of Lully: Ballets & récits italiens, which includes the Ballet des Nations music from 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme', is also an absolute delight. Finally, if you can spare an evening for the full Monty, both theatrical and musical, there are few finer entertainments in the world than this DVD: Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, Comédie-ballet de Molière & Lully / Dumestre, Le Poème Harmonique, Lazar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I711M8DHA3LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMTDBOK#wasThisHelpful","R3I711M8DHA3LO","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The duetti da camera of Agostino Steffani, around eighty in number, are among the most exquisite masterpieces of baroque chamber music. They are scored for voices in various combinations such as two sopranos, soprano-alto, soprano-tenor, with the occasional appearance of baritone or bass; they are accompanied by basso continuo and, in a very few cases, by other instruments. Their poetic texts address mainly the intermingled joys and miseries of unrequited love. Only one of the duets is in genuine dialogue form, with two distinct protagonists answering one another, while the great majority are composed to texts which are actually soliloquies, with the two voices singing to the same words but their musical lines expressing, as it were, different strands of the thoughts and feelings of the enraptured, confused or disappointed lover. The works tend to be in several sections, with recitative passages being interspersed between aria and arioso sections varying in pace, metre and mood.The format offers fabulous possibilities for the expression of complex human emotions, with intertwining voices tracing melodic lines and combinations of delightful texture, delicate counterpoint and extreme subtlety. And the inventive genius of Steffani - for his mastery of melody, texture and expression one of the great baroque composers for the voice - was at its very best in these works which were so greatly admired by both musicians and lovers of fine music in his own time.Until recently Steffani's duets have been sadly neglected through much of the great era of recording, and so far only a handful of these works have found their way onto disc - the two best recordings so far, in my opinion, being the one from soprano Rossana Bertini and countertenor Claudio Cavina Duetti Da Camera and the Archive reissue from singers Daniela Mazzucato, Carolyn Watkinson, Paul Esswood and John Elwes directed by Alan Curtis Duetti Da Camera. So this present recording of seven more duets, performed by soprano Elena Bertuzzi and tenor Alessio Tosi with a small instrumental group, makes a very welcome appearance.One of its obvious assets is that the artists have chosen works which, as far as I know, have not been recorded before - with one small exception which I'll return to in a moment. And, by and large, very fine they are too. The first duet, 'Pria ch'io faccia', demonstrates one of the drawbacks of the present recording, namely that two of the works - items 1 and 7 on the present disc, which were both scored by the composer for two sopranos - have been transposed to be performed here by soprano and tenor. Now, Signor Steffani knew very well what he was doing, and where that included choosing to have the melodic lines of two voices exquisitely close to one another in places, rather than an octave apart, then so be it. For these reasons, I would say that if he scored a work for two specified voices then it ought to stay that way. The theorbo introduction to the first item is also spurious. This work is also the only one of the seven which I had previously heard recorded - in that case sung by soprano and countertenor in a beautiful private recording by the London ensemble Baroque Encounter, but sadly no longer available.Nevertheless, the music still sounds lovely in the present recording, and in fact the two singers both do a terrific job. Ms. Bertuzzi has a lovely voice, as pure, clear and steady as can be, and Signor Tosi's tenor is also very good. Both singers perform in excellent style, singing their words with sincerity and to great expressive effect. Steffani's virtuoso demands place the soprano under pressure at some points, but she copes pretty well. The performances also sound a little blustery at times, lacking the last ounce of refinement that characterises the other two recordings cited above; but there's no denying the two singers' talent, commitment and overall musicality. The accompanying instrumentalists also provide excellent support - Francesco Baroni on harpsichord, Rebecca Ferri on cello, and Michele Pasotti on theorbo.Of the other works not yet mentioned, 'Lontananza crudel' (track 3) is actually of doubtful authorship and is considered by some to be by Giuseppe Antonio Bernabei, son of Steffani's teacher Ercole Bernabei. 'Vorrei dire un non so che' (4) is an especially fine piece, with its intermittent recitative episodes beautifully taken by the two singers, and with the vocal gymnastics of the final bars also very nicely handled by both of them. 'Dolce è per voi soffrire' (5) is another beautiful piece, its delicious opening harmonies typical of Steffani and, I would say, unique to him. Finally, the closing 'Saldi marmi che coprite' (7) is simply a magnificent work. It does suffer here from the soprano-to-tenor transposition mentioned earlier, perhaps even more than the first piece did; the absence of the delicate interwoven textures of two sopranos is a significant loss, and I would greatly love to hear this work as Steffani intended. However, the music is still lovely, the singers are expressive, clearly understand the music and its poetry, and are able to convey these to the listener.The recorded sound is close and has a slightly hard edge to it, but it does also have some depth and ambience and doesn't distract too much from the music, and neither does the occasional distant traffic noise which may be picked up on decent stereo systems. The booklet contains ample information about the musicians and brief notes on Steffani's life, work and the duets in general, but no comments on the individual works on the disc. Texts are not provided, but the booklet directs us to the Brilliant Classics website where texts and translations are shown. The English translations are poor, but we can perhaps make some allowances in view of the label's very reasonable prices.In spite of its faults, then, this is an attractive recording. It makes a significant contribution to the Steffani discography and is very likely to please the growing numbers of his admirers. In fact, I would even suggest that these performers might consider bringing us further volumes, preferably with a couple more singers roped in so as to perform the pieces as scored by the composer. Finally, many thanks to Colin Timms, author of the excellent monograph Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music, for some of the above information on the composer's works and the scoring of the duets, both in his book and from personal comments. The opinions expressed here, however, are my own.At the time of writing, the recording is available in CD format from European sources.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTY1CS5KTG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8GD10Y#wasThisHelpful","ROTY1CS5KTG4","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please don't get me wrong - Agostino Steffani's music is wonderful. It's just this performance and recording that are awful, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 review under Amazon's other entry for this recording: Alarico. However, I've been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing five-star reviews, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.Those two reviews were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other's work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they've now changed their Amazon names to 'ML' and 'A Customer' respectively. Hang on - now they've both deleted their reviews on this page as well, and all their other Amazon reviews!) I'll avoid commenting on the details of the latter's review directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn't really anything plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn't take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first review I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perhaps a similar fate awaits the present review!This leaves me with Magda Levi's review, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms' monograph Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music - from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha' '. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande's website, having recently contributed some material to it. However, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico' review here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my previous review, I tried to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the worst singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly awful performance and recording.Reviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perhaps this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can't sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they're unlikely to get much better over the next 35 years.This recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too bad either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani's music, and I'd greatly love to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I'm sorry to say, much of it is ruined by the poor singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone's beautiful chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace' is wrecked by poor singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Care Fiamme/ Amate Catene', is ruined by the same factors.It's also worth mentioning that Steffani's roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.Returning to the main business, however, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, terrible recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn't - I'd immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much better to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the reviews. Most of us here on Amazon, whether readers or reviewers, are not that stupid.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QNWJ54MTZP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LCZXTA#wasThisHelpful","R15QNWJ54MTZP7","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a lively and enjoyable selection of 16th-century Hispanic renaissance music discovered in Guatemala in the 1960s and now held in the Lilly Library of Indiana University. In addition to the more traditional methods of conquest and subjugation, involving death, terror and overwhelming force, the Spanish conquistadores used their rich musical talents and resources to captivate and convert the native American peoples to the benefits of Spanish rule, culture and beliefs. So the music here is mainly of European origin or, at the very least, influence; no composers' names are given in the manuscripts.The programme consists of a variety of instrumental works, chant passages, hymn settings, villancicos and a Mass which I'll return to in a moment. The vocal music is performed by the Pro Arte Singers, directed by John Poole and Carolina Gamboa Hoyos; they make a first-class ensemble, with excellent voices and a fine vocal blend. The instrumental works are played by the period wind Ensemble Lipzodes on shawms, dulcians, recorders and the occasional percussion, with a few additional players joining in at times; again, they are a fine-sounding group and perform in excellent, spirited style. For some of the vocal pieces, including the Mass setting, their instruments double the vocal parts.There are many enjoyable things here, especially among the instrumental pieces, but the most impressive work by far is the anonymous Mass setting. It has no title and is given no explanation at all in the booklet notes, but in fact it is a parody, or more accurately a paraphrase, Mass on Janequin's chanson 'La Guerre'. Janequin's famous piece gave rise to numerous examples of the genre of the 'Missa de la Batalla' especially in the Hispanic world, including those by such as Guerrero, Victoria, Pérez and Capillas - not to mention the French composer's own brilliant self-parodying 'Messe la Bataille'. The present, anonymous example I found to be especially fine. It's a mainly homophonic work, with just a few passages of fairly straightforward polyphony; and, rather than pointing up the melodrama and rhythmic contrasts in Janequin's original, it emphasises the melodic beauty and reflective sadness of the composer's multi-faceted chanson. It's beautifully sung here, with the wind instruments doubling the voices in some passages, and for me it's a definite hit and a fascinating contrast to other works in this genre that I've heard.The Mass movements are interspersed with other works of the kinds mentioned earlier, and the programme concludes with a lively, celebratory piece for voices and instruments, 'Oy hasemos fiesta' (Today we all celebrate the virgin Saint .....), which provides the disc's title. The booklet notes are very helpful on generalised background, but there is very little about the works chosen and there are no texts or translations supplied. According to the notes, the producers 'care about the environment' and so, 'in order to conserve the use of paper', we are referred to Indiana University's Music Marketplace website and to the Lipzodes Ensemble's own site. I couldn't find anything in the former but, sure enough, the latter does provide texts and translations, some slightly expanded notes, but still no mention of the 'Batalla' mass - which is very disappointing, because I would have been interested to read at least some informed speculation as to its origin and authorship.Altogether, I found this a fascinating and enjoyable programme, and extremely well performed. The musicians are somewhat let down by the producers, however, with that facile hypocrisy of the bit about saving paper, and in my view the absence of texts and of some vital information deprive the disc of an otherwise deserved fifth star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWA598RFLBS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050O8VKM#wasThisHelpful","R3PWA598RFLBS1","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owen Jones' book is fundamentally flawed for two reasons. Firstly, the title doesn't make sense - not only because 'chav' in the UK does not mean the same as 'working class', but also because the working classes are not demonized, or at least not by the vast majority of British people.Let's take the pejorative term 'chav' for a start. To me, it refers to someone who is probably young, probably but not necessarily male, and who exhibits some or all of the following behaviour: loud-mouthed, ill-mannered, ignorant, antisocial, destructive, criminal, racially prejudiced; abusive of or violent towards others, especially anyone vulnerable, old, disabled or handicapped, to anyone who is of a different race, colour or culture or from the next street, another town or a different part of town, and to supporters of rival football teams. That's probably enough to be going on with but suffice to say that, while many 'chavs' may be working class, the great majority of working class people are not chavs. So the two terms are entirely different.Next, the working classes are not demonized in British society - certainly not in the sense of being criticised, condemned or abused as a group. OK, the author is right about some things - the UK's social and economic system is very unfair, the poor have an extremely hard time, successive governments should be putting things right and have failed to do so. But it's not because the middle classes are lousy and selfish; some of us are, but we're not by definition rotten as a group any more than the working classes are. The author also insists on trying to define exactly who is working class and who isn't, based on such factors as occupation and income, but his definitions don't really work and he ties himself in knots in the attempt. And if the middle class is so lousy, why do so many people want to be in it?Some of the reasons the author gives for his 'demonization' theory are ludicrous. Let's start with British TV comedy, allegedly guilty of singling out the working classes for ridicule. Now, the whole point of comedy is that people get ridiculed - from the preposterously smarmy and devious Sir Humphrey Appleby in 'Yes Minister', to the pompous middle-class prat Captain Mainwaring in 'Dad's Army', to the ignorant, bigoted Alf Garnett of 'Till Death Us Do Part'. When Del Boy of 'Only Fools and Horses' fails to prop himself up at the bar and falls over sideways, is it because he's working class that we laugh? Of course it isn't - we'd laugh just as much if it were the Queen, the Pope or the UN Secretary-General, although they probably couldn't carry it off with quite the same aplomb as actor David Jason does.Having said all this, the author does make some good and well-informed points, and does so in a very eloquent and readable style. Many arguments are well made, but Jones is also ruthlessly selective in his use of quotations and statistics and there are contradictions on almost every page. Many passages seem persuasive in isolation, but the trouble is that the overall argument, in my view at least, just doesn't add up to a convincing case. He comes down hard on cruel and heartless Thatcherism, quite rightly in my view. But Thatcher was given the order of the boot more than 20 years before this book was written, successive governments have had their chances to put things right since then, and some have done so in certain respects. So how long can you continue blaming everything on people and events of long ago?  Even the current UK coalition parties get jeered at when they carry on trying to blame economic troubles on the last Labour government, who left office 5 years ago at the time of writing this review.But apart from Thatcherism, Jones tries to pin the blame for the present ills in British society upon the alleged prejudice, bigotry and all-round nastiness of the middle classes. The trouble is that, by creating and exploiting this sweeping stereotype of the middle class in order to suit his argument, he effectively demonstrates that the most bigoted and prejudiced person around is the author himself. He may not have intended it to be this way but that, it seems to me, is the end result of this extended, hate-filled rant against the middle classes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TO7I41QEUDZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844678644#wasThisHelpful","R2TO7I41QEUDZP","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music of this recording was composed by Lambert de Sayve (1549-1614), a musician from Liège in Flanders who worked for much of his career for the Hapsburg dynasty, including the Emperor Matthias for whom the 16-part 'Missa super Dominus regnavit' on this disc was composed.  The Mass movements are interspersed with shorter pieces, both vocal and instrumental, from the composer's 'Sacrae Symphoniae' collection, as well as a few plainchant passages.The vocal music, in a style midway between renaissance and baroque, is sumptuous in texture, and is finely sung and played by the excellent Choeur de Chambre de Namur and the instrumentalists of La Fenice, directed by Jean Tubéry.The Mass movements benefit here from the doubling, and in some cases replacing, of the vocal lines with instruments. However, I have to say that I did not find the music of the Mass, or most of the other works here, at all interesting. It's not profound, original or memorable, in spite of the performers' efforts. Indeed, there is some pleasure to be had from the quality of the singing and playing - but not a lot, I fear, from the music itself. The only exception, for me, is the wonderful, march-like opening instrumental Intrada by Alessandro Orologio, a catchy and exuberant piece which, again, is beautifully played here with sumptuous cornetto embellishments from Jean Tubéry. It's all over in a minute or two, but it so happens that this latter work has also popped up in another recording, of music by Jacobus Vaet, Musica Ferdinandea - Ein Fest für Kaiser Ferdinand, which I found absolutely beautiful.So, in spite of the fine performances and direction, as well as the handsome booklet with excellent notes, texts and translations, I can't recommend the present disc with any great enthusiasm.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALJUP048S73H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001716JRY#wasThisHelpful","R3ALJUP048S73H","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD offers a programme of sacred cantatas for solo soprano by Johann Kuhnau, Bach's immediate predecessor as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, as well as a couple by Kuhnau's Italian friend and mentor Vincenzo Albrici. The first work, the seven-movement 'Weicht ihr Sorgen aus dem Herzen', is a good example of Kuhnau's graceful, relatively straightforward style, with attractive melodies and a touch of pietism. This cantata's final aria, 'Komm doch, süße Stunde', is especially fine. Soprano Barbara Christina Steude has a lovely, clear and steady voice and excellent expressive ability – her style and vocal quality ideally suited to both arias and recitatives in this music.Accompaniment is provided by the early-music ensemble 'Concerto con voce', with up to nine string, woodwind and continuo instruments. Balance between voice and ensemble, and between the instruments themselves, is just right, and Jan Katschke's direction from the keyboard is stylish,  sympathetic and altogether excellent. Katzschke has already brought us outstanding German baroque recordings of keyboard music by Kuhnau and Weckmann, and for the present disc he certainly maintains those standards.Albrici's cantata 'Omnia quae fecit Deus', on a more imaginative Latin text, is rather more melodramatic in style, its episodic but enterprising character extremely well pointed by both singer and ensemble. Its demanding vocal part tests Ms. Steude's figuration skills to the limit.Kuhnau's closing cantata, 'Und ob die Feinde' - in spite of its opening lines ('and though enemies may plot our misfortune day and night …..') - is a work of light, tripping melodies, and forms a cheerful and attractive conclusion to the programme. The booklet notes are excellent, and all texts and translations are provided. Kuhnau's vocal music may not quite be in the top rank when judged by the formidable standards achieved by the German baroque; but nevertheless this is a most enjoyable selection, well judged and organised, and the disc will undoubtedly be of interest to dedicated baroque enthusiasts. Since we're forced to decide on a star rating, then in view of these persuasive performances I'd say it deserves full marks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390N77DYCAUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00475Q1RK#wasThisHelpful","R390N77DYCAUN","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a ballet suite by Michel-Richard de Lalande, to accompany a story based loosely on Don Quixote and other fictional and mythical figures. The plot is fairly inconsequential, but provides a good excuse for some enjoyable and intellectually undemanding music. This consists of a series of mostly instrumental movements, played well here by the Ensemble Baroque de Limoges, a substantial baroque band directed by Christophe Coin. There are also a few vocal items sung by a decent soprano; no texts for these are provided, but the well-illustrated booklet provides good notes and a detailed synopsis of the story in English.Among the 41 mostly very short movements are a lively Ouverture, a ceremonial Air de Trompettes scored in bright 'grand siècle' style; a fine Chaconne which, at just over two minutes, passes all too quickly; a characterful Air pour les Chinois, and a vigorous Air pour les Combattants. Towards the end there's also an excellent 'Tempête' depiction, accompanied by wind machine and thundering timpani, and the final Dernier Air (Rondeau) is especially engaging.I prefer the sacred music of this composer – such as his very fine 'Te Deum' – but Lalande's ballet music is nevertheless enjoyable, with plenty of variety in melody and scoring. Ideally, it would be better to be watching people dancing around on stage at the same time – which, of course, was the original intention. But the playing is lively and stylish throughout, and the ensemble make the best possible case for the music thus meriting, in my view, a 4-star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTPVK3G6KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ENV2UA#wasThisHelpful","R3GTPVK3G6KZ","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Polish baroque composer Mikolaj Zielenski (c. 1550-1615) was writing at a time when European music - including a number of eminent German, Austrian and Polish composers - was changing dramatically under the influence of the Venetian school of the Gabrielis and their contemporaries. Many of these northern and central European musicians travelled to Italy to learn their craft. That influence pervades the contents of the present recording, consisting mainly of sacred vocal works by Zielenski (I'd like to use the strictly Polish spelling of his name but when I try, it gets misprinted by Amazon) but also a couple of pieces by Giovanni Gabrieli and one by Palestrina.The opening work, Zielenski's 'Ortus de Polonia', is distinctly Gabrielian in style, sung here by a pure-voiced choir with some lovely instrumental work from cornetti and others doubling and embellishing the vocal lines. The vocal ensemble Les Traversées Baroques, directed by Étienne Meyer, and the instrumentalists of Fiori Musicali, are all excellent, and there is a deeply devotional quality to both music and performances in these lovely, expressive pieces, further enhanced by plenty of enterprising instrumental work. 'Mitte manum tuam' (track 3) is a fine solo bass motet with cornetto part; 'In virtute tua, Domine' (4) is another lovely piece. Tracks 6 and 7 bring us two familiar Gabrieli works, the instrumental Canzon VIII and 'In ecclesiis' from the Sacrae Symphoniae. Zielenski's 'Gloria et divitiae' (14) is especially fine, and lovingly performed here.The Zielenski works offered here are also available in a complete series of his works on several Cds from the Polish Dux label, in worthy but rather thick-textured renditions. But, for those who would be content with a high-quality sampling of the composer's works, the stylish and spirited performances on the present disc make it a very good choice. Booklet notes are adequate, fairly generalised with very little about the individual works chosen. But there are no texts of the vocal works. Personally, I like to know what they are singing about, and I'm getting fed up with labels such as K617 which, in spite of the obvious need as well as repeated customer complaints, don't provide the texts of vocal works or even make them available on their websites. Hence the marking down from 4 to 3 stars.For an even better insight into the fascinating world of the Polish baroque, I would strongly recommend the following beautiful recordings - both carrying the same title after a glorious piece by Marcin Mielczewski: Adoration of the Virgin Mary at the Polish Court and Mielczewski: Virgo Prudentissima, the latter from the same team as the present disc.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39A0OYPINHV0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMUBBG0#wasThisHelpful","R39A0OYPINHV0R","A36Z4FFAW2E6F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36Z4FFAW2E6F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"‘The heat haze shimmers atop the road, as if what lies behind me is something I just made up. Like my whole life has been a dream, but now I’ve been jolted awake.Just in time to watch it all fall away.’On their way to visit her future mother in law for the Fourth of July weekend, Kristine and her fiancé Daniel stop at a rest stop for her to change her clothes where she gets attacked in a bathroom stall. Never seeing her attacker but being knocked out, she awakens frantic to get to Daniel only to find he’s gone missing. Her mysterious attacker calls her, instructs her to get in the car and leave or else he’s going to hurt Daniel. Furious with her inability to help him, she does get in the car and drive away with the sounds of Daniel’s screams still echoing through the phone. But this mystery person that goes by the name of Malthus is far from done with her and the next 24 hours of her life becomes a nightmare thrill-ride through hell and back again.I’ve read my fair share of “nail-biters” but very rarely has every. single. page. caused a permanent look of complete and utter panic on my face. I absolutely could not tear myself away from this one. Swerve is the very definition of “edge-of-your-seat”.Swerve reminded me a lot of Phone Booth, where Kiefer Sutherland Malthus knows all about Kristine and the past that still haunts her and is completely using it against her to make her life a living hell. Since the majority of this novel was spent on the highway on the roadtrip to hell, it had definite shades of Duel as well to make it extra terrifying. It also helps that the bad guy is completely batshit insane and the things he’s capable of doing with a smile still on his face will horrify you. This one is definitely not for the faint of heart.Swerve is an explosive horror-thriller that is constant and unrelenting. It was horrifying and sickening and I am never stopping at a f***ing rest stop again as long as I live. Or at least not without a bazooka.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RFOGV9JNFRL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476798575#wasThisHelpful","R2RFOGV9JNFRL1","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Portia Kane is a woman who used to have big dreams of being a published author but is currently experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis. We’re first introduced to her character as she hides drunk in her bedroom closet with a handgun watching her porn-producer husband cheat on her with a much, much younger woman. As sad as it sounds, Quick made this introduction memorable and hilarious, as unlikely as that seems. Deciding that going to jail for shooting her husband and his lover she dubs “Khaleesi” just isn’t worth it so she hops on a plane to head back home to her simple-minded hoarder of a mother. She has a coincidental run-in with a nun she’s seated next to on the plane at which point Portia, still drunk, spills her guts to her even going so far as to describe just how endowed her soon to be ex-husband isn’t. Coincidentally the nun is actually the mother of her favorite English teacher that changed her whole outlook on life, who just so happens to be going through his own mid-life crisis as well.Honestly, I could continue on with the various plots and coincidences (there are many of both in this tale). There are also several different POV changes: Portia of course, her English teacher Mr. Vernon, Chuck Bass (another individual left changed by Mr. Vernon and someone who has harbored a crush on Portia for the better part of two decades), and even a brief interlude to Mr. Vernon’s mother who we’re made informed by the letters she sent to her son. Portia, regardless of her protestations that “it wasn’t about the money” doesn’t ever come across as anything but a rich, privileged whiner. The flashbacks to her past and her childhood dreams should have been enough to make her a bit more tolerable, but unfortunately she never did dredge up any sympathy from me. And her showing up at her favorite English teacher’s house was more creepy than gracious. I have a favorite teacher that I recall with absolute adoration, however, I still can’t say I would ever get the urge to show up at his house unannounced declaring that I was there to “save him”. Mr. Vernon’s character was the POV most explored and was the most interesting to read about. His mother’s POV could have been left out entirely, which would have left this book minus the two dozen or so mentions of “my husband, God” which made my eye twitch just about every time. There is also a very strange and intense focus on negative reviews (it specifically mentions a bad review a published book received via Kirkus) and ultimately the impact they have on an author. Not sure what Quick was trying to say with that little tirade but I find it more than a bit funny that Kirkus didn’t actually care for Love May Fail very much.I’ve heard this is a common trend in Quick’s novels (this is my first Quick novel so I can’t speak for the rest), but faith and the belief that there’s always something to live for is the theme with this one. It’s about finding that spark in life that spurs you up over the next hurdle that life will inevitably throw your way. The idea was there with this one but the execution and the abundant coincidences left me feeling far from inspired.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUBQ5ZF2H0Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062285564#wasThisHelpful","RYUBQ5ZF2H0Z8","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“…our world is filled with many mysteries, things we don’t understand. Never go into the deep parts of the forest, for there are many dangers there, both dark and bright, and they will ensnare your soul.”Biltmore Estate is large enough to have kept a secret for over a decade: deep within its basement lives a man and his daughter, named Serafina. Serafina’s father is in charge of the buildings maintenance but he would be tossed out in a heartbeat if it were discovered he also resided there. And Serafina is a whole different matter. Curious about the world around her and of her own past, she’s no longer able to keep herself confined to the basement, especially when she witnesses the murder of a young girl. Her body was never discovered and by the following morning another child was missing. Serafina is determined to help these people find their lost children, even if it means disclosing her secret.Beatty created a most mysterious girl with Serafina, who is described as having golden eyes and strangely enough, four toes instead of the normal five. Those differences only add to the air of mystery surrounding her and keep you wondering what it is that makes her so special. She’s a girl with a good heart and a kind soul that you can’t help but admire. Befriending the owner’s of Biltmore’s nephew, Braeden, makes this story even more charming. The two quickly hit it off, despite their obvious differences in social class, and they both team up convinced that they’re going to be able to find these children. Through her friendship, Serafina starts seeing the world through a new set of eyes, only seen before through the pages of books. She sees the good in the world but because of the man in the black cloak, she’s also uncovering the bad as well.‘She was beginning to see how difficult it was to determine who was good and who was bad, who she could trust and who she had to watch out for. Every person was a hero in his own mind, fighting for what he thought was right, or just fighting to survive another day, but no one thought they were evil.’Serafina possesses a definite horror, but isn’t quite as terrifying as it is charming. The unique heroine is definitely the spotlight of this tale with her most uncommon story of her life and how she came to reside in the Biltmore Estate basement. While some parts of the book did seem to creep along very slowly and some aspects weren’t left sufficiently explained, it was still ultimately a satisfying supernatural tale of mystery that will no doubt delight children and adults alike.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GY1X60KUQDHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484709012#wasThisHelpful","R3GY1X60KUQDHO","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“…can’t people just not f***ing suck as human beings once in a while? […] People have just as much capacity to be good as they do to be s***. It’s a choice. People make choices. So they need to make better f***ing choices.”Being that this is Corey Taylor’s third book you think I’d be used to his absolutely impeccable way of putting into words all the bitching and complaining that runs through my head, but I am. Like all the times when I’m confronted with the idiocy of this planet be it by their ridiculous purchases, their laughable choice in music or they way they choose to raise (or not raise as the case may be) their children. We’re all confronted with the insanity on a daily basis but we’re forced to suffer through, internally rolling our eyes at the imbeciles. But Corey manages to transform the suffering into entertainment in the form of a hilarious memoir once again.“Incompetent people don’t know they’re incompetent. They just blithely blunder through their day-to-day with no care for any damage that happens in their wakes. When the mishaps are pointed out, they see the issue but don’t do anything to adjust and fix their ways.”You know those people you encounter that seem as if they were put on Earth just to make your life miserable? Or how about those times you witness some type of human behavior that causes you to simultaneously stop to worry for the human race while also thinking “What in the f*** is wrong with people!?” If you’ve had thoughts such as those, this is the book for you. If not, back away slowly. Not one to mince words, Corey Taylor points out all the issues in society and human behavior in general without a care for hurt feelings. He’s blunt, honest, and always candid. You gotta love that about him.“When people suffer under the illusion that their time and attention is more important than everyone else’s, no matter how mundane the occasion may be, I snap like a piece of dried-up driftwood, waiting to be set fire at the pyre.”Corey Taylor has successfully covered the argument between good and evil, the existence of the supernatural and now the lack of common sense of the human race. I can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0CD9XBM83PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306823586#wasThisHelpful","R2A0CD9XBM83PD","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My rating: 3.5 of 5 stars‘All they need was a reason, a conspiracy. Learning that telepaths existed and that they had infiltrated the Coalition would make them suspect everyone. The senators already fought and argued and threatened to secede. She wouldn’t give them more fuel to burn their ties.’Lieutenant Ramie Ashdyn and her team are sent on a mission by the Coalition to steal classified information from the Saricean’s but she is the only survivor. She is subsequently blamed for their deaths and charged with treason. She’s left unable to speak the truth of the situation in order to clear her name because her mind has been altered by a telepath. The proof of the existence of telepaths is the classified information that her team stole and inevitably gave their lives to keep secret because the knowledge of this may be the very thing to tear the Coalition apart.‘In three days, Rykus would lead a contingent of soldiers in a daring, deadly assault on an enemy shipyard. In three days, the Coalition and the Sariceans would be at war.’Ashdyn is a stubborn, badass chick who has no problem taking care of herself. Growing up starving on the streets of Glory, she volunteered to become a soldier of the Coalition. She also discovered she’s faster and more powerful than any human being: she’s an anomaly. We’re given very little of her background and the details behind being an anomaly and while it was enough to clarify most questions, I wanted more details because it was an extremely interesting concept. I loved the inclusion of Commander Rhys Rykus and the whole concept behind the loyalty training as well. Due to an issue with an anomaly’s mental stability, they underwent loyalty training which made them dependable soldiers that would follow instruction and wouldn’t snap under the strain they underwent. Commander Rhys Rykus was Ashdyn’s instructor and he’s been requested to use that loyalty training in order to get the classified information from her. It doesn’t help matters that the two have a very complicated and heated rapport, both denying the existence of feelings they may have because a relationship between them is out of the question.Conspiracies, treason, and intrigue oh my! Shades of Treason includes all of that and more (like a pretty hot relationship build-up). I hope to see more delving into the world-building in subsequent installments. Specifically, I’d love to know more about anomaly’s and not just who the Saricean’s are but what caused the war between them and the Coalition.

"My rating: 3.5 of 5 stars‘I only did what I did to protect myself. I didn’t have any other options.’Julia Vann had the seemingly perfect life before the incident. She belonged to a happy family, had a twin brother she was incredibly close to, close friends, and a boyfriend she thinks she could love. The incident took that all away and left her and her family packing up their belongings to move to a new town with new names where nobody knows who they are. Lucy Black has a chance to start over, to start fresh, but her past proves to be a bit more inescapable than she thought.Julia/Lucy was a very surprising character and her first-person narrative which carefully entwines the past and present was written extremely well. She was quite a distorted character that at first appears to be like any normal teenager, but the subtle glimpses that begin to leak through her faade tells a whole other story. Was it the incident that transformed her or does her past provide the real answers? The side characters weren’t as impressive: the dutiful boyfriend that comes over to make her homemade soup when she isn’t feeling well, the devoted best friend that asks no questions, and even the absent parents that we see very little of. The legal technicalities did manage to raise some eyebrows as well, however, despite these issues that could have brought down the whole story, Panitch still impressed me with an incredibly riveting tale.Damage Done is quite the twisted mystery and the summary does little to prepare you for what’s in store. I think it’s best kept that way, seeing as the reveal was quite the impressive twist, even if it was foreshadowed early on. The first twist isn’t the only twist though and this is one engrossing mystery that will keep you speculating. Panitch has another YA psychological thriller coming up in 2016, Never Missing, Never Found that will most certainly be on my TBR.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGU9XVX8OE0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553507494#wasThisHelpful","R1LGU9XVX8OE0G","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“In the dream house, the boy listened for the monster under his bed.”Jack Peter hasn’t been the same since he almost drowned when he was seven-years-old. Becoming terrified of the world outside, he’s become something of a recluse for the past three years and his parents, and even doctors, have been struggling to find a reason. When the terrifying things that Jack claims to see become visible to his parents, they begin to think they’re going insane rather than realizing that maybe what their son has been saying isn’t exactly a lie. Is there something supernatural astir or is everyone in fact going insane?The slow, subtle build leaves the reader in a constant state of anxiety, unable to differentiate between reality and madness. While not exactly terrifying, despite the depictions of a pale white creature which roams the lands around their home and of the babies that defy gravity by crawling across the walls, this story still manages to leave a slight restlessness in its implications. A comparison to A Turn of the Screw is expected, what with the creepy children and of the general gothic-like atmosphere of panic and terror. Donohue applies an inspirational twist to this tale by granting power behind the monsters to a child. What would cause a child to want to create terrifying monsters in reality? Does he have the power to control their actions or only their existence? And does their existence serve a purpose?One aspect that could have been dealt with better were the adults. Their continued ignorance of the wrongness of the occurrences is typical yet tiresome. Failing to believe in their young sons seemingly fictitious stories is one thing but it’s a problem when you’re seeing said stories with your own eyes and are still acting oblivious. I would have preferred this story told entirely from the point of view of the children, since their perspective of what was happening left you feeling like a child once again, terrified of the monster under the bed.Not terrifying, yet still memorable. Donohue impressed me with his prose and capability of maintaining a mysterious edginess. I will definitely be seeking out his earlier works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBCNRL4JPFRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057159#wasThisHelpful","RJBCNRL4JPFRF","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lou owns a small French restaurant named Luella’s in the heart of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She’s engaged to be married, however, she tries to surprise him with a coconut cake for his birthday only to find a woman in his apartment. In lingerie. She doesn’t take the news well and the restaurant suffers from it that night, which also happens to be the night the local food critic visits Luella’s.Her little restaurant begins a downward spiral after his scathing review but things are starting to look up when she meets someone new. Al is from the UK and has yet to be shown around Milwaukee so Lou agrees to be his guide. She takes him to see everything from the best restaurants to museums and festivals. They begin to fall for each other during their non-dates realizing just how much they have in common, but neither of them know that Al was the food critic that caused Lou to lose her restaurant.The Coincidence of Coconut Cake is a delightful, lighthearted romance story that is also a love story to delicious foods and the city of Milwaukee. The food descriptions had me re-declaring my love for food.‘He started with the much hailed cheese curds, hot and oozing a little of the white cheddar; the outside was crispy and salty when he bit. A string of cheese dangled from his mouth to his hand as he pulled the cheese from his lips.’And also making a raid on my kitchen. And maybe planning a trip to Milwaukee to see all these wonderful sounding sights for myself.‘Ingredients in baking were mixed in a specific way to create a specific result; a lot like relationships. If people didn’t blend well together, you’d never get the outcome you wanted.’The requisite drama in this one was palpable and while it all came to a predictable resolution this was still a completely satisfying story. There’s something about the components of a basic foodie fiction book that I can’t help but fall in love with. Delicious food descriptions + quirky characters  adorable romances = me, head over heels. And The Coincidence of Coconut Cake has all the right ingredients.P.S. There’s even a delicious coconut cake recipe in the back pages that I can’t wait to try myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABNCK1D8U9CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501100718#wasThisHelpful","R3ABNCK1D8U9CW","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was more lesson in that than in killin’ any eight-point buck.’Bull Mountain is located in the backwoods of Northern Georgia where for decades the Burroughs family has successfully evaded the law while making their living running moonshine, pot and eventually meth. Halford Burroughs is currently the man in charge of Bull Mountain while his younger brother and family outcast Clayton is the sheriff of the county. The two have managed to form a precarious truce yet fractures form when Special Agent Simon Holly arrives with the revelation that he’s there to put a stop to the Burroughs family enterprise on Bull Mountain.‘Clayton knew he would always be welcome, but the badge had no business here at all.

And if it didn’t belong, the people who lived here made d*** sure it didn’t stay.’Bull Mountain centers around two brothers, Halford and Clayton, but actions of their father, Gareth, from decades past is responsible for setting in motion the current catastrophe. When Gareth Burroughs made the transition from moonshine to pot and then to meth, the need to secure his growing empire became more and more apparent. Allying himself with gun producers in Florida is the first step he takes in the wrong direction seeing as the Burroughs have always kept their business on the mountain, never asking for outside help. The alliance continues when Halford takes over, but the Feds have discovered the dealings down in Florida and have successfully traced it back to Bull Mountain. Clayton is the only one with the chance to convince his brother to sell out who he’s working with in order to avoid prosecution and to avoid the firestorm set to descend upon the land.Every once in a while a book will come along that leaves you completely dumbstruck in how utterly impressive it is. Bull Mountain is one of those books for me. Even more so impressive is the fact that this is the authors debut novel. Not only was the labyrinthine plot that ricocheted back and forth in time and between a slew of characters handled skillfully but the brilliance of the twist that managed to alter the entire story was utterly superb. Bull Mountain is a dysfunctional saga about a family that pride themselves on loyalty that begins to be warped by the long line of violence and bloodshed. It’s a story where the line between good and bad is significantly blurred to the point of no recognition. Where even the characters can no longer see how their actions have transformed them.According to this interview(http://www.writersbone.com/interviewsarchive/2015/6/28/tumbleweed-tendencies-a-conversation-with-author-brian-panowich-about-his-debut-novel-bull-mountain), there’s already a second book set in McFalls County and a possible third to come as well. I couldn’t be more pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HRJK1ORXQ3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917396X#wasThisHelpful","R31HRJK1ORXQ3G","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my new favorite piece of clothing. I absolutely adore this top! The plaid material is a soft, flannel material that isn't too heavy and is great over a basic top on a cooler day. But what really sets this apart from the rest of the basic plaid tops is the lace insets. Lace lines the entirety of the hood, along the cuffs, and even inside the pocket flaps on the chest. The hood is a decent size and isn't just for show.The top does run a little bit small, especially in the shoulder area. I typically wear an XL and I ordered a 14. Stretches a little during wear but still very pleased with this product!

"Hilary Westfield has finally achieved her ultimate goal in life: she’s an official member of The Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates. But life as a pirate has been, as of late, not exactly full of thrills. This has clearly not gone unnoticed as she’s just received her first warning from the Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates that her membership is about to be revoked if she doesn’t start acting more pirate-y. Hilary and her crew head off on a search to find the lost Enchantress and she can only hope that this mission helps her reputation as a pirate.While reading this, the one thing I kept thinking was this would be one adorable Disney movie. We’ve got Hilary, the young girl who wants nothing more than to be a world renowned pirate. There’s her unlikely companion, a talking gargoyle rather than the much expected parrot. Add to that are the more goofy than dangerous pirates, the clueless police inspectors, the snobbish patricians that frown upon pirates and the all-together light-hearted storyline that is quite delightful indeed. Definitely a perfect storyline for a Disney movie.More pirates, more adventures, more magic and of course more gargoyle make this an entertaining second installment in The Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates series. There isn’t much in the way of advancement in overall plot but this is such a fun read that readers of this series aren’t likely to mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLKYW6ATWCYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062194364#wasThisHelpful","RFLKYW6ATWCYF","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘Laying there on our bed is Jeremiah’s work shirt where I left it, the map unfolded beside it. And then like a hornets’ nest in the hot dust that you almost don’t see until it’s too late, but once you have, you can’t not see it for the buzzing in and out of the crack in the dirt crust, the idea of it just comes to me.’It’s 1862, and the country is in the midst of the Civil War that goes on for another 3 years. Jeremiah Wakefield, a New Yorker, has dreams of someday owning his own farm and being able to take care of Rosetta and their future family and the Army’s enlistment bonus would be exactly what he needs to do that. Rosetta is a tomboy and helps out on her fathers farm but when she finds out that Jeremiah is leaving her for the war, she insists that if he’s intent on going off to war that he’s going to marry her first. They end up marrying and Jeremiah leaves shortly afterwards. Rosetta finds that life just isn’t the same with him gone and sitting alone in their house day in and day out worried about his safety is more than she can take. So she chops off her hair and enlists in her husband’s unit as “Ross Stone”.Rosetta was the most incredibly memorable and courageous character. I Shall Be Near to You showcases one woman of this time period that defied gender expectations but Rosetta was not the only woman out there fighting alongside husbands, brothers, or fathers. In the Author’s Note, McCabe states that “…the fictional Rosetta’s experience as a soldier is an amalgamation of the experiences of the more than two hundred women who are known to have enlisted [...]“. It’s an aspect of war, not just during the Civil War either, that is not often explored and it was so fantastic to read this beautifully written story bringing these women’s stories to life, women who put their lives on the line when they didn’t have to.McCabe’s time spent researching this period is evident from her descriptions of the camp sites set up, to the foods, and of the deep seated feeling of dread these men (and women) were experiencing when marching into battle. Rosetta’s sacrifice and dedication to her husband is truly inspirational and you’ll be hard pressed to forget their ardent love story. Skillfully constructed and masterfully executed, if you are a fan of historical fiction novels and especially Civil War centered novels, this is a must read. A most impressive debut novel, I eagerly await more from McCabe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJYW822MR930/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137749#wasThisHelpful","R1WJYW822MR930","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""What am I living for and what am I dying for are the same question.""The Year of the Flood is a companion novel to Oryx and Crake (however O&C fills in much of the necessary back story so make sure not to skip it).The discussion (or argument) continues with The Year of the Flood regarding the ability to alter humans in order to achieve perfection and whether it's an ability that should be used. This time, we get to see the world through the eyes of Gods Gardner's (and also those of whom live in the pleeblands). The God's Gardner's are an extremely eco-conscious group of people that have been prophesying for years of the `Waterless Flood' that is impending. Because these people have anticipated this event for so long they're more prepared than anyone else, or at least the ones that survived the initial pandemic are. This group of people has created their own ideology which melds science and nature into the fabric of religion and was really quite fascinating. The most fascinating aspect of Oryx and Crake was learning about the pandemic and how it came to be but with The Year of the Flood it was the focus on this extremely adaptive group and how they managed to survive in a world where no one else could.The highly creative world Atwood has created is not without flaws. It is imperfect and blemished, however for me that was what appealed the most. I expect if we ever find ourselves in a dystopian/post-apocalyptic world it would be much the same lacking a perfectly wrapped up ending. Atwood has been clear to designate this trilogy as ""speculative fiction"" and not ""science fiction"". Science fiction tends to be so outlandish that its very unlikely it will ever occur whereas speculative fiction may be outlandish at first glance yet its still dreadfully possible. That's exactly what these stories exude: the actual possibility of these events transpiring. It's what makes these books fantastic yet so terribly frightening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQWM0U2RW6DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q1IUNK#wasThisHelpful","R3TQWM0U2RW6DG","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.’Lolita is likely one of the most controversial stories in 20th century literature to date. Lolita has been coined as a ‘love story’ and even ‘erotic’. In all honesty, this was simply Humbert attempting to convince himself (and others) that his actions were normal and completely justified. By the end pages, I could honestly say that Humbert believed wholeheartedly he truly loved Lolita, that he always had the best of intentions for her and that he was a good father to her. His version of love was of course far from normal and was quite sick and twisted indeed but because we’re only seeing this story from his point of view it’s obviously a biased and glamorized interpretation.‘We live not only in a world of thoughts, but also in a world of things. Words without experience are meaningless.’But to me that was the most amazing part of this story. When you really think about this story as a whole, you know what he did was wrong, you know that he changed that 12 year-old girl irrevocably and you can almost despise him for the fact that he blamed her for seducing him initially. However, despite all that, I know I’m not the only reader that struggled to not feel at least a slight bit of sympathy for him. And that’s the true brilliance of it.‘And the rest is rust and stardust.’Lolita is a truly remarkably written story that was undoubtedly shocking after its initial publication in 1955. I can’t help but find it severely unlikely though that it would have ever been published during this day and age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXSB523TO0MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739322060#wasThisHelpful","R1YXSB523TO0MB","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘The experiment are watching.You can feel them, ay. In the quiet. In the room. Wherever you are-they’re there. That’s a given. Sometimes they’re right, sometimes a wee bit further away; when I want to hurt myself but I dinnae, I can always feel them then. They want me to hurt myself. They’re sick like that. What they really want is me dead.’Anais, 15 years old, is suspected of assaulting a police officer and while the police complete their investigation she’s taken to The Panopticon for close monitoring. For being so young, Anais has led a shockingly violent life. She never met her birth mother and has been in the foster care system since she was born. Her foster mother was brutally murdered and Anais was the one to find her body. Drugs and alcohol has become par for the course with her and is the reason she can’t remember if she actually did assault that police officer. All she knows is, the tower in The Panopticon watches over everyone, always. Whether that’s simply a paranoid delusion or not remains to be seen.‘The watchtower windows reflect the sun, and the big bug-eyes stare, and it’s totally obvious that watchtower doesnae even need staff in it; it just watches – all on its own.’The Panopticon is a wild ride of pure insanity. A crazy combination of A Clockwork Orange, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Scottish style. The Scottish terms will seek to overwhelm you but Google is useful; use it. This story was shocking and heartbreaking, even more so when you find out it’s loosely based on the authors own personal experiences with the foster care system in Scotland. Anais may be a juvenile delinquent but she’s still got morals and that’s what makes her case so heartbreaking. She’s smart, full of wit and has hopes and dreams of living in Paris above a bakery where she’d wake up to the smell of fresh croissants. But since she doesn’t live above a bakery in Paris, she passes the time by playing the ‘Birthday Game’ where she uses her imagination to make up a different life than the one she’s currently leading.Anais is a prime example of juvenile delinquency but she’s not the only misfit being kept at The Panopticon. There’s the girls she befriends: Isla, the HIV-positive mother of twins that cuts herself to try to rid herself of the virus and Tash, her lover who works as a prostitute in order to save up for their own flat. There are less sad-cases as well such as the boy who is bullied by everyone including the staff after he is caught raping a dog and another who burned down a special-needs school. Bottom line, this is not a pretty story, but despite its ugliness it tells the honest story of young people that are beaten down by the system that is intended to keep them safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFX0ZI8NBDFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347952#wasThisHelpful","R1CFX0ZI8NBDFK","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘A heartbeat, a split-second’s whim, that’s all it takes to change your life forever.But what happens when you get it wrong?’Abigail Haas has done it again. Dangerous Boys is one seriously twisted and convoluted tale that will have you completely enthralled. Her stories will put you under a spell, desperate for answers to eagerly sought questions. In Dangerous Boys, there is Chloe, and the brothers Ethan and Oliver. The three become complexly intertwined, irrevocably changing the makeup of each others lives. A terrible accident occurs involving the brothers and only one makes it out alive. But who survived? And what were the sequence of events that led up to that moment? These questions will exasperate you, forcing you to willingly glue yourself to the pages. The one thing you should come to expect with an Abigail Haas book though is nothing is ever as it seems.Dangerous Boys is a deceptively simple tale of a young girl freshly out of high school who has big dreams of leaving the small town behind and experiencing life. Her life is upended when her father divorces her mother and her mother is thrown into a deep depression, leaving Chloe to take care of her and thus forcing her to put her future on hold. The story alternates between the past, before Chloe meets Ethan and Oliver, and the present, after the devastating fire. Piece by piece the story begins to form. Chloe and Ethan’s relationship, Oliver’s involvement, the jealousy and turmoil that takes place… all leading up to the accident that took the life of one of the boys.What truly made this story shine for me was Chloe’s character. At first glance she’s just a small town girl with big city dreams but her complexity was kept hidden and begins to blossom as the story progresses. Here’s a girl that has always done what’s right, has kept her grades up in hopes of achieving her dreams. As her life begins to crumble around her and her hopes become dashed, the regret and anger over her circumstances builds. The introduction of the two boys into her life changes everything for her and breaks the mask she’s been hiding behind. We’ve all hidden behind a facade of sorts at one time or another and discovering that person that sees through all the bulls*** to the very heart of you can be an enlightening and transforming experience.Abigail Haas is a writer of mesmerizing mysteries that always keeps me second-guessing. A truly talented writer that I eagerly await more from.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PL0SMOIEM07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT5W3U0#wasThisHelpful","R35PL0SMOIEM07","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Secret Diary of Lizzie Bennet is a modern retelling of Jane Austen’s ‘Pride and Prejudice’ that transports the characters from the early 1800s England to 2014 America. Lizzie Bennet is a college grad student that has begun vlogging about her daily life as a study of social media for her thesis. What started out as a simple school project though becomes so much more.Okay, confession time: I have never read the original Pride and Prejudice. YES, I plan on correcting this, hopefully soon. I have read the movies though (and LOVE them) so I’m at least aware of the storyline. TLBD was constantly popping up on my Twitter feed and when I finally asked I was directed to the youtube page. WARNING: If you have not yet watched TLBD please make sure you have several hours of time on your hands before going there. I’m serious. It is so addicting. And SO fun.If you’re a fan of TLBD on YouTube, you will adore this book. Yes, it’s the same story for the most part but there are small additions to the story that would have happened off camera that we get an interesting in depth look into. Plus, if you’re suffering through withdrawals of TLBD then you’re likely willing to take anything you can get.If you’ve opted to read this via audiobook, it is quite frankly like listening to the YouTube videos with your screen minimized. The lack of actual facetime with the characters was sorely missed because they are all incredible in their roles, but Ashley Clements (the actor who played Lizzie in TLBD) did a superb job at narrating the assorted voices and made me glad I opted to go the audio route. For those of you that have not watched the YouTube videos, it is not necessary to fully appreciate the book but you’ll likely want to watch them after getting immersed in the world of modern Lizzie Bennet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108B3QUL7FH1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVY1L8Q#wasThisHelpful","R108B3QUL7FH1J","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘...there are not jostling anxious crowds outside, no frightened people rushing and pushing past each other in the streets. No klaxon howl of car alarms, no distant gunfire. The people are hidden now, those that remain, hidden under blankets or in basements, encased in their dread.’With mere weeks left before the impending asteroid makes impact with the earth, Detective Henry Palace is on a last minute mission to get to his sister Nico before it’s too late. Nico is convinced that the group she’s joined up with is going to be able to save the world with the help of a nuclear scientist by the name of Hans-Michael Parry but Palace is convinced that it’s nothing but a farce. One way or another, he intends to do anything and everything he can to ensure his sisters safety and solve his final case for the brief time that he may or may not have left.‘They say that just before impact the sky will brighten ferociously, like the sun has burst from its own skin, and then we will feel it, even on the far of the earth we will feel it, the whole world will quaver from the blow.’The journey to find his sister is a difficult one. The few clues he has takes him and his dog Houdini from New Hampshire to Ohio and upon reaching the abandoned police station in the small town of Rotary, the evidence he sees leaves the outlook bleak. His determination to find his sister despite the knowledge that in a few days it will no longer matter is heartrending but his resolve is truly admirable. Society is crumbling around him and the world is literally about to come to an end yet Detective Henry Palace is doing whatever he can to maintain his morality even in the face of mortality. World of Trouble is an engaging end to a thrilling trilogy that you will want to race through to determine the fate of the earth and its inhabitants.

"Jess is a resolutely optimistic single mother who struggles with two jobs and two kids after her husband, seemingly suffering from depression, leaves them to move back in with his mother. When her daughter Tanzie gets the opportunity of a lifetime at a prestigious school, the only way the tuition can get paid is if Jess gets her to a Math Olympiad in Scotland. Only problem is, they don't have a car nor the funds to get there. Ed, a tech millionaire who's house Jess cleans, has gotten into a world of trouble involving being accused of insider trading and he needs to get out of town in hopes that his troubles blow over. Ed ends up offering to drive Jess, her two kids and they're stinky dog Norman to Scotland in what ends up being one seriously stressful yet hilarious road trip.In this hysterical and emotional tale of opposites attract, Jojo Moyes continues to solidify her spot as one of my favorite authors. Her portrayal of life as a single mom struggling to keep her kids fed was sobering but terribly relatable if anyone has ever struggled financially. Jojo Moyes also tackles the topic of economic differences, bullies and deadbeat dads with ease. Her characterization is unerring with each and every character being well-written and detailed without managing to tread too far into predictable territory. Her stories have always managed to throw me with their unexpected twists and One Plus One is no different. The two main characters both possess enough wittiness and differences which cause their attraction to not be immediate. The romance is a slow, subtle build that even though you're expecting you still won't really see it coming.One Plus One's summary would suggest a typical, formulaic chick-lit story of opposites attract but culminates into a simple and pleasing page-turner that fans of the genre won't want to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2BG6HX7ZTFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426582#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2BG6HX7ZTFF","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My rating: 3.5 of 5 starsIn The Thousand-Dollar Tan Line, (almost) the whole gang is back together again. Veronica has left her high paying job as an attorney in New York City to return to Neptune, CA to help her dad out with his PI business. Mac Mackenzie has left her fancy job as well to assist in the computer aspects of the job but they’re struggling to make ends meet. A huge case finally lands in their laps when the incompetency of the local sheriff department requires the Chamber of Commerce to hire help to find a missing girl that was visiting Neptune on spring break.Veronica Mars is one of my all-time favorite shows that was cancelled much too soon. When it was released that not only would there be a new movie to look forward but a book series as well I had a total fit. Finding out that Kristen Bell narrates the audio of the first book was even better news. Kristen Bell perfectly narrated each and every character we’ve grown to know and love. The audio is definitely the way to go with this one. The story itself was ALMOST as good as I had hoped it could be. It was a slow build in the mystery bits and Veronica doesn’t even make an immediate appearance but that’s temporary. The mystery is interesting and has a few twists I didn’t see coming but it did still feel like it possessed the typical framework of many already been done before VMars investigations. Regardless, just being back in Neptune was the best thing ever.The Thousand-Dollar Tan Line is written in third person POV and for the most part it worked. Would first person have worked better? Most likely. But third person does allow the reader the opportunity of a different perspective on Veronica and the investigation in order to formulate their own thoughts and opinions rather than seeing it solely through her eyes.One of the things I loved about the show was the skillful combination of the mystery and the romance. This wasn’t the case here though as Logan has a minuscule part in the story, however, I am okay with this as I find myself a bit over Logan. Gasp. I know. I just wanted to something fresh and different for her I think. Here we have Veronica in her late 20s and yet she’s doing the same things she did in high school. She left a well-paying job in New York to go back to Neptune just to go back to the same job that makes it a struggle to pay the bills. While I understand this is an introductory novel back into the life of Veronica, I can only hope that we can expect bigger and better things for her. The ending definitely left open the opportunity for future VMars stories and I for one cannot wait.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6ZXR9890GEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUBCDJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3K6ZXR9890GEE","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘In this present hour, there was time for anything to happen, endless time.’The Sea Garden contains three separate novellas that slowly intertwine together. The first novella shares the name of the title and is set in present day. The second and third novellas are all centered around the WWII era.I became an instant fan of Deborah Lawrenson’s after her debut novel, ‘The Lantern‘ completely mesmerized me with its Rebecca-esque gothic story. It was clear she had a talent for the written word and I’ve been anxiously awaiting a new book from her. The Sea Garden presents a somewhat full-length novel, broke up into seemingly separate stories but have more in common than assumed. The Sea Garden novella is the present day story which brings to life a young woman named Ellie who is hired to construct a new WWII Memorial Garden. Her short visit is a disturbing one after the mother of the man that hired her is unkindly to her and after she believes to have seen ghosts in the Garden. The real heart of the story comes in the WWII stories that have an unexpected impact on Ellie’s life even after all that time has passed.‘Thy word is a lantern unto my feet: and a light unto my path.’I recognized and enjoyed the authors skillful writing yet found this story lacking in comparison to its predecessor. I found The Sea Garden to be for the most part too convoluted and lacking a clear and concise ending that wrapped up all loose ends. The affinity between the three tales was a little too slack and wasn’t as solid of a connection as I would expect with a multi-narrative tale such as this. Also, the odd supernatural aspects felt superfluous and too extravagant of an addition to this basic tale of history and its effects on everyone it touches. The writing was most pleasing but I would have appreciated this story more if the three novellas had stood on their own without the compulsory connection between them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPJMXU86GM5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ37AP6#wasThisHelpful","R2PPJMXU86GM5G","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pushing the Limits is a contemporary YA story about romance and friendship and dealing with loss. Echo was involved in an accident with her mother but the trauma was so strong that her mind has blocked it completely. All she wants to do is remember, but is she strong enough to handle the truth? Noah is still dealing with the loss of his parents in a house fire and is struggling to survive the foster care system. He was separated from his two younger brothers and all he wants to do is obtain custody of them so they can all be a happy family again. Echo and Noah have both suffered in life but are complete opposites of each other, yet they fall for one another just the same.I've said it before and I'll say it again: YA contemporary is not my go-to genre. This book sat on my shelf for years because lets be honest, that cover screams nothing but high school! romance! angst! drama! to me. I was surprised that while the romance (and yes, all the angst and drama one could ever hope for) is a major part, the story possessed a depth I was not expecting. Echo and Noah were individuals that had been forced into growing up sooner than necessary due to incidents in their life and Pushing the Limits is their coming of age story that treads the line between YA and NA and will be well-liked by fans of both.Pushing the Limits was entertaining and I read it fairly quickly, however, it didn't manage to generate much in the way of opinion. I was overall a bit indifferent about Echo and Noah's story. While I appreciated the complex and separate side stories of both characters, it was all too melodramatic for me in the end. The romance was given some time to develop so instant love wasn't a real factor, but once the romance started it, the seriousness between the two progressed at the speed of light. There were the obligatory `I love you's' thrown around and the constant use of `babe'. While the characters stories possessed depth I didn't feel that their romance did. The story suffered in pacing during the second half and would have benefited from a trim in length as it only succeeded in adding more of the already abundant melodramatic flair. Excessively long yet still compulsively readable, it disappointed by ending too predictably. I seem to have nothing but negative things to say, yet I did enjoy the read overall. It'd be worth it to give the author another shot to see how she progresses as a writer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FHAVS2W04JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0A5Y78#wasThisHelpful","R3FHAVS2W04JH","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“That girl, dead and gone, her spirit trapped forever just inside town limits—she’d come from someplace, was going somewhere. Until destiny had stepped into the road in front of her, stopped her forward motion, drawn a killing claw against the white, fluttering swell of her future. Whispering, ‘Oh no, you don’t.’When you made plans, the saboteurs came out to play.”The night of Becca’s high school graduation brings her one step closer to leaving small-town life forever. The following day brings dreadful news of a young girl that was found beaten to death on the side of the road. The death of this unknown girl stirs Becca’s doubts and causes her to become fearful of this outside world that she’s received her first glimpse of. Was this girl killed by an outsider or is the one to be feared someone from her own town?I was warned that Amelia Anne is Dead and Gone isn’t a book for everyone. I was warned about the prose. I was warned about the excessive descriptions. But those warnings were clearly not meant for me. The intro line managed to grab me instantly. Hook, line and sinker.‘The night before Amelia Anne Richardson bled her life away on a parched dirt road outside of town, I bled out my dignity in the back of a pickup truck under a star-pricked sky.’You couldn’t tear this book out of my hands after that. I worked reluctantly. I slept reluctantly. I couldn’t stop reading until I had completely devoured this book. The author is so adroit with the English language that I wish it wasn’t her debut so I had a full backlog of her work to go back and read. Rosenfield’s descriptions are excessive but felt completely necessary for this type of story. The additional wording added a heightened sense of what was truly happening, a heightened sense of dread. The continued investigation into this girls death never succeeded in actually getting any closer to solving but it did succeed in completely unraveling the town and each of its inhabitants.Amelia Anne centers primarily around Becca who after having sex with her boyfriend James was unceremoniously dumped immediately after. The death of this anonymous girl and the effect that her death has on this small town is actually more of a side story. The story alternates between Amelia’s final days and Becca’s transformed days following the discovery of the mysterious body. As the story unfolds, the reader is shown the similarities between the girls despite their differences. The mystery in how the two came to be connected seemed to be an impossibility. Seeing the pieces of their stories slowly merge and form the bigger picture was a revelation as I managed to remain in the dark until the very end.‘In a place so insulted, where lives are so small and gone about so quietly, violent death hangs in the air – tinting everything crimson, weaving itself into the shimmering heat that rises off the winding asphalt roads at noon.’Certain details of this story really stood out for me. Firstly was Rosenfield’s portrayal of a mature teenage love in its genuine form with all its unnecessary complexity. Her descriptions of this small town and its inhabitants were completely on point. Not surprising, the author grew up in a small town in New York with a population of less than 3k people. And lastly, her ability to write such an intricate and alluring tale in less than 300 pages.Amelia Anne is Dead and Gone is an exquisitely written debut novel that’s flawlessly layered and incredibly captivating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWJBPPN0NGET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142426105#wasThisHelpful","R2QWJBPPN0NGET","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘The box she had carefully constructed about herself would fall apart. And she didn’t know if she could bear standing out in the open, in the harsh wind, without the comforting warmth of those walls she had built to shut out everything she didn’t like or understand.’In the early 1930′s, Hitler’s rise to power as the undisputed leader of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party continues. The country is in ruin after the financial crisis and the people were drawn to the promise of changes that Hitler vowed to make as soon as he’s elected Chancellor of Germany. He has up until now kept his true intentions for the Jewish people hidden under a thick coat of gloss, but the truth is starting to come out bit by bit. Gretchen Müller grew up knowing nothing but love for ‘Uncle Adolf’ after her father died preventing an assassination attack on Hitler. When new information is brought to her attention that her fathers death isn’t all as it appears, everything she has ever believed has to be reevaluated.‘He had said his opponents were flung cross every corner of the city, barely discernible, like a spiderweb-until you tossed water on the gossamer net and there your opponents were, glistening like diamonds, brilliantly bright and unmistakable.’Gretchen Müller’s beliefs in the National Socialist Party run deep, yet her father’s death hit her hard and she still misses him dearly. Her continued suffering over his loss manages to be the chink in her belief system and when a young Jewish reporter named Daniel Cohen approaches her about the possibility that his death was actually murder, everything in her life begins to crumble. The historical detailing was at times excessive but really manages to set the scene well. It’s clear that the time period was well-researched and it all felt authentic despite the obvious fictional additions. While I didn’t see the likelihood of a Jewish reporter taking the chance to approach Hitler’s ‘golden-girl’, I did feel that Gretchen’s change of mind as she uncovers more evidence of her fathers murder was genuine and believable.The murder mystery was hands down the best part of this novel. There were scenes of gripping intensity when Gretchen and Daniel would creep through the shadows to uncover necessary information to expose her fathers murderer. The personal scenes between Gretchen and Hitler were chilling and while I have read many books regarding this time period, I had yet to read one where Hitler has a starring role, showing his disturbing nature clearly. Also frightening was Gretchen’s ghastly brother who shared many characteristics of Hitler himself. A warning to you animal lovers, there is a severely heartbreaking scene that I wish I was able to mentally prepare for.My one disappointment was the romance. While I’m all for a good forbidden love story, and this one was certainly forbidden, I didn’t feel the feels unfortunately. Their love isn’t instantaneous, however, I felt we learned much more about Gretchen and not enough about Daniel to get properly attached to his character. Gretchen’s feelings regarding Daniel felt clunky and while I would normally expect this considering her ingrained beliefs towards Jews, it felt like her change of heart came far too quickly.The complete lack of interest in the romance managed to throw a wrench in the entire story for me but thankfully there was an incredibly interesting murder mystery for me to follow instead. Prisoner of Night and Fog is a fantastic look into the time period from the unaccustomed German perspective. Witnessing Hitler’s rise in power was especially disheartening as we all already know of what’s to come. The ending sets up the next book nicely and I’m interested to see how the author continues handling this historical time period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DX9PXNAMQ5ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ37AK6#wasThisHelpful","R3DX9PXNAMQ5ZQ","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deliverancedeliv·er·ance [dih-liv-er-uhns]noun: the state of being saved from something dangerous or unpleasantDeliverance is the deceptively simplistic story of four ordinary men from Atlanta that decide to go on a canoe trip in the Georgia wilderness. The river they plan to traverse is destined to disappear soon because of a new dam that will flood the area. Soon into their trip, they encounter two men who live in the nearby mountains and their weekend wilderness adventure quickly morphs into a struggle for their very survival.‘The river was blank and mindless with beauty. It was the most glorious thing I have ever seen. But it was not seeing, really. For once it was not just seeing. It was beholding. I beheld the river in its icy pit of brightness, in its far-below sound and indifference, in its large coil and tiny points and flashes of the moon, in its long sinuous form, in its uncomprehending consequence.’Unlike most who have either read this book or experienced the movie, I went into this story completely blind, oblivious of the horrors to come. Being a fan of southern gothic fiction though, it was essential I read the original classic that helped to generate the genre. Published in 1970, Deliverance was Dickey’s first novel and the one he went on to be most known for. In 1965, he won the National Book Award in Poetry and those poetic abilities shown through the darkness of Deliverance. The surprisingly beautiful poetic quality added a much needed delicacy to this tale so as to make it a much more agreeable read.“Here we go, out of the sleep of the mild people, into the wild rippling water.”The river itself, the Cahulawassee River, has much more symbolism than one would initially recognize. The Cahulawassee River is being forced into modern times and will cease to exist in a matter of weeks. These four men are forced into changes as well due to the harsh situations they are involuntary put through. It changes their mindset and state of being and forces them to make choices they never expected to have to make. These changes necessitated the realization that while they felt like ordinary men in comparison to the abominations that they faced, they were more than able to transform similarly all in the name of survival.Deliverance is a dark and dismal read but is permeated with skillfully beautiful writing that makes it a completely necessary read for any fans of the genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LPMI8MXJR6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061HS5L2#wasThisHelpful","R9LPMI8MXJR6D","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Pandora [...] was a really amazing woman. All the gods had blessed her and given her gifts. That’s what her name means – ‘the girl with all the gifts’. So she was clever, and brave, and beautiful, and funny, and everything else you’d want to be. But she just had the one tiny fault, which was that she was very – and I mean very curious.”Melanie is a curious little girl, much like Pandora was. She loves school, loves learning but loves her teacher Miss Justineau even more. She’s never seen the outside world, only her cell, the corridor, the shower room and the classroom which is located on an army base. Melanie is an incredibly intelligent little girl, capable of extremely high level classes for someone her age. Other than being near genius, she’s just a normal little girl, until she catches the scent of human flesh.‘…the Breakdown, when the world filled with monsters who looked like people you knew and loved, and every living soul went scrambling and skittering for cover like mice when the cat wakes up…’The normal hungries that roam the earth are your classic type zombie: they’re mindless and single-minded when it comes to obtaining their next meal. Melanie and her classmates are high-functioning zombies or “hungries” that are capable of speech and emotions, things the normal hungries are incapable of. These children have been captured for the sole purpose of experimentation, in hopes that they are the key to a possible cure for this terrible disease that has consumed the world.There are many interesting aspects to this novel that I wouldn’t normally expect to find in a normal zombie-type book. First and foremost is the cognitive abilities of these children despite their undead status. It was an interesting aspect and leads to the next aspect: the ethics behind the experimenting on these coherent children even if it’s done for the good of the human race. The doctor conducting the experiments, Doctor Caldwell, has completely disconnected herself from the belief that what she is doing is wrong and successfully convinces you as a reader in the chapters told from her POV that it’s for the greater good. Switching to the chapters told from the POV of Miss Justineau offers you the opposite stance as she’s become attached to not only Melanie but the whole of her students even though she fully understands exactly what they are and the danger they represent. The perplexity of the situation their forced into isn’t simple nor straightforward.The other aspect to this novel that is the main driving force is the relationship that develops between Melanie and Miss Justineau. Melanie has suffered through a life of solitary and Miss Justineau’s teachings are the shining beacon of hope that she always has to look forward to. In turn, Miss Justineau develops an affection for Melanie despite her best intentions to remain distant. The relationship was surprisingly heartfelt and touching.Setting all the unexpected aspects aside, my favorite aspect of zombie novels is always the why and seeing what route each author takes. Zombie novels have become quite common these days and thus requires them to have an original aspect that hasn’t been done before. The Girl With All the Gifts does just that. The individuals in this novel are infected with Ophiocordyceps, a genus of fungi that actually exists in our world today but grows only on insects. I can’t express enough what a superb job M.R. Carey does at explaining the details of this fungus and how it came to be possible for it to infect humans. He goes into incredible detail yet explains it in such a skillful way as to avoid leaving us non-scientists completely clueless.While The Girl With All the Gifts had many incredible facets to it, the ending was the most memorable. Shocking and unexpected yet such a fitting ending to this amazing story. Engaging, shocking and thrilling, The Girl With All the Gifts is one incredible read that thankfully manages to live up to all the hype.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNSIN4FHQSDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316278157#wasThisHelpful","R3JNSIN4FHQSDB","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“We all have a past. Some people just can’t let go of it.”Ross and Claire are newlyweds, honeymooning in Scotland when tragedy strikes. Shortly before the two are due to leave for home, Claire becomes ill and ends up in a coma in the hospital. Ross becomes completely overcome with grief, unable to come to terms with what is happening and ends up in an accident and blacks out. He wakes up in the year 1333.‘I marvel at the fact that I haven’t broken out in hives. Apparently, not only has my eyesight improved, but my allergy to horses hasn’t transferred to this time period, either.’I blame Outlander on my time-travel obsession. I also blame Outlander for my high expectations when it comes to time-travel. I’m able to count on one hand the amount of time-travel books that managed to work for me. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. There weren’t any special stones or portals that sent Ross back in time, instead he was run off the road while riding his bicycle by a semi and tumbled down a hill. He woke up in another time in completely different clothes with renewed eyesight and a curious lack of his typical allergies. Instead of going back in time as himself, he went back in time and took over the life of one of his ancestors (à la Assassin’s Creed, just replacing the Animus with a grassy hill). It worked yet it didn’t and was cause for some serious confusion later as the story develops.The historical aspects of this novel were well-done and felt very authentic but the incorporation of time-travel bits and a modern man in a medieval world felt clunky and strange. The biggest issue I had was with Ross, the main character, and his complete lack of a spine throughout the entirety of the novel.‘I’d signed up for a fencing class during my freshman year of college, but during the first session my impulse whenever my opponent thrust his rapier at me was to roll up in a ball on the floor and cover my head with my hands. I quickly switched to bowling class.’He improved somewhat as the novel progressed, but he was an irritating character from the beginning which made it difficult considering the entire story was told from his point of view. We’re given past glimpses into his childhood that were clearly meant to provide reason behind his meek and submissive personality but it still didn’t work for me. The time period did succeed in maturing him and turning him into a ‘manly man’ but even then there were passages that were clearly meant to show his character development that were slightly ridiculous.‘Somewhere a lamb, trapped in the ruins, bleats. I slow, keening my ears, and finally see it, its pink nose pressed between the bars of a wooden fence that has been pushed over. The small building next to it is still on fire. Adam sees it, too. He glances at me, shrugs in pity and goes on. A gap opens up between us and I dark after him, the lamb forgotten.’If this was intended to show his growing manliness it was a big fail. The character was a total coward, completely spineless and while he was a little less cowardly by the end he failed to generate any sympathy from me and his plights.The romance(s) were a big hot mess. We’re first introduced to Ross and Claire who are on their honeymoon yet Claire is constantly making fun of him, all in the name of playful teasing of course, and their spark couldn’t light a campfire if their life depended on it. When Claire becomes ill, Ross is distraught while contemplating life without her but it felt more like he was distraught about just being alone and didn’t have anything specifically to do with Claire. He wakes up in 1333, already resigned to the fact that he’s going to lose Claire and it immediately became oh! I have a wife here and another chance to love. The icing on the cake is the simple justification at the end, explaining everything with a pretty bow on top. It was a bit too perfect for my liking.In the Time of Kings is a historical fiction romance with a time-travel twist but was lacking in both characterization and romance. The historical fiction bits strongly showcased the authors abilities and will appeal to fans of the genre.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4RG91OJTH6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOY92QG#wasThisHelpful","R3R4RG91OJTH6E","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Just One Day, Allyson and Willem meet for one memorable day before getting separated. In Just One Year, the two spend the following year searching for one another before finally succeeding. But did they get their happily ever after?All be warned: there will be spoilers.I wasn’t a huge fan of this series in general but was so thrown by the ending (or lack of ending) in book two that I knew I had to pick this up regardless. Allyson and Willem never generated any warm fuzzies for me but I still wanted to see what happened to the two of them in the end. After finishing Just One Night I have to say, they (author? publisher? whoever made the call to publish this.) should have left well enough alone. The two get their happily ever after, but Just One Night only manages to showcase Allyson’s creepy stalker obsession with Willem (I’m sorry, but who travels the globe searching for a guy she spent a single day with?) and Willem’s creepy foot fetish. I’m not joking. Did he obsess about her feet in the other books? Because if he did I must have blocked that s*** out because, ew? For only 43 pages there were an obscene amount of foot comments. Here are several examples:‘Allyson is sitting on the sofa, her sandals off, neatly placed under the coffee table. (The sight of her bare feet. What this is doing to Willem’s blood pressure. She might as well have taken off all her clothes.)’‘It all feels like a dream and yet as natural as breathing. This is what you do. Put Allyson’s feet into your lap.’‘They are on the stairs and she is under him and he’s got that wrist of hers in his mouth (finally!) but it’s not enough, he wants all of her (the feet!) [...]‘“…Allyson is sitting next to him, and with everyone jammed at the table, she is right up close. And then she slips off her sandals under the table and sort of nuzzles her foot against his.He loses his appetite, for food anyway.”In addition to the creepy foot comments there was one ‘memorable’ scene in particular where Allyson was behind Willem on the bike he was riding and she decides to make out with his back, I guess since his mouth wasn’t available.‘She can nuzzle against his back and lick his vertebra if she wants to. (She does, so she does.)’‘Willem is just desperate for it to end. He is so full of wanting that it is painful and Allyson keeps lifting his shirt and licking his back, which she shouldn’t do while he’s riding a bike because he might pass out. (But she shouldn’t stop, either.)’This is the fourth Gayle Forman book I’ve read yet was the poorest showcasing of her writing skills. The point of view was often unclear and would switch up at random without any section breaks resulting in a strange disjointed feel to this short tale. Plus, I’m not sure what was up with the strange sentences she decided belonged in parenthesis for no apparent reason.Just One Night was intended to give fans the happily ever after that was lacking in Just One Year but it just didn’t do it for me. It failed to create emotional resonance I would have expected for two people that spent the past year searching for one another. Maybe it’s because I can’t look past the creepy feet comments or the fact that it seemed to be about nothing more than the two sleeping with each other. Maybe it’s because I never cared for their story or either one of their characters but I didn’t feel there was anything truly romantic about this love story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGHPIG84M6S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJXV3OQ#wasThisHelpful","RJGHPIG84M6S3","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Banishing the Dark picks up weeks after the explosive ending in Binding the Shadows. Cady is back at home after recuperating in the hospital but there is still much to be concerned about, primarily her violent mother who will stop at nothing to take Cady’s powers. In an attempt to protect Cady and her loved ones, a memory spell is cast that ends up causing even more problems. It’s a race against the clock to find out reverse the spells performed on Cady as a child, before her entire life is taken from her.I wouldn’t have thought it possible that by the fourth installment the character growth would continue to dig in deep making me love these characters even more and have them ranking right up there with my all-time favorite characters. Lon is such an amazing male lead and ranks right up there with Curran as one of the very best in Urban Fantasy. Cady is such a realistic and strong female lead that I love just as much as Kate Daniels and Kara Gillian. There was also an added bonus with the writing where dual POV’s were used: Cady and Jupe. Jupe has always been a favorite character of mine because of his crazy antics so it was enjoyable seeing a part of the story through his eyes.The Arcadia Bell series has easily become one of my all-time favorite Urban Fantasy series. And now it’s time to say goodbye.What I loved most about this one was how everything was sufficiently wrapped up yet didn’t have that perfect cherry on top sort of finish. There were still slight issues that the characters were dealing with and issues that they anticipated having to deal with in the future. They didn’t have a perfect fairytale ending but they did have a satisfying ending and I loved that. While I would not complain about more installments, I must say that in retrospect this was the perfect time to end it. There weren’t so many loose ends to tie up that Banishing the Dark turned into one major info-dump to answer all ongoing questions which is an issue I have with many series enders.Many bloggers that had the opportunity to read this early were not aware going into it that this was to be the final installment. I was glad to be warned ahead of time but it didn’t make the goodbyes any less sad. All I can say is, as much as I’d love to read more of Cady’s story I can respect the authors decision to end it when she knows it’s right. Cady and Lon and Jupe will all be missed but there’s always re-reads. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU6RCVGIXJAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451695098#wasThisHelpful","R2VU6RCVGIXJAE","AIGIQOEVITSJ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIGIQOEVITSJ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure why it has taken me this long to finally listen to Zappa's final recording, maybe because I was never as excited by his 80's work as his 60's and 70's stuff, but I've been missing out, and as some others have said here this was definitely his magnum opus.The symphonic synclavier compositions here (all of disc 1 is programmed while 30% of disc 2 is live sampling of the Ensemble Modern) are exquisite and varied, from energetic, manic and dramatic (like for a soundtrack to a mad scientist movie), to peaceful and beautiful, to dark and minimalistic. And then there's the spoken interludes - a mix of extended cuts from the 1967 sessions for Lumpy Gravy as well as more recent bits (with a new group of ""piano people"" recorded in '91 appearing on disc 2). And if you think all this spoken stuff is just the silly part, then please explain why he took the trouble to include it in the first place, or include the full libretto for it in the high quality and otherwise informative and beautiful packaging. For me they add a nice (sure, sometimes silly but always absurd) human element.Yes, its different than just about everything else he produced, but the overall effect is a fitting piece of conceptual continuity for good 'ol FZ.Damn, I wish he was still around doing his thing.

"This book had been on my wish list for some time, but I'm glad I waited until the 2nd edition was out to read it (and am surprised it hasn't been reviewed here before now). Cyrus Stearns has with obvious devotion to detail revised his original work substantially, and the result is a high quality academic yet eminently readable book.My 5 star rating isn't so much an opinion about Dolpopa's philosophical ideas - since their study can be helpful whether we agree with them or not - as an appreciation for the whole package Stearns presents (biography, history, and philosophy in a quality publication). For me these ideas are intellectually challenging, and the fact they have generally been considered outside the mainstream and provocative piques my interest. However they may be a bit dry and academic for the casual reader, and over the head of someone not familiar with basics of Yogacara and Madhyamaka philosophy and Tibetan commentary, and I confess that as I get older I find I have less patience for all the intricacies Tibetan Buddhists endlessly debate about the ""Two Truths"", and in fact would rather hear about the old Chan formulation of  ""3 truths"" (the relative, absolute and their nonduality), or even more, the intuitive experiential (and outrageous) Dzogchen dismissal of it all as being just ""2 lies"" from the point of view of primordial awareness.The 14th century Dolpopa seems like a fascinating individual, innovative, independent, even audacious, and his contribution to Tibet's spiritual traditions while widespread is not widely known and acknowledged today (and the fact that we are still talking about him almost 700 years later as THE main exemplar of independent thinking within Tibet is all the more remarkable!). I like his ideas, for their bold contrary flavor that challenged the accepted doctrines of his day, but while I may agree with some of his interpretations, it's really not my main concern which ideas and doctrines are more correct than others. Personally its easy to glibly think they are all wrong to some degree (since they are all mental constructs), but my hunch is that Dolpopa is correct, and our inherent Buddha Nature IS complete, pure, unconditioned, luminous and ever present (and not just a potential viable seed stored in our minds somehow...which the slow and steady gradualists would have us believe, nor a quaint poetic metaphor for a bland emptiness as the Prasangikas maintain), and that nonduality means just that, and that it is simply our habitual obscurations that prevent our direct experience of It (and that an intellectual understanding, no matter how accurate, isn't going to remove these obscurations one bit).Dolpopa's radical contribution to Tibetan Buddhism is that he openly taught that relative truth is referring to phenomena that doesn't actually exist, while absolute truth does exist in and of itself, and is really all that exists (the first part agrees with orthodoxy, the second is the heretical part). As Stearns points out, ""To say that there are no phenomena other than the basic space of phenomena (dharmadhatu) is equivalent to saying that there are no phenomena other than nondual primordial awareness"" (p. 96). Although this naturally leads into the more experiential views essential to the practice of deity yoga, Mahamudra and Dzogchen, Dolpopa's ideas in the sutrayana context of Buddha Nature and the Two Truths, while agreeing with a small stream of other masters throughout Tibetan history, were unorthodox and unacceptable to the majority in the reformed (Sarma) schools, especially after the Geluk sect became politically dominant in the mid 17th century and tried to impose a rather strict and uniform version of orthodoxy.Stearns' mostly focuses on the Sakya and Kagyu school's reaction since they interacted the most with Dolpopa's Jonang tradition, but it's a bit unclear (not addressed in much detail) how these ideas were received by the Nyingma (old school). It is clear that Dolpopa didn't agree that Mahamudra or Dzogchen 'nature of mind' teachings were complete (Dolpopa's preferred method for enlightenment was the Six-branch Yoga of the Kalachakra Tantra - which as Stearns briefly describes it sounds like a mix of Dzogchen's togyal/trekchod practices and the 6 Yogas of Naropa type tantric practices), yet the Nyingma's view in regard to pointing out the 'nature of mind' in Dzogchen is very similar sounding to Dolpopa's interpretation of absolute truth (if interested see Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition). The subtleties can get confusing! However, if one thing is clear from the various schools of Buddhism in Tibet its that mixing traditions, and trying to reconcile differences casually, is generally NOT helpful to one's actual practice. (The 19th century nonsectarian Rime movement was not about a blending or ""crossover"" in the modern American sense, as about the three underdog schools collecting and preserving the diversity of their various traditions - keeping them distinct and alive.)Clearly Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen was a remarkable master, and Stearns does an excellent job of presenting his life and teachings without it becoming overly complex, moreover Dolpopa's insightful criticisms are well worth considering for any serious student of Madhyamaka and Tathagatagarbha. As Stearns says in his intro, ""He (Dolpopa) often remarked that the majority of buddhas and bodhisattvas agree with him on these issues, but that the majority of scholars in Tibet oppose him."" This book reveals a controversial, provocative and creative side of normally conservative Tibetan culture, rarely seen, and does so through a wide range of material - biography of Dolpopa (p. 9-40), history of the shentong tradition (p. 41-83), doctrine of Dolpopa (p. 85-110), and original translations of Dolpopa's texts and autocommentaries (p. 113-311), as well as extensive end notes (p. 313-411) and bibliographies (p. 413-437).Overall this book makes a fascinating intro to his life, and his somewhat heretical ""shentong"" view of emptiness - highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZKORUHP48IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559393432#wasThisHelpful","R2OZKORUHP48IU","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book sight unseen so to speak because I like the subject, thought the title might indicate a radical dzogchen presentation, respect that Tulku Thondup wrote a foreword, and that Master Tam was a close student of Dudjom Rinpoche. What I discovered is a bit of a let down. It is a well produced little book that reads quickly and covers a lot of ground in a fairly reliable way, but it also seems very conventional and doesn't add much to the wide range of books already published on the subject (esp. see Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava's Teachings on the Six Bardos, Mirror of Mindfulness and The Bardo Guidebook). Maybe its main virtue is that it is short and makes the subject more easily accessible, and that for the most part it is aimed at a wide audience (not just Buddhist), and emphasizes the need for practical experience - and familiarity before we die... (Sadly, waiting to prepare for one's death until already on the death bed is kind of like starting to save for retirement on one's last day of work...)Master Tam is a Chinese Buddhist scholar born in 1935, and so his presentation understandably follows a more traditional format, but also gives us a nicely different perspective on these Tibetan teachings - often referencing Taoism and Chan Buddhism, along with modern secular metaphors. I kept reading because I warmed to Master Tam's style (casting a broad eclectic net), and really wanted to like his book, but I also found it lacking clear and memorable insights - being more of an intellectual (and sometimes too discursive) survey of the material.This book attempts to explain one of the most well known teachings to have come out of Tibet, Padmasambhava's 8th Century hidden treasure text (discovered and expounded upon in the 14th century by the 15 year old Karma Lingpa), on the ""Profound Dharma of Natural Liberation Through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities"" - specifically about the 6 bardos, or in-between states experienced in the process of living and dying. Obviously this is an essential subject for ALL people to be familiar with, and obviously the original version was very culturally specific (ie limited). Master Tam's retelling is pretty faithful to the original.So what we get is a traditional Vajrayana approach to a mix of exo and esoteric teachings. Master Tam's tradition is Nyingma (literally ""ancient ones"" which this treasure text is most closely associated with), but it is also the way Nyingmas adapted to the newer reformed schools of Tibetan Buddhism - a gradual path presentation of general spiritual practice including some profoundly timeless dzogchen essentials. Part 1 introduces a variety of basic concepts necessary to understand the teachings on the 6 bardos, such as 'ground of being', 'buddha nature', 'naturally arising' and 'naturally liberating' phenomena. Part 2, the meat of the book, offers various explanations and meditations that take us experientially through the 6 bardos. This practical aspect is the main redeeming part for me. Master Tam suggests many practices to do, and explains them in a quick yet effective manner. It is probably best for someone already familiar with more detailed explanations, yet is also presented as a basic intro. It reminds me that Karma Lingpa's original interpretation must have been very vague and poetic and designed as basic sign-posts for one's own realization. In this regard Master Tam's traditional yet scholarly approach is subtly revealing.3+ stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TO7CMML8XJ78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1896559107#wasThisHelpful","R3TO7CMML8XJ78","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was awed by Simon Phillips' drumming back in the late 70's when he played with Phil Manzanera's 801 (801 Live and Listen Now) at just 19 yrs old. And yet over the years I lost touch with his work (solo, as well as an in demand session player), and before recently getting this recording I'd never heard of pianist Jeff Babko. So I'm pleasantly surprised by this album from 2000, and glad to be catching up with Phillips' nimble understated virtuosic drumming.While most of these tunes are composed by Babko and Phillips, alone and in collaboration, they sound like they'd fit right in to the 60's Blue Note era - a straight ahead jazz sound that also reminds me a lot of Zappa's early 70's bop/big band recordings (both Phillips and trumpeter Walt Fowler played a bit with FZ). While not especially original sounding the music here is full and fluid and the playing masterful - from both Babko and Phillips as well as Dave Carpenter on bass, Brandon Fields on tenor and soprano sax, and Fowler on trumpet and flugelhorn. The studio recording quality is excellent, but for me the highlight is the final track; an almost 16 minute live version of Freddie Hubbard's ""Spirits of Trane"", which gives both Phillips and Babko ample opportunity to show their chops.Overall an enjoyable listen. 4+ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PYYRJODQE4O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004WK4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3PYYRJODQE4O6","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been years since I've felt this good listening to one of Hiatt's CDs.At this stage in life Hiatt writes and plays with a confidence and authority that is earthy and reassuring and carefree - as if he's happy just to be doing it, and doesn't really care what we think. This kind of relaxed mastery is refreshing in today's hyper self-counscious, ever slicker world of entertainment.He's one of those songwriters you want to listen closely to as his lyrics usually don't follow the predictable (besides the occasional throw-away, like his ""Baby's Gonna Kick"" and ""Old People"" here), and this is recorded so we can hear every word. Musically they have a comfortable familiarity that remind me of his work with Little Village, but also hints of The Pahinui Brothers, Kevin Coyne, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, old pirate shanties or something from O' Brother Where Art Thou. (My favorites on first impression are ""Long Time Comin' "", ""Marlene, ""Wind Don't Have To Hurry"", ""Nobody Knew His Name"", and ""Come Back Home"".)This CD must have been recorded really 'hot' because it has an intense in-you-face feeling - like seeing them playing up close in a small club, or practicing in a home studio. The DVD (part of the deluxe edition) of an October 2013 show at the Franklin Theatre (""in downtown Franklin Tennessee"") is pretty good too - with fine audio and video - and his band ""The Combo"" backing him really well, especially Doug Lancio on guitars. Best of all, the show manages to practically span his whole career in just 10 songs (with 2 from this latest CD) - including a killer version of ""Feels Like Rain"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9PQPMI4P5BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTNTORY#wasThisHelpful","R3C9PQPMI4P5BD","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another fine release from the Zappa Family Trust, this soundtrack for the movie (A Token of His Extreme - an excellent, not to be missed, glimpse at how good this band and performance was) is top quality FZ - from my favorite era/band of his - recorded (but apparently not domestically broadcast) as part of a special concert on 8/27/74, at the studios of KCET in LA.As the liner notes note, these are also pretty much (with small additions/omissions) the same performances as released earlier on The Dub Room Special, but in ""an entirely different mix."" Different enough to be worth getting - especially the way the drums/percussion really jump out as being the heart of Zappa's music, as well as the omission of ""Stevie's Spanking"" and ""Easy Meat"" from The Palladium 1981 NYC Halloween show, which is just fine by me, plus the addition of ""Oh No/Son of Orange County/More Trouble Everyday"" which is even better.Besides being more live music from one of the best bands he ever assembled (the same as on the great You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore - Vol. 2), the highlights here, for me, are his innovative extended guitar soloing on Montana, Florentine Pogen, Stink Foot, Pygmy Twylyte, Inca Roads, Son of Orange County and More Trouble Every Day.My only (very minor) complaint is that the liner notes are pretty sparse, with the printed track numbers not matching those on the actual disc. Overall though, both the performances and sound quality are excellent (perhaps even tightened up a bit due to the more formal TV studio venue). Yet even this slightly more ""normalized"" performance couldn't get any airtime on mid-70's American TV (although it did play in Europe). Understandably it must have been frustrating for FZ to be continually dismissed and disregarded (even as he pushed conventions to the limit....). Finally it seems (40 years later!) Zappa can be appreciated for what he did as a composer-musician-bandleader-performer, and not just rejected for how he appeared...

"Rusty Belle is new to me - discovered via their great contribution to Chris Smither's latest (Still on the Levee) - and I'm delighted. This CD, well produced by David Goodrich, who also produced Still on the Levee, offers a wide range of singer-songwriter/folk/americana music, combining great lyrics, excellent musicianship and a playful down-home spirit.Their style ranges from folk to rock, pop, old R&B, country, and blues. My favorites are ""Sad Little Boys"" which showcases Kate Lorenz's sultry contralto, ""Words That Fit"" which begins with a very Smither sounding acoustic guitar, ""Change My Heart"" (check out their playful video on youtube), ""When We Were Older"" which is achingly beautiful and would not be out of place on a Mary Gauthier recording (set to a tune Nick Drake could have written), ""I'm Alive"" (early rock verging on Beatlesque-based on a Richard Thompsonish rhythm) which I just can't get enough of, ""The Waves"" another Smither-sounding tune crossed with something Paul Simon might record, and  ""Sink and Swim"" another beautiful song with the lovely harmonies of brother and sister Matt and Kate.The packaging is a bit minimal - lyrics are included (although not that easy to read), but no listing of who's in the band or playing what (not hard to look up on their website, or from viewing their live performances on youtube). The youtube posts show just how these three are able to get such a rich sound out of such minimal instrumentation (all 3 do some form of percussion), and the website gives a short bio, letting me know they are from Massachusetts, formed in 2006, are comprised of Kate and Matt Lorenz and Zak Trojano and that this is their 6th CD. It won't be the last I hear of them... that's for sure.4+ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJRFMCC5P0Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FARKU2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJRFMCC5P0Y9","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little book, just brimming with facts and figures, statistics and upbeat anecdotes that make it clear that the world is (as John Lennon foresaw), ""Every day, in every way, ...getting better and better.""  So often pro-capitalist books are written by stogy and conservative seeming old men who, while often correct, seem to be speaking to and about an older century. This book by Johan Norberg, a relatively young Swede (born 1973), is remarkable in being for and about a younger generation of humans, which is overall healthier, wealthier, freer, better educated and more equal than any in history. It is about real positive change from the ground up (via the free market) instead of from central planners. Besides surveying the improving state of the world today Norberg also covers a wide range of topics that relate to capitalism, globalization and free trade (as well as simply and clearly defining them).This is the perfect book to encourage an optimism in those just getting started, an optimism sorely lacking in most media, political and academic accounts of life on Earth in the 21st century. This 2003 Cato Institute edition was originally written at the turn of the century and published in Sweden in 2001, and my only caveat in praising it is that it could use an update. A lot has happened in the past 11 years and it would be good to see (in the facts and stats and, Norberg's more mature attitude of today) how it continues to be positive for the majority of humans. It's this overall perspective that is so easy to lose track of - especially given the widely covered economic upheavals and sectarian military conflicts which have for many defined the first decade of this century.Life in the 21st century is full of serious challenges (and Norberg acknowledges these, while documenting how they are generally ameliorated by democracy and capitalism), but we're fully capable of meeting them and adapting and resolving and even, yes, thriving with them. The key word here is ""we"" - the global group of freely choosing individuals - that is the 100% which is easy to miss in the heated partisan debates. This 100% is what the inherently dynamic (creative/destructive) capitalist market nurtures and is nurtured by. The 21st century will either be the century of individual liberty (which the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries began recognizing and valuing, but only partly delivered), or it'll be much worse than anything we can imagine... My vote is for optimism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJQJYU3UK11M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1930865473#wasThisHelpful","R3UJQJYU3UK11M","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great collection of Chris Smither's songs, rerecorded with more lush, more mature instrumentation, yet it's all done in a way that feels natural and right, like the songs themselves have simply evolved with time.I first heard Smither at a small rural festival in 1992, it was a magical time, and I went home with his latest Another Way to Find You and an earlier It Ain't Easy CD. Over the next 15 years I collected almost everything else he produced. Then years later I discovered I had somehow ended up without any of these recording as they slipped into that foggy whirlpool of property division that is divorce, and I never bothered replacing them, as if they were part of a past I didn't want to try and revive.Today all those years and missing albums come back to me in a flood of relief and appreciation. These old songs (a selection of 24) are familiar yet rearranged and refined enough in the revisit to make them essential even if you have the originals. Being all rerecorded in June of 2013 they have the consistency of his voice and vision and virtuosity as it is ""now"". And his voice sounds great here, as does his rich and nimble instrumentation, along with some tasteful backing. Each time I listen to these CDs (and I've been listening to them a lot) I hear a new favorite - and it's perhaps most telling that his songcraft really shines through the clearest when someone else is sing them, like on the final track of disc 2 where Kate Lorenz of Rusty Belle does a beautiful version of ""Leave the Light On"".The material recorded here, going all the way back to 1970 and including something from all 12 of his studio albums (except his 2009 Time Stands Still), is impressive in itself, and the fact that he's put his latest touch on it is much more than just a cherry on top, or a new coat of paint, it's more like finding a cask of his single malt that has sat untapped for decades - so much better with aging. He's also added deluxe packaging (DVD size booklet  with nice and easy to read lyrics), which will make it a bit harder to store with the other CD, but probably guarantee greater notice/play.Although its great to see all these cuts having new life breathed into them, and some are absolutely beautiful, I'm finding I still like some of the stripped down originals more, but that just inspires me to finally repurchase those earlier albums. Seems to me that's the best kind of retrospective - new appreciation for the present and the past.

"Ropes are like shoes or cars, no single type can fit all our needs. This Type A semi-static rope is great for rappelling and hauling, top-roping with a self belay, AND even top-roping in the usual set up (since it is designed to hold 9 factor one falls). That final use is what makes this rope unique. It also has great 'hand' (knotability, handling and coiling) for a static line, but it does sacrifice some durability in the sheath.My main use for static ropes is for climbing route development where I do a lot of rappelling, hanging on a Petzl Grigri 2 Belay Device, and self belaying with a Soloist, and I mainly use the Singing Rock R44 NFPA Static Rope for this, but this Edelweiss is my second choice - better feel, more versatility, lighter weight (70 vs 77g/m), and yet a little less abrasion resistance (sheath is 35% of weight vs 38%) compared to Singing Rock's 11.2mm. If you don't need the extra sheath strength, or can consistently protect the sheath on sharp edges, or are using it on smooth, less abrasive kinds of rock this is probably the better choice. Other options if you want greater durability is to go with the 10.6mm ""caving"" rope which is also a Type A rope (rated to 15 factor 1 falls) but has Everdry treatment which reduces water shrinkage to 1.5%, as well as having 37% of weight in the sheath, but only 71g/m weight! Or the (Edelweiss Static Caving 11mm Rope), but it is also a bit heavier than the Singing Rock 11.2mm.Overall 4+ stars for versatility, light weight and quality construction.4/30/15 edit - I've ordered this ""static rope"" 3 times now and every time I've received the ""speleo"" (listed separately here on Amazon in a longer length). The pattern is NOT the same as shown in the pic on this page (single red thread), instead it is a closely paired black/red thread pattern. It may be the same rope (different edition?), but I'm not sure any of this matters since the ""product description"" says it's a Type A (semi-static) rope. Edelweiss does recommend you soak the new rope in water to pre-shrink it before use - the spec sheet says it has 4.2% shrinkage in water (not sure why they don't do this at the factory...). With 3.5% working elongation this rope will stretch noticeably at much over 100' length. If need be to reduce stretch to a minimum tie off to an intermediate anchor point, or just get a fully static rope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSFZYOA3XEMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OPMCVU#wasThisHelpful","RZSFZYOA3XEMC","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this vocal CD from Artie, his last recording before his untimely passing on 7/20/08. It has tasteful and consummate musicianship as well as good songwriting (all originals either written by Artie or in collaboration with Wendy Waldman, John Sebastian, or Joe Flood - except for the great cover of the traditional folk ballad ""Cuckoo Bird""). Artie's vocals aren't very strong, reminding me of some local artists I've known (or the voice of the also great guitarists Kelly Joe Phelps or Roy Rogers for someone perhaps more well known), but it is a kind of style that grows on one - especially with his thoughtful and tender lyrics, strong melodies, and great backup instrumentation.Artie was really a great guitarist, reminding me often of Martin Simpson here - for his skill and understated approach, and he also has some great support from Tony Levin (bass), Gary Burke (drums), Warren Bernhadt (piano), Joe Flood and Kenny Edwards (mandolin), John Sebastian (electric guitar) and Wendy Waldman, Donna Lewis, Amy Helm and Teresa Williams (backing vocals). The sound is more varied and less polished than his acoustic new-age/jazzy instrumental music, my favorite, other than the really strong ""Cuckoo Bird"", being the stripped down resonator guitar driven ""Where the Blues Began"", but this is a good thing. The overall quality reminds me of the easy listening yet masterful recordings Michael Franks made in the late 70's (when Artie was still playing Appalachian folk), and yet I'm mostly left feeling I've gotten to know Artie as someone unique, warm and easy going; thanks Artie! 4+ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6P5JPQRFPRGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OCXMCM#wasThisHelpful","R6P5JPQRFPRGD","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only recently discovered the music of Artie Traum, and as delighted as I am to finally hear this recording, I'm also saddened to learn he passed away in '08. I'd heard his name associated with guitar lesson books and videos for years, but didn't really know his music until listening to his early stuff with Woodstock Mountain Revue (the excellent collection - Music from Mud Acres). This recording finds him 25-30 years later getting together with some friends for some heartfelt duets. The result is wonderful, a range of jazzy instrumentals that combine influences of folk, country, bluegrass, world, swing, jazz, and prog-rock genres, but have a mellow 'new-agey' flavor all their own.Although each tune brings a new partner or group of partners, and slight twist of genres to the mix, the result is we also get to hear just how strong and consistently skillful Artie's playing is - an acoustic guitar style and sound that is crisp and full of swing and romance. Many of the cuts have a bit of magic due to the special guest, but it is Artie's playing and composing that ties it all together. I wasn't familiar with all these friends before hearing them here, but these are a few of the highlights to my ears;Track 1- The wordless vocals of Leslie Ritter and piano of Warren Bernhardt, combined with the acoustic slide of Traum, set the tone with a strong, moody, jazzy number that has the rare combination of driving rhythm and spacious exploration.Track 2- The combined Newgrass and Jazz influences of both Traum and mandolin master David Grisman make for a very satisfying and classical sounding jazz number.Track 3- John Sebastian's down home, back porch harmonica and guitar makes for some great soothing new-age folk music.Track 4- An aggressively fluid and jazzy acoustic guitar duet with Laurence Juber.Track 5- Gently swinging bluegrass/jazz thanks to the great Sam Bush (mandolin) and Bela Fleck (banjo).Track 6- Worldbeat rhythm with the varied percussion of Joachim Lartey and backing of Tony Levin (bass).Track 7- Romantic mellow Newgrass/Klezmer sound with the lovely fiddle playing of Jay Ungar and bassist of Molly Mason.Track 8- Easy listening Jazz with a subdued Levin on bass and Josh Colow on electric guitar.Track 9- More mellow Jazz with Bernhardt's pleasant understated piano playing.Track 10- Worldbeat/Prog-Rock influenced explorations with the electric guitar of Adrien Belew and bass of Tony Levin.Track 11-  Obviously a high point for Artie here, with The Band perhaps making a new country/jazz/rock sound - that works! (I'd swear David Gilmour sounded a lot like this on his '06 solo record ""On An Island""!)Track 12-  A beautiful, gentle closing guitar duet with brother Happy.If there is any complaint with this recording its that it is perhaps too consistently slick and safe, but it is on the Narada label after all, and for that kind of smooth and even vibe it's both masterfully played and recorded! Also, if you like this kind of sound, I can highly recommend his later recording without so many guests (Last Romantic), which is even more consistent and soothing. R.I.P. Artie, thanks for all the sweet sounds!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30KJ7T88GCTP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000I418#wasThisHelpful","R30KJ7T88GCTP5","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dave Soroka is the epitome of the great unknown musician/poet. He's the real deal, and yet he's been woefully under appreciated beyond the small crowds who get to attend his shows. He may have better collections of songs, but The Ladies of Summer is the best recorded to date (and only one available on Amazon). Recorded in '99 with the backing of some of Grand Forks, BC's best musicians (accompanying Dave's vocals, rhythm guitar and harmonica), on various guitars, dobro, bass, drums, piano, fiddle, mandolin, slide dobro and wonderful backing vocals (""Tequila Angle Choir""!).The tone is mellow and folky, and the lyrics warm and personal, yet poetic enough to transcend the Sorokaness of it all. If you're unfamiliar with Soroka, a solo performance of his song ""Little Lazy"" is available to watch on Youtube. It gives a good taste of his plaintive heartfelt singing and playing. 4+ stars.Track listing;Hey BeautyConsuelaThink of Me ComeradoI Ain't Going Down Like ThisFire of La JollaHey DarleneLittle LazyRight Here With MeLook Again Sweet Nora JeanClose Up the CantinaThe Ladies of Summer","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVF68PWVRDM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014K92HC#wasThisHelpful","RAVF68PWVRDM5","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Colin Wilson published this book in 1971, a time when humanity was apparently beginning to wake up en mass. Psychedelic drugs had already effected millions (usually for the better), and would continue to effects millions more. Same for Eastern religions and alternative spiritual practices. As they said, it was the dawning of the age of Aquarius, and this book set out to place ""The Occult"" in its proper perspective, as not just a system of naive pre-scientific magical thinking mumbo-jumbo, but as the ""science of the future."" In other words, the less obvious spiritual realm that the occult works with, and the less developed human faculties required for this work, will become more obvious and developed as we continue to evolve and increase our vibrational sensitivities. It is what we are growing INTO, not away from, and the sprinkling of historical mystery schools and masters have been the vanguard, and not just the lunatic fringe.By the late 70's I was well on my own way to doing this kind of work along with great numbers of my peers. I took psychedelic drugs seriously for awhile, then moved on to Eastern religions and meditational practices. The whole point of course was to have direct personal experience of the numinous, the unknown, the... occult. Almost 40 years later it is helpful to look back and see it all as part of the process Wilson foretold in this book. Especially since for much of that 40 years I have shied away from calling my practices or perspective, ""occult"" - thinking instead that referred to something more shadowy and less noble and wholesome. Wilson's book has helped bring me full circle and be able to embrace the larger evolutionary process we're all going through, and helping create.Wilson defines the fundamental proposition of magic or occultism as, there is ""a kind of 'psychic ether' that carries mental vibrations as the 'luminiferous ether' is supposed to carry light."" (p.52) If this is so then we are already effected by these vibrations unconsciously (as many other types of animals clearly demonstrate), but can also become conscious of them, and work with them. In other words our higher human function isn't just to look to understand the cause and effect of events via objective science, but to search for their meaning, for us, and live with a vivid sense of wonder (what Wilson calls 'Faculty X'). As he says in his introduction, ""The higher the life form, the deeper its capacity for registering meaning, and the more powerful its hold on life"" (p.31), and then later, ""What I am suggesting here, and throughout this book, is that whenever man has a strong sense of the value of something, he activates his 'powers,' the powers that lie beyond the violet end of his mental spectrum."" (p. 144-145)There is nothing flakey in Wilson's approach. It is really a thorough reference work by a skeptical yet sympathetic inquirer organized in three parts; 1) Wilson's broad survey of the subject, 2) A history of magic, focusing on the bios of some of its more famous (and infamous) adepts, and, 3) A look into the practices and realms these adepts were working with. Part of the relevance for me is that Wilson may have started as a non-beliver, but by the time he was finished researching and writing this history had a different appreciation and respect for the underlying reality and value of the occult. As such, this book is as much an intelligent critique of the limited approach of modern rational materialistic thinking (the masculine, solar path), as it is an exploration of the non-rational alternatives (feminine, lunar path), really seeking to move us forward out of our current rut, by integrating the two halves of the whole . As he says, ""a science - or knowledge system - which has no place for will or purpose is an obstruction to human evolution, and at this particular point in history, a dangerous nuisance"" (p.141).This history is a major work and contribution, detailed and complete and yet not dry or merely encyclopedic (reminding me a bit of Murchie's The Seven Mysteries of Life: An Exploration of Science and Philosophy), in fact more of a psychological or anthropological study than merely a history. For an example of the thrust and style of his writing here is a typical passage from page 136;""The first and most important step towards self-transformation is to grasp intellectually what I have explained in the preceding pages: that man was not intended for a lifetime of the 'worm-eye view,' any more than a bird was intended to spend its life on the ground. We have a natural faculty for 'pulling back,' for seeing things through the wide-angle lens, for switching on to more serious vibrations. For human beings, boredom and depression are abnormal - a failure to grasp their natural powers. My powers are wasted as long as my vision is narrow and personal. They are like a boxer who cannot get any force behind his punches at close quarters. And when my will has become passive through 'close-upness,' I fall into a dreamlike state in which illusion and reality are intermingled. I become trapped and tangled in my own narrow values, instead of remaining open to values that are greater than myself. For human beings are intended to 'connect' with values outside themselves and to become unaware of themselves as 'personalities.' ""So the overall effect is an intelligent, sympathetic and practical appraisal of the occult, AND human nature. As he says in summary of the 16th century's 'Age of Magic' with the dawning of the 'Age of Reason', ""A busy, energetic sort of person has no time for the supernatural, and his temperamental rejection of it makes him feel that his world of practical clear-cut issues is the only real one. It is a healthy instinct. We should bear in mind that nearly all children dislike the supernatural, except in ghost stories. This is not necessarily fear, but an instinctive need to confront a clear, simple world in which they can make decisions and shape their lives. Anyone who has ever loved science can understand this. There is something cold, hard and exhilarating about science... By comparison, the world of the occult is misty and damp, reminding man of his ignorance and encouraging him to adopt a passive attitude towards his existence."" (p.276)Wilson obviously had an open and inquiring mind, and wrote engagingly on a vast and complicated subject, one which has, by definition, been cloaked in secrecy and misunderstanding. And yet, for me at least, the best part is that Wilson pulls ""The Occult"" out of its murky past, broadens and redefines it to seem more vibrant, positive and relevant to the evolution of all humanity, our destiny as just a conscious aspect of the whole...Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U35TXWBYG9C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566199956#wasThisHelpful","R3U35TXWBYG9C6","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is refreshingly direct and irreverently anti-PC, intellectually stimulating and yet simply and clearly, even plainly, delivered. In an era that is habitually and institutionally anti-intellectual it is a breath of fresh air, even if it ends up seeming a bit obsessive and even shocking as it tracks the deep groove of what is probably a typical intelligent person's experience in life, of misunderstanding, under-appreciation, and the resulting bitter resentment (which inevitably flirts with madness...).As the author states in his preface, this is a fictional work of an inner aspect of his personality, ranting about things he is fed up with in modern society. And as the back of the book blurb says, it's ""A dark portrayal of a thoughtful, intelligent man appalled by the stupidity and conformism of the grotesque inhabitants of the society in which he lives."" Is it mentioned anywhere that this is droll British satire at it's finest - even if twisted by the modern world into a rather dark place. Well, it is.If you don't like the idea of such intelligent, brutally honest, articulate, genuinely insightful, occasionally misanthropic and psychotic monologues then pass this one by. The subject is, as the title says, about living an intelligent life, which requires conscious cultivation (just as we are told in the crux scene of Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, just before the corporate board meeting is attacked by the pirate accountants...), and a willingness to go against the social grain of mind numbing conformity and endless distractions. As the author warns, it is a rant, or more like cathartic vent, by a frustrated intelligent person (NOT to be confused mind you with an ""intellectual""), and in some ways reads like a self-help book without much concern for the reader's self-esteem.I found all this quite fun and stimulative, which is about what I expected from the Amazon writeup. What I didn't know was how the actual writing would be. It's good. For example;""People don't like to see themselves for what they are, because, in most cases, they are stupid, lazy, shallow, selfish, unprincipled, amoral, prejudice-filled c#&*s with a sad, desperate desire to be respected, or at least accepted, by the other stupid, lazy, shallow, selfish, unprincipled, amoral, prejudice-filled c#&*s they surround themselves with.  It is these character traits that prevent people from becoming intelligent in the first place. The reason they don't become intelligent is that they don't practice thinking about anything in depth - and they don't put the effort into thinking about things, because they simply do not care about being principled and consistent in any way....  I have been lucky - I don't delude myself about that.  I have worked at my thinking skills, but I was born with the character traits that enabled me to develop them.  Initially, inquisitiveness is the key - the desire to learn and the capacity to find joy in discovery. This however, can easily flounder if you do not have determination...  Later, developing intelligence becomes a battle against the stupidity you find all around you. You need a certain degree of immunity from the diseased assumptions of the society you live in. Since most people's stupidity is rooted in their desire to conform, its important to nourish this immunity and nurture it as a source of pride. "" (p.21-22)It is a small book, and at less than 100 pages is a fun, often funny, and quick read - my only complaint/suggestion to Mr Jameson is that this could easily be a chapter or two in a much larger more developed work. It might even be interesting to see all his little philosophical tracts combined and woven into something of larger scope. I don't know if his other books have the same ""voice"", but I suspect they do, but anyway if not, a larger novel could accommodate many different voices. As it is, in this short form I wouldn't call it great fiction (or even fiction most of the time), but it is memorable and thought provoking, and useful!I look forward to reading more of Jameson's books, and hope they continue to take this intelligent (if slightly unhinged) perspective in new and challenging directions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTG8SB7LHXIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481185934#wasThisHelpful","R2DTG8SB7LHXIL","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this 1992 compilation (from the first 4 albums by the Woodstock Mountain Revue, which they recorded in 1972, '77, '78, & '81, and all sounding great here) because it includes the original version of Roly Salley's great song ""Killing the Blues"" (covered many times, but also available in an updated version on Salley's '05 solo album - Killing the Blues), but there are plenty of other songs to make it a keeper. I'm especially glad to discover a new favorite song (""Barbed Wire"" by band leader Artie Traum).The sentiment is back-to-the-land Catskill hippies meet Bill Monroe and Earl Scruggs, while the sound ranges all over the bluegrass and folk map, reminding me at times of the Holy Modal Rounders, Jonathan Edwards, Jimmie Buffet, Brewer and Shipley, New Riders of the Purple Sage, John Hartford, Sam Bush, Darrell Scott, Kate and Anna McGarrigle and even The Waterboys.... yet they (apparently anyone in the local Woodstock scene they could round up for the recording sessions) are really just part of this larger late 20th century (real) country folk revival, sharing tunes and obviously just out to have a good time. Most of these 22 tracks have vocals, but there are also 4 fine instrumental banjo/fiddle/peddle steel/guitar/harmonica covers.Highly recommended for fans of down home Americana.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOGZCHXBQI2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000003M7#wasThisHelpful","R2QOGZCHXBQI2T","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago I heard Killing the Blues on the excellent 8 disc 1995 Rounder Records Hills of Home: 25 Years of Folk Music sampler, performed by Woodstock Mountain Revue (originally from Music from Mud Acres which was a selection from Woodstock Mountain Revue's first 4 albums from 1972-81..., and it also can be found on Rounder's more recent 4 disc sampler Rounder Records Story). Anyway, Rowland (then called ""Roly"") originally performed his signature song with simple guitar and banjo accompaniment, and its better than any and all of the many great covers done since then. It is so good (plaintively done in heartbreaking rawness but not sappy) that I later bought this collection of his songs (recorded in Vancouver BC in 2003) without a clue what it would be like.This collection, unfortunately his only solo recording - which other than ""Killing the Blues"" consists of songs written in '01-02, is much slicker than the Woodstock Mountain Revue's sound and covers a broader range of music (not just Appalachian folk), sounding at times influenced by the pop hooks of Jackson Browne or the Beatles (more specifically Paul McCartney) or even Van Morrison-like instrumentation or the simplicity of John Prine. Its always country sounding, but moves smoothly from Nashville pop to pop-jazz to pop-rock to pop-folk country. Especially the version of Killing the Blues which even though done at the same tempo seems much more upbeat than his original version, or even how it's usually covered.The main attraction of these songs is the songwriting itself, although they are also well played (the musicianship is consistently top-notch, while Salley's voice is not pretty as much as unique and expressive in an early Dylan fashion). I'm not sure Salley could be considered a ""great"" songwriter since he hasn't been very prolific, but the songs he has recored here have a rare quality like some hard earned deep sea pearls, which we can be sure he dove for himself.... Overall a 4+ star effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350SJMKSCK6CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PEAZF0#wasThisHelpful","R350SJMKSCK6CH","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed Werner Herzog's quirky documentary about life in the Antarctic, two of the high points being when I recognized the soundtrack as David Lindley's acoustic guitar, and the other seeing Henry Kaiser in action as an underwater photographer and ecstatically jamming on his electric guitar (regrettably missing from this CD). And I'm happy to find the soundtrack CD even better than the soundtrack on the movie (longer, more detailed and varied tracks).Kaiser and Lindley here continue their global cross cultural muse-ical collaboration - but unlike their recordings in Madagascar and Norway, and the diverse human influences there, in the antarctic, while they bring some of those musical influences (especially Lindley with his Scandinavian hardanger fiddle, and Malagasy sounding oud, cumbus, cittern and weissenborn guitar tunes), they are also exploring a mostly nonhuman world of snow and ice covered land and ice covered ocean.I kind of doubt Lindley ever went to Antarctica (this is mostly recorded in the studio in California), and his playing tends to be the warmer sounding, but he also gets nicely into the expansive open ended (yet sometimes pensive) spirit of the place (and that hardanger fiddle sounds so Arctic  - hauntingly cold, brittle, and desolate - in itself). This is clearly Kaiser's project (and passion), but he plays a surprisingly low key part, only really expressing his brooding, dissonant take on that frozen world in the opening and closing long pieces, and this is fine for me since I'm a huge Lindley fan. There is also the occasional backing from other musicians who do a good job of filling out the sound (glass instruments, double bass, percussion, cello and trombone), but mostly the mood is sparse and clean, and an odd balance of dark brooding ""otherness"" and bright upbeat liveliness (perhaps the essential contradiction of the great underinhabited continent).For those who enjoy BOTH Kaiser and Lindley, this is an enjoyable and rewarding listening experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315GB0CV22VAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2RNAOO#wasThisHelpful","R315GB0CV22VAX","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep coming back to this CD, satisfied by the songwriting (especially the 7 penned by Robert Hunter and David Nelson, but also the others), and the musicianship (especially Buddy Cage's soaring pedal steel) much more than I thought I'd be. I'd even give it 4+ stars.Of course I listened to the original NRPS back in the day, didn't for a long time, and then decided to catch up with them more recently with their latest 17 Pine Avenue (also featuring a fresh batch of Hunter/Nelson songs), and then got this. And I like this the most since the classic The Adventures of Panama Red! A nice mix of country inflected rock, and some cookin' psychedisized jams.(Barracuda Moon seems like the greatest dance song this morning... like an undulating snake rising on the driving syncopated drumming and San Francisco infused guitar riffs, hard to imagine it not causing anybody to want to uncoil, and a nice continuity (of where they come from) with Hunter adding an oblique reference to the first set of his lyrics The Dead recored, ""Barracuda, Barracuda, Barracuda Moon - Fiddler on the heart string give another tune - Barracuda Moon, Baby, Barricuda Moon - Ain't no alligator just a Barracuda Moon"" - as well as more obviously to his unreleased 1978 album Alligator Moon. And finally to help make sense of this little tangent, according to The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics, ""Alligator n. (1920s-1930s) a usually though not necessarily pejorative term probably coined by Louis Armstrong to describe musicians who stole (""followed"") the ideas of black players."")My only regret is that unsure of the quality of this album, I made the mistake of getting a used copy in ""VG"" condition at first which had just enough scratches to not play on my higher end home stereo... so I'm back this morning to get a new copy, and while at it pick up the alternative version (Where I Come From - Radio Mixes & Live Bonus), reputed to be even better than this one!It's great to know muse-ic and the muse-ic-ians who play at the Muse's indulgence may always change, but also just continue to do the timeless multi-hued serpent dance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2D3T3JL1Z0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W1Z3T4#wasThisHelpful","R1S2D3T3JL1Z0W","A3GUZIX0ITZORF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GUZIX0ITZORF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the Camel website says about this new recording, ""The Snow Goose has been lovingly re-recorded. Faithful to the original with tasty arrangements and enhancements for stage presentation, The Snow Goose is not only a timeless story of love and war. It is a tale of dignity and kindness lifted to the heart on the wings of an injured Snow Goose through her unique relationship with two humans. Written by Paul Gallico, this short story inspired this beautiful music.""This studio recording from May of 2013 (subsequently presented on their fall '13 tour) is a faithful re-presentation of the 1975 classic (same order for the tracks, with some extended bits), with perhaps a slightly more passionate and mature sound - enhanced by the more symphonic arrangements, and a richer recording quality. Only composer/guitarist Andy Latimer remains from the original group, yet they sound like Camel to me! This does not replace the '75 recording (if you don't have that one yet I'd recommend the deluxe '09 edition - Snow Goose), but it makes a fine addition to the story.Note - So far ALL the reviews on this Amazon page are for previous editions of the original recording.

"This must the best Chromebook you could buy for less than $500. Yes, you could spend as little as $150 for a usable Chromebook or as much as over a thousand dollars for a Pixel, but why? It is a Chromebook after all. Of course, touch screen feature begins to appear in some Chromebook (and costs more), but I failed to see the justification for spending more than $500 for one. Most decent Chromebooks area in $200-$300 range, but this Toshiba Chromebook 2 is much better buy with just another $100 more.To begin with, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 came with HD screen and gorgeous colors. Play a high definition movie on it is a whole different experience. Almost as good as my MacBook Pro, but you are talking about an Apple machine that cost 3 times more. The Chromebook has 3 expansion ports: 1 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.o and slot for SD card. It also has a HDMI output, so you can also use it as your media player. I bought a 128GB compact USB 3.0 drive and plug it in permanently, so I now have a very nice laptop, no moving parts with a lot of fast local storage space. The features that make this Chromebook a far better machine than other Chromebooks are Intel I3 CPU and Skullcandy sound system. It is fast and sounds awesome in the headphone and external speakers! This Toshiba Chromebook also features backlit keyboard and a really nice trackpad (again, almost as nice as the one on my MacBook Pro – the only gesture missing is three-finger dragging).The setup of this Chromebook was a bit tricky at first. I entered the same network password 3 times, even flipped the switch to see what I was typing, only to have it told me wrong password was entered. Then suddenly it worked and I had no trouble connecting to new network since. Since I already have a Gmail account and Chrome browser configuration, I can sign on and start using the Chromebook immediately.This Chromebook is about ¾” at the thickest part and a weight bit over 2 lbs. Very nice texture outside, 13” screen is just about right for all types of work and entertainment.So why would you spend $450 for a Chromebook when with the same money you can buy a laptop? Simply put, you laptop is much heavier, more software licenses to worry about, probably becomes obsolete in a couple of years and probably comes with nothing worth bragging about hardware. On top of that, you constantly have to worry about virus and upgrades. None of those exists in Chromebook.  I own several laptop devices and tablets, include Windows PC, MacBook Pro, Chromebook, iPad and Android tablets. But I believe this Chromebook is the most practical and my favorite machine for around the house use and road trip. It starts up in seconds and you never have to worry about virus and security.

"About the only thing bad about this pair of pants is the price. My wife complained that she wants more of these, but did not think $60 is a good price especially she only wears to the gym and sweats in them. Well, I guess you have to pay for quality.The pants is super comfortable, with wide waist band and nice, soft, breathable material. Print pattern is ""so cool"", my wife's words.

"The Boneco Air Purify P500 system came in an attractive package and fully assembled, you only need to unbox, open the front cover, take the plastic wrap off the included filter and plug it in. Then pull the plastic tab off the remote control, then turn it on.There are five fan speeds, with five is the strongest.  I started out at second speed and you can hardly hear the fan noise. At fifth speed, you can definitely hear the fan. I let it run for about an hour in fifth speed, then drop down to third.  At third, you almost can’t hear the fan noise, as it is overcome by other white noise.  It is quiet enough that I put it in our bedroom. The air filter provided enough air circulation that I did not need to keep my ceiling fan on with the cool weather.I can feel the significant improvement in our air quality in the morning. The air seemed cleaner and our allergies seemed disappeared. We sleep very well last night too.  But only one night, so we will see if it really worked in a week.  Our bedroom is less than 200 square foot, below the size specified for this air filter. I would not recommend using this filter for room larger than 200 sq. ft.The system comes with an allergy filter standard, so it is just right for what we need. It is expensive to replace ($99), but for good night sleeps it is a bargain. We finally found an air filter that really works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JKFQRBAQ9C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WVVZK0#wasThisHelpful","R7JKFQRBAQ9C8","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case was shipped with frustration free packaging, but it ended up frustrating me to no end as I found it impossible to take it apart to put my phone in! No instruction enclosed, so I had to go to Otterbox website. The only information I found was in the FAQ section, where it said to peel the silicon back out until it is separated completely. There is no video for iPhone 6 plus, so I viewed one for the HTC Defender case as I think they must be similar. Well, it is impossible to do.The silicon back seems like welded shut to the case and guess I don't have enough finger strength to open it up.I gave up after  about 30 minutes fighting with it, so have no information on its operation.From the outside, it is longer and wider than my Otterbox Commuter case about 1/4"" and 1/8"" thicker too. And believe me, the Commuter is big enough to feel uncomfortable in my jean pocket, I hate to think how this case fit. You need to have a large pocket or really loose jean to keep the phone + Defender case in your pocket. It is measure 3 1/2"" wide x 6 1/2"" long and 1/2"" thick. It looks like it will protect your phone well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ9BP8K1ZVA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ9BP8K1ZVA9","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't a lot of cases designed for Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, Most of them are decent, but nothing worth bragging about. From a personal preference standpoint, I would give this case 3.5 stars, but it meets everything it was advertised for, hence the 4 star rating. Like most cases designed for this tablet, there is no portrait mode so it is a bit awkward to read a magazine. eBook is ok as they can be read in either mode.The cover has a nice feel to it, not slippery so you have no worry of it slipping out of your finger. The inner also smooth so you don't have to worry it scratches your tablet screen. Tri-fold cover provides 2 viewing angles and when closed DOES NOT put the tablet to sleep, so this is a consideration when buying. There is still a gap between the cover and tablet, so stuffs might get into between. Four rubber straps hold the tablet at 4 corners and they look strong enough. If one of them ever breaks, this case would become useless.If you have time to look for a case, there are better options. For me, this tablet case is just another also-ran.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LH3IV4KJH2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWGZOY4#wasThisHelpful","R20LH3IV4KJH2N","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Otterbox case to be used in my long weekend bicycle rides or when I am on vacation, when I spend a lot of time outdoor. The iPhone 6 Plus is big, and this case made it even bigger! Could hardly fit in my jean pocket, but the protection it provides is more than worth it. I have not drop my phone yet, so can't really say how it performs.  All ports and buttons are at the right places and nice to hold in your hand .Then I discovered an issue with this case. The case comes in 2 parts: a soft rubber  inner and hard plastic outer shell. Very clever design; as if you drop the phone, most vibrations transferred from the hard plastic shell will be absorbed by the inner layer and keep your phone safe. This has got to be the best part of the case. But then when took it into a dry sauna room after a work-out session..After less than 10 minutes, the entire case got heated up so much (and retains the heat too) that my iPhone shut down and display the message ""High temperature, iPhone is not available"" or something like that. I had to walk out of the sauna, go to the car and put  my phone in front of the AC vent to cool it down. I have use my phone in the sauna before with other cases and this never happened. So the heavier the case, the more heat it absorbs and retain longer.Other than this, I love the case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V9K9E0EC1HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N28ARHS#wasThisHelpful","R15V9K9E0EC1HU","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is a just a simple, minimalist bumper case for your iPhone 6. It fits my iPhone 6 as expected and shown it was designed for just iPhone 6, but I guess it would fit the 6s as well. Nothing special about the case, I would bet that it provides less protection for your phone than other Otterbox cases.The one feature that I like about the case is its clear back. It shows off my gold version iPhone well and does not add that much more weight or bulk to the phone. But of course, with any Otterbox case, you always trade weight and size for extra protection. This case would give your phone more protection than most other cases. All openings and buttons are exactly at the right places.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJCLE5KS1OTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53TD5W#wasThisHelpful","R2RJCLE5KS1OTT","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well it’s not quite 10 minutes.  But if you think about from unboxing to put on a couple of steaks, it could be around 10 minutes. Get some help from your significant other to lift the grill up, lock it into places and tighten the wing-nut to lock in the braces, then connect the propane tank and arrange the grill plates: it is truly around 10 minutes. If you count installing the side burner and shelf, install the front doors and tighten all the screws, it could take around 30 minutes. Note the 30 minutes; it is a far cry from what it takes in my gas-grill assembling experiences that it often took somewhere from 2 hours to half a day. All grill manufacturers should learn from Hamilton Beach; that no one enjoys putting a grill together. This grill is so simple; the whole thing involves tightening less than 10 screws!The grill was shipped to me in a big square box, weight around 50 lbs. It has some minor damages from shipping; one of the doors was dented and a couple more dents at various places, but generally still works. They could do better in packing and transport. The grill was provided to me free for evaluation, otherwise I would return it if I spend almost $500 and receive a less than perfect product. I used a pair of pliers to fix the dents so the door would fit.Now, about the grill: it is awesome! There are 4 burners with steel plates on top to radiate the heat. Nothing needs to be added. Four heavy iron grates on top, about a couple of inches on top of the steel plates to get the heat up quickly. The burners could be turned on individually to control the heat or just simply use part of the grill if you cook only a couple of steaks to pieces of chicken.  All knobs have igniters built-in, and it took about 5 seconds to light the grill. There is also a large thermometer dial on the grill lid.The grill comes with a generous sized burner. This may be the feature that get used the most, now you have the option to fry without getting the house smelling like a burger joint. The side burner is operated with the same big knob with built-in igniter. A satisfying click to light it up.Despite the minor dents, the grill looks beautiful with brushed stainless steel. Four wheel casters let you move it easily (btw, you don’t even have to install the wheels, they came pre-assembled). It has all features you need and a very decent price around $450.I love this grill and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZ4VHHPD9LMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNE12Q0#wasThisHelpful","R3JZ4VHHPD9LMA","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best way to make French coffee. The traditional way is to put coffee ground into a special filter, then pour in hot water and let coffee drip down to a cup below. Well, I did that for most of my life. Then I switched to a coffee press. It is better, but not quite the taste I was looking for. So I looked for this on Amazon and found this amazing espresso maker! I used to have this same thing to use when I went camping and still remember how the coffee tasted. Believe me, try it and you never go back to anything you used before.This espresso maker is simple to operate. Put coffee ground in the filter, fill the botton reservoir with water, screw the top part on and put on the stove. After 3, 4 minutes, water start boiling and thick, dark coffee start flowing to the top cup.

It fit neatly on my wife's home office desk, along with her double monitors, keyboard, mouse, phone and a whole bunch of other unamed things. I have a couple of other printers already, included an Epson Workforce 450, but this printer is quicky becoming my favorite one.We use this printer primariy for scanning and occasional image printing, so it fits the purpose well. There are incredible number ways to scan, from scanning to local SD card to cloud, email and computer.. Epson seems to have them all figured out and extremely easy to set up.Settign up this printer took all of 20 minutes using the excellent color LED screen and I had the printer on my wireless network. Like other reviewers said, you need to know its limitations and purposes you get the printer for. I have no plan to use this printer heavily, more in scanning and some printing so it fit my wife just fine. Loading the paper to back feeder seems like a negative point, but to my wife it actually a plus. No complicated tray loading to deal with, just drop some paper to the feeder and done. It is wireless, so you can put it anywhere your netwrok can reach.This is an exellent wireless inkjet printer for light printing and copying, and incredible scanning capabilities.

"This is not your regular old safety glasses. I am not a shop guy, so only need safety glasses occasionally when cut my grass or trim tree branches. But I found a lot more use for this pair fo safety glasses for my outdoor activities. The glasses were designed thoughtfully with features that when wearing it, you would think they are an expensive pair of sunglasses. I have a medium to large face and this pair fits me really well, so comfortable that rival those expensive glasses I had. I worn it for a couple of days now driving to work and one 3-hour bike ride. Especially on the bike ride, I felt much safer that they will protect my eyes from road debris much more than my regular riding glasses. The polarized amber color greatly increased contrast and cut down lots of glare. Oh yeah, they look good too!The only complaint I could have is it is folded big and I don't have a case for it.

"It took me almost an hour to put them together. One of the chair's leg was slightly uneven, but I adjusted it by loosen a chair foot. I recommend you to get a ratchet wrench; there are only 8 screws per chair, but in tight space. You can use the supplied wrench, but I think it will take you a long time. And it was pretty awkward, especially when attaching the back.All cushions have nice, rich color and throw pillows provide a nice contrast. I have them in my cover patio, so about the only thing I would worry about is dust. I can see dust get into the chair nooks & crannies and it could be hard to clean. Guess you could wash them with garden hose, but then you have to wait for it to dry before use. I just put a cover on them while they are not being used. The table was easy to put together; all legs fit a certain way, you would know if you put them together wrong. Top of the table is just a plain old ceramic tile, but it is a good opportunity to replace it with something you like.Price is a bit steep, but my wife (an expert in shopping) thought it was a good deal for Amazon's price.

"This is a pretty cool selfie tool. The handle extended out to almost a meter (around 3 feet) and came with a compact Bluetooth camera remote. Collapse it and its total length is about less than 9 inches. The phone attachment is sort of a grip with soft rubber, you can tighten it a bit without worrying hurting your phone. I used it fully extended with my iPhone 6 plus, and I can see I start losing my grip a little bit. Anything smaller than the iPhone 6 plus should work great with this. The telescoping handle bent just a little bit, almost unnoticeable.The Bluetooth remote paired quickly with my iPhone and work great with iPhone's native Camera app. But when I tried it with other camera apps like Manual and FiLMC Pro, it only  turned up the ringer! Wish there is a way to make it works with all camera apps. Regardless, the remote is small and you can practically attach it your keychain. The other useful feature is standard 1/4"" screws on both ends of the handle. You can attach it on top of a tripod for selfie with your phone, or attach a compact camera to the top screw (of course, you need someone to push the button it your compact camera does not have bluetooth).It's a feature-packed selfie tool, and I really like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5R6ZDU4JTLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB1YAC4#wasThisHelpful","R1C5R6ZDU4JTLE","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This must be the coolest invention for grilling! Received it this morning and I put it to a try this afternoon with a thick, juicy rib-eye steak. It turned out perfect, just like I expected.

"I have been to houses that have this type of attic vent and I can tell you, it was amazing even in the summer in Texas. So I was excited to receive this fan and install it in my house.A word of caution: if your house does not have a gable, forget this fan as it is the wrong attic fan. You need one that mounted under the roof vent. And if your house does not have a gable vent, try to get help from a carpenter as it will require cutting hole in the gable and installing a vent or shutter outside. Including the fan, it could cost you around $500 to have a gable vent with fan.  My house already has a gable vent, so I was lucked out.There are plenty of Youtube videos showing you how to install this and you can really do it yourself with some patience. I used a sheet of plywood,cut a hole to fit the fan, mount the fan on and nailed it to the frame of my gable. Then connect the electricity, set the temperature to 105 degree as per the instruction. That was it. It still took me half a day and countless trip to the attic. I did plan a head of time and start early morning while it was still cool. It's still spring in Texas, so I have not heard the fan come on yet.

The 6"" wheels are perfect for hard pavement, as long as he stays away from pot holes or large road cracks. Looped handbrakes worked well, and could lock the collator to convert it into a seat, with padded brace for his back.

I chose the shiny side out to match with the MBP screen. The screen attached to the monitor with 4 small piece of sticky double sided tapes. The screen actually has suggested places for sticky tapes, but when I put the tapes there, they overlapped the corner of my MBP display. I had to take them out, reposition the tapes then attach it again. It is also a bit pricey, cost almost twice of that of a regular privacy screen, that was why I took half a star off. Belkin also provided a plastic folder to keep your screen while it is not being used. Extra 4 sticky tapes provided for future use.But this definitely a high quality, works as advertised screen and I highly recommend it.3/23/15 UPDATE: After using the screens for a few days, I found another improvement that Belkin can make. While the screen fit my 13"" MBP perfectly (BTW, I also have the 11.6"" screen and it fits my Dell Chromebook perfectly too), it is a bit inconvenient when you need to take the screen off temporarily. Such as when you need to show co-workers something on your screen. Then you have to spend a little bit of time putting it back. If Belkin provides some holders that you could slide the screen in and out that would be great. Rating is still 4.5 stars in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MGCT1TX2XJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7R1CKQ#wasThisHelpful","R5MGCT1TX2XJN","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually spent more time removing the old, nasty ceiling fan than assembling and hooking up the new fan.  I have an old home (25+ yrs) and the previous owner was very creative, he rigged up this contraption that took me more than a couple of hours to undo, including a trip to the attic.The whole assembly is pretty light weight, so you can be assured that any existing electrical light fixture would hold up the fan just fine. Just like all the ceiling fan you worked with before, the fan came in a kit. Some part was put together, but most were not. You have the options to use the short down rod or connect closed to the ceiling. I have some clearance so I chose the down rod option.From then on, I just follow the instruction on the excellent owner guide. Please beware that the installation steps started from section 3. Follow it step by step and you should be ok. It took me less than an hour from attaching the holder to electrical box to turning the fan on, sitting back and enjoy. And I am by no mean a professional, just a handyman wannabe. If you can get a friend or significant other to help, it would be even faster and easier. There was a couple instances that I wished I have 3 hands! The fan light was designed for both one switch (turn light on/of with pull chain) or separate light/fan switch.The fan blades’ rich cherry color matched my wood floor like it was designed for it.  It is balanced and quiet like it was installed by a professional. Brush nickel for the fan housing gave it a look of sophisticated contemporary. Three 60W light bulbs were supplied with the fan, but I don’t think they are bright enough for me. I will replace them when I come by the hardware store next.So this ceiling fan is an excellent choice. Easy installation, quiet, move a lot of air with its five-blades and 3 fan speeds, and look awesome! Price is good too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2J8ZNSM7Z53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZTU7TS#wasThisHelpful","RM2J8ZNSM7Z53","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"iXpand is another ingenious product from Sandisk. It instantly adds 16, 32, 64 or 128GB of storage to your iPhone or iPad, depends on what you buy. Compact and slim, it easily fits in shirt pocket and takes virtually no space in your briefcase.What I love about this flash drive is it frees you from iTunes! Copy photos or videos to this drive using any computer to access from your iPhone or iPad later. There were so many instances that I had to copy pictures to another flash drive, took it home and transfer to my iPad via iTunes. Yes, you have to add another app to your iPhone or iPad but it's well worth it.One thing should be noted is you can only transfer photos and videos from the Photo folder, i.e those that captured with your iPhone or iPad's camera. I could not yet find a way to copy a video from the Movie folder.The iXpand drive came precharged so you can use right away. It can be charged by plugging in a USB port of any computer. Use it like any other flash drive to copy files, and you can access them through the iXPand app, including movies, photos and music. Also remember that the iXpand drive is only a backup device, you cannot copy files from the iXpand to your iPad. Copy to the iXpand is easy and fast; just select the file and specify where you want them copy to.One thing Sandisk could improve on this drive is include a USB extension cable. The drive is pretty wide, more than 1"", so may not fit in some tight laptop spot or make the next USB ports useless until you remove the drive. A good manual on the iXpand Sync software would also be nice, I can figure out how after playing with it a bit, but I can certainly imagine some users might have trouble with it.All my flash memory products are from Sandisk and they just last and work all the times, so I expect the same performance from this drive. This is definitely an alternative to paying for the next larger memory size iPad or iPhone.3/15/15 Update: I downloaded a copy of the user guide from Sandisk website and found out that you can copy photo and videos back to the iPad/iPhone, but only to the Camera Roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQZO5MSWYVLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBGYPNE#wasThisHelpful","R1EQZO5MSWYVLB","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this is Dell Chromebook 11 – 3120 (early-2015), unlike the version you would find if you use the Service Tag to find your machine on Dell Support website. Enter that service tag and Dell website would return the early-2014 version instead.I had the Samsung Chromebook 2 Octa 5420 11.6, purchased in the Fall 2014, a couple of months after its release (it is currently being used heavily by my nephew who is in 5th grade), so I am very curious to see the differences between the two Chromebooks. As they both use the latest Chrome operating system/browser, the software is exactly the same on both machines.  The advantages of Chrome is I have the same set up on both machines as there is one single profile; log on the machines using the same Gmail account and you get the same environment. I have not touched the Chromebook for months, but got my same set up when logging into the new machine.I don’t think there are pros and cons between the two machines. They have different CPUs, but performance basically the same. You get the same snappy responses, fast network, quick start up, 8-9 hrs. of battery life and same software look and feel.  Prices are almost the same too. Below are the differences I observed:• Dell uses SD card reader – Samsung has microSD slot that you could add more permanent storage: With Dell, you could hot swap full size SD cards as often as you wish, it takes a little more work to swap microSD card on Samsung. But you can leave the microSD on the Samsung permanently, while with Dell you probably have to remove it when put in your briefcase.• Dell includes ability to lay flat, keyboard and screen open flat – Samsung does not: I can see situations when you want to do this, but not often.• Dell Chromebook is soft rubber: the screen has some flex to it and edges are wrapped with soft rubber so protected from scratches and dings.• Weight:  minor different in weight. I have not weighted them, but at this level who cares about the differences of a couple of ounces.• Look: Samsung Chrome book looks much better with smooth, shiny silver shell. This Dell Chrome book looks like an inconspicuous a laptop like thousands of others.As my review for the Samsung Chromebook, I think this Chromebook is good for 90% of users, especially for students. I once brought my Chromebook with me on a 2-week trip and never found the need for my full featured MacBook Pro. You could actually do 90% of your daily task on this machine. It is the best for browse the net, reading email and magazine, watch videos and movies such as from Netflix. Pack a few movies on a SD card and you are good to go!I love this machine as much as my Samsung Chromebook. It is a toss-up between the two of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUYU27L6OLVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBBUIDM#wasThisHelpful","RDUYU27L6OLVM","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great phone if you are going oversea and do not want to take your expensive iPhone 6 plus with you. Or you have a small phone and want something bigger without taking a second mortgage of your house. Or you just simply want a small tablet. I won't review Android Kit Kat here, I defer it to other more qualified users. I can only talk about how I used the device as a phone/camera/video plaback device.First thing I saw that is negative about this phone is its speaker. It is very weak, it is actually impractical to carry on a call on speaker phone. The phone volume itself is not that great either, most time I have to use a headset to get clearer voice. The other party seems to hear me just fine as I heard no complaints. Camera's performance is marginal, slow, but produce decent pictures. I used it to shoot pictures of my dish in a restaurant, and they all came out soft. Only outside with brightlight that I got some decent shots. Video is almost always bad, this phone needs very brightlight and can only do a good job in non-fast moving scenes. I shot a lion dance in Chinatown and the video is almost unusable, blurry with bad audio.Touch screen is faily responsive. No worse or better than other inexpensive Android phones, but not at iPhone level. Kit Kat is good to use, you would like it if you are used to Android operating system. I added a 64GB Sandisk MicroSD card and loaded some videos. As a media playback device, it is pretty decent. As I said, this could be your small tablet.But for the price, you can expect too much. Since it can support dual SIMs, it is great for those oversea trip as well. I think it is a good back up to have; but as a primary phone, spend a little more and get a better phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMFAIF6PO9FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R3DMFAIF6PO9FT","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a long time Sonicare user, I can tell you this: Forget this one and buy the Sonicare instead. Your teeth and gums will thank you for the wise choice. About the only interesting thing about this powered toothbrush have is its rotating brushes. But rotating brush head is also its major weakness: It is so underpowered that if you press it a little hard (very little) to your teeth and the thing stops. The tooth brush does not have enough power to keep rotating!With Sonicare, you have quarter-pause and 2-minute timer. Every 30 seconds Sonicare tells you to switch side and your brushing session always last 2 minutes. And the cleanliness you feel after brushing is priceless. The Conair has none of that, or I did not have a complete brushing session to know. I charged the toothbrush full (almost 24 hours and the light turned off to tell me it is full charged) and tried. It only took 15 seconds for me to know that this doesn't work for me and probably never will. I kept having to move the toothbrush aways from my teeth for it to contiue working. This in additional to expensive and tough to find brush head (as I heard) make the Conair not a good buy.3/12/15 UPDATE: I tried it again today to make sure I did not miss any thing. I left it plugged in for longer 24 hrs to ensure the battery is fully charged. Then squeezed a pea size toothpaste on it. Same result! The toothbrush stopped with just a little bit of pressure. It now definitely will be retired to the garage waiting for a trip to Goodwill.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QNGKIJ5YZCSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DO442DU#wasThisHelpful","R1QNGKIJ5YZCSJ","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most extended battery made for iPhone I know aren't going to win any beauty contest anytime soon. They are all bulky and effectively nullify all design work put into the product. Well this one is almost no different. Slap this case on and your beautiful iPhone 6 looks just degrade to ordinary. However, it is the best looking so far, and all the features this battery/case come with almost make up the loss.it is a protective case with battery. Your iPhone speakers are amplified, sounds much better than what on the phone itself. Lightning connection replaced by micro USB, I am sure, like me, you have 10 of those just laying around. No panic if you forget your cable at home. Power button in the back, and can tell how much juice remains in the battery. Nice curvatures to hold the phone, even it is a bit heavier.So, this is something nice to throw into the luggage on a trip in case you need more talk time. Others report a solid 3 hrs increase in talk time, I have not yet to try it. First impression is good and expect it is a good product too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q2BAWNY4MXT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG8TIYA#wasThisHelpful","R1Q2BAWNY4MXT2","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could be a very nice and interesting case for the iPhone 6 plus. Nice red color, interesting design surely a good conversation piece. Semi-soft rubber fit the phone nicely, texture on the sides guarantees you won't drop it accidentally, but easy to pull out of pocket. All buttons and ports are on the right place, I have no trouble operating the phone at all.Overall, it is a good case, except that it appears the design is glued to back of the case, not part of the case like I thought. The backing does not have a perfect glue job either, one small corner by the camera port seems to peel up (see picture). I don't know how long this will stay on.I had to pay for shipping as this is not a Prime item. Shipping it back is too much troubles so I keep it, but not totally happy with the case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1FGL0UNQBJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI9TDUC#wasThisHelpful","R2M1FGL0UNQBJM","A3V7D0LH8L7BG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V7D0LH8L7BG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought these (in King size) a few weeks back, but couldn't write a review until they were used, washed, and put on again. They were silly-smooth when first put on and are just as smooth after washing. I would agree with the manufacturer that these are as smooth as 1500-count cotton sheets at a fraction of the price. That said, you can feel that may not be as long-lasting as cotton sheets would (but at this price, who cares?), and I recommend that they be washed under the gentle cycle in your washer (warm water) with a cold rinse.After the first wash, I found that they were colorfast and, being polyester, were also wrinkle-free. I didn't notice any shrinkage after washing when they were put on the bed. I bought these in the Rust color, and they look great and absolutely ""Pop"" on the bed. At $25 per set, I figure I an buy another 3 or 4 and still keep total cost well under the cost for a single set of comparable cotton sheets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PNK8DUSPO3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143FF3H2#wasThisHelpful","R31PNK8DUSPO3N","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this scoop! After years of using anemic plastic scoops that twist, bend and break sooner than later, I've found a scoop that will survive our three cats & two litter boxes. Now that we use the new ground ""corn-cob"" style of litter, we don't get the mini-cement litter clumps that are somewhat common with clay litter, but this would be excellent at loosening and removing these.I sides of the scoop are high enough that when you shuffle the scoop to strain the litter (and that which it carries) that the ""stuff"" doesn't end up on the floor all around the litter box. It is also VERY easy to rinse clean as the litter doesn't cling as it does to plastic scoops (especially when well used). I have read some reviews that mentioned that the foam-type handle begins to peel off after a time; should that happen, I have duct tape. I've already ordered another for the second litter box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UCK4HWCQQ8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DCAAP4#wasThisHelpful","R10UCK4HWCQQ8F","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 2 six-packs of these, one for just plain use in the dryer and another for use with an essential oil (I chose orange). Previous to these, my wife had bought some plastic dryer balls. They came in a two-pack, were very noisy in the dryer and, being very light in weight, were pretty much useless. We stopped using them after 2 dryer loads as we saw no benefit other than the noise.We've been using these for a couple of weeks and are very happy with the results. For large loads, we use all six balls and only four for medium loads (both our washer & dryer accommodate larger-than-normal loads). Here is what we have learned:1.  Our dryer loads DO complete in less time (estimate, about 10% quicker). This translates, over time, to a savings in electricity (we are at $0.14/hr) that will far exceed the cost of the balls.2.  Items like cotton dress shirts come out with so many less wrinkles that one could wear them without ironing (I iron them anyway because I'm a bit OCD in that regard).3.  The wool balls are very quiet in the dryer and are, in fact, hardly noticeable, especially when compared to the very noisy plastic softener balls we were using.4.  When used with just a few drops of the essential oil of your choice, the entire load will be infused with a light scent of that oil.NOTE: I recommend using two distinct sets of wool balls if you choose to use a fragrance and to keep the sets separate. Once the wool balls have been scented, they do not give up that scent easily or quickly. Use the one for non-scented laundry (outerwear?) and the other for scented laundry (underwear?). Enjoy the features of guilt-free fabric softening and the pleasures of the same, but scented. Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5J5A3EHG03F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2T6OE4#wasThisHelpful","R3S5J5A3EHG03F","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I've been cooking for some 50-years, I've never used (or thought I needed) a spatula designed specifically for fish, although I have always been aware of them. I bought the Dynamic Chef fish spatula while it was offered as an Amazon Deal, and I'm very happy I did!The curved design of the spatula makes not only fish easier to lift or turn in the pan, but it works just as well for chicken parmesan (gotta brown those breaded fillets before you do anything else), eggplant, or any other delicate item you might saute. This is a true Chef's tool that fits well and feels good in the hand. The rough-textured plastic handle makes the home cook feel confident that, even if greasy, it won't slip from your grasp.It is light in weight and the balance is just perfect.

"I have always used the traditional stainless steels whisks. I've had them decades and they have served me well. Recently I bought a couple of non-stick fry pans for eggs and the like, so I decided that, to be safe, I should buy a non-scratch whisk. Enter the Slippery Kitchen Silicone Whisk. It is perfect for my needs (eggs, small-batch light mixes, etc.). It's shortness (about 10"" overall) and stainless-steel handle provides excellent control without wrist strain (at 64 and arthritic, this is an issue). I find this size perfect as anything that requires a very stiff whisk will be mixed first in a stainless steel bowl, so no worries.I really like the fact that the whisk is easily cleaned with just a quick hot water rinse (even when coated with a brown sugar-molasses mix). The flexibility of the whisk keeps this from being useful for any but light batters (pancakes, for instance), but for most types of sauces or eggs, it is fantastic! I now use it mixing liquids in my ceramic coated dutch ovens, as my stainless steel whisks left scratch marks that, over time, may have worn away some of the ceramic coating.A well constructed kitchen tool that is worth its price. Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRZMUXIV2SNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5FPBMI#wasThisHelpful","RSRZMUXIV2SNA","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for my wife who is a Speech Pathologist. She works mostly with people who have suffered some type of brain trauma (accident, stroke, etc.), or are suffering from Dementia or Alzheimer disease. Many of these people have swallow difficulties, so my wife often needs to do an inspection of their mouths and upper pharynx (back of the throat) to rule out any physical, non-motor reasons for swallow problems. In the past she used a small LED Penlight. While this provided sufficient light, it was a bit large and patients often had to open their mouths more than was comfortable for them.She has been using these for a couple of weeks now, and she is very pleased. The yellow light is not an issue for her and she finds them light in weight and easy to use. She is particularly happy that her patients need only open their mouths slightly for her to light the oral cavity to see what she needs to see. They are very convenient for her as she can just clip them to her pocket. The smooth metal construction lets her disinfect them (with alcohol swabs) quickly and easily to maintain good sanitation.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFMJ6PPKJ4B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC2NA6W#wasThisHelpful","R3RFMJ6PPKJ4B0","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't add much to the prior reviews except to say that (to this 64 year-old) George Ezra is an old soul in a young body.

"After about 40 years, I have re-engaged with modeling. These type & style paints were not available to me when I did modeling in the 60's (oh God, was it that long ago ...?), so I am entirely impressed by the scope, breadth and quality of these acrylic paints. My son clued me into diluting them slightly with some water, and they work incredibly well on the (primed) plastic WW II models I'm doing.My first two models were a PT Boat and a WW II fighter plane. Just a few areas (on the boat, mostly) needed a ""metallic"" touch to make them stand out from the usual drab-color total painting. Great overall effect for me. I doubt I'll ever use another paint than Vallejo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W97Y2D4SLX3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D82OLM#wasThisHelpful","R1W97Y2D4SLX3I","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: I did not by this through Amazon (although I am a Prime member) solely because it was needed STAT. Had I done so, I would have saved money (as usual).My wife was recently in a car accident and the air-bag deployed which, although it kept her from any real damage, it caused a painful bruise on her sternum. I went to out local ""chain"" drugstore and bought this for her. Two minutes in the microwave later, she had instant relief.The wrap is very well constructed and has two handles that allow you to handle the heated product without dealing with the heat of the wrap right out of the microwave. Although my wife originally used this for her chest bruise that eventually resolved itself, she also had used it to relieve neck tension (to help avoid migraines). I, too, have used it on my knees for arthritis relief. It's a bit large for other joints (wrist & elbow), so I have just ordered the smaller size for joint use.The heat pack gives immediate relief (dry packs take a while), and you can feel it penetrate as soon as you put it on. Maybe it's my imagination, but I swear I get a ""deeper"" relief with this than a dry-pack type of heat wrap. As a Cold Pack, although it works well, it doesn't last near as long as the CryoMax cold pack (http://smile.amazon.com/Cryo-Max-Reusable-Medium-1-Count-Boxes/dp/B001QFZL1Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1444781408&sr=1-1&keywords=8+hour+cold+pack) that is designed for cold therapy alone.All-in-all, both my wife and I believe this to be a great product that will likely last for many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBUX9PC6IP5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042PUJEG#wasThisHelpful","RHBUX9PC6IP5B","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this item on an Amazon “Today’s Deal” offering, even though I had recently bought (again, through Amazon) the Photive HYDRA Bleutooth speaker (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K589F8A?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00). I’m glad I didn’t give the HYDRA a top rating as this speaker is far superior in a number of ways. Let’s count them, shall we …PROS:1.  More compact & lighter weight2.  Significantly louder without distortion3.  Better frequency response, especially in the base range (rated at 68Hz vs. the estimated 200Hz for the Photive HYDRA)4.  Volume control for wired input devices (the HYDRA volume does not control output from input devices thru RCA connections)5.  SD card slot: accommodates up to a 32GB micro SD card, eliminating the need for external input devices)6.  The Arespark has a much longer battery life (14 hrs. vs. 8 hrs. [at medium volume] as stated by the respective manufacturers.)7.  Arespark has a convenient but unobtrusive battery level indicator.8.  Has a ""Selfie"" button for use with iPhones (not somethingI use myself)9.  Carabiner-like attachment clip (carry it with you “hands-free” while it plays) is very convenient.10. Weather-proof cover for inputs firmly attached: HYDRA has cover that can be easily lost as stated in my original review.CONS:1.  Relatively short USB charger cable (but most of us have others that are longer)2.  Short “device” input cable (again, as above)All-in-all the Arespark is far superior to the Photive HYDRA.  It has a better frequency response and is louder (without distortion) that the HYDRA, and at the same price or less. I had my HYDRA for about 3 weeks, but donated it to Goodwill after getting the Arespark. I couldn't be happier as it suits my needs and then some.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHA58D0SLX8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE48SN6#wasThisHelpful","RVHA58D0SLX8U","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this a while ago and have been waiting for the company to make it right ever since. Maybe I got a bad batch. Maybe I suddenly couldn't do with this product what I had done before a others. Maybe the God's conspired against. Nevertheless, this company (who offers a LIFETIME warranty on this product) eventually just ignored me when I would not work for me.Now before I continue, let me say that I still have the exchanged emails & the requested photos (proof) that I sent to them, which included a copy of my original purchase invoice from Amazon.I ordered these for the new Moto E (1st Gen) that I had just gotten to use with my Tr*****e account. Including phones for my wife & my son, I had installed this type of product 6 times before. Frankly, I thought this would take care of all our phones. Much to my chagrin, my first attempt at installing this on my phone (in a closed bathroom a recommended), I couldn't get the first shield to adhere without scores of bubbles that I could not press out. So, too, the second and third films. Bubbles + bubbles that I could not get rid of.But it's under warranty, right? So I contact the company. I don't complain; I only tell them what happened. Maybe I'm doing something wrong that I not seeing. Please advise, I ask. A few days later, I get an email asking me not to give a bad review. Please give them an opportunity to resolve the situation and would I please send pictures. I send pictures of the three failed results.  A few days after that, I get an email saying they got the pictures, can I send my original invoice. I send them a copy of my Amazon invoice for the product. After that, I wait. And I wait some more. Then I just forget about it & order a flexible glass protectors that installed flawlessly on each of the first tries.It's been almost 4 months since the original purchase and I just again today thought of it. I could leave it be, or write the review. I HAD to write the review. If you have a company that offers a warranty, you should abide by that warranty, even for a $7 product! They can do nothing for me now as I already have screen protectors for all three phones.I never asked them to replace the product.

"Needed outlet expansion with moderate surge protection for my wife's home work desk with ability to safely recharge her work laptop. This was perfect. Easily installed into what was a double wall outlet using the integrated machine screw to attach it to where the wall plate screw went. Does not accommodate the large, clunker transformer/chargers, but does easily accept todays more narrow chargers.Once attached, the outlet tells you if your outlet is A O-K (green LED light) or has a fault (red LED light). In that case, better call an electrician as there is a short somewhere along the line. It provides a basic protection for your attached electronics (such as a re-charging item), but it doesn't provide the higher level of protection one would want for a wall-powered computer. For that, an APC battery back-up/surge protector would make more sense.Very happy with this outlet, but would have been happier, still, if the outlets were tilted out at a slight angle (20 degrees or so) for easier access.

"The photo for this hat makes it look very much like leather, unless to enlarge the picture to easily see that it's cotton. Nevertheless, the two brown hats I received didn't look weathered at all, but they still looked great. They have a great patina that I'm certain will fade or time and use in the sun which will only make them look better.OK. Enough about the looks. Here's the real scoop:1.  The construction of this hat is second to one other that I have ever had. It is sturdy, perfectly proportioned, easily adjusted and has a substantial sweatband inside (i.e., it really will absorb sweat).2.  It is made in China, but with premium materials and cotton that has a heavy, rich feel to it. On the outside, the hat almost feels like suede.3.  The stitching is perfect. I couldn't find a single flaw or stray thread.4.  The fit is generous and deep. I wear a 7 3/8 hat size, and this fit me with a full 3/4"" of exposed velcro in the band to make it smaller.  The hat itself it very deep (tall) so it may sink down on smaller heads, so keep that in mind. I don't know how well this would fit children or smaller women (my wife is 5'4"" and it looked a bit ""top-heavy"" on her. I gave hers to my son.5.  A nice distressed leather look can be easily obtained with some light swipes with fine (400 grit) sandpaper in a few spots. Go very lightly a bit at a time, brush off between swipes, and avoid damaging any stitching. Gives a very nice effect.All-in-all, I have to say I've never bought a better, sturdier bill cap at any price. I believe you'll love the fit and feel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUCJKN0DN04U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FHJNC2#wasThisHelpful","R3QUCJKN0DN04U","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has suffered from severe migraines since she was a teenager, and I mean commode-hugging migraines. For at least 4-days each month, she was totally incapacitated. When she was in her early 30's, her doctor managed to get her into the clinical trial study for Imitex, an injectable medication that alleviated her headaches almost instantly after they occurred. Since then, many other medications have come out for migraine relief, but most of them are taken orally. They do her no good because by the time the migraine sets in, she begins to vomit, so oral meds never get absorbed. This leaves only the injectable. But this medication is incredibly expensive, even with insurance that pays for only some of her need. When we pay cash, it costs $55-70 per shot!She has tried many prescribed treatments to lower the frequency of her migraines, but none have been terribly effective. Recently, we read about Butterbur Extract for the prevention of migraines. It takes a month or so for any effect to be noticed. She's been taking this for about 50 days, and has begun to see a marked reduction of migraine onset. Because insurance requires it for her to get regular coverage for her injectable, she keeps a log of headache onsets. So far she has logged about 20% less than she did before she started this extract. She feels it is working (and who am I to argue?).Not every medication or herbal supplement works for every individual, but this has worked very well for my wife. Considering the inexpensive cost of Butterbur, we can't see why anyone suffering from migraines would not try it. If you do, buy a 3-month supply, as it takes at least 30-days for you to begin to see results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11G3OCUKFFVLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCTTXG0#wasThisHelpful","R11G3OCUKFFVLE","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a VERY long hiatus (I'm in my mid-60's), I decided to start modeling again. For my plastic models, I chose a couple of WW II models that require some metallic colors. Now all I knew and used back in the day were oil-based paints and thinners. Primers were not a concern. Fortunately, my son does modeling for role-playing games and educated my on asking the parts before applying primer, all to give the acrylic paints (new to me, also) good adhesion and prevent flaking/chipping later on down the line.He recommended this brand of primer, so I bought it in basic light grey as a neutral base for the various colors I'd be using. Now I've used spray primers before, but always in home project applications, but I wasn't ready for what the Tamiya primer provided: the finest mist that I've ever seen come out of a spray can other than hair spray. It lands like dust on the plastic and covers in just a couple of coats. It dries quickly and allows me to paint without streaking or running with slightly thinned acrylic paints. Wish we had this stuff when modeling 50 years ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLD8Q5CH082T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BMXRUM#wasThisHelpful","RQLD8Q5CH082T","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this mostly outside with my iPod so I don't need earphones while working in the garden, sitting out with my wife, etc. For what I paid for it (under $40) , I'm happy. I don't use the Bluetooth function at all. I bought this for its water-resistant claim, which seems to be true as I recently left it outside at night by mistake. We had one helluva thunderstorm that night, but the speaker worked just fine the following day.I really like the rubberized exterior that encases the entire unit except for the speaker grill which, itself, is very sturdy and not likely to be easily damaged. It has a nice grippy feel and won't be prone to slipping from one's hand. I've twice had it drop to the ground (through my own stupidity) from heights of about 3 to 4 feet. Neither drop damaged the speaker as far as I can tell. Nevertheless, I have ordered a padded carrier for the Photive HYDRA Speaker (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0127P8TBW?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13). I expect that with reasonable care this piece of electronics will last for many years.A few observations that, were it more expensive, would have brought the rating down to four stars:1.  The speaker does not get terribly loud, but it is fine for indoor use or outside at a limited distance (at top volume, it is at a comfortable listening level 50 to 60 feet directly in front of the speaker or about 30 feet off the the sides or behind the unit.2.  It has very poor Base response. It is fine for certain music types (Folk, Country, etc.) but if you like, say, Classical music, you will be very disappointed. I don't know that actual frequency response for the Photive HYDRA, but as a trained Audiologist and Acoustician, I would be surprised if it went much lower than 125 Hz or much higher than 16,000 Hz. Most stationary speakers will deliver a range from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. If you are a Classical music lover, look elsewhere for a portable speaker.3.  When using the auxiliary input the speaker's volume control does not work. Volume is dictated by the limits of the input device. The speaker's impedance must be much higher than earbuds as my iPod, when set at top output level, gets no where near as loud as it can with earbuds. If you connect a CD player through line-output (as you should) the volume may be quite loud but cannot be controlled. Connect thru' ""earphone"" output to have any control whatsoever. PROBLEM: Earphone output it so low as to be almost unhearable.4.  The rubber end-cap that protects the exposed inputs and the on/off switch is not well secured. It has a rubber ""nub"" that slips into a rubber hole to keep it attached by a less-than-one-inch rubber ""cord"". The end cap attachment is easily knocked out of its attachment hole, and the entire protective cap can be easily lost.All in all, I'm glad I bought this and it will travel with my wife and I (with an iPod) where ever we travel. (I'll never  try using a CD player direct, though). The speaker is compact, light, easy and quick to charge, and provides decent fidelity at all volume levels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAME0U9EN5V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K589F8A#wasThisHelpful","R2PAME0U9EN5V2","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Frankly, as good an artist as Darrell Scott is, I wasn't certain how I would receive this CD. I love Ben's work so much, I was worried that I might be disappointed. Then I listened to the first cut (""The One I'm Still Thinking About"") and I was surprised that it brought tears to my eyes. Ben left us with a legacy of just over fifty songs, and there can be no better legacy to leave behind than one's own music. Darrell records about a fifth of that legacy and in so doing, has added to his own.Those not familiar with the late Ben Bullington and want to experience a fair spectrum of his insight, style and grace in the way he wrote songs, this album could be considered a ""Best Of"", and you would do no wrong in buying it. Those of you who do know Ben's work, you owe it to yourself to hear Ben's songs done in the spirit of his writing but with Darrell's own, expert twist put on music and phrasing.

"This laundry bag measures 9"" x9"" x 20"" tall, smaller than the typical folding basket that measures 13"" x 13"" x 19"" that I have previously bought elsewhere for $5.00. Still, it is large enough for fit a full standard load of light to medium weight laundry (not heavy towels or jeans). I bought 4 bags. The first one I loaded with whites had both handles break at one of the two connection points immediately, so it has to be carried in the arms rather than by the handles. The second did not break under the same load, but it is obvious from the flimsy construction that it soon will. I didn't check the other two bags since I assume they are no better.It seems obvious to me that quality is not something this company values, nor is providing good value for your dollar.

"I agree with other reviewers that this album is the best since ""Too Long In The Wasteland"", his first. I'll even say that it is his best album to date. As a story teller, no one comes close besides the late Ben Bullington (notably, “Ben Bullington” and “White Sulfur Springs”). Some may compare Mr. McMurtry to the ubiquitous Bob Dylan, but McMurtry writes of only real life; if not life lived by himself, then life that is carefully observed and empathized with until a true story emerges. McMurtry is also one of the very few artists who regularly make a socio-political statement in their recordings (Steve Earle is another), perhaps part of the reason he doesn’t get more airplay or TV time.I’m glad that he decided to go mostly acoustic with this album as it has been how I have seen him in various small venues (Does he play any others? He sure deserves to.)  Mr. McMurtry’s guitar playing prowess is often concealed on his records, but on “Complicated Game” he shines, and you know it. The production and engineering are exceptional as is the musicianship of everyone involved. Truly, this is one of the 10 Best albums of 2014 in this genre. (It has been listed as Folk, Country & Rock. I choose to consider it Folk-Rock that has lately seen a resurgence since it’s almost-demise in the early 70’s).Hope you enjoy this album.

"Truth is, we're getting older and I wanted our ""Last Fan"". We try to use fans rather than our A/C for obvious reasons, but our living room fan has always really interfered with hearing dialog clearly when the fan was set on anything higher than Low. I was intrigued by the ""silent"" aspect of the fan, so I thought I'd roll the dice. I rolled a ""7"", and 7's a winner!I won't even compare this to the noise level of the comparable Vortex stand fan; it would be unfair (We had one that died this year after only 7 years of use ... second Vortex to do just that). On low setting, this fan cannot even be heard running, as the ambient room noise is louder; on Medium setting you can hear a very slight ""sssshh"" sound that is totally unobtrusive while watching TV (without use of sound bar or surround sound);' on high it becomes only slightly noticeable, but still doesn't distract; the ""Turbo"" setting is the 4th speed, and altho' louder, still doesn't make TV dialog harder to hear.As an acoustics expert, I can say that the reason for all this is the very shallow curve of the blades which are also thinner than the usual fan blade. Whereas most fans produce a ""hiissss"" sound (that REALLY interferes with hearing speech well), this fan produces a much lower frequency sound (""ssshh"") that doesn't interfere as much with speech intelligibility, so hearing dialog is not interfered with very much. As well, the level of noise it produces is MUCH lower (by my measurement, about 20 Db) than the typical fan of the same size.It is easy to put together, has a much more stable base than did (does) our Vortex fan (of early demise). As well, the heavy base has four rubber-tipped feet to help prevent marring of smooth floors. Removal of the metal ""screens"" is easy for quick cleaning of both fan cage AND blades. The remote is very responsive and can control everything other than the tilt of the fan and oscillate function.Construction of the fan is substantial, and I can't see how it wouldn't last close to a lifetime. As I have had 2 of my 3 Vortex fans die on me within 3-7 years, I will be buying a 12"" Rowenta for our bedroom. At this price (comparable to the ""Vortex""), I will trust that an improved, but traditional design fan will serve me as well (and better, sound-wise) as any Vortex-type fan while lasting longer.

"After we bought a new couch & love seat, I decided to protect them from dirt & spills that pretty much ruined our previous living room seating. I've been around for a while, so I knew that I would need more than what was recommended. That said, we got four 2-packs. Although we didn't need that much for a single treatment, I knew that I wanted a second treatment on the most vulnerable areas.Using this indoors is best done in spring or early fall when windows can be opened to dissipate the fumes and odor of the spray. Open windows also help accelerate drying time.I double-treated the armrests and seating cushions as I planned and still had two full cans left over (NOTE: Our loveseat is smaller than most at 5 1/2' in width. We have cats, so as soon as I realized fur removal was easier on the treated areas, I used most of the remaining two cans to treat the back cushions, as well.Spills bead up for a while on treated areas, giving you enough time to blot things up before they stain (I used plain water to test this).

"I did not buy this printer through Amazon (although I would have saved $10 had I done so), but rather through a local warehouse club. I was dubious about my purchase based on all the poor reviews; however as all but two of the reviews were not ""verified purchases"", I did not lend them too much credence.  I know my review is not a ""verified purchase"" either, but I am a frequent Amazon purchaser & a regular reviewer who prides himself on accurate & fair reviews.I am using this printer on a Mac running 10.10.3. I bought it to replace my HP J5750 ""All-In-One"" that suddenly decided not to print in black. As well, my old printer shook my entire computer desk while it printed, and it never printed photos worth saving. The HP 7645 prints both B&W and Color on standard paper in less than half the time and doesn't shake my desk at all. Further, it prints 4x6 and 5x7 photos quickly and beautifully on HP & Kodak glossy photo paper; every bit as good as drug store prints. The quality of B&W printing is every bit as good as a laser, crisp and very detailed, so I don't understand those reviewers who claim otherwise. As an ink jet printer it is, of course, noisier than a laser, but not so noisy as to distract.I tried the printer first using the USB connector with excellent results. I then (and since) used it via the wireless connection which has worked flawlessly. Other users didn't mention their operating systems, so perhaps they were using one which had problems recognizing the printer, but my Mac had no issues. Print response was just  as quick as if the printer was connected via a cable.All-in-all, I highly recommend this printer for any Mac user.UPDATE: 04/17/15Had an issue where the auto-document feeder wasn't working properly.

"I won this on a “Bidding Site”, so I lucked out and ended up paying less than two dollars for this tablet. I’ve never had a product likes this before, so I have no means of comparison to similar products costing 3 to 4 times the price of the ZeePad. Not having used any “Pad” but this one, I can still see why one would want to spend more for a brand-name, more expensive product.I haven’t explored everything yet, just the features that I would use most frequently. I’m a big Netflix user, and I had no trouble logging in to the service from the pad, and I watched several episodes of the 6-episode Vietnam series. I watched two 45-minute episodes with the battery level down to only 78%. From there, no matter the function I was in, the battery power dropped precipitously. It almost seemed as though the power was operating on a logarithmic function where the power draw was 10x greater than the draw before it. It declined rapidly from (10 mins.) from 78% power to under 60% power. Shortly thereafter (at about 40%), the tablet just shut down completely.While I watched Netflix, the stream was steady & uninterrupted and the picture was very good. I watched some episodes of another series on Netflix (with the power cord plugged in), also with very good results.I was unable to listen to music from my Amazon Prime account or from any online streams of a radio shows connected via websites, although I had no problem listening to Pandora, once the app was installed.I can shop, I can do email & Facebook, but there are many things I cannot do because of the limitations of this tablet. If you are content with very basic apps AND you don’t mind using the tablet while plugged into its power supply (which I now do because of logarithmic discharge of the battery), then you are good to go to buy this $40 tablet. Just don’t expect anything more than a $40 tablet.What is a $40 tablet? The screen can be seen only when “face-on”; the battery life is relatively short & unreliable; some applications wont run (e.g., Amazon Prime music); the speaker is mono and very “tinny” (better listened to using headphones); navigation is difficult, and certain things (like deleting an item) are hard to do.All-in-all this is a good deal for someone who just wants to watch shows on-line, do some basic email/Facebook stuff, and listen to Pandora while doing other things. Remember: you get what you pay for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YO2CUZ340VKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGRH3SE#wasThisHelpful","R2YO2CUZ340VKE","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a 13-EEE in a shoe, but I bought these knowing that the “D” width would be narrow for me, but I figured that they would stretch out over time. It’s been about 3 months now, and the width seems fine; they have “molded” to fit my feet. The same cannot be said of the length. The size 13 I bought was tighter than I thought it would be. If they were shoes, I would have returned them, but as slippers that will be worn just a couple of hours/day (at most), I kept them. I would have to say that these run a bit small and should be purchased one-size larger than your usual show size.The sheepskin lining is great. Smooth and comfortable from the start, the thick lining quickly conformed to the shape of my foot. As advertised, your bare feet will not get sweaty in thises slippers, and for that I’m grateful.The soles are thick enough to be worm outdoors (to get the mail, paper, etc.) without feeling the pebbles of our gravel driveway. I have worn them, as well, while driving; very comfortable.Although they are made in China (hard, these days, to find something that is not) they are well constructed and feel like they will last a number of years. I look forward to slipping into these each day when I come home from work, and I wear them around the house on my days off. All-in-all, I’m very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K34ZE6KXQWUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002B562F4#wasThisHelpful","R3K34ZE6KXQWUO","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this to my wife as one of her Christmas presents, and I could see the disappointment in her face when she opened it. If she had a cartoon caption box over her head it would have read, “Oh, great, a callus remover; how about a whole body massage?” Then she used it and it was love at first try.This grooming tool is just great. She had more callus on her feet than skin, but she loathed the feel and sound of the usual manual callus scrapers that I have always used. A couple of months have passed, and her feet are free from dead skin and she is finally pain-free wearing shoes. It took a while, but now she only does maintenance to keep her feet “comfy”. I have used it, as well, and it works fast & does a great job of keeping my own feet in tip-top shape.It uses four “AA” batteries, but rechargeables are not recommended by the maker; I tried them, but the buffer speed was lower, so we stick with alkaline batteries. If you have bad feet to start with, you will go through a lot a power cells until you get into the “maintain” mode: it EATS batteries with constant use.All-in-all, we could not be happier with the performance of the Amope.

"If you have a washer that empties into a sump pump, you should be using a lint trap. You'd be amazed at how much lint & hair, etc., your washer spews into your sump, even if you don't have pets. If you DO have pets, a lint trap is indispensable. Lint will cling to the input & output port of your sump pump. Over time, this build-up causes a blockage that will stop your pump from working & require a replacement. It's cheaper & smarter to use lint traps. With one of these in place, whatever gets past will also pass through your sump pump without causing any damage or build-up.Now for the product review. These are usually sold in 2-packs at many types of retail store, usually for anywhere from a dollar to two-fifty. Like these, most come with a zip-tie for each trap. At half the price of what you will pay in a retail store, these lint traps are a bargain. They are shorter than the 9"" length the product description claims (try 7"" when fully extended to USEABLE length). Unlike store-bought brands that are stitched on the bottom, these have a metal ""crimp"" to close off the bottom, and this shortens the ""real"" length. If you use any of this type of lint trap correctly, you don't let them get more than half full, so the length doesn't matter that much, really.Even though they may need to be replaced more frequently than store brands, they are still more economical by 50 percent or more and translate into a great savings. They work as well as any other I've ever used. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3HBG2ELG673/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX9HZPE#wasThisHelpful","R3S3HBG2ELG673","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first Sangean radio I've bought, but it won't be the last. Except for a ""boom-box"" era relic, every radio I have is AC powered, so I thought it would a good idea to have something basic that I could rely on during power outages. Then I realized that this would also be something good to have while camping, backpacking or even in the car on long trips. It is, after all, an EMERGENCY RADIO! This review will not include information already in the Amazon product description.The construction is very substantial. It's made with the same plastic material used in the making of various construction-site things that  ""take a licking but keep on ticking"". The radio is protected from ""drop"" damage by thick, screwed on, rubberized protective caps. One rubberized end has a flap that gives access to/protects the connections for headphones (the use of which mute the speaker), USB power-in and USB power-out. Now, DO realize that this is a basic AM/FM radio with a Weather Band and an Emergency Weather Alert setting. You cannot play your iPod or iPhone through it as it has no external input. You CAN, however, charge either of these items from the radio itself. The quality, design and construction of this radio is absolutely excellent. Instructions for use are straightforward and easy to understand.Although it weighs only about 14 ounces (with the included Lithium-Ion battery), it feels much more substantial. It is conveniently small (3.5""H x 2.5""D x 6.0""L) with a retractable antenna for both FM and Weather bands. There are 7 Weather band stations, but expect to get only 1 or 2 local stations to come in; frankly, that's all that will be available in any particular area. In times of potentially bad weather (e.g., the risk of tornado), the radio has a ""Weather Alert"" setting that, if a local/national weather alert is issued, will give you an ""alarm"" that will be followed by the actual alert; a near-essential feature here in the Midwest, but also useful in other areas of the country (again, when camping, hiking or in the car, this can be a life-saving feature).The sound from the mono speaker is very good. Although the radio has no tone controls, they're not needed. There is an excellent balance of tone, not too much bass or treble; very easy to listen to. FM reception is very good. I don't listen to AM often, but I tried several stations to see how well the radio did. It passed with flying colors. The radio has a ferrite antenna for AM reception, so the telescopic antenna isn't needed. The stations I listened to all came in quite clear and without the AM static I grew up with. I'm about 20 miles north of Milwaukee and I was still able to get a Chicago station, loud and clear: impressive.The incremental volume control goes from ""0"" to ""30"". A good listening level, for me, is between ""14"" (in a quiet situation) to ""24"" (in a noisy environment). With the volume at the max of ""30"", very slight distortion was evident in the most-used FM band. Because the AM band has less fidelity, it can be ""cranked"" to the highest volume level without regard to any kind of distortion. Likewise the Weather band (the fidelity of which sucks, anyway).Sangean claims the battery will provide about 10 hours of power with the radio in AM mode. In FM mode (at a moderate sound setting of 20), it gave me over that much time before the charge light told me it needed recharging. Pretty decent since it can be fully recharged in about 2-hours with a USB input (I use a direct AC to USB charger. It may take slightly longer with a PC-based USB power connection).When in the off position, the radio displays the current time. Once turned on, you can select stations with ""band select"" followed by manual tuning , or you can select up to 19 presets (AM & FM combined) which are easily programmed. In warmer, sunnier times the radio is automatically run or charged by direct sunlight by way of a large solar panel on the top of the radio (15 hours of direct sunlight = full charge). In a ""worse case"" scenario, you can run the radio using the folding & included ""Dynamo"" crank handle. The Dynamo provides 5-7 minutes of use for every minute of cranking at about 120 cranks/minute; not ideal, but useful in dire situations.Finally, the radio also has an LED light that provides (my estimates) a steady ""high"" brightness of about 15 lumens, a low night-lite level of about 2 lumens. It also provides a steady pulse light (on high only) of about 1/second and a standard SOS signal at the same brightness level. In keeping with the emergency theme, the radio`has an ""Emergency Alert"" button that produces a piercing, pulsing sound for purposes of location.On the overall, I can't think of anything else I would want in an emergency radio The sound is good enough that I will be using this in my main bathroom on a regular basis for local music/news while I shower and keep it charged with an AC adapter. All-in-all, I feel better that I have a radio that I can use anywhere that will keep my both entertained AND informed without any loss of power worries.

"I bought this at the same to I purchased our coffee maker that used basket-type filters. I had paper filters, but I thought this would be more environmentally friendly. In the long run, I though it would be cheaper to use than paper filters. Before I used it the first time, I gave it a thorough warm-water wash with soap to remove any manufacturing residue. Two uses later, I switched back to the paper filters. I'll put aside that it was very messy to clean after each use and just mention that it imparted a definite metallic taste to our coffee. Perhaps other, more expensive filters of this type do not have the same effect, but this one did. i guess you often get just what you pay for, and this is one of those cases. At 6 bucks, it was a total waste of money. Fortunately, it is recyclable, which is just what I did with it..NOT recommended!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQ4W1RQO4K42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPXTA0C#wasThisHelpful","R1CQ4W1RQO4K42","AETG43ARLZDZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AETG43ARLZDZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This collection of Phil Ochs songs is easily the most treasured of his recordings that I own. I’ve been a Phil Ochs fan since my early teens in the 60’s, and I own every LP he ever put out in the States, but I never heard a good number of these songs. Whether or not you are a fan of Ochs, if you are a lover of traditional folk music, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD, as it belongs in your collection.Until you hear this performance of just Phil with his guitar, voice and well written songs, you amy never understand fully why he was considered to be right “up there” with his good friend, Bob Dylan. You may never fully understand why Pete Seeger thought so very highly of Phil. You may also never understand his true genius until you hear these 25 songs that he had written by the time he was only 22 years old. He had vision and insight well beyond his years.This CD will make you feel as though you are in a small club listening to Phil in person back in a time when the protest song was sought out and appreciated by audiences (albeit generally small). Many of these songs are actually still topical today (The A.M.A. Song, The Ballad Of U.S. Steel and The Power And The Glory (which he refers to on the CD as “my anthem”).If you know the full story of Phil Ochs and his untimely death, you will have tears in your eyes if you think about the talent that was lost to us when he ended his life. This CD is a peek back into an era and into an artist that, some 50+ years ago, helped shape what the decade of the 60’s became.

I commented that I thought these were ridiculous and wouldn't make a bit of difference.I was very wrong. These are the bomb! Put them in the microwave for about 45 seconds then pop onto feet. Have a seat with a book or magazine for 10 mins or so, because they aren't made for walking around. The bliss of my toes getting warmed up just makes me happy. It's easy, and I don't have to make a huge production out of running bath water, soaking & drying my feet 3 times a day (although I do have very clean feet as a result). They warm the bottom and top of the foot. The bonus is that these also work nicely to warm up my hands! Instead of running the kitchen faucet I just stick my hands in here. Warm in no time.Now I can reheat myself into a less cold & cranky state in no time at all. My husband says, now wasn't that worth $20? I wish I had these years ago.I must add that after we purchased these, I saw them at Marshalls for $15. Whatever. If you have cold feet, this is your savior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGUUPKW8D1XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NSH6JS#wasThisHelpful","R3IGUUPKW8D1XB","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2008 out of nowhere my eyes had a horrible reaction after taking off my makeup. I had never had a problem before, now my eyes were crusty and swollen almost shut. I don't even wear make up but a handful of times a year. I tried everything to remedy this. New eye makeup, the expensive kind. New makeup removers. Lots of brands & price levels. Nothing made a difference. My eyes would pay a price for a good week afterwards. I resigned myself to wearing eye make up maybe 1-2 times a year. This went on for a few years.Then I got a free sample of Lancome Eau Frache Douceur in 2012. It was the magic potion I had been searching for! My savior! It removed my make up without a reaction. It was pricey, but I splurged on a bottle. I make it last because, again, I don't wear makeup that often.This past summer I went away on vacation and forgot my beloved Lancome! Ack! I wasn't prepared to spend the big bucks to order a whole new bottle, and I was nowhere near a dept store to try and bum a sample.I did the research as to what made that Lancome  product so special. Turns out it is micellar water. Why have I not heard of this before? I took a chance and ordered this product to fill in the gap.Again, my lucky day. Worked just like the Lancome version at a fraction of the price.Note - I do NOT wear heavy make up, so I don't know how this will work for those that wear a full on face of product. I wear mascara (not waterproof), eyeliner, some shadows, powder, some liquid blush. A light hand on all of it.Definitely worth a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A63S4AQ35GPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJ796#wasThisHelpful","R1A63S4AQ35GPZ","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to like this hair dryer. I loved my Scalpmaster Elite until I dropped it on a hard tile floor from high up pulling it from a cabinet and broke it. My fault! (I own 2 of the Scalpmaster Elites, an extra for my in-laws house when we visit, which is often). I also use the concentrator tool on it. If you haven't learned how to master the tools, look at the Sam Villa hair education videos on YouTube or his site for pros. Good Info, great tutorials!I ordered this one thinking that maybe this was the updated version of that one.The Scalpmaster Elite is a super hairdryer for those of us that want a pro looking blow dry at home. The Revlon/Clairol hairdryers you get at Target are crap, and you will understand that only when you move up to one of these. Plus they have such a short life! Ugh!  A good, semi-pro hairdryer is the way to go for most of us that are good at doing our own blow drying. I like the way I blow dry my own hair, to the point when my hairdresser finishes my cut, she hands me a brush and her $150 pro dryer and I get to work. This is how I know I do NOT need a pro dryer. They are heavy! They are made to dry for hours a day 5 days a week. That can get hard on your wrist after a while.On the plus side, the Ionic is a tad smaller than the Elite, so a bit easier to handle as you work around your head/sections. However, it says it is 1875 watts. What? No way! It feels like a travel hair dryer, it blows so weak. And don't get me started on the low air setting. It's like a 'why bother?' My teen age daughter was laughing when she was using it on the low air setting.And the concentrator tool - what is that? I will post a pic comparing the Elite tool vs. the Ionic. It barely fits on the end, and as you blow dry your hair, you need to adjust where it is angled. It is made of thin (and clearly easy to crack/break) plastic. It gets very hot with little use, ok, not unexpected - but not easy to adjust for your needs as you can tell when manipulating, it is on the verge of cracking. And if you hit it with your brush, as that sometimes happens, it gets knocked off! This tool has been designed to fit just inside the rim of the dryer. There is very, very little space for that to sit properly. As I try to remove or adjust it, I am constantly thinking ""I am about to break the tool or the end of the dryer!"" The Scalpmaster Elite tools fit OVER the outside of the nozzle, are MUCH more well made (thick plastic that clearly won't crack!) for long term use. And the opening is too big - oval shaped, not great for concentrating the flow of air. Poor design flaws on the Ultra Elite Ionic.Since I have a teen daughter and myself using this dryer, I went ahead and returned it & reordered the Scalpmaster Elite. It is $20 less here on Amazon than at my local beauty store (that got me hooked on them in the first place with a good coupon!). Totally worth $45!Hope this helps someone!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J74TLX1XOLKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CYEQS0#wasThisHelpful","R1J74TLX1XOLKS","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not every day, but when they are sick or fighting a cold. Even my husband, who is skeptical about supplements, has seen it work for him, stopping a cold in much less time than before. Should be used in conjunction with selenium for best results.ALSO...there are so many of us on Amazon trying to find products like supplements, vitamins, herbs,creams, etc., to manage our health and well being. I try hard to bring an honest review to you. However, much to my chagrin, I am finding paid for and planted reviews. We all know that the person selling a product is going to try and coax a couple of good reviews, but when I come across a product with an outstanding & unbelievable amount of 5 stars, I looks further. For what? Too many 5 star reviews from people who have no other reviews, written in as few words as possible to make the word quota. OR a 5 star review written by someone that has maybe 1 or 2 other reviews for a couple of cheap items, often all bought at the same time. Or many of these types of quick 5 star reviews showing up all around the same time period. Then there are the 'verified buyer' obvious paid reviews. I've read that this is worked by offering someone an Amazon gift card in exchange for that person purchasing the product then positively reviewing it, thus earning the 'verified buyer status' and elevating the validity of the review. So be forewarned and look a bit further in for the high quality reviews many of us take the time to write!This extra post script is NOT in reflection of the product I am reviewing here; it is to educate readers as they wade through all of the reviews to try and get the correct information to make a well educated purchase with their money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REH014MF2M6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098U0QC0#wasThisHelpful","R3REH014MF2M6T","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually own the Ninja that is one step below this and it is awesome. I had to comment on this one because I helped buy this for my mom. This is one powerful bad a** piece of machinery to own. She makes smoothies and juices in it (like I do in mine) effortlessly. I even made chocolate chip cookie dough with the paddle attachment, totally skeptical that it was up for the job. Nope, it mixes dough as well.My one caveat - the blades on mine are so sharp it is scary BUT...! The blades on this one are downright frightening. I have worked in restaurants and I cook homemade foods daily. I chop and slice on a regular basis. I have had my knives professionally sharpened. The blades on this model are so thin and WICKED sharp that I sliced open my finger with such ease - it went effortlessly through my skin like butter. And with a blade that perfect, it did it with NO pain, I didn't realize it until blood started pouring from my finger. You cannot even test the blade with a feather touch, it will go right in. I have never experienced a blade that sharp before. This is not something you want to let your kids use for their smoothies. I won't even let my kids clean this blender. You will love it but be forewarned.

"I was ALWAYS a very fit woman even in my 40's. Nothing extreme, just always moving & energetic, great diet, etc. Until I turned 41 - my back started giving me trouble. Fast forward to me going to PT to get my back in better shape in Fall 2012. Then late Dec 2012 -  PT is great until one rushed day when she stretched my right leg too far too fast. Didn't feel like anything until 2 hrs later, OMG, the pain in the sole of my right foot & low back! I couldn't walk without a limp. I had never had foot pain before, ever. I couldn't sit on anything soft because of the pain it would cause my low back.It got worse. I had an MRI (slight disc bulge, but nothing that would cause such pain). I tried everything over the next few months - acupuncture, chiropractor, spine drs, orthopedist, physiatrist, neurologist, steroid shot, supplements, stretching, walking through the pain, ice, heat, epsom salt baths 3+ times a day, etc etc. My life became a nightmare of pain - unable to ambulate properly, I had to crawl around my house. I could barely drive. I was given a temp handicap parking placard and told to get a cane. I used to run, bike 40 miles a week, garden, now I was reduced to a cane and suggestions of back surgery in less than a couple of months of being in great shape and NO pain?? My sole of my foot and my back was on fire; other parts of me was starting to deteriorate as a result.I am a big reviewer on here because I believe in the power of the truth and word of mouth to help others. I also depend on it as well to help me. So I was going through a review of what, I do not remember, maybe a supplement that might alleviate pain, and it mentions looking into trigger point therapy. I am so glad I followed the trail to this book.By the time I got to this book, it was November 2013. Not quite a year into my hell. My family was suffering, watching me suffer. I would lay around and try not to wince or cry out when I had to get up, knowing my kids were watching. I shuffled around. I missed so many of my kid's activities.Anyway, I got the Kindle version, and I look in this book as fast as I can for how to manage pain for the sole of my foot. Imagine my surprise - THAT pain originates in my CALF? So I look for the tender spot it tells me to and OUCH! THERE IT IS! Painful, in the meat of my calf. I start to gently work on it. It was painful and would get sore with massage, but I worked through it. This was the Saturday before Thanksgiving.Monday before Thanksgiving - TONS to do. Cleaning for family, shopping, etc. I tell my husband I am going out to get groceries at a couple of different stores, he looks worried. How can you handle it, he asks. He knows I usually can only do about a half hour out then come home and rest. I insist, tired of being so disabled. I go to one, two, three stores. I am out for over 2 hrs. And...THERE IS NO PAIN IN MY FOOT. NONE. I am stunned. No pain from driving, which usually exacerbates it. No limping. Normal gait for the most part, though not perfect due to almost a year of altered gait/limp. UNBELIEVABLE! I come home and my husband comes out to help me, worried that I am going to be in a bad place pain wise. Neither of us can believe how well I was doing considering where I was only a few days before.Now, I have to get to work on all the other trigger points that have cropped up due to my altered walk, excessive crawling, and poor sleep posture to work around pain, as well as my low back issues.It took some time. It took work. I ordered the actual book so I can highlight and dog ear pages. For low back pain, your glutes carry some heavy duty trigger points. If you sit a lot, you probably have trigger points.My foot pain is 100% gone, but after a bike ride I can feel it creep back in. I just pull out my lacrosse ball & roll it out, done. The book warns this can happen, so knowing what to expect and then managing it is most of the battle.  Low back pain has cleared up around 80 - 90%. TPs have a tendency to return esp in a cold environment (I'm in Boston) and esp if they've been there a while. So it can be a bit of work but very worth it.I have lost a lot of muscle so there is a weakness there, I am working on regaining all the strength I lost.What I cannot understand is why all the specialists I saw in Boston - the land of great doctors! - NONE of them thought of this? Even the PHYSIATRIST? Isn't this supposed to be their specialty, muscle and soft tissue pain mgt & recovery? I told my neuro about TrP and she said ""it makes sense"".It's is some work to keep up with all the trigger points that crop up but I do it while watching TV or listening to music.If you have soft tissue pain that nothing else seems to help, you have NOTHING to lose here. You can also Google your pain symptom and 'trigger point therapy' and find some solutions. There are also great YouTube videos on it.BTW, if you stretch a tired or cold muscle too fast/too hard it can set off a trigger point. That's what happened with my PT that day. If I had known about trigger point therapy, I could have saved myself from a year of hell on me and my family, as well as the bills.I recommend a cleaner diet, exercise, fresh air and constant movement versus just sitting. Excessive sitting and lying around make soft tissue pain worse. Stand for half of your tv show. Micro breaks from your laptop. Move around more, get blood flowing, blood flow to an injured area is healing. I love Tiger Balm for night time stiffness or to help get your circulation going on a painful spot.There are also some good videos and a Ted Talk on the science of pain in the brain that are worth watching. If you have been in pain for a long time, your brain actually can become hypersensitive to even tiny pain stimulus. An exaggerated response. It is important to retrain the brain not to overreact to small incidents. I took a nasty fall on my bike last week and was totally panicked, as I have not fully recovered from this past year's trauma. I was hurting that day pretty bad but it didn't turn into anything more than sore arms & shoulders for a couple of days. I had to keep telling myself not every boo boo turns into a year's worth of pain. It helps!Please get in touch if you have more questions or input.*UPDATE June 1, 2014*I keep learning from this book. One thing I think has helped keep pain/discomfort at bay is the use of a SMALL KID BALL in addition to the lacrosse ball. I got into the habit of using the lacrosse ball and it works well, but I started to get more pain in the hips & tightness in lower back. Over the last 2 weeks I started using the small ball and it really got into the tight, deep muscle tissue that needed attention, that even the lacrosse ball couldn't reach. I am finding new relief now, just in time for summer activities. The knowledge I have gained from this book has absolutely made a difference in my back pain. Give it a try, it may well be the most affordable & most effective solution you come across.*Update* Sept 6, 2014I am still finding great relief with TrP therapy. Not only through this book but online. YouTube has many instructional videos on how to work out TrP if the book is too technical or if you need a visual. I am finding that I need to work on the QL TrPs. I found a great set of TrP balls in all the sizes I was missing,from tiny to lacrosse ball size, I just received them and they work very well.http://somasystem.com/shop/myofascial-five-pack/They are only $20 for the set plus about $6 to ship. I have no connection to this company, FYI. They should have an Amazon listing but they don't I wonder why?I would also like to remind anyone starting out the process of working on their TrPs NOT to go overboard. It is very easy to do. You start out, it feels SO good to work out the knots, you are feeling better and better. Then you assume that MORE is BETTER. Maybe you start rolling the TrPs too hard or too much each day or too much in one session. This is where you might set off excess soreness. You have to be careful with the QL muscles (most of us have TrPs there but don't know it until you get in there with a small TrP ball) or you might cause back spasms. I had a chiropractor overwork my QL's and set off a horrific week of spasms before I discovered TrP therapy. So go slow and careful, it will pay off.*UPDATE* Feb 11, 2015I am still finding great relief with TrP therapy. I joined a gym for the 1st time in a decade to get me through this hard Boston winter and was surprised how many people at the gym were ending their workouts with trigger point therapy methods - rolling out on balls or foam rollers, trainers using them on clients, etc. It has caught on as a medicine free, effective way to manage your muscle aches.I have also found that I need a truly functional space to do my TrP sessions. I have put holes in several walls in my house, so now only the basement cement wall will do. Fortunately, I have the perfect space. A cement wall a few feet from a pool table. I can put a small TrP ball against the wall in my glute area, grab hold of the pool table for leverage, then manipulate the ball into some of the hardest to reach spots by bending over slightly and pushing myself into the ball. (Does this sound perverted? Sorry, this is how it has to be done to find relief! I wouldn't want a massage therapist to try and dig around there to work them.)I have found great pain release from working these hard to reach glute points. For back pain that is not getting better despite best efforts, the glute and hip flexor points are key. Keeping up with my TrPs a few times a week really helps.Women in perimenopause should note that because of our changing hormone levels, your body is PRONE to trigger points as well as random aches & pains that cannot be found on any tests other than a series of hormone test through out your cycle. For some women in major hormone flux it can be severe enough for you to be diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. Yes there are some true cases of those diseases that are not related to hormones or trigger points, but there are also women being misdiagnosed & sent home with RX's for anti-depressants & way too strong pain meds. Do your research. A balanced - KEY WORD IS BALANCED - hormone therapy (like bio hormone replacements) as well as exercise, diet, TrP, and improved digestion (which diminished greatly around 40-45 in women) will make a difference in your pain levels.I am working with a gifted endocrinologist who tests my blood 2x a month so we can get the best picture how to manage my perimenopause. I do not have CFS or fibromyalgia, but I do notice that trigger points crop up more often now that my blood tests reveal I am primenopausal.*UPDATE* September 29, 2015Still loving TrP therapy. I travel with 2 sizes of balls when I fly so that I can roll out those knots that can happen after being cramped on a plane. Still find that most of my knots originate in my glutes. I no longer have any foot pain.I try and tell others about it without sounding too ""gushy"" and most people just ""mm-hmm"" me and then forget about it. I don't want to sound like trigger point therapy is the unicorn that will take away everyone's aches and pains, but too many are missing out on medication-free pain relief because doctors or physical therapists aren't offering it as an option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3350GIJJOSY7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608824942#wasThisHelpful","R3350GIJJOSY7J","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Aussie  band made their name in the USA in 1988 with 'Under the milky way', which is awesome song. I bought the whole album...on cassette...for a cross country road trip in 1990 and was blown away by how many other songs on this album just TAKE you there with emotion and lyrical content. It still holds up today in 2014 without sounding dated. I am buying the mp3s of my faves to download and share w my friends who haven't discovered the music they thought the knew from The Church.

"My husband made fun of me for getting what he considers a bulky case. I disagree! It is a case made to protect. For the first time ever I dropped my phone on some wood stairs, it bounced 2 stairs them hit the wood floor. I panicked but the phone was 100% fine. The only gripe, if you have to do a battery pull, it does have a tendency to pull off the back plate as you remove the case, so be careful there.

"Tiger Balm ultra is my go to balm whenever I am achy. Slept on the pillow wrong? On my neck, fine in no time. Low back grumpy? Slather it on. My gripe is that the small containers that are a hexagon shape make it tough to scrape out every little bit of it. I am the type that cuts the toothpaste tube in HALF to get everything I paid for (esp for pricey Toms of Maine...but I digress). This tin is the perfect size for right next to the bed. And it is easy to get every bit of product out of it.I have tried every balm, rub, and cream on the market for muscle aches and pains. I always come back to this. Yes it has a strong scent but they all do. At least this one is a cinnamon scent. Know what else I find? If you are having trouble sleeping, because maybe your thoughts are racing, rub a bit on the base of your neck. The smell and the sensation is distracting in a good way that helps calm the mind. A nice extra benefit!ALSO...there are so many of us on Amazon trying to find products like supplements, vitamins, herbs,creams, etc., to manage our health and well being. I try hard to bring an honest review to you. However, much to my chagrin, I am finding paid for and planted reviews. We all know that the person selling a product is going to try and coax a couple of good reviews, but when I come across a product with an outstanding & unbelievable amount of 5 stars, I looks further. For what? Too many 5 star reviews from people who have no other reviews, written in as few words as possible to make the word quota. OR a 5 star review written by someone that has maybe 1 or 2 other reviews for a couple of cheap items, often all bought at the same time. Or many of these types of quick 5 star reviews showing up all around the same time period. Then there are the 'verified buyer' obvious paid reviews. I've read that this is worked by offering someone an Amazon gift card in exchange for that person purchasing the product then positively reviewing it, thus earning the 'verified buyer status' and elevating the validity of the review. So be forewarned and look a bit further in for the high quality reviews many of us take the time to write!This extra post script is NOT in reflection of the product I am reviewing here; it is to educate readers as they wade through all of the reviews to try and get the correct information to make a well educated purchase with their money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJT3D885RREM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N5WT2O#wasThisHelpful","R2YJT3D885RREM","A1HS55TIAPZP4C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS55TIAPZP4C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Does the United States of America really have political dynasties? If pushed, maybe most people would think of the Kennedy clan and possibly in more recent times the Bush family, but these are exceptions to the rule?Well no, which may come as a surprise to many readers when they recall that America was founded through rebellion against nobility and inherited status. The author of this massive book shows that there are many dynasties and gives an in-depth, interesting and focussed look at these as well as projecting to maybe the next dynasty-in-waiting if Hilary Rodham Clinton gets her way…One was easily overwhelmed by the sheer mass of this book. To a foreigner who has not needed to study America’s comparatively short political history this was an engaging, fascinating read. One can imagine that it may impact on interested American readers in a different way, whilst remaining an engaging, fascinating read. It could have been useful to have featured a little more background information for the ignorant foreigner (or U.S. citizen who slept through class) since the narrative did not always follow a chronological timeline; at times this led to some confusion and uncertainty, especially as it made various assumptions about the reader’s knowledge. Yet overall it is a small complaint when you look at the bigger picture.It was interesting to read about the author’s motivation for writing this book, it being an updated version of something he wrote a half-century earlier, typed on an electronic typewriter he bought from a going-out-of-business sale of the Nixon-Lodge Presidential Campaign Headquarters in December 1960. The inspiration for the book came as a result of his reading habits while stationed in Germany as a soldier in the late 1950s; searching for something interesting to read in the camp library led him to stumble on “The Biographical Directory of the United States Congress” which listed every legislator since the Continental Congress of 1774 and curiosity took over after noting many names kept reappearing time after time. The dynasty hunter was hooked!The Constitution of the United States is quite clear: “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States” yet the author has calculated that 44 American political families have had at least four members of the same name elected to federal office, and in 75 families three members of the same name held national office. Take matters further and a further 48 “mix and match” dynasties exist through marriage. Fascinating in its own way; bolstered by the author’s profiling of 17 (possibly soon to be 18?) families who have established firm dynasties.Reviewing a book of this kind is difficult; how do you review a behemoth of a reference book, even when the author has managed to find an interesting twist to bring a story to life. If you have no care about politics you probably won’t be set on fire by this book, yet it had a lot of interest to offer even to someone who is interested in general knowledge yet quite ignorant about American political history (keeping track of one’s own country’s politicians is enough!).It won’t be for everyone, yet if it catches your eye it probably will deliver a lot and exceed your expectations. For that, at least, it is worthy of closer consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXRAZD4CGAKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815727089#wasThisHelpful","R2IXRAZD4CGAKU","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like it or not, how we pay for things is changing. A lot of the development can be positive and beneficial; yet it only takes a power cut or a network problem or worse and then…? Technological advances are, problems aside, delivering great benefits for more people than ever before. It can be saving those who have often the least quite large sums of money. If can also make it too easy for us to spend what we don’t have and borrow more to do it.The author takes a look at the world of money and payments through a broad lens, pooling insights from many disciplines including history, anthropology and technology to provide a fairly interesting, open and forward-thinking book. Cash still can have its place but there can be greater advantages with electronic payments; the rush to move to electronic and online payments has been fraught with problems, namely security has failed to keep pace. Instead of picking a pocket or raiding an armoured car, a talented criminal hacker can attack hundreds of thousands financial accounts, moving money around the world through a web of bank accounts in seconds. Some criminals prefer the bulk, brash approach and some use salami slicing where it is felt better to get a few cents from a lot of people who don’t notice for a long time, than a big attack that can be quickly detected and possibly acted upon.There is no free lunch, nor no risk-free option, no matter where you keep your money and how you use it.“It can also cost money to have money: to keep it stored safely, you need a minimum amount in order to keep a balance at the local bank, if there even is a local bank, or you may need to pay a person to store it for you. You may have to pay a fee to send money to another person far away from you, to pay for a service or a thing, to support your family, or to help someone out in times of need. You pay this fee to a money transfer agency. These can be formal, international businesses like Western Union, or informal networks of money transfer agents, and everything in-between. You may also have to pay some of your money to fulfil your religious duties, to demonstrate fealty toward your ancestors, and to prove yourself a worthy person in your community,” writes the author.“Money is also fun to play with. Coins are satisfying to hold, flip, throw, spin, hide, and re-cover. Paper bills can be cunningly folded, ripped, burned, drawn upon, and modified in a host of ways. Money is one of the magician’s favourite props. The act of destroying value by tearing up a bill or making a coin disappear always creates excitement in an audience, and the relief at seeing the value restored always draws applause. Magicians play on the mystery of paper and metal, worthless objects in themselves, signifying value. Banknotes can be folded like origami paper and the resulting paper given as gifts, kept as curiosities, or put at the bottom of a jar next to the cash register to encourage tips,” the author notes. Money even has a place in death, other than just the inheritance that a few many hope to receive, the thing families can be split over, whether it is actual or symbolic money that is burned as a gesture to the afterlife. Some spirits are fussy; allegedly the Vietnamese dead demand paper sacrifices in the form of U.S. dollars…This book just keeps on giving knowledge to the reader, even if you didn’t think you wanted any. How about is that for value-for-money; even money has its place in the choice of words and their meanings whether directly or indirectly referring to monetary transactions. Even a missed call – what’s that to do with opportunity and money? For that bit of knowledge you’ll have to read the book, yet it is an interesting, eye-opening and innovative simple thing!Think about money and how you handle it. The author brings it into perspective too in his rather relaxed, inimitable way: “For money: throwing a coin in a busker’s guitar case is different from tossing it; crumpling a bill and leaving it as a tip is different from folding it over once, diagonally; from placing it on the table; from placing it in the hand or, more firmly and deliberately, in the palm. Tossing a bill or coin in a card game or dropping money reverently into a box at church; offering with spite or offering with pity; a quick beep of a missed call to say, I am alive!, or the repeated, insistent beeps of a multiple flasher demanding you call someone back and insinuating—without words, text, or images—that you are a greedy bastard if you don’t. We are already seeing people express themselves with mobile money— using it to conceal transactions from spouses, or to advertise payments within a social group. The repertoires of mobile and money represent a web of use cases not always captured by our common-sense assumptions of what mobile and money are, are for, and can do.”That’s it. You’ve had your lot. Time to cash up. One final money-related reference: buy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127C1AC2WPTXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159YMB08#wasThisHelpful","R127C1AC2WPTXL","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting book, one of those that you might not think you need if you see it momentarily at a bookstore, yet once you open it up and start reading you will soon get hooked and the information just begins to flow. A number of public relations campaigns from the past four decades have been examined, which have undeniably helped shape popular culture and influence public opinion.Naturally, a book of this kind can only give a superficial overview, yet it manages to provide an excellent, engaging summary of what happened, how it happened and perhaps more importantly highlights some of the key takeaway points and skills that can be deployed in other situations. The only real criticism is that it ended too soon and there were too few campaigns under the author’s magnifying glass. One can hope that a volume two, volume three and so on are under consideration, since the concept appears to work very well and it could be extended to become a broader franchise, taking in successful campaigns from other countries.So what campaigns did the author focus on? Margaret Thatcher’s first election, the Tony Blair New Labour years, a fourteen year “repositioning” of the Monarchy, reinventing the Rolling Stones, establishing David Beckham the brand after football, the 2012 Olympic Games, Bono’s Product (RED), Barack Obama’s Presidential dream and a ten year campaign for Dove and “real beauty”. An interesting mix for sure.There’s not a lot more to say. The book is as giving as you let it be. It is not going to necessarily be a “big bang” change-your-life thing, but neither does it promise that. It is much more subtle. It is clearly aimed at those with communications-based professional responsibilities, yet even the curious generalist will get a fair bit out of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSL8KENJ7GDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749475099#wasThisHelpful","R2DSL8KENJ7GDC","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Society does not value its public libraries in the same way as it used to; the library is being forced to change and seeks to remain relevant in today’s different world. Yet a good library, staffed by knowledgeable librarians, can still be important and they can still be part of our lives. They are just serving us in a different way than before.This book argues that the average American has not fell out of love with the library and that they are managing to survive; two out of three Americans are members of public libraries and visit them at least once a year. Of course, user patterns have changed. How many children would go to the public library to conduct homework research, for example, yet this was a staple part of school-life for this reviewer!So the book’s author dons his rose-tinted spectacles at times to examine why Americans have loved their public libraries, as viewed by “regular folk” through newspaper articles, memoirs, biographies and other sources. Views, or expert testimony, from politicians or library professionals have been eschewed. The voice of the user is being allowed to shine, aided at times, it must be said, by a slightly confrontational, argumentative tone. The author’s passion shines through, that much is clear.As you may hope for in a book about libraries, the organisation is excellent with a detailed index and you are positively encouraged to check out other sources of information through the extensive bibliography at the back.All in all, an interesting, sensitive, thought provoking read about a very important institution that, even today, can have its place. You don’t have to have experienced an American library to enjoy this book. You just have to be curious: you get a mix of many different subjects all in one not-so-little book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KL5C0SFZAQ52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X3JJWO#wasThisHelpful","R1KL5C0SFZAQ52","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who would be a digital marketer today? So many channels fighting for your attention, so much demand being placed on your brand and then there is the risk of damaging your carefully produced image. Ensuring that it remains accessible, honest, open and relevant is a challenge. Help is at hand!The authors of this book promise to help you ensure that your brand is present in each space, whilst staying true to its brand purpose – remaining “On Purpose” in other words.The book takes you through the whole process, examining the brand and its purpose and promise as well as helping define and deliver multiple channel customer experiences and cultures that should or would deliver sustainable results. It backs up this advice with a range of practical guidance and case study examples. It was interesting reading the interviews with specific industry leaders and learning the advice they offer up. Nothing they suggest is that unreachable; it just requires a bit of determination, drive and a will to succeed. People often fall over and mess up the simple stuff though…Overall the book was an interesting read but it felt quite difficult to establish a deep connection to it. Some books are like that and others you just fall in love with. It would not be fair to describe this as a love-hate relationship, but a slightly straitened reading experience that is worth the effort (if you find the same feeling as this reviewer).All in all, not a bad book, even with the aforementioned niggles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLB5N8MB8AP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016I91HJE#wasThisHelpful","R1OLB5N8MB8AP7","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no longer enough to confine workplace learning to structured, formal training programmes. Continuous educational development is the mantra de jour; naturally formal learning situations still have their place although there is a greater emphasis on learning as you go on at work.This book examines the world of informal learning within an organisation, offering guidance about how to get the best out of your in-house educational resources through enabling a quality mix of planned, unplanned, self-directed or guided learning to take place. This new way of thinking can be confusing, especially for the older generation who are used to structure and order, yet for an ever-increasing cohort it is quite natural to learn from a YouTube video, a MOOC or with multimodal guidance from a colleague (or even rival!). The sharing economy and ecosystem is second nature to many.Even though to this reviewer the book was not overly revolutionary in nature, it managed to provide a quality, interesting summary of a changing, expanding area. It engaged the reader and provided actionable, inspirational advice that could be implemented in any organisation and backed up with a clear “taking action” section that will help develop and implement a workable action plan for informal learning.Whilst the book was engaging and worthy of a read, at times it started to feel a little defocussed and verbose; a slightly tighter edit might have just made the difference. The layout is clean and engaging, plus the customary in-depth index you’ve learned to love from the publisher means that you can easily jump around and dig deep inside.The book’s price won’t break the bank and your company stands to gain much more than this pitiful investment back in the long run!

"Imperialism – like it or hate it, understand it or wonder what it really is – is brought under the watchful eye of the authors in this fairly specific book, which aims to mix history and international relations together and inform the curious, waiting reader.It is just unfortunate that it failed to gain traction with this reviewer, since the subject is quite interesting on many levels. Imperialism as a term is being applied within many economic, political, cultural and linguistic subjects, yet quite a few people are confused about what it means and how we should view it or respond to it. This book aims to change that and provide a bit of authoritative knowledge infusion at the same time.Unfortunately this is less likely to be a spontaneous “something different”-read for most. Even those who may find a benefit or a need to study it probably must to focus unnecessarily hard. It is by no means a bad book, yet it just felt a little bit too onerous, laboured and less inviting than it could have been. Fortunately the price is not too high; as an expensive book that you can possibly struggle to connect to might just lead to resentment and even less reader focus.The central theme of the book is interesting and there are some insights there, so for many it could be worth the additional overhead to extract the knowledge. A general reader won’t get as much out of it; that may be a shame as with some remodelling it could have broader appeal without compromising on its content quality.Otherwise, there is always a local library…","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0QGVM3UUOAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199397899#wasThisHelpful","R3A0QGVM3UUOAF","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sub-title to this book is “what the ‘experts’ got wrong about the global economy” and seeing that immediately reminded one of a phrase that was popular when this reviewer was young: “expert: x is an unknown quantity and spurt is a drip under pressure.” In many ways, it is a rather apt description of the so-called experts, the masters of the universe, who are acting on our collective behalf.The author seeks to look at why so many experts have failed to understand the global economy, coming out with bold (wrong) predictions or just plain misunderstanding things in recent years. Posing questions such as why did the Eurozone end up with an unemployment rate more than twice than that of the United States and six years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and what caused the prolonged economic failure experienced by the majority of the world’s low- and middle-income countries at the end of the 20th century? It can’t all just be bad luck, one of those things, or something that is hard to explain… can it?The author believes that there have been valid alternatives to economic failure and in most cases those wielding the crystal ball could have read the future better and certainly reacted a lot quicker with a higher degree of confidence and accuracy. Politics and adherence to political dogma comes in for much blame in this interesting, thought-provoking book, yet ignorance, bravado and a closed-mind are also symptoms that have inhabited a fair few who may have had a hand or more in the economic soup. In many cases not only did they burn the soup and make its flavour run out, but also they managed to upend the saucepan, destroy the kitchen and do serious damage to the house at the same time.Mixing economic and political history, current day awareness, opinion and a few provocative fireworks into an interesting, compelling read, you don’t even need to understand it all or agree with it to enjoy the book. Yet you may find a great connection and a meeting of minds, along with rising blood pressure due to the activities and omissions of a few…You may sense the author’s opinions and colours with ease! Punches are not being pulled, egos are not being massaged and neither is academic-neutral language being deployed. Text such as this is crystal clear: “Of all the examples of neoliberal policy failure since the Great Recession, the Eurozone crisis stands out as a work of art. The European authorities who made this mess – the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – known as ‘The Troika’ – provide one of the clearest, large-scale demonstrations in modern times of the damage that can be done when people in high places get their basic macroeconomic policies wrong. That it has happened in a set of high-income economies with previously well-developed democratic institutions makes it even more compelling.” Ouch!Should you believe that the author is presenting “a load of old cobblers” (translation: a technical term, often used to show you disagree with the fundamental argument) you can follow the sources for yourself and see whether the author has an argument you may hold with, or whether you are still of the belief that he must have been “smoking something” to come up with such a fantasy.In any case, it was an interesting read. It gives you food for thought. Anything more than that is a bonus and it may depend on your own perceptions and potential willingness to accept a counterpoint. A worthy consideration to your reading list in any case!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECE28D38WR6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195170180#wasThisHelpful","R3ECE28D38WR6O","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book managed to shame this reviewer; you might reasonably expect a Briton to know something about one of the largest wars that Great Britain has been involved in and understand how members of its then-Empire contributed. No excuses can be given and whilst one was aware that British forces were active in India and other Empire countries, the scope of their contribution and involvement to the war effort was not so known. This book changed that.So much changed because of the war. Maybe change was inevitable in any case, at least as far as India’s relationship to the Empire was concerned, yet when the call came it was prepared to help and sought to do its bit for the war effort. It did a lot more than “a bit” too: viewed in isolation it produced the world’s largest volunteer army in world history with over 2.5 million men. The country also contributed heavily to the war’s logistics chain. India wasn’t unscathed; it had to change a lot to provide the help and by the end of the war quite a lot of lives had been lost both in battle and because of it.The author packs a lot of powerful history into this sensitive, authoritative work. An admirable level of academic neutrality is deployed to let the story tell itself. This is more than just a war history; the author seeks to consider how the Indian subcontinent itself was reshaped by the war as its impact shuddered throughout the country. Was all change good and for whom? What about those who didn’t jump on-board and wholeheartedly want to support someone else’s war?Some of the claims made are shocking to this reader (even if more informed people were aware of it): racial division and segregation was actively practiced in some areas to protect the prestige of the European community. This massive book features an extensive bibliography and index so the reader can dig in as deep as they want, even following the sources if they so require.This book is positively overwhelming. A pleasurable immersion into a subject that is hardly pleasant at its core, yet the underlying stories and actions that came about due to it makes for a fascinating read. A highly recommended book, even if you tend to shy away from war and history titles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AP8BNI9N788H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199753490#wasThisHelpful","R3AP8BNI9N788H","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The food industry today is quite different to the food industry of yesterday; nowadays it is quite common for fresh food to be sent to the other side of the world to meet consumer demand. The supply chain can have special demands and peculiarities that may be unique to the sector, yet some of the solutions found to various problems may be exploitable elsewhere.This book takes a look at the supply chain for the food industry both today and in the future; there is even a bit of history thrown in for good measure too. Innovation is key; customer and industry demand is fast-paced and there is also strong consumer demand for sustainable, ethical and considerate handling of products. The modern customer thinks more than just the quality of the foodstuff and the price paid: it is a lot more than getting something from point A to point B, vaguely on time and on budget.Take this example from the book that demonstrates the potential chain complexity: “Fish caught in the North Sea or off the western coast of the United States is frozen and shipped to China where it is defrosted, filleted, packed and refrozen before reaching retail shelves in Europe and the United States. The only reason for the supply chain being this complicated is to save on operating costs, but this also brings more risks into the chain.”The author sets out to give a wide range of information in an easy-to-digest form to both experienced industry participant and newcomer alike, looking at topics such as food sourcing, technology trends, food security, future challenges and global logistics. A fair balance and tone is achieved.As with other Kogan Page books, everything is clearly laid out, well signposted and features an extensive index and bibliography for your future deep-diving into the source material.In all, a credible, interesting look at a sector that can put special demands on its supply chain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BW262CO6PLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749473649#wasThisHelpful","R26BW262CO6PLA","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here is a concise, “get started” practical handbook that aims to offer guidance to those who may need to plan and host events.The reader, who is probably working within public relations, event management or a related area, is promised a quick guide to the world of events and event planning before going deep into subjects such as location selection, content, logistics, budgeting, procurement and evaluation.It is a bit of a mixed bag, as it mixes up theory and academic models whilst aiming towards practical matters with examples, case studies and many external resources. There did appear to be a bit of an identity crisis within the pages, leading to a fair bit of text feeling as if it was padding and overly basic and not keeping with the rest of the book. Fortunately, the book is not overly expensive; so one could even ignore the irrelevancies, but should one really need to go to this extreme?Yet time after time this reviewer really does wonder who the book is aimed at! Some of the nuggets of information are interesting, fascinating even, but it is far from being the go-to guide that it wishes to be. Neither is it a book that you may throw at a student or absolute beginner, even though they may get something out of it. In quite a few places it seemed to get an award for stating the bleeding obvious in a particularly banal way, such as: “Make sure the choice of location and venue fits with the objectives and style of your event, as well as the image and reputation of the client and their organization.”Some parts, such as the art of searching for the right venue, feel to be on the right track and lift the mood of an otherwise grumpy reviewer. Here one could start to sense some value and validation of the book. Other parts, telling about event execution that features real-world examples such as the use of tablets on each guest table, synchronised with event information, menus and sponsors’ messages could be worth the price of the book itself. After all, it might just need one good tip to make your next event go even better…Sadly, overall one has to be fairly neutral about the book. It set out with much promise but didn’t deliver. To use an event analogy, the execution of the event failed to match the advertising hype. The event was not a total washout, but neither was it something you may whole-heartedly endorse or rush to sit through again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H9LE36OTXZWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749471395#wasThisHelpful","R2H9LE36OTXZWG","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To a non-American with only a passing familiarity of the Constitution of the United States, this was a fascinating book; one can only imagine how this would be a powerful, eye-opening, depressing and concerning read to any American who still clings to the notion of democracy and who values what the Founding Fathers had written down.Today, it seems, that the Constitution is often viewed as a historical curiosity, something for the government (of whatever party colour) to talk warmly of when they wish, whilst trying to find legal loopholes and scheming to “reinterpret” pesky bits that get in the way. Others with vested interests try and chip away at the document, trying to leverage their particular desired viewpoint into the Constitution and its amendments.The Constitution has been tried and tested, battered and pushed, in many monumental court cases to consider matters such as slavery, segregation of the races, legalised abortion and even to examine the role of government itself. Some parts are well known, even to foreigners, such as Americans and their love of weapons – as enshrined in the second amendment to the Constitution. Other parts are known about due to the linguistic gymnastics and “don’t care what the world thinks” approach that was seemingly deployed to justify keeping people at Guantanamo Bay, citing technicalities to justify not doing something rather than doing the “Right Thing”, namely giving those accused of serious crimes the right to a trial and the protection of the Constitution. It can certainly polarise opinion.So this is a fascinating book, even to someone who doesn’t understand it all; to someone who doesn’t know the history, doesn’t have a feeling or pride in the Constitution. The author used the term “constitutional personae” to define differing viewpoints and approaches taken to the Constitution and they get given specific treatment in the book’s chapters. Heroes are willing to invoke the Constitution to invalidate state and federal legislation. Soldiers defer to the actions of the political branches. Minimalists favour small steps and only incremental change. Mutes prefer not to decide difficult questions.Questions galore. The author poses many open-ended questions, writing: “Is the Constitution living or dead? Should judges follow the original understanding of the Constitution, even if the original understandings suggest weak protection for individual rights? Should judges defer to political majorities, even if they appear to invade such rights? Should judges follow longstanding traditions, even if they seem oppressive? Should they attempt to improve democratic processes – for example, by giving special protection to the right to vote and the right to free speech? Should they offer moral readings of the founding document – for example, by invoking the best understandings of equality and liberty? Should they pay attention to social movements, and try to adopt what is best in them? The differences among competing theories of constitutional interpretation are of course fundamental. But if we investigate the arc of constitutional history, we will discover another set of differences. They involve disparate Constitutional Personae – judicial roles and self-presentations that sharply separate judges as well as those who comment on their work.”It is quite probable that readers will reach their own conclusion to the questions raised. Maybe no side will concede ground, although the wise reader would be better informed after reading this book and gaining an additional perspective; even if they don’t necessarily admit it.This is a relatively short, but powerfully incisive book. If it can awaken interest in a foreigner who will never be influencing American politics and society, just think what it could do for someone who should care about what is, after all, the most important document in the country. It made and defined the country…","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252LVFSUI4TDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190222670#wasThisHelpful","R252LVFSUI4TDZ","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For quite a few years China’s “expansionist policy” and global ambition has been the subject of many press headlines. The country, it is said, has visions of empire, seeking foreign outposts with the aim of supplying food and other raw materials to satisfy its own growing demand. Africa is one key area, it is claimed, and large chunks of the country have already been sold to Chinese companies. Is this true?Well the author seems to treat such ambitious, intriguing and possibly inflammatory stories with a large degree of scepticism. If the country has been trying to buy up huge tracts of Africa, to employ predominantly Chinese workers who will grow and ship food back, it either has not done such a great job thus far or it has been incredibly successful at hiding its endeavours.Certainly it appears that the author has done her research. All of the claims investigated are supported by extensive sources. There is nothing to suggest that the evidence presented is not correct. Many news reports and claims do get debunked in what appears to be a comprehensive manner.  It does seem amazing that so many reports could be so wrong, although as the author notes if a respected news source reports a claim, there is a tendency for it to be echoed around the world as fact.How or why have so many people seemingly got so muddled up, or to use a slightly off-colour British phrase “arse about face”? The author notes that Chinese farming investments are in fact “surprisingly” limited and land acquisitions modest; China exports more food to Africa than it imports. African governments are generally desperately seeking foreign investment (no matter what they may say to the domestic audience) and China, like others, has its fair share of pioneering business explorers, yet the limited, tentative steps made so far have hardly been successful or large-scale.What are the motives for those who may be pushing a false agenda?  If even the economist of the African Development Bank will author a report claiming China is the biggest “land grabber” in the world, surely in Africa they should know the real truth? The author seems to be knocking down the claims like pins at a bowling alley. As the author writes: “The first belief, echoed in the chief economist’s statement, is that the Chinese have actually acquired very large areas of farmland in Africa. Many media stories have featured Chinese companies (or, more commonly, simply ‘China’ or ‘the Chinese’) as central players in African land acquisitions. Second, it is widely believed that the Chinese government is leading the effort to acquire land in Africa as part of a grand plan, using its state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds.  Third, the conventional wisdom holds that the Chinese have developed a voracious appetite for African grain. Finally, many believe that the Chinese have sent (or plan to send) large numbers of their own farmers to settle in the continent. For example, The Economist newspaper repeated (without endorsing) a report that more than a million Chinese farmers were cultivating crops in Africa.”The author is adamant – “None of the stories above turned out to be true.” China’s policies talk about increasing foreign investment (but so do many other countries) but nothing has been discovered to suggest there is a plan for massive, large-scale investment in land or African agriculture. The author notes “…surprisingly few of the Chinese investments headlined in media stories have actually taken place. No one has yet identified a village full of Chinese farmers anywhere on the continent.”For the investments and trials that have taken place, the outcomes have often turned out to be euphemistically described as “problematic”; many myths are circulating as facts, ambitious plans transform to meagre realities and perhaps a lot of hot air has been expended by parties with vested interests to pump matters up.Large, structural and practical problems exist, particularly in African agriculture, that won’t be solved overnight. Some of the investments made are speculative, some come from people with no agricultural background and definitely with no state-provided finance.  “Why does Africa import so much food, when it has some of the world’s largest expanses of arable land? The simple answer is technology: Europe’s 18th century agricultural revolution has yet to reach much of rural Africa. With 54 countries, the continent has an enormous variety, and no country’s story is exactly the same as another’s. Yet overall, the statistics are striking. Some 65 per cent of ploughing, cultivating and harvesting operations rely solely on human muscle – no animal traction or machinery. Up to 20 per cent of harvests rot in poor storage or are lost to pests, compared to only two per cent in the United States,” notes the author.  It hardly sounds a prime investment opportunity; even with the entire might of the Chinese state possibly lurking in the shadows.How is there so much confusion? The author quite diplomatically states it as “In some cases, a Chinese firm was interested, but the investment still failed to go forward. In others, however, those compiling the databases mistakenly tagged an investment as a Chinese land acquisition when it was actually a company from another country. They labelled an initial statement of interest or a memorandum of understanding as a signed contract, and failed to follow up. There was almost no investigative reporting on these cases – journalists repeated them, but almost never inquired further. Surprisingly, as we will see, some researchers did go to Africa to investigate the most sensational cases, yet their published research was not picked up by the hundred members of the International Land Coalition, which in April 2012 still included in their database debunked Chinese “land acquisitions” in Africa totalling nearly 3 million hectares.”There’s more: “More to the point: the Internet is a wonderful tool, but it creates a challenge for those seeking to know the real dimensions of phenomena like foreign land acquisitions in far-away places. As we saw in the case of Mozambique, poorly-checked stories can multiply, with fiction popping up as fact in books and articles by writers who assume, because it appeared in a well-regarded newspaper like The Economist, or The Guardian, or a respected website hosted by a top-ranked think tank, it must be true. Furthermore, we now live in an era of ‘big data’ and ‘killer facts.’ In the social sciences, many students learn that as long as they have access to a dataset, they can write dissertations about development without ever visiting a developing country.”Of course, this could all be an elaborate cover story, being set up on the orders of Beijing. The balance of probabilities and a cup of strong coffee tend to point in the author’s favour, however.To the question “Have the Chinese acquired large areas of farmland in Africa?” the author answers: “No – or at least, not yet. If Chinese companies had actually acquired all the land they were alleged to have acquired since 2000, they would have ‘grabbed’ nearly 6 million hectares, just under one per cent of all of the arable land on the continent. Yet as we have seen, Chinese agribusinesses have actually acquired very little land in Africa. Even including all the farms acquired in the 1990s, and the GMG Global plantations in West Africa, Chinese companies still hold fewer than 250,000 hectares of African land, an area roughly equivalent to twice the size of New York City. Discouraged by poor infrastructure, political instability, and the sober realization that profits were likely to prove more elusive than hoped, Chinese firms came, explored, and then went elsewhere.”Will they return? Maybe that depends on the pace and willingness for change in individual countries.This book certainly was an engaging, eye-opening read that appears to throw many buckets of cold water on a narrative that many perhaps want to believe is true, to fit pre-ordained opinions and viewpoints. The reader does not even need to care about African or Chinese politics and agriculture to find this a different, passionate and informative book that could give them literary company for many evenings. The book does not seek to portray China as a total innocent who only wants to focus on its own country, even though it struggles to do that at the best of times presently. It was all really fascinating and whilst it can diminish the reader’s “global-marching views” of China, it can and does further act as a wake-up call to many African countries to improve their own lot and that of their inhabitants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YIYZXK9JN374/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019939685X#wasThisHelpful","R2YIYZXK9JN374","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will drinking a glass of cold, sparkling soda be soon the equivalent of smoking: you are a social pariah in the eyes of many, whilst providing a source of income for the producer and taxing government alike? You might not be able to draw a direct comparison since you are less likely to be hooked with an occasional glass of Coca-Cola, yet becoming a regular “hooked” consumer can have its side effects. There’s a whole world of soda politics that you possibly had never imagined.This is an interesting book that looks, without recourse to hysteria or hyperbole, at the world of soda drinks, the role they play in our society and their real downside as these products contribute to poor dental hygiene, higher calorie intake, obesity and type-2 diabetes. Clearly a glass won’t harm you, but several glasses a day or more?The author takes a forensic look at how the soda drinks industry works to get us hooked. Advertising is heavily used to make drinking soda seem normal, as normal as drinking a glass of milk or water. Would your football stadium hot dog be the same with a glass of water? What about a visit to the cinema, if you took milk with your over-priced popcorn? Carrot juice to accompany your hamburger at a fast-food joint?Even after any health issues that can follow there is a dark side. Why would the soda drinks industry be pumping large amounts of money to lobby against changes that could impact on their bottom line? They may shout loudly about their ethical policies and corporate social responsibility, whilst shovelling money at lobbyists to head off initiatives that might stop their products being marketed towards the most vulnerable (children) in places where they gather such as schools or cinemas.The author carefully comes out with her arguments. It is not a quick “all soda is bad” rant. Measured change is possible. Nobody is suggesting that all sodas should be banned, yet they are relatively cheap to produce and sold at a high profit. Alternative formulations and ingredients could be used to offer a more healthy soda, ideal for consumption in moderation, but that costs; both in terms of direct profit and potential sales. No wonder there’s a lack of demand to change things?There is change but it does not come from “Big Soda”. The author notes, talking about public advocacy and campaigning: “…sodas are, in public health jargon, ‘low hanging fruit’ – easy targets. They contain sugars but nothing else of redeeming nutritional value. This explains in part why sodas are an example of successful advocacy. Soda consumption is falling. Americans are not buying Coke and Pepsi the way they used to, and are only partially replacing them with other sugary drinks. This did not happen accidentally. As any soda company executive will tell you, health advocacy has become the single greatest threat to company profits.” Yet this is not being replicated worldwide and the pace of change is slow. Maybe a wise company would seize this tidal wave and change course whilst it can. Corporate intransigency, on the other hand…Think what you pay for your soda, take a typical 12 ounce serving (circa 330ml for those who use metric). The author mentions how a drink is made and the role ice has, before giving some stunning figures: “Ice performs four critical functions: it chills the drink, improves the taste, dilutes the ingredients, and reduces the retailer’s cost. If you pack ice to the brim, less than half the volume of your drink comes from the soda mix. Once ice is added, these ingredients are so diluted that the final cost of fountain drinks to the seller – including the cup, lid, and straw – comes to just over one cent per ounce. This explains why many places are so generous with free refills. Even though refills usually have less ice than the initial drink and end up costing the seller more, they are still highly profitable. Convenience stores, restaurants, sports facilities, and movie theatres make so much money on fountain sodas that they can well be generous: a typical return is more than 80 cents on the dollar.”It can get worse, notes the author: “The larger the soda, the more sugar and calories it contains even if diluted with ice. But larger sizes do more than that. First, they encourage greater consumption. Researchers find people to consume more from large containers than small ones, even when they leave some behind. Second, large portions are confusing. People given larger servings tend to underestimate how much they are eating to a much greater extent than when given smaller portions. Smaller sugary drinks are healthier for three reasons: they provide less sugar and fewer calories. They discourage excessive intake. And they promote more realistic estimates of the amounts consumed.”This reviewer likes a soda as must as the next person and even though you know the calorie count and have read the nutritional differences between a regular and light product it can be hard to change. Seeing the size of some of the drinks containers on sale at cinemas leads you to boggle. Sometimes one even struggles to finish the regular drink at a hamburger restaurant and who wants to take a few mouthfuls home; the obvious solution is to leave it, yet how many take the common route of “finishing it off” with a few gulps… tick, tick, tick goes the calorie counter…One cannot add much more. There are two sides to every argument and the author notes this, witness the mass of reading notes, bibliography and deep index. If you really disbelieve a point, the author openly shows where she got the information from and you can follow the chain back and review matters.For this reader, at least, it was fascinating, essential reading. Maybe it won’t change his limited soda intake but it sure won’t expand it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRD0KZZBMYH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190263431#wasThisHelpful","R3BRD0KZZBMYH7","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every company needs “operations” and operational management at the heart of its business for fairly obvious reasons, yet rather too many companies fail to view this as something that deserves to be managed with a strategy. This book seeks to change that.The authors believe that by strategically utilising a company’s operations, a company can transition and up its game, possibly leading to greater profits, greater business, increased customer satisfaction and many other positive metrics. It need not necessarily cost a lot more to implement either and it could save money in many cases.By highlighting successful companies that have transformed their businesses, the authors seek to show that there is a gap between the accepted theory and devolved practice. As well as acting as cheerleaders-in-chief for this desired change, they also provide frameworks that can help integration and take-up. The world might be your oyster with a bit of focussed, operational strategy to join the other dots on the corporate roadmap.The book’s message itself won’t be new; for example academics studying operations and supply chain management this is not “rocket science” even if this is a very good, clear introduction to the subject. For those who it could really matter to, it has the potential to be a powerful (metaphorical) kick up the backside. The wise recipient of the kick may realise why it has happened, the less-wise may look astounded, but maybe the message will seep through eventually. The authors managed to make a book that serves several reader groups at the same time; the generalist can improve their knowledge; the academic can get a clear understanding to the problem in relatively few words and the professional who is doing this stuff for their day job could (or should) understand the importance of the subject and the necessity for change.If you suspect that your company is not making the most out of its operations functions then you should strongly consider this book. If you believe you are already utilising them to the max, maybe anyway you should take a second opinion with this book?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU74YBY0YI9F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749473312#wasThisHelpful","RU74YBY0YI9F2","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A book that promises to help boost our understanding of neuroscience with the aim of showing mindful management, trust and effective workplace leadership would surely be expected to grab the reader by their shoulders and really steer them through the subject. So why did this book fail to follow, in part, what it seeks to teach the reader?It is not that this is a bad book. It just didn’t show “literary leadership” and win the reader over; a reader who is interested in this subject and underlying science. The book sets out to show how our rational-conscious and emotional-unconscious can function in working life, leading to the revelation that less than one in three employees are actively engaged in their work.As well as a bit of theory and alleged motivation, the author promises a range of “simple but powerful” techniques for “becoming mindful and connective and for getting ‘out of control’.” It went through the various motions of explaining and identifying issues before offering up a solution, but if felt rather perfunctory in its execution and that was not its intention one can be sure. The author’s credentials seem impressive, so it feels perhaps more frustrating and disappointing that the book just did not capitalise on this captive, receptive reader and really hammer home its message. It failed to fully communicate; it felt a bit like an old television signal fading in and out. The good, clear bits felt very good; it was just the rest that got in the way of the experience.This book could be something that you potentially could form a connection to and it could still be something you may get a lot out of if you force yourself.

"To some, this book may appear to be heresy or denying the inevitable, no matter what they would like to otherwise believe. Yet can this book be incredibly incisive or just stating what might be the obvious fact – China will NOT rule the world.Is the author criticising the new clothes of the emperor? Maybe China will not become the world-dominating superpower many fear, expect or await. Time will tell, yet nonetheless the author offers up an interesting analysis and forecast through a mix of politics, sociology, business and history. Four key points are taken up that, the author claims, show that China’s current meteoric growth is transient. There are said to be misconceptions about China’s boom, namely that that China could undermine orthodoxy by offering an alternative model of growth; that China is radically altering power relations between the East and the West; that China is capable of diminishing the global power of the United States; and that the Chinese economy would restore the world’s wealth after the 2008 financial crisis.Many have pointed towards China’s present “financial hold” on the West due to it being the low-cost workshop of the world, sucking in masses of foreign currency; yet many point out that whilst China could dump the Dollar and create a world meltdown in the process, it is in the country’s own interests (and especially its elites’ interest) to maintain the status quo and not do anything rash. In more recent months many cracks have appeared in Chinese financial markets and structures; is the economy over-heating and what may occur if things start to split. China is probably trying to rapidly paddle and maintain the status quo for its own selfish reasons; at the same time the rest of the world can watch on and hope…The author has put together a gripping read about a fascinating subject within an engaging, credible package. It manages to be accessible to the generalist reader whilst being a nuanced, actionable book for the academic or specialist. It is not screeching hysterics but provides a fairly matter-of-fact assessment with a lot of referenced sources so the sceptical, curious or argumentative reader can dig deeper as required.There is a lot to this book; at times it felt overwhelming, but maybe it is the equivalent of a good Chinese buffet dinner; a lot of things for everyone and it is good to offer more than most people could consume. It was an interesting, pleasurable read and it could be good to put this book into a time capsule and look back in the future to see just how right on the money the author was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4JQXG7A2Q6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231164181#wasThisHelpful","RA4JQXG7A2Q6E","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The role of a project sponsor, especially in a larger organisation is often misunderstood: it can be a mix of customer, advocate, supporter, firefighter and key influencer. The sponsor may not involve themselves with the day-to-day matters, that’s what the project manager does, yet they are the number one cheerleader who should be pushing the upside and hopefully eradicating any downside or rocks in the road to success. This book offers what it says is a guide to successful project sponsorship: it appears to deliver.In many ways, a book like this should be superfluous as it is hardly containing the secret formula to eternal youth; yet far too many projects stumble, collapse or have major problems because the sponsor’s eye is taken off the ball. The project sponsor can direct and focus the beam that the project manager should be managing. Some projects and supporting organisations are worse than others; government projects tend to suffer especially. Projects ordained by committee, each pulling in different directions can be hazardous territory. It doesn’t help that often the companies hired for project management duties cannot (or will not) influence; they are getting paid anyway…Whether a project can be saved through a book like this remains to be seen, as even though the book can be very good, the audience may be less receptive to its charms. One can hope, one must try; lead by good example and all that. The author takes four key principles towards successful project sponsorship and uses them as effective tent pegs, building around them a range of practical, actionable examples and suggested good practice instead of purely dry, theoretical models, rules and strategies. This is a book for doing and getting things done.This book is an adaptation of a Dutch book, five editions of which have appeared since 2003 and obviously it has been updated, enhanced and polished over time. Something must be working in the author’s favour as one has not heard that the books are being used to fill gaps in dyke walls. Certainly when looking through this book, it offered up a positive vibe, delivering credible and effective messaging to the reader which could be implemented within their own organisation. In places you may think it is overly simplistic, but that is not a bad thing. It is necessary to get to the basics to even answer what is a project or what is a project sponsor, as many people have wild, differing ideas and from often the most simple of misunderstandings can the bigger problems grow.It was an engaging read. It was not patronising but supportive; thought provoking and positively reactive. For those who admit that they might need to brush up on their project sponsorship skills it could be a little goldmine. Even project managers could benefit from seeing things from a slightly different perspective too. Sadly, those who need it the most, might remain blind to it because of their own stubbornness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9C49AA1YTDLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749474246#wasThisHelpful","R9C49AA1YTDLY","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Billed as highlighting the economics of manipulation and deception, this book provides, albeit with a slightly over-used ‘device’ a very interesting look at how we are being cheated by the invisible, free-market hand that many economists assure us works for our common good.Can there be only winners or, for every winner must there be at least one losing counterpart? The authors must know their stuff, as you don’t get Nobel prizes (for economics) out of cereal packages. They provide a compelling view to often perceived wisdom, reinforcing perhaps many thoughts that mere mortals hold, or perceive; yet maybe we don’t have the power to change and those that hold the power have no desire to change…The authors’ central point is that as long as there is profit to be made, sellers will systematically exploit our psychological weaknesses and our ignorance through manipulation and deception. This is not a dry economics textbook, as many real world examples are offered up to highlight the contention made with a fair amount of humour. It manages to avoid being a tin foil hat-wearer’s vision of apocalypse and everything being controlled by a small cabal of the elite.“We spend our money up to the limit, and then worry about how to pay the next month’s bills. The financial system soars, then crashes. We are attracted, more than we know, by advertising. Our political system is distorted by money. We pay too much for gym memberships, cars, houses, and credit cards. Drug companies ingeniously market pharmaceuticals that do us little good, and sometimes are downright dangerous,” notes the book’s publicity material. Make no mistake, even though this is a comparatively jovial, lightweight book aimed clearly at the generalist, it is backed by serious minds, passing on a serious message with a serious level of research so there’s a lot for the non-generalist to get their teeth into, if they just will.At times this book felt a little overwhelming, perhaps due to the over-use of the ph-device and some of its style, yet taken a chapter-at-a-time, in smaller chunks, it seemed a totally different book. Perceptions, perceptions! For those who care, there is a mass of reference notes and an extensive bibliography, so you can dig deeper through the source materials at will.The authors note that they admire the free-market system but just don’t like how it is serving people, writing: “The economic system is filled with trickery, and everyone needs to know that. We all have to navigate this system in order to maintain our dignity and integrity, and we all have to find inspiration to go on despite craziness all around us. We wrote this book for consumers, who need to be vigilant against a multitude of tricks played on them. We wrote it for businesspeople, who feel depressed at the cynicism of some of their colleagues and trapped into following suit out of economic necessity. We wrote it for government officials, who undertake the usually thankless task of regulating business. We wrote it for the volunteers, the philanthropists, the opinion leaders, who work on the side of integrity. And we wrote it for young people, looking ahead to a lifetime of work and wondering how they can find personal meaning in it.”Some of the stories featured will make you despair, such as how focussed people can be on gambling that slot machine players would continue feeding the machines in a casino, oblivious to a person lying on the floor suffering from a heart attack. Some of the stories will have your eyes wide open and on stalks. Some may just sap your will to live and make you want to find a cave and hide in it. Yet maybe, just maybe, there is hope…?If those who have it better in life are still worrying about making ends meet, how do those with nothing cope? You read stories about the poorest of the poor in some of the less-developed parts of the world and they appear to be relatively happy with what little they have; it seems unbelievable when viewed with our western, first-world eyes. The authors write: “Most adults, even in rich countries, go to bed at night worried about how to pay the bills. Economists think that it is easy for people to spend according to a budget. But they forget that even if we are careful 99 per cent of the time, the remaining one per cent, when we act as if ‘money does not matter,’ can undo all that prior rectitude. And businesses are keenly aware of those one per cent moments. They target the events in our lives when love (or other motivations) trumps our budgetary caution. For some, this is an annual Christmas potlatch. For others, it occurs at rites of passage: such as weddings (where the wedding mags assure brides that the ‘average wedding’ costs almost one half of annual per capita GDP); funerals (where the parlour director carefully lays out the caskets to induce the choice, for example, of the Monaco ‘with Sea Mist polished finish, interior richly lined in 600 Aqua Supreme velvet, magnificently quilted and shirred’); or births (where Babies “R” Us will give a ‘personal registry advisor’).”So many examples are given that can have the effect of hitting you in the face with a hammer. How health clubs ‘manipulate’ us to savings that cost us more, how we stuff nearly a third of our daily calorific intake in a single snack, how we felt adding an egg to a mix made is creative and how statistics can be presented to appear to show one thing whilst carefully ignoring what they should be telling. Remember all those wonderful statistics and ratings showing how securities are a slam-dunk investment? Remember how Enron was wallowing in profits? Statistics, accountancy sleight of hand, and much more besides. Who is the fool?Overall the authors have put together a very good book. In an ideal world there’d be no need for such warnings, but our world is not ideal. It is a book that is capable of giving a lot and leaving many lasting impressions; albeit sadly for the wrong reasons (but that’s the purpose of this book, so don’t shoot the messenger).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFXAJEN4WU11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691168318#wasThisHelpful","R2EFXAJEN4WU11","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quite specialised book for a specialist audience, yet even the more curious generalist could get something out of it if they try. This book is effectively a secret look into the toolkit of a coach, giving 50 top tools that can help transform a coaching situation.The authors set out to provide the reader with the right mix of techniques, preparative aids and analytics assistance to really provide a powerful “coaching experience” for clients. You may consider yourself to be a top-flight coach already, but any elite sports trainer will tell you, keeping an eye on what other experts do can yield benefits as, at this level, even a marginal improvement can move mountains. For the rest of us, this book will help you up your game.There is something for everyone; maybe you need to tighten up your provision of the relationship, perhaps you must work on increasing your client’s confidence and enhancing their performance or maybe you are not so hot on developing a leadership style. From start to finish, you are given it all. You still have to implement it, react to the information and deliver. This is a coach for a coach, in other words. A guide, not a rigid template.If you don’t know what you are doing then either you are a coach who needs a lot more practical help and education or a general reader; here this book might be a bit too overwhelming but perseverance and a positive attitude can pay off. For those who are more experienced in the art of coaching, it might be a little goldmine.That’s it really. Short and sweet. It seems to do what it says on the tin and then some more. It can either deliver major renovation assistance to your coaching skillset or just let you further polish an already polished operation. Either way, what do you have to fear?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PGKI8RHHJARE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749473444#wasThisHelpful","R1PGKI8RHHJARE","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s true; the most dangerous move in business is the failure to make a move. If you do nothing you won’t progress and may fail; if you move you still may fail but at least you’ve tried – within reason therefore, it is good to “think big, act bigger”.The author is an acclaimed industry veteran who has the scares to prove it, and here he seeks to inspire and get people thinking and doing things. At least if you try, you’ll never wonder what could have happened if you had just dared to try. This is one of the better “business inspiration and motivation” type books and boy is there a lot of them on the market. All books of this type can be very personal affairs – you need to establish a personal connection with the author’s words and have faith – yet some seem to be less credible, more superfluous and harder to gel with than others. Even with the expected alpha-male bombastic, egocentric positivity that comes with this book, it did seem to be more genuine, heart-felt and actual than many others.The usual aims and goals are offered up; there’s nothing overly untoward or special here. The author’s experiences and successes are mixed in liberally around the advice and counsel on offer. A lot of humour and the author’s character shone through. Maybe part of the attraction for this reviewer is the perceived less strait-laced, possibly irreverent approach taken by the author. How many books would, after all, overtly state that you may “…achieve the next big thing by being a little pig-headed and irrational”? It grew on you. In fact the relative unconventional, direct approach taken tipped this over from being a reasonable three-star book to a great four-star one and potentially the sky is the limit.Some of the author’s stories might confuse the reader, letting them question the point of adding them, such as the author being hired to give a speech and then being told he would be fined (his fee reduced) for every utterance of 21 words. All because a bit of grown-up language (a list was not given, but the inference was that the list did not have racist or sexist terms, so it probably had things like the “B” and “F” word. Clearly you wouldn’t or shouldn’t drop the F word on a live CNBC broadcast, but in a closed audience of adults in a high-intensity, passionate speech it might not be entirely unjustified. Clearly you wouldn’t open the speech with “Hello, I’m f…g glad to be here today. What a f…g nightmare the airport was, the b…ds lost my case and gave me s..t when I complained”.The author tells the story: “This company, an otherwise terrific software business, couldn’t deal with it. They were willing to pay my speaking fee but wanted to fine me $500 for each time I used one of the words on the list, up to a total fine of $7,500. I counted on my fingers (math is not my strong suit) how many bad words that gave me: 15. Then I looked at the list. There were words on there I would never think of using. It would be very difficult for me to work them all in, but I love a challenge. I accepted the deal with every intention of using up all $7,500. Forget for a moment that the company never discussed any of this with me before sending over these stipulations. (Want me to tone it down? Just ask me. Don’t bring in the lawyers first.) What I couldn’t figure out was why this company wanted me to speak in the first place if this is what they expected. I am an open book. No one hires a dog like me and wonders why he doesn’t meow. I am not effective or for everyone, and I know it, but as a result, no one ever complains that they got something they were not expecting. Why would they want me to change who I was on a fundamental level?” Makes sense? Be yourself, be genuine and don’t be something you are not.If you take the time to read this book you will find a lot of things that you may secretly agree with, yet it might not be “acceptable” to highlight and amplify them. After all, everyone uncritically loves TED talks or what? Franchise trendy food stores are just doing a great job? A consistent, uniform product must be superior?You can warm to the author and his style. Even relatively mundane issues about interacting with an assistant can seem one thing but be another when you focus on the detail and consider why a certain course of action was taken. All over, for example, a simple question about a colour or monochrome print out. Be different? The author wrote: “You know, I’ve been called pig-headed a number of times, and I’ve never taken offence, because I find pigs smart and delicious. But until this book, I never looked up the actual definition of pig-headed, which according to Merriam-Webster means ‘refusing to do what other people want or to change your opinion or the way you do something: very stubborn.’ Synonyms for pig-headed include everything from ‘headstrong’ to ‘opinionated’ to ‘wilful.’ I’m good with being those things when necessary, especially when considering the opposites of pig-headed: ‘acquiescent, compliant, pliable, relenting, and yielding’.”If you let it, this book will give generously a mix of humour, insight, tragedy, shock and a mass of actionable information. It might not lead you by the nose to be a squillionaire, but it can help transform you in ways you had not considered where necessary, as well as the usual “boring business attributes” that are a given “good to improve if you can”.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQS90UW4QCI7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599185741#wasThisHelpful","RQS90UW4QCI7L","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What went wrong? Companies had great ideas that could possibly disrupt a market and lead them to great riches, yet something just didn’t fire in the hearts and minds of those who should have came rushing with their proverbial wallets in hand. This book looks at this frustrating sector of business life and seeks to offer a strategy to help others reframe or reboot their business ideas if necessary.Sometimes it might be the simplest things that have sent you down the wrong path. Other times it might just be the wrong place at the wrong time. It can be something else too. Of course, you don’t have to have had a failed business idea (or entire business) to reap the benefits of this book. If you do, it might give it a second chance, yet selling those new-fangled fax machines is no longer an option… If you haven’t shot your bullet yet, maybe the book can act as a sanity check to help you overcome problems that you have not experienced but might. In any case, does it hurt to further stress test your assumptions and expectations?The author believes that her strategies will help companies avoid stagnation and disappointment, allowing them to focus and “… see the difference between facts and beliefs, impossible and possible, and problems and opportunities. The shift in how you see things changes everything.” This is not a business rescue-style book in the traditional sense, yet it is more than a business refresh or business reboot guide. It is a careful mix of so many things. When you consider the price of this book and what you are getting, it can really be a no-brainer unless you are absolutely, definitely sure that you have a slam-dunk success on your hands. Even then, are you really sure? Even Apple can slightly release a less than perfect, err, Apple…The book was quite a refreshing read and pleasantly different. The humour was questionable at times (but not in an inappropriate way – no “wardrobe malfunctions” are to be found here). The author also believes that having a company is optional; even private individuals stand to gain from her advice and counsel, noting: “…anyone who feels stuck in any area of their life and needs to reframe their mind-set to get out of that rut would benefit from the read. It doesn’t matter if your problem is big or small, life- or work-related, or in your neighbourhood or halfway around the world.”Part of the author’s determination and focus is attributed to her Indian heritage and parental influences. Even if there is an element of humour or chiding, you can sense her passion and pride in this and no doubt parental influences had a positive part to play too. After all, her parents made her. As part of her background show-and-tell the author explains how she was always asking questions as a young child, even about possibly out-of-bounds matters such as her place of worship. Such determined questioning seems to have been a sign of things to come.“I started by asking why there were separate entrances and seating areas for females and males. I grew up with boys in school and around the neighbourhood, and I wanted to sit with my friends. He told me that the genders had to be separated so that the women didn’t distract the men. The idea was that if they separated the genders, the men would focus on the sermons and not be ‘lured’ by the seductive women. (I believe my precocious teenage words were ‘Why can’t you just get rid of the men who can’t focus? Seems like you’re solving for the symptom, not the problem.’) I think this is where my passion for truly understanding the problem and reframing it as an opportunity came from,” wrote the author. This reviewer was also encouraged (as a child) to ask questions, which sometimes led to questions his parents probably rather wished hadn’t been uttered, especially to strangers, yet if you make the offer…“Asking questions was my way of breaking the rules, challenging the expected, daring myself to do more, and creating a world that let me reframe problems as opportunities to come up with something cool, new, and different. Now, I never feel like I have to pick A or B. If I can’t find what I am looking for, I keep trying to find other options. I’m not thinking about the constraints; instead, I’m asking ‘What do I want? What do I need to do to get there? What’s important to me? What am I unwilling to compromise?” wrote the author, giving a good idea about how she thinks and approaches a problem.The wise reader should be alert to the following sentence. This book is more than a “business rescue”-type thing. If you let it, it can open your mind to a lot of other elements and, if necessary, serve as a springboard to further research, as you will be inspired. User interface design, human behaviours, usability, product design and much more besides awaits you. In many ways the “business rescue” side pails into insignificance.There is not much more to add. Looks can be deceiving and the first impression of this book was blown away. It became something much more than what one first feared and expected. It was a nice read, even for the humour, the outlook on life and the general stick-your-nose-out-type approach. It is lightweight yet powerful; an ideal thing for a commute or flight if you don’t fancy a bit of bedtime reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZD2GYDDH8LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619613182#wasThisHelpful","R1CZD2GYDDH8LP","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For how long have we been told that hierarchies are crumbling, whether it is in the world of work or in our social lives. We are increasingly going direct, cutting out the middleman or intermediary. Our world is increasingly becoming a flat world, the author of this book observes.We cannot throw away the old skills and techniques used to navigate and collaborate through the hierarchy – a typical vertical hierarchy – as we still need them as we move along the flatter, horizontal world. After all, we may be doing it and more of it ourselves; so we must know what we are doing and streamline or maximise our actions. We also need to think about other travellers in this flat world, ensuring that any interactions they may make with us and our companies are as smooth as possible. It is in all of our interests in so many different ways.This book is a series of collected chapter essays, relaying the considered insights of many people who are already navigating the flat world with aplomb. Taken in isolation there is a great range of opinions and experiences that the reader can get from this book, before moulding them together to hopefully get something that will equip them for this brave new future. It is not the clearest, easiest and most direct of reads. Taken together, the book suffers; it lacks a certain common voice, a feeling of togetherness and a bit of its fizz is missing. This was more disturbing and distressing because you can sense there is a lot of great information within, screaming to get out.In one way this is a great example of why we need to ensure our flat world is easily navigable, as it might be a “one shot”-attempt to connect with us or, should persistence be engaged, the experience may not be as engaging and mutually beneficial as it should be; the implications of this are fairly obvious. This book could be the equivalent of a one-stop-shop information source, yet this reader’s potential loyalty to the brand is not guaranteed as the navigable path felt to be strewn with rocks and thus should a perceived better, smoother rout exist to similar material, whether better or not, maybe one steers the boat in that direction, possibly never to return.Regrettably, it just didn’t feel that this book was really ready. Pioneers are often breaking new ground, yet the messages they pass on for wider public attention do need to be very clear, acting as a magnet to draw in a crowd who may be confused, sceptical or unsure. Just preaching to the converted is not enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HK8VV4NJQ0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749473932#wasThisHelpful","R4HK8VV4NJQ0Y","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Content is king is an old mantra, or it just feels as for more years than one cares to remember content has been an over-used and often under-appreciated term. To an old journalist who trained on manual typewriters and had no Internet access, content is, well, just what we used to call copy. Different copy for different purposes, audiences and goals.This book tries to push its way into a fairly crowded area, aiming to show entrepreneurs how content may be used to build “massive audiences” and create “radically successful” businesses. Littering the book with examples such as Huffington Post and KraftRecipes is one thing, yet it can also be setting up unrealistic expectations. Small can be beautiful and a firm of architects can still utilise great content for a very small audience. Bigger is not always better, despite the inferences and hoopla from this book.One remains sceptical, probably due to the book’s whole being or its execution. The author is a content marketing expert and the advice is generally quite good, embracing and actionable; yet the book just did not grab this reviewer. It should have. Even an old dog can learn a few new tricks from another wise old dog. It just felt as if you could not warm to this book and thus it was too easy to become disengaged and put it down. That is a shame. Both the author and the publisher knows their business, so what went wrong here? Is it more than good content in average or poor packaging?When it is far from being the only content marketing resource available, why rush to this book? Why indeed. It is frustrating, as one knows that the author produces interesting and engaging material and this reviewer is a regular reader of his online service/blog. The self-same feeling that the author manages to create there is missing here. It just feels a night and day difference. It is not even a dumbing down/different audience argument either.If you can get on with the book then it is likely to deliver a lot. The typical reader for this book is going to benefit from a sequential read and forming a connection to the author; being sold on the concept, the need and the execution. If you feel it falls at the first step, maybe you won’t hang in there to see if things change. Definitely a “if you need this type of book, look at it first in a bookstore” thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UGU9K44WBMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125958965X#wasThisHelpful","R18UGU9K44WBMT","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many people criticise so-called green initiatives that are built around ecological preservation for stifling long-term economic growth, giving at most a blip in certain sectors whilst incurring costs elsewhere. On many occasions they are the “devil incarnate” and just get in the way of business. Oh, what should one believe?This is an interesting, relatively specialist book, that looks at the economic picture and costs of so-called green capital, examining the gamut of costs related to the deterioration of the “great natural regulatory functions”, such as the climate system, the water cycle and biodiversity, as if we mess them up as a society we really could be facing a “game over” situation. It sounds alarmist and many will rationalise it as being something mankind finds a way around; yet even if it does, or it can mitigate the problem with a bit of luck and good fortune, why play Russian Roulette?There is a precedent for this. The authors note: “Four thousand years ago, the fate of the Sumerians revealed that when growth is driven by capital accumulation that preys on the environment, it will eventually self-destruct. Thanks to their control of irrigation, the inhabitants of Sumer developed agriculture, writing, law and the city; but because they were unable to master drainage, the indispensable complement to irrigation in arid areas, their civilization vanished as a result of the sterilization of the soil by salt.” Is that enough? How about this: “The inhabitants of Easter Island, who had also developed one of the first writing systems, experienced a similar fate. After felling the last tree, they abandoned their island with its huge granite statues and it is now lunar landscape.”These were more innocent, less-developed times too. Look at this through a 2015 lens; we have machines that can process tonnes of rocks within the blink of an eye, explosives to destroy the world many times over and the ability, capability and desire to consume more than we should… What good luck which could have saved the planet in the past may not exist today.For the generalist this book has a lot of thought-provoking, incisive comment. The specialist can also draw upon a range of possible workable solutions and enjoy an examination of various valuation schemes and their contribution to the goals of green capitalism which, if implemented, could hopefully benefit both business and the wider environment.Analysing the validity of the models offered up by the authors is far beyond the “pay grade” of this reviewer, even though they do not appear far-fetched, are sympathetic and seem to understand the diverging needs of both sides. It is unfortunate that more general readers won’t see this book due, in part to its price, but also its appearance of being a more esoteric, specialist work. It could serve both reader groups, even if the amateur had to skip around a bit, as the authors manage to put a lot of points into context, adding colour and consideration rather than just waving a “hectoring finger” as sadly many environmentally focussed books tend to do.Certainly, to conclude, one can fairly say that this book deserves closer scrutiny; even if you are not even close to any “decision-making” processes, it does not hurt to get even a greater understanding about a problem that can and will affect us all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYYEXQTBRE1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231171404#wasThisHelpful","R3GYYEXQTBRE1L","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What exactly is Wall Street and how does it really function? The question is not as simple as you might think. Can the reputation of this famous collective institution be any more battered and criticised yet its presence dominates the world financial markets and can impact many domestic economies long away from New York. Wall Street coughs, the world recoils.This weighty book takes a deep look at the transformation of Wall Street from being a “clubby enclave of financiers” to what it is today. A total of 14 “financial visionaries” throughout time have been selected as the focus within individual chapters, although it is clearly concerning itself with more than just these key people. The author lets the stories speak for themselves, rather than being a piece of student “agit prop” or a hagiography for the Wall Street elite.  As you may expect, there is a wealth of references and further reading suggestions so that the dedicated reader can drill down further.Credit must be given to the author for the way he has weaved a fairly complex (and arguably controversial) story together to provide an interesting narrative both to the general reader and for the professional or academic. A credible balancing act has been reached and when the general reader begins to feel a bit of information overload, it is easy to “fast forward” towards the next subject or thought. This book does not focus on advocacy for change or reform. The reader can reach their own conclusions. The book does provide a fairly neutral, interesting history that speaks for itself.You might believe you know a fair bit about the world financial markets, history and politics: this book will surely add a bit more to the credit side of your knowledge ledger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W4M8W0SJ28JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231170548#wasThisHelpful","R3W4M8W0SJ28JF","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Change is usually led or inspired by a few, their actions creating a wave and latterly change as people either follow suit, adapt or switch course. Not every pioneer will effect change and one current term de jour is “social entrepreneur” and in this book the authors argue that such people are helping push change by observing systems and technologies that are ripe for transformation, sometimes going out on a limb, but nonetheless trying…This is a bit of a specialist read, looking at the theory of social entrepreneurship, its activities in history and how it works in the present day. A framework has been designed by the authors to try and explain how successful social entrepreneurs actually go about producing meaningful, transformative change, split between four key stages of understanding the world, envisioning a better future, building a model for change and scaling up the solution.Despite the book containing a lot of powerful information, it deserves to be more accessible and inviting; as it stands it might not get such a wide audience as it deserves.Many people today may try and shoehorn powerful figures of the past into the role of social entrepreneur. The author highlights Mother Theresa or Martin Luther King Jr. as prime candidates that, despite doing great works, are not social entrepreneurs, noting: “Without question, each of these leaders had enormous impact on the world. But were they social entrepreneurs? Calling them by this name, as some might be inclined to do, is based on a desire to validate important work leading to real and significant social benefits. While such an impulse is understandable, it is also unhelpful. If the term social entrepreneurship is used to characterize every act of leadership generating public benefit, it will simultaneously become everything and nothing. Striving for social good, as Mother Theresa did, or advocating for social justice as Martin Luther King did do not mark one as a social entrepreneur, nor does creating a business that happens to help the world while driving profit, as Henry Ford did.”Yet the authors bring up Andrew Carnegie, viewed by many as a “robber baron” for his union-busting activities, whilst supporting union rights at a time when he was the richest person in U.S. history and he then sought to give it away. Carnegie, they argue, is a social entrepreneur as he used his insight, riches and position to do things such as  fund libraries in the U.S. and many other countries. Access to education and enlightenment was being democratised and brought closer to the average person who did not have a vast private family library or restricted university library at their disposal. Once Carnegie started to fund public libraries, others did too and now a century later the library is still a very important institution.Once a social entrepreneur has been defined, moving forward with seeking to develop a way for “future Andrew Carnegies” to function is the goal of the authors. It need not necessarily be a massive gesture; many smaller gestures can work and lead the masses to great things.In places it felt as if the book was losing its way, getting thrown around on the literary high seas and not moving forward, despite it being an engaging subject to consider. It may be a book worthy of persevering with, should you have a need, but it is probably not going to fall into the casual, general reader’s lap; in many ways that is a shame as it does give a lot of interesting insight if you can successfully extract it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZL35CNTW4G1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633690687#wasThisHelpful","R2ZL35CNTW4G1V","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all want an easier life, what’s the harm in that, but when does it change from being a reasonable desire to something that is less attractive, namely the act of entitlement? The author, in this book, looks at why many people are failing to get what they want and where they want to be because they stumble, they expect, they believe they are entitled. In other words they don’t know “how to do life the hard way” and their sense of entitlement keeps them from tackling challenges and finding success.A lot is being promised by this book, the reader awaits to discover “…the skills of learning to tackle and resolve matters that are difficult, rather than avoiding them, giving up too quickly, or hoping someone else will do it for them” and it can surely lead to great things such as “…success in the reader’s relationships, finances, self-care, and work.” At least a modicum of work may be necessary, apart from reading the book, so once you man-up and acknowledge what must be faced, you surely will reach your goals and move forward.That’s the theory. As with so many self-help books, it can be a very personal thing. Either you connect or you don’t. The results can vary or be interpreted in many ways. Any change for the better surely is good, so maybe if you set lower expectations you feel better when they are achieved and then some! This reviewer found the style a little too mixed and less focussed and the repeated references to Bible passages was possibly less appropriate (although, to be fair, they didn’t offend and you could jump over them – if they give you comfort or inspiration is that a bad thing, but then why not take examples from other religious works too?)One cannot say that this was a bad book. It passed the “would you skim read a bit of it if a friend lent it you” test. It didn’t make this reviewer want to rush out and buy a copy nor did it give a hint of changing his life; yet it potentially could for you. Quite a few interesting points were raised and the changes potentially reasonable and doable. Identifying the “entitlement culture” is an important point, as it can otherwise create a downward spiral and something that is hard to break.“Whatever the cause of the sense of entitlement, the end result is that the person believes that he or she doesn’t have to play by the rules of responsibility, ownership, and commitment. And the end result of entitlement is predictable: The entitled person feels good and lives badly, while those around him feel bad about the situation but have more successful relationships and careers,” wrote the author and who can’t say if they are honest that that picture is not recognisable?The author had some good people on their team, noting: “My writing coach on this book gave me some great advice that shaped the way I approached the material: ‘Don’t write a finger-wagging book that just gets people even more frustrated and feeling even more helpless. Describe the problem, but give people solutions and hope.’  The same goes for our reactions to the entitled people around us.

"What has happened? Has capitalism ran out of control and instead of providing increasing riches for more people as a reward for hard work it is in danger of overheating the entire machine and blowing it up for good measure?The author is concerned and he believes that the same economic system which charged America and made it a great economic powerhouse in the past century is failing, leading to greater problems if it is not brought back under control. Can the genie be put back in the bottle? The author believes so and has a plan.This does not appear to be one of those typical hysteric “oh God, the world is ending, it is all the fault of the elite”-type books but a sensitive, considered look at a problem. The so-called elite do come in for some criticism, as their increasing power and influence is part of the problem, yet it just a component of a complex situation.  Not so long ago a typical income in the U.S. could have been enough to sustain an entire family and provide often a fairly comfortable life. Today, you would be struggling and even if two people have the luxury of a job the money just doesn’t seem to stretch. Consumer debt is spiralling and yet the rich are getting richer and the poor, as well as the “pampered middle class” are not.There is a distinct falsehood, the author claims, that people are paid what they are “worth” and that increased wages leads to reduced employment and thus a vicious circle is formed. A race to the bottom is quite unedifying. Society is becoming ever polarised. It is becoming a “them” and “us” arrangement. Of course there has always been rich and poor, yet the differences were mostly relative: now the difference between the average worker and the rich or super rich can be quite obscene, even when viewed through the eyes of someone who has been fairly successful in life so far.Many have stopped believing in a future and that may lead to a dangerous snowball effect. As the author notes: “Confidence in the economic system has declined sharply. The apparent arbitrariness and unfairness of the economy have undermined the public’s faith in its basic tenets. Cynicism abounds. To many, the economic and political systems seem rigged. The threat to capitalism is no longer communism or fascism but a steady undermining of the trust modern societies need for growth and stability. When most people stop believing they and their children have a fair chance to make it, the tacit social contract societies rely on for voluntary cooperation begins to unravel. In its place comes subversion, small and large – petty theft, cheating, fraud, kickbacks, corruption. Economic resources gradually shift from production to protection.”The solution may be bloody, at least figuratively. Turkeys don’t vote for Christmas or Thanksgiving after all. Yet the American public will be engaged with the never-ending “fight” between Republican and Democrats or other distractions as to whether government is doing too much or too little. This distraction may be contrived or encouraged because it suits those in power to divert attention away. The author’s recipe for success is for the wider population to be unified and united in a desire for change for the entire country’s best. The author also notes that whilst focussing on America’s problems, the self-same issues and solutions are relevant for many other countries too, adding: “I believe that if we dispense with mythologies that have distracted us from the reality we find ourselves in, we can make capitalism work for most of us rather than for only a relative handful. History provides some direction as well as some comfort, especially in America, which has periodically readapted the rules of the political economy to create a more inclusive society while restraining the political power of wealthy minorities at the top.”Whether the author has the right recipe to get things back on track remains to be seen, but more and more people do believe that something has to be done.  It is not a dream or desire to take America into a socialist or communist-style paradise; inequalities exist in every system but the inequalities now seem to be getting into extreme territory: that is the concerning “danger zone”.If nothing else, the author has provided an interesting take on a challenging, divisive, engaging subject and treated it with sensitivity and maturity. Some may describe it as revolutionary, some as evolutionary and others just won’t really know for sure how to react, yet the book’s observations and analysis will resonate with them nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UF93UJ1I5YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350570#wasThisHelpful","R7UF93UJ1I5YT","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Employee engagement is hardly a new subject, entire forests have been decimated to produce books that all claim to have elements of the secret formula that will help get your employees more engaged, more productive and just happier. Yet, as many employees will admit, engagement remains disengaged, no matter how many trinkets, football tables or other morale boosters are deployed. Time to look beyond engagement?This book claims that a brain-based approach can be the saviour to an eternal problem although, it notes, even when companies do succeed and manage a degree of engagement, there are still problems as the employees may be engaged, motivated even, but they have no energy left for the core tasks ahead of them.Can you win? The author says that there is something called “the engagement paradox”, meaning the more companies focus on engagement, the more disengagement they produce; most employees start out with the intention of being engaged, committed and loyal (no matter how much they’d rather win the lottery and never go back to work) but a combination of work and home-life just saps their energy. Society is running at far too high a gear.“It's not that employees don't want to be engaged. It's not that they don't support the engagement programme. They are committed and loyal soldiers. However, in today's exhaustion era, they are simply struggling to make it to the weekend. Lacking energy, they resort to quick fixes, workarounds, and reactive fire fighting, thereby hardwiring depletion into the system. As a result, employees come to perceive engagement efforts as a management con game. We've witnessed situations where up to 50 per cent of the employee population believe no meaningful outcomes will occur as a result of the engagement survey. This crisis of belief causes acute pain inside well-intentioned leaders who are doing their best to unlock employee engagement. They feel caught,” said the author.Whether this book really has the secret sauce is debatable. It talks a great talk but whether it really has discovered anything revolutionary is unclear. A lot of the conclusions appear to be common sense or simple, yet often the best things in life are exactly that. Ten leadership principles are offered up by the author, reportedly based on the findings of “brain science”, which will not just deliver engagement but take you “beyond engagement”. Engagement 2.0? More carrot and the right type of carrot, rather than the big, bad stick certainly will help!In any case, the book did not seem to stretch the bounds of credibility by reverting to hype-filled hoopla that, sadly, far too many leadership and motivation books rely upon. That is a big plus. If you view this book, as did this reviewer, with a relatively cynical, non-committal expectation then what the book delivers is certainly positive and promising.The low price of the book and the promise of improving if not going beyond engagement, means that it should be considered at least as an alternative source of possible salvation. What is there to lose, especially when everything is to gain. Even if it cannot or does not deliver the “big bang” you may be expecting, even a small nudge towards the better would be a great start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7ZKT7XEXHH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1772360171#wasThisHelpful","RI7ZKT7XEXHH5","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Are you truly making the most of what you say or do? Maybe you are letting yourself down with the manner in which you communicate? Maybe this book will help you play the part better!Improving how you communicate is the author’s goal, enhancing the invisible, subconscious messages you may pass on through your body language as well as your general stature, appearance and whole being. Whether in a one-to-one meeting or standing on a stage in front of thousands of people, the author believes that real change is quite possible.If you have read books about body language, public speaking and related subjects in the past you might not find this to be a totally revolutionary book, yet it manages to package a lot of interesting points together to make it a complimentary read, building upon and refining your existing knowledge. A number of practical exercises are included which the author believes will help the reader improve and articulate their performance. It need be no different to playing a music instrument: many people can play an instrument, but not so many are capable of playing within an orchestra at a concert level. The core aim is to make the reader shine, whether if they are “speaking” as part of the orchestra or taking a solo role.The book is written primarily in a narrative, first person-type style and it didn’t work so well for this reader. Different strokes for different folks, but it just made the whole reading interaction more stilted, less accessible and at times a bit of a chore. Greater internal signposting could have been used, along with an index (one was not, in any case, present in this review copy) so that a stressed executive who knows they saw something about reading an autocue confidently could perhaps find the exact page and remind themselves of the tip as a last minute aide memoire.Even though it did not work for this reviewer on the whole, it wasn’t a wasted read. It just felt it could have been even better and more focussed; it could have been an excellent book rather than an average or quite good book. Your views may vary: at the very least you should check it out and see if you can form a connection with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1218QXV6Y7AQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071835482#wasThisHelpful","R1218QXV6Y7AQC","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a fascinating, if not rather specialist book, which aims to be an accessible guide to the world of text analytics and data analysis for marketing folk.As an upmarket “how-to guide”, the author has sought to make this a jargon-restricted zone, showing working methodologies and actionable strategies for the use of text analytics without dumbing it down to an absurd, useless level.  As the book’s marketing materials note, the book: “…presents the process of analysis in ways that people who use the data need to see them, helping marketers to clarify and organise confidently the confusing array of methods, frame the right questions and apply the results successfully to find meaning in any unstructured data and develop powerful new marketing strategies.”This book may make your head ache at first if this subject is entirely new, yet just think how even more difficult it could be if it did not have the benefit of the author’s simple, sympathetic and at times humorous treatment to make it so reader-friendly! The author aims to get you understanding how text analytics can be used within your organisation, enabling you to perhaps have a go yourself as well as liaising with programmers and external vendors who may use a strange language that vaguely resembles English (or your country’s language) peppered in with a lot of mysterious jargon for good measure.Text that you could, should or may need to analyse can be everywhere and a lot of it, most of it, may be unstructured. Dependent on your needs a lot of this text can yield insights into what people might be thinking, feeling or saying about your company and its products. It might even allow you to guess what they are looking for and not finding. The world can literally at your fingertips, as long as you suck in enough data and manage to sufficiently analyse it.Are you still confused? It does not help that terms such as data and information may be used interchangeably.  The author seeks to clarify matters, saying: “Anything that can be collected in any fashion counts as data. Noise from a cell phone tower is data. Mistranslated text is data. Propaganda is data. Data exists, but may not have any purpose. It is not information. The distinction is essential. Information conveys valuable new insights, telling us about something that we did not expect, or allowing us to deal with an unusual contingency. We often encounter the belief that having a great deal of data also means that we must have something interesting. Some writers have even made a point of saying, apparently earnestly, that more data is always better. This is not true. In many cases, this assertion can be completely backward. If the data you have at hand mainly is not useful, more of it makes it harder for you to find what you need, not easier. As valuable items get overrun by useless ones, they become more elusive, and may even vanish from sight entirely. Knowing where to look, as well as how to do the analysis, becomes critical with data that is not structured.”There is a phrase about “not seeing the wood for the trees” in English that can be applied here. The author hopes that you will be able to see right through the forest of text after applying a “filter” with the help of text analytics, making an information pathway through the forest of noise as you go.Certainly this seems to be a valiant, great attempt at demystifying a very complex being. Should you have a need for this book, the author might be your literary knight in shining armour.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14OOFYOB16BS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749474017#wasThisHelpful","R14OOFYOB16BS2","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world of retail is changing and ignoring it is no longer an option. Just like when dinosaurs roamed, it is possible for smaller beings to survive - you just have to avoid being squashed by the bigger beasts. Adapting, embracing a changing situation, being agile and having a real purpose are key attributes in this developing e-retail world.This book is more than just a theoretical look at the changing face of retail. It considers how society is changing thanks to the Internet; the world might be getting smaller but we are facing increasing challenges as well as possibilities. If you are in business it can be great that you now have the world as your potential customer base, until you remember that you can have the world as your competitor too! If you are an intermediary or reseller you might be feeling squeezed, especially if you are not adding real value to the chain.So the authors have managed to provide a good generalist’s guide, without being boring to the specialist or interested industry participant. It is a thoughtful overview and summary that allows you to expand your thinking and research as required. Some of the opinions may appear over-simplified, such as the reasons why some online retail is successful today, compared with something a decade or further ago, yet it does not make it any less desirable. If you view it as a guide for moving forward, here it can have more value.Compared to earlier, pioneer times there is a greater critical mass of users online - a mass of users who are prepared to (or will only if they can) shop online - and the infrastructure to support it. This reviewer recalls in the mid-1990s using the Internet (pre Amazon) to buy things and twenty years on the experience is totally different. Then, you would wait for days for someone to check their email inquiry (if they were that fast!) and reply and once you had reached an agreement it wasn’t plain selling. You would have to send a bank cheque by airmail and wait for it to clear. Far too many companies were not geared up to export either, so you had to tell them what was necessary. Delays, delays and more delays. Even those who could accept a credit card (manually, not online mind!) invariably requested a fax of your ID too. It was a more innocent time – can we say risk of identity theft? Sure, let me fax over a copy of my credit card, a signature, a copy of my passport and a letter to you for a USD25 computer part…Yet today, within one minute, this reviewer could order and pay for a copy of this book online from Amazon.com (other outlets are available). Within hours the book may be dispatched and it could be received from the other side of the world within days. (At the time of writing this review on a Monday afternoon, if the book is ordered within the next four hours, Amazon says it would be received by Thursday if priority shipping is selected). For books, it is even quicker if you use a Kindle or similar.Often it is easier, faster and not always noticeably more expensive to order online from another country – the selection can be better too. If you are an even savvier customer, you might use a price comparison website and maybe you save a few per cent buying from a new vendor and spend a few minutes opening yet another account, or you buy from a trusted global player who already has your credit card number and address. To use Amazon as the example, if I want to give a copy of this book to my father his address is already stored there. Even if I wanted to give it as a gift to a new friend, a new address can be added in a minute; I can select gift-wrap and bang… all done. It is so easy, yet I can be a fickle customer and if another vendor for whatever reason attracts me, maybe my purchasing preference is redirected.Even a fraction of this was unimaginable in the past, yet those who were there at the start and did it felt rather good and special. What would the alternative have been? Maybe a local bookstore would “special order” something, via their supplier, who would go to another supplier and a whole chain would develop, with profit to add at each level – should the chain break or be delayed, the poor customer might not know without a lot of effort. After placing my order online, I can track its progress to my door…So clearly efficiencies help us as a customer, or e-retail participant; but they help our competitors too and create greater obligations on us all. Already we are starting to see things going in phases; concepts that were trialled and didn’t work are replaced by other things, for them to be replaced by the things that once didn’t work but might do this time around, possibly with the benefit of modification, a new technology or just “this time good luck”. Companies come and go too. eBay was once viewed as the ecommerce darling, a great place for the consumer to hold a virtual “garage sale”. Then the company’s focus switched to big companies, especially overseas ones and customers increasingly became disenchanted or found sites offering better value and now many customers have fell out of love with eBay. Many smaller businesses too and the bigger ones who remain might not be so loyal as, after all, one platform can be the same as another, it all depends on whether it delivers the business!Existing retail is changing already. It was not so long ago that the stupendously-large “megamart” was the future, then the companies started focussing on their “local” stores with a smaller footprint and selection. Even without e-retailing, they don’t really know what they want. Maybe they know their ship is sinking and are trying to simultaneously find dry land and fix the hole.The authors note: “Brick and mortar stores will still exist, but often as showrooms for hands on experiences and test centres for new products. Their footprints are shrinking, and mini stores will open in apartment buildings and offices, acting as distribution spots for customers. Few of us will buy products in stores, and even fewer will take them home. Most purchases will be made online and delivered with regular items like water, toilet paper, food and beauty products being scheduled on a regular basis. Everything will be connected to the cloud, creating a new era of smart products. In addition to smartphones, we'll have smartcupboards, smarttables, smartfridges, smartpens, smartclothing, smartcars, you name it. So your milk will reorder itself when it's low and show up on your doorstep the next day. Your dress will organise a date with the dry cleaner before you realize it's dirty. The middleman will disappear, creating direct links to producers and consumers around the world. This will increase collaboration at every stage along the supply chain, resulting in more customised and personalised products and remarkable customer experiences.”Little stick-on buttons that Amazon has started selling, for a select few brands, that let you re-order products such as washing powder will only be a stepping stone; yet for this reviewer they do seem a lazy step too far – even if they were free. They are not, the customer is expected to pay several dollars a button for the privilege of ordering a pre-determined size product from a pre-determined brand at what ever price the vendor will sell them for - how online stores can have many different prices for the same product, dependent on who you are is another subject!One interesting expectation is the growth of 3D printing, whether in the home or as a service within the local community. The authors believe this will be the future, so our physical goods will be made literally on our doorstep; this will disrupt a lot of intermediary stages. Just think now how many people are making illegal downloads of music and films. Will some of us be downloading illegal images of an IKEA bookcase before we send it to our 3D printer? How will stores selling new and used products cope? Already there is a problem with counterfeit products such as mobile phone chargers. Is that a counterfeit chair or a genuine one?Look around you: you may be forgiven for thinking that the online business is larger than it is. Still over 90% of all transactions are made offline, the authors note, so if such change and transformation has occurred with such a relatively small share of the market, imagine how it may be when (rather than if) the bulk is done online. The authors talk about zero friction: “When it's just as easy – or easier – to buy something from someone around the world than it is to call in at the local high street store. When paying for something online is easier than using hard paper currency. When everyone participating in the shopping process, as both producers and consumers, is normal. When online and offline worlds don't exist because there's seamless integration between them. This is zero friction. When the barriers to create, buy and sell products online are gone, for everyone, making it just as easy, or easier, to go online and get what you want. It's a world of seamless customer experiences. It's the future. And we're building it faster than anyone could have predicted.”Access to this brave new world is not necessary restricted to the big companies either. Democratisation of business may occur. You just have to have the right product, the right idea and the right service and be on top of your game. Interesting times are ahead. If you have not thought about the world of electronic commerce other than to complain when your parcel is delayed, this book can be for you. If you even have a tangential “dog in the fight”, this book can provide a great scene-setter and act as a bit of a focussed crystal ball.The intelligent reader will, once they finish this book, start to reflect on the individual journey that it took to reach them; considering what it skipped past along the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBPNVFS67LOXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622878574#wasThisHelpful","RBPNVFS67LOXE","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very few companies truly “go it alone” today: partnerships, alliances, cooperative agreements are essential, whilst mergers, acquisitions or takeovers can be commonplace. Your strategy might need a reboot, as the old tried and tested ones may no longer pass muster: a remix strategy could be required.There are so many pressures on businesses today as well. Disruptive technologies, globalisation, an ever-informed customer and even the “social media” menace can work against you, so having a clear strategy that hopefully works is essential. This book promises to help you see things in a possibly different light. Even if you think you have everything in order, does it hurt to take a look “just in case”. It will either reveal a hole in your plans or confirm (in your eyes) that everything is tickety-boo.The author mixes real-world consulting experience and academic research to consider how companies are creating value by remixing their resources, working with other companies to hopefully lead to a stronger, unified chain rather than weaker, individual elements. Three laws are central to the author’s thinking: the value created by the combination should exceed the total that would be generated by the players acting alone; the combination must be designed and managed to realize the joint value in reality and each participant must earn sufficient profits to reward its investment.Potentially this book can deliver a fair bit of good advice. It just did not feel as “open and attractive” as it perhaps could have been. A lot of the advice may appear fairly common-sense and matter-of-fact but, as any successful entrepreneur will tell you, the packaging of several items can be more powerful and valuable than the individual entities taken in isolation.Whether this book is genuinely revolutionary remains open for debate. It can deliver a lot to an open, appreciative reader who is prepared to dig deep and consider matters. It may either grab your attention or pass you by: there’s not so much middle ground.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7TTH4BQ4R7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422163083#wasThisHelpful","R2W7TTH4BQ4R7F","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attraction can be a highly personal attribute, yet why do many people get attracted to and rally around a brand? Whether it is a commodity or a prestige brand, the price of a product is not always an indication of quality or actual value. What is value? It can be more than just money. The art of prestige branding has been deployed!Sometimes it feels that there is not that much of a difference between brand X and prestige brand Y, yet people will pay a lot more for the latter and it is more than just exclusivity. If there is a limited supply of a certain French wine from a good vintage year you can understand it will cost more than a typical bottle of “supermarket red”. Yet how can a commodity item be a prestige brand when the manufacturer could make millions of the same product each and every year as long as demand remains? It is not always the case that there is a big difference in form, taste or looks and there is not a celebrity endorsement or film tie-in to help.This book takes look behind some of the more successful current-day prestige brands to see what makes them tick. Some of the brands defy convention, yet they have succeeded. Some of the brands use luxury branding and marketing techniques for their commodity products with success.Why do many of us aspire to (whether we vocalise it or not) or actively seek out one brand of toilet paper than another as, after all, colour and thickness of paper aside, what’s the difference? You don’t have a little logo with the slogan “Just Wipe It” in the corner of every sheet. You don’t have an audience when you are attending to your needs and neither do you tend to get celebrity endorsements from famous models who gush how they wouldn’t “wipe with anything else.” You certainly don’t go to a bar or a hotel and ask for a roll of your favourite toilet tissue to be provided. Well 99.9999% of us don’t, but invariably there must surely be one who does?You will also begin to think about branding and marketing in a fresh way and the authors have been busy discovering why some brands are “created more equal than others”, pulling in over 100 case studies, interviews, observations and research, before mixing it into an interesting, humorous, detailed tale which is a lot more than a dry, theoretical textbook. It is quite possible that the interested, general reader would find a lot of good stuff here too, even if they might not ordinarily stumble across it.The book cannot deliver you the secret formula to creating a prestige brand: you still need a good product or service and you need the fickle mind of the public on your side. Yet you can shape your product, polish your marketing message, highlight your image and propagate the impression that you have a prestigious brand. P. T. Barnum may be proud of your endeavours too! Is it smoke and mirrors or science…? Can it be a little bit of everything?The idea behind this book and the whole theory emerged from a simple origin. As the authors admit: ""It all started with a glass of beer and a simple observation: Some brands have gained almost mythical status – seemingly beyond any price or performance considerations. We were having an after work drink when one of our bar mates cut through our conversation, ordering a ‘Supercharger’ (aka Vodka Red Bull), triggering a spiral of questions: Why do people flock to a ‘gourmet vodka’ like Grey Goose, where vodka is mostly liked for being flavour neutral? What keeps Red Bull cool after all those years? And isn’t the mystery around Taurine, its famous ingredient, eerily similar to that of skin care brand Crème de la Mer’s miracle broth? Such different brands with different targets at vastly different price points, but both applying similar strategies and achieving a relative premium.”Fast forward to today and an excellent, intriguing, landmark book. You don’t have to have a prestigious brand and any connection to one to enjoy it. It has rather a lot for everyone. What you may think is responsible can be a mixture of old, out-of-date, fractured thinking, i.e. you are just plain wrong! The authors admit that we can be effectively in confusing times and, of course, maybe some new terminology is needed to accurately define this brave new world where classic notions are shattered into a thousand pieces.“We quickly felt uncomfortable using the established terminology and started talking about ‘modern prestige’ or finally ‘Ueber-Brands’. This newly emerging breed of ‘prestige’ brands thrives on paradoxes, breaks with branding traditions and inspires us with an innate sense of mission paired with often very counter-intuitive commercialization strategies,” say the authors, pointing out that purpose increasingly beats performance and that price is often rather a catalyst than a barrier to purchase.A lot is contained in this relatively slim book and you will find yourselves reading it several times to maximise your use of the authors’ revelations. As if that is not enough, there is a massive bibliography of further reading suggestions, allowing you to dig deeper into existing research and published articles, should you wish to learn even more on a given point.So, this book could be an ideal description of itself. A prestige product that stands out, despite it being something that deserves to be a commodity product, that is to say something that should be on the bookshelf of everyone involved in marketing, branding or advertising… as well as the “information curious” generalist reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TL786MBJ5UDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749470038#wasThisHelpful","R3TL786MBJ5UDY","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For more years than one cares to remember, Africa has been profiled as the continent to watch, the next economic powerhouse, the “lion economy” in waiting. Yet we still wait and we still watch… The “Next Africa” might be different, assuming the continent hasn't been plundered by its rulers, sold off to foreign investors for the rich commodities available, or managed to destruct itself due to wars; or a combination of many factors.The authors are optimistic, they believe that people will change what they think about the continent; they believe that the old problems (perceived or actual) that are arguably holding it back will be no more or significantly reduced. They forecast that the continent will be hit by a “… wave of transformation driven by business, modernization and a new cadre of remarkably talented Africans (that will thrust) the continent from the world's margins to the global mainstream.”Maybe this time? Who knows. Will the continent be able to rise, unite, develop, extend itself and benefit from the changes, or will it be sunk by the “old problems”. Maybe it will be “treated” to the taste of “democracy” by other governments? The authors mix their own experiences with detailed research, personal profiles, interviews, analysis and maybe a little bit of crystal ball-gazing for good measure.Africa is increasingly under the eye of global business as well as a few fairly large national governments. You would not expect anything else. Is Africa ready this time to make the leap? Possibly: the disruption can come through technology and modernisation programmes leapfrogging the old and tested way of doing things. Innovation is already happening because of need. What happens in Africa does not necessarily stay in Africa. A new online service or product developed in a small village could get worldwide traction with ease. Nothing should be taken for granted and many Africans are renowned for their eternal energy, drive, optimism and determination. Can technology and innovation be that enabler?Interesting times are ahead of us. Africa’s success may depend on Africans tearing up the traditional game book and moving ahead. Can the leap be made so that the continent is an enabler and a maker, rather than a provider or service facilitator? Does this require greater unity from the continent as a whole; after all it may face greater resistance if it becomes too big a threat to American, European or maybe Asian interests and their economies? Africa is viewed by many as being the next low-cost production region - whether that is wishful thinking and by whom is debatable. There is a real chance (or risk dependent on your point-of-view) that Africa will achieve a lot more than just be the next workshop for the world. It may be leaping over that transformative step.In any case, the authors put forward an engaging argument to suggest there is a very bright future for the continent. They may appear optimistic and overly positive but they are not underplaying the challenges and risks ahead. They present a fairly advanced, focussed, diverse look at Africa and act as a great funnel of knowledge. Some of it you might not agree with. Some of it may challenge your existing knowledge, views and stereotypes. Some of it will be totally new. It all appears to be eminently valid and credible.Whatever you start with and whatever you end up with, the reading journey will be a pleasant one. Africa is, to most non-Africans, quite a misunderstood, less known continent. The authors believe that the future, globally-connected Africa could positively impact us all, being a place where its leaders and citizens wield significant economic, cultural and political power. They also see a future in which Americans and other so-called first world nations will be more likely to own African stocks, work for companies doing business in Africa, buy African hits from iTunes and see the continent in an entirely new light. That much, one reckons, is given. It is perhaps a question of when and how that is more apposite.It was, at least for this non-African reviewer, a thoughtful book that didn’t scare, threaten or shame: it just provoked interest, curiosity and engaged the mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQGSMHFV8XSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006371X#wasThisHelpful","R3MQGSMHFV8XSS","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quite strange book, filled with humour and quite intriguing, interesting text that looks at the world of work by creating instruction manuals for many different jobs. It is a lot better than you first may fear.Do you fancy learning how to play a piano without a piano in Bolivia? How about being a magician in Paris? A ballerina in London? All this and more – a total of 14 different jobs – await. The book’s publicity material has some highbrow explanation for it: “The value of this book is twofold: For young people or middle-aged people who are undecided about their career paths and feel constrained in their choices, (the book) offers an expansive vision. For ethnographers, this book offers an excellent example of using the practical details of everyday life to shed light on larger structural issues.”The TL:DR version: Interesting, obscure, fascinating read about stuff you might never have thought you wanted to know about.There is the serious side to the book, such as it conveying jobs in culturally specific ways through a range of voices and perspectives, as in an older sister counselling her brother on how to be a doctor in Malawi. The less-serious side is the promise of a humorous, informative and credible read. The astute reader may also take away many interesting points that could possibly be shoehorned into other situations.As the book notes: “Think about the work you have done. You generally need a complicated mix of skills to do any of it well. You often have to learn some tacit knowledge and have some direct training, you need to show social competence and master some physical skills -- all specific to that particular occupation. To be a magician in Paris, you need to know how to perform tricks without much room to manoeuvre because you might have to do it in a restaurant. But you also need to know how to negotiate with a French government bureaucrat so that you can get a government stipend for being a creative artist. Some of what you need to know can be taught through books, some you can learn only after observing and practicing on the job itself, and some you learn from your mentors and co-workers.”When this reviewer first saw this book he expected to hate it or, at the very best, believe it would be so-so with the occasional bit of humour and interest. Yet it turned out to be a lot, lot better than that. A splendid curiosity that may appeal to the discerning reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHGMMCFYOS0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801456851#wasThisHelpful","R2JHGMMCFYOS0I","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forty-plus years on and still this book can be capable of making the reader smile and despair at the same time. Just like on the small screen, now this classic has been rereleased for the benefit of a new set of readers.There is little point reviving the plot, it is quite simple. The author takes a rather close eye at the world of Wall Street and considers how stock markets work. This was written, perhaps, in a slightly more innocent time, when the word of a trader was his bond and we did not have the “benefit” of high speed margin trading and other technological manipulations. Although, of course, manipulations happened then too.It need not be something consigned to the “history” shelf either, as many of the same drivers, market movers, psychological traits, nervous ticks and other factors that helped make, move or shake the market remain current today. The packaging might be different, the pace a little racier and we have more toys at our disposal but nonetheless...It is a light-hearted romp through Wall Street with a serious gaze, becoming something different for everybody whilst being one of those books you probably should have read at least once if you have an interest in investing and investments. It is more readable and incisive than many of the so-called classic “must reads” of today that either jump the shark or act as a synonym for turgidity.Buying it won’t, err, break the bank. Making duff investments can though. Don’t worry, if you end up owing enough, you’ll probably get a bailout. Bankruptcy is only for the little people who are not too big to fail. Having “connections” helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8R2TUFSPKAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSLI6NI#wasThisHelpful","R1O8R2TUFSPKAX","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The majority of our day is usually spent doing work, rather than sleeping or relaxing. This work, however, might not be necessarily putting money in your bank account. We are enslaved to others through shadow work, a series of unpaid, unseen and undervalued jobs that can take up rather a lot of our time!This book is a mix between social observation, commentary, self-help and realisation: it even has a bit of humour, or as much humour as you might permit it to provide after you are slapping your head in frustration as the realisation of just how much we are doing for others sinks in.Our lives are busier, there seems to be less time to do the things we want (and we can’t blame Facebook and Twitter for eating up our time with a stream of status updates, cat videos and OMG!!! WTF!!!!!-type outbursts of rage). So what is happening? We are allegedly in the most prosperous era in human history and this should be bringing leisure to us. It is not that long ago that the “computer revolution” was promising home robots and the eternal life of riches and leisure amongst other good things.Shadow work… the plethora of unpaid tasks we are doing on behalf of businesses and organisations is to blame, the author says. Yet we consider it normal. Filling our cars at the petrol station, building our own furniture from flat-pack kits, checking ourselves in online for flights… the list continues: some of this work is sold to us as offering convenience, choice and freedoms and maybe it is. Yet it all adds up. Recycling, redeeming gift cards, giving feedback and reviews, recommending services and products to our friends, printing off our own travel tickets… and so on and so on.Why are we paying, for example, with our own time to tidy a table and take all our refuse away, possibly sorting it into recycling bins, after eating a hamburger or taking a coffee at a high-street chain? Would having someone bring the food to us and tidy up afterwards really add much to the bill? Where next? Should we take our own orders? Oh, that’s already happening in some areas, again sold as a “convenience” that we enter our fast food order into a touch screen, swipe our credit card and then take a queue number. All these jobs that disappear; paid jobs that is… don’t worry, there’s a ready stream of volunteer labour. You can always be bribed or rewarded with a trinket, a frequent customer point or a badge or logo to attach to your social media profile.Sarcastic, cynical or just increasingly aware at the obvious when it is brought to one’s attention. What do you think?There is also another form of shadow work, albeit with good intentions – volunteering. We often volunteer to a charity or other good cause, gifting our time, yet many of these organisations are run like big corporations, often with the bureaucracy and pay structures at the executive level to match. Is our help necessarily well targeted, well received and justified?This book gets you thinking about the actual exchange between consumer and corporation as well as society as a whole. It may inspire change, it may lead to higher blood pressure and a great degree of irritation. At times you may consider the book labours a point, becomes over-simplistic or a tad petty and petulant, yet overall it does manage to open up an interesting area of thought and functions as an interesting, different read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21RXDE4Q685H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619025256#wasThisHelpful","R21RXDE4Q685H9","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oracle Corporation, the mighty computer technology company, is everywhere and whilst it is not as ubiquitous or well known as Microsoft or Apple to the average person, there is a very good chance that their life is touched upon quite often by Oracle’s products.Becoming an Oracle customer is an investment. You do not just go to the computer store and pick up a ready-made system and neither do you ring a local computer dealer and they install something for you within a day or two. So good planning, product knowledge and industry awareness is key; an Oracle consultant becomes a vital cog in the machine, linking customer to supplier, finding the right solution to let the customer’s business thrive and move forward.So armed with this book you may better understand your Oracle consultant, or any consultant for that matter; or if you are a consultant or thinking of being one you may be a much better one thanks to the author’s advice whereby she lifts the veil on a proven method of teaching consultants that is central to Oracle’s international business dealings.Oracle wants to be in a business relationship for the long-term. A trusted client relationship is key and whilst there are commercial pressures for both Oracle and its clients and sometimes disagreements, identifying and hopefully resolving any differences of opinion can be key for that successful, long-term “marriage”. The author should know her onions: she created the course Oracle Consulting Services requires each of its consultants to undertake. There is no such thing as a bare pass in Oracle’s world and the company appears to put in the resources and support to aid its consultants who, in turn, aid its clients and prospective clients. High standards are not just expected or desired: they are demanded, it is non-negotiable.There is no shortage of “be a better consultant”-type books on the market, but this one really found a little niche and hammered its way into this reviewer’s consciousness. If the author is such as accomplished trainer, should one be surprised at the end results? Whilst taken in isolation it is hardly revolutionary, as a package of measures its simple delivery, unambiguous messaging and considered opinion does make it stand out. Investing in quality, demanding high-level responses and behaviour, plus setting the bar very high has its benefits.Even as a grumpy old industry veteran who has been there and possibly nearly seen it all, this book didn’t disappoint. Is this reviewer too old to become an Oracle consultant: the book was not full of PR-speak extolling the company as “The Place To Work” complete with capital letters, yet it did draw you in as a hard and hectic place to be, where professionalism and quality execution is valued, and where you would go the extra mile and then some, because in the longer-term it is the right thing to do. It is all very attractive and enticing!Of course, it helps when Oracle does it all under one roof. It can genuinely be a one-stop-shop rather than one cog in many with all the problems that it can bring in the guise of choice and flexibility. As the book notes: “The software development effort at Oracle is a coordinated effort. The software, hardware, database, and middleware teams work together to assure that all of Oracle's products work seamlessly. Oracle's consultants have access to the individuals who wrote the software as well as a host of exceptionally experienced consultants. Oracle consultants frequently have the opportunity to contribute feedback on product performance and recommend enhancements, and so they are deeply invested in the overall success of the software. Oracle offers all its employees access to training in software and industry and soft skills. Any training that is available to customers or partners is generally available to Oracle's consultants without charge. Employees benefit from access to training materials before their general availability to the competition. The last and perhaps most important investment that Oracle makes in its employees is in the area of soft skills. Soft skills are talents that are needed to communicate effectively, excel in productivity, and be the type of person from whom others want to learn. Oracle's human resources team provides a library of soft skills training for all roles and levels of employees.”So many companies claim to invest in people - their people; they even get nice little logos and certificates to stick on their marketing materials. The cynical amongst us know the value of these certifications. The proof of the proverbial pudding can be in the eating.Even if your company is much smaller and your marketplace is quite fragmented, you can still potentially benefit from the Oracle Way in your way.The author does not varnish things, diplomatically noting: “When people hear the word consultant, a number of images come to mind, and not all of them are positive. Defining what a consultant is and is not is important for both you and your clients. Setting the correct expectations early and often is crucial to a productive relationship. Perhaps one of the most difficult skills to learn is soft skills. The ability to gain the trust of others is part of your personality or it isn't. There are a lucky few are who are naturals at this; other people are drawn to them, and so they easily assume the role of trusted advisor. For others, gaining this trust can be a stumbling block. To be an effective consultant, it is imperative that you be able to gain the trust of your client immediately and, equally important, retain that trust. Understanding the skills necessary to become a world-class consultant is the first step toward developing these skills. Being able to determine the areas where you have an opportunity to grow and learning how to cultivate these skills are important steps in the right direction.”Clearly, anyone can be a consultant and expert; even this reviewer has been known to don the consultant hat, yet there are many things he would equally not consult on, even if the end customer might not suspect a thing. Short-termism is an unattractive trait. One should aim for the long-term and a true partnership. Becoming an Oracle-class consultant? Who knows if that is always truly achievable…So in short, an excellent, powerful, considerate book that could stand you in good stead for a long time to come. Even if you think you know everything, a check of this book to be certain wouldn’t hurt, would it?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KBPY7ZK800F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071847804#wasThisHelpful","R5KBPY7ZK800F","A3F15EGM4FN2QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F15EGM4FN2QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These things are fantastic, I totally love them!  After a trip to India last year, I became enamored with the middle eastern decor including Indian temple windows, Moroccan walls, tiles and windows, and other tapestries, textures, grilles, carvings etc. and wanted to try to re-create the effect on the cheap.  Plus, I wanted to have a bit of a privacy screen on my hideous apartment windows that face the back side of other apartments across the way - while keeping me from seeing that view and them seeing me, and still letting in what dim light there is to be had - and doing it all in high style - I added these Wall Pops to my windows as you can see in the photos, and now my hideous eye-sore windows are my favorite part of the apartment!  I also used some contact paper border with a similar pattern (Brewster WPS93855 Wall Pops Tangier Stripe) to complete the effect, and couldn't be happier.  Sometimes when the sun shines for about 5 minutes through these Wall Pops I get a wonderful pattern sun dappling effect.The only thing is they are made of some sort of slick almost non-stick material and I used a roll of double sided foam tape to stick them up at each corner and many of them fell down within a day - I had to find an ULTRA sticky version to keep them from falling down.  They are perfect for my windows, and thin enough that they don't cause a problem when one window is slid open over the other. While some characterize them as ""flimsy"" I think you just have to consider what you're using them for - I found them easy to cut so I could combine a number of them on odd sized windows - I wouldn't want them thicker or harder to cut. There are other ""hard"" screen style privacy screens if that is what you're looking for, but if you use these for windows or walls they are just right. I would guess that even hanging free as room dividers you don't ""need"" them thicker unless that is a look you want - but you'll probably pay more for something thicker and heavier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OJQW8MCH6OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D53QRE#wasThisHelpful","R20OJQW8MCH6OB","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have become obsessed with Moroccan and other middle eastern style decor lately, and was searching for ways of duplicating the incredibly rich, multi textured designs of Moroccan interiors as well as Indian temples and other design elements uses on walls and windows.  Without spending a ton for the real thing (carved wood window grills, wall tiles, wrought screens etc.) I took a chance on this roll of border contact paper (essentially that is what the material is, the same stuff you line your drawers with) combined with some window squares (Wall Pops WPP0275 Honeycomb Decorative Hanging Room Division Panels) in hopes they would sort of create that certain feel and look and was really amazed and delighted with the fantastic impact these contact paper borders made on the walls around my windows.  I mean I really am IN LOVE with them - it makes the plain old ugly cement walls look like thick architectural elements of a Moroccan interior covered with beautiful tiles.  I've been looking around the rest of my apartment to think how I can add MORE of this.  Maybe the larger design squares.  And let me say also how EASY it was to roll it on. It's easy to re-position if you don't get it on totally straight at some point, but it sticks really WELL - even if you don't prep the surface (I had lots of built up dust and grime from the city air blowing in my windows on the window sills and peeling paint - I didn't clean or remove the curling up paint or anything - and this stuff just stuck right on top, made everything look clean and new, looks AMAZING and is not peeling off ANYWHERE.

"I gathered 8 different powdered sugars available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, trying to find something without the chalky gritty texture and did a taste test by mixing each into a milk and sugar glaze icing.THE CONTENDERS:{Powdered sugar:}[1] Dominos, [2] Bundaberg, [3] Tate & Lyle, [4] Miss Roben's, [5] Hain Organic, and [6] India Tree{Powdered invert sugar:}[7] CK Dry Fondant and [8]C&H Bakery Drivert (Domino's)THE RESULTS:[1] Dominos (with corn starch) - the one I grew up with. Has a distinctive taste of sugar and powdered dry wall.[2] Bundaberg Pure Icing Sugar (from Australia) (no starch) -  Has a good basic plain pure sugar taste, but fairly crunchy/gritty for powdered, even without any starch.

"It's definitely the THINNEST floss I've ever used. I didn't think it was even possible for floss to be thinner than everything else I've tried, but this stuff really does slip right between my tightest teeth.  That is the good.  The bad is that it does shred -- I have to move to a new area on the length of floss every few teeth because it does start to shred, and the little filaments that loosens from the main strand will start to stay between my tighter teeth - which then becomes annoying to try to get out.  So I've had to change my flossing technique - usually I'd get through my whole mouth only changing out the floss once, but I have to go for 3 or 4 strands with POH to stay ahead of the shredding.Not sure if I'll order more or just go back to my Duane Reade house brand after this - it's a bit thicker but it doesn't shred as much, plus I feel it has a bit more of a rough edged grip to scrape off the plaque - whereas the POH is slightly more smooth without quite the edge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140OFNE0N5OJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003STWCQA#wasThisHelpful","R140OFNE0N5OJZ","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE BAD[1] Too long:  At 36"" length, it turns out that make the zipper about 3 inches too long to easily reach down to connect the zipper and start zipping up-- instead you have to bunch the jacket up to grab both sides of the zipper to get it going, then because it's bunched up, you can't just easily zip it up, you have to  zip it up in stages as you smooth and straighten the coat back out again and align the two edges.  The coat I'm replacing is like this and I never realized that it was really all about the few inches of length, but since it bugged me the last few years with the old coat, I don't want to switch to another one that requires the same thing -- I'm switching to the Dawson Canada Goose which is 33"".  The coat will still keep me warm and that 3 inches less coverage will not make that much difference except for making the zipping process much simpler.[2] Red is not my type of red. I wear a cool or pure cherry red - not a tomato red.  Red is my favorite color, but tomato red grates on my nerves.  Red that leans towards cooler, maroon, orange, brick, washed out Nantucket red - all of those things grate on my nerve. I only like pure red. In the picture on my monitors the coat appears bright cherry red, but in person it's leaning towards tomato.[3] The pockets where you ostensibly warm your hands are in a bizarrely high location, I am literally putting my hands on my breasts when I put them in the pockets.  The lower pockets, sort of 'utility pockets' with flaps - are equally awkward to put your hands in, given they are not really meant for that, with top opening and front positioning.  Again, the Dawson coat is better designed in that it has pockets down lower where your hands naturally go into the pockets.THE GOODPer the Canada Goose website, this coat is a Level 4 warmth.  I went for a 3 mile stroll in short sleeves in 15 degree weather with this coat, no scarf or gloves or any other extra layer, and I was sweating by the end.  I could probably sleep in a snow drift in this coat.  I'm sending it back and getting the Dawson anyway (for reasons outlined above) which is a level 5.  The extra feature on the Dawson is a fleece layer where the neck closes - and while I haven't received it yet, I predict I will like that better than this Trillium - which has no lining where the neck closes, and in fact while the rest of me was sweating, my exposed chin was an ice cube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C4RM9LAKM186/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00508I74I#wasThisHelpful","R1C4RM9LAKM186","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mica is a beautiful and natural mineral that gives a golden glow to the light that is unlike any other type of lamp shade, for a warm atmosphere in your living space.  This lamp shade is a good quality, solidly made, and the bulb glows through beautifully.  I used it to replace the shade my floor lamp came with.The caveat I would note with any mica lamp shade is that Mica has unique properties in the way the light glows through with an amber color, but it also diffuses the light differently than a fabric or other shade, i.e. you can see relatively clearly where the bulb is located through the shade - and as such it is more crucial than any other type of shade to make sure you get the right harp so that the shade is positioned with the bulb close to mid-point between top and bottom.  If the bulb position is too close to the top or bottom it will be obvious when the light is on, and not look that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334C3FPNW6E2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UW7BUC#wasThisHelpful","R334C3FPNW6E2D","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is expensive for such a tiny little amount per packet, but I don't think there is any other product out there like it.  I use the Baiden mitten for my body, which is also unique to exfoliation in the same way, by rubbing damp skin you start getting the dead top layer to crumb up and roll off. Baiden make a more gentle version specifically for the face, but as many times as I've tried it as gently as possible, I still end up with some spots (like the eye brow where there is no padding under the skin to the bone) sort of abraded.  The face is just too delicate and fraught with difficult nooks and crannies for the Baiden mitten.  The perfect solution is this packet of Earthen Instant Peel - I actually find that I can get about 3 uses from one packet, it takes so little of the mud-like substance to work.  When I first tried it several years ago before I'd heard of Baiden or even knew that dead skin could crumb-up and roll off like this, I was completely skeptical and thought it was just the earthen mud substance itself that was crumbing as you rubbed it and it dried, I really did not believe that it was gathering dead skin cells - I thought it was a total gimmick to fool people.  I tested by going over the same area several times, rinsing and starting with fresh product, and noticed each time it would crumb up less and less until it wouldn't crumb up at all - meaning it had gotten off every last bit of the dead layer of cells.  Even then I wasn't convinced, I still thought possibly it was just your skin oils combining with the mud that made it crumb up and I was just using up the layer of oil (even though I have dry skin, this is what I thought).I put it away for a year still thinking it was not really doing anything, and then I discovered the Baiden mitten and finally learned that dead skin really DOES crumb up and roll off, and eventually it dawned on me that is what the Earthen product was doing - something in their formula manages to do the same thing with a mud-like substance (I can't even guess how). So I came back to try it again and was now firmly convinced it was truly exfoliating - and unlike the Baiden mitten, there are never any spots that are over-abraded, and it's easy to get into the recesses (like between the eye and nose-bridge etc.)  I had actually noticed for a while that inner eye-socket area was flaky and because of that, the cover stick I'd use for my under-eye circles would not go on smoothly, even using extra moisturizer did not fix it.  Well, I was amazed and delighted once I returned to trying this Earthen product the second time around and specifically concentrated on exfoliating that area - the flaking was totally gone and the cover stick went on smoothly on pristine baby-smooth skin - it really and truly worked!I'm unaware of any other product out there like this for the face - any other exfoliation peel is more likely going to be the harsh irritating acidic type that leaves your skin a little raw and sensitive for a few days or similar until the fresh new skin grows in, but the Earthen product does not utilize any kind of irritation or harshness at all, somehow it ONLY removes the dead layer and if you don't have any dead layers left, it simply does nothing - you couldn't get it to take off the live layers even if you wanted to.For anyone who hasn't tried it before, I recommend using this in the shower after your face has been soaking wet for a while, but towel drying it first, it takes about a minute of gentle rubbing before it starts to crumb your dead skin layer off - if you start with too damp skin it will take longer as it has to dry just a bit before it starts working.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ75HA9GWE5SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DY5NOW#wasThisHelpful","RQ75HA9GWE5SS","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother, sister and I make cookie houses for Christmas every year but usually bigger size, ranging from 6 to 8 inches high. The problem is so many cookie eaters are reluctant to break into a house to eat it and the truth is we want people to eat these, not just keep them on display. I figured a smaller house would enable people to feel free to eat them, as they are simpler, appear less 'labor intensive"" and are probably the equivalent of 1-2 large cookies. It still took a lot of convincing and encouraging to get people to take a house to eat (while there were cookies available to choose, they still went for the cookies).  With that said, they are so quick and easy to make and decorate, I'll probably make some every year - they may be good to include in the little assorted cookie plates I sometimes assemble as gifts.I would add one thing, the plastic cutter is noted as being heat sensitive and somehow I mistook that to mean it was heat resistant, so I made the cookies both ways, by cutting the dough and baking as is (they spread a bit obviously but can still be assembled without difficulty), or baking large areas of cookie and then cutting after baking while fresh out of the oven and still soft enough to cut into (this makes an exact, clean-line precisely sized house).  After cutting 2-3 three that way for valentine's cookie houses (cutting fresh out of the oven) I noticed the plastic was starting to warp and melt where it had contacted the hot sheet.  Given the necessity to cut while the cookie is hot and soft, it is also by definition also too hot to use a spatula to move it to a cool sheet before cutting without tearing it or blobbing it up - so I would say that they are not heat resistant enough to use this method -- I'm glad I got two of these (one had been meant as a gift), because I'm going to need to toss the melted one and use the remaining cutter in the future, and stick to cutting only the raw dough.  I think the reality is only a metal cutter would withstand repeatedly cutting fresh hot baked cookies from the sheet.  So understand what ""heat sensitive"" means!I've included a photo, you can see the smaller house with my hand beside it - which is 'hot cut', and in the foreground the closer/larger house was cut from the cold dough and baked (expanding/rounding a bit) - it looks just fine - there were no problems getting the expanded house forms to assemble and it looks cute with it's rounded edges - there is really no need to cut hot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8G3C2C6I33Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OX8NNFE#wasThisHelpful","R3T8G3C2C6I33Z","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The glow is spectacularly beautiful, just exquisite.  I can't say enough good things about this.  I ordered some other salt lamps (the loose rocks in the wire basket) and set them all over my apartment, then this order arrived about a week later and once I set it up, it blew the others away and I really wished I'd just ordered a bunch of THIS bowl instead.  It's just beyond.  Also unlike the other salt lamps I ordered which were so poorly packaged it was really a miracle to me that any of them arrived intact, this bowl was VERY well packaged with layers and layers of protection so you will get it in one piece, and the bulb is separate so it's safe from shattering if the box and salt rocks get dropped or shift along the way.The combination of the carved salt bowl, the red bulb, and the loose salt rocks piled on top is really the best possible way to take full advantage of the beautiful properties of the color and glow of light through this mineral.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM9LM66AF2GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZMFZD2#wasThisHelpful","R2RM9LM66AF2GB","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gathered 8 different powdered sugars available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, trying to find something without the chalky gritty texture and did a taste test by mixing each into a milk and sugar glaze icing.THE CONTENDERS:{Powdered sugar:}[1] Dominos, [2] Bundaberg, [3] Tate & Lyle, [4] Miss Roben's, [5] Hain Organic, and [6] India Tree{Powdered invert sugar:}[7] CK Dry Fondant and [8]C&H Bakery Drivert (Domino's)THE RESULTS:[1] Dominos (with corn starch) - the one I grew up with. Has a distinctive taste of sugar and powdered dry wall.[2] Bundaberg Pure Icing Sugar (from Australia) (no starch) - Has a good basic plain pure sugar taste, but fairly crunchy/gritty for powdered, even without any starch. Though I couldn't find what equivalent ""X"" count Bundaberg is rated, I'm guessing it's something like the coarser ""commercial grade"" 4X or 6X (as opposed to the finer 10X ""consumer grade"" typical of Dominos and most other consumer powdered sugar). I read on blogs some people don't like the extra gritty texture, while others claim without the starch it makes a smoother, less clumpy butter cream frosting. I'd have to test that another time. For the simple glaze though I didn't like being able to taste and feel the grit.[3] Tate & Lyle Icing Sugar (UK) (Maize starch) - I ordered this specifically because everywhere I looked on the internet sites where this product was mentioned or listed, it did NOT have corn starch, and instead had ""anti caking agent E341"". It arrive overseas finally, and sadly, it appears they are now using ""maize [corn] starch"" and no longer E341 (Calcium Phosphate). I was very disappointed.[4] Miss Roben's corn free powdered sugar (tapioca starch) - tastes a little off, everyone noticed when given a taste test comparison, and the tapioca starch is no less gritty than corn starch.[5] Hain Organic Powdered Sugar (Evaporated cane juice) with corn starch - has a much fuller sugar taste than all the rest, due to the fact that it's the whole evaporated cane juice - a rich hint of the molasses fills your mouth. Tastes great but when you don't necessarily want extra flavor and just want the sweetening - it wouldn't be my first choice. Plus, also due to the fact that it's not as refined, that trace of molasses does give any resulting ""white"" icing a distinctly golden/beige hue.[6] India Tree Powdered Cane Sugar - According to various sources and purveyors on the internet, the label (which states it is 1/100th the size sugar granule of regular powdered sugar) means ""twice as fine"" or 10xx compared with 10x (e.g. Domino's and other usual supermarket powdered sugars). My experience of tasting this was that the texture is most DEFINITELY finer. To the point where I almost could not detect any grit or grain at ALL between my teeth or on my tongue, and the taste is very clean and pure, no chalky or raw hint of anything from the 3 1/2% added corn starch. In terms of taste and smoothness it was almost on a par with the powdered invert sugars (which have no starch), and left all the other powdered sugars in the dust.{Re Powdered invert sugar aka dry fondant: these granulated/dehydrated invert sugars function the same as powdered sugar in glaze icing, but I'm not sure how they'd work in something like a cream cheese frosting. whipped cream, butter cream or royal icing e.g.}[7] CK Dry Fondant - like Hain - there is a very very small hint of the unrefined molasses remaining which means the product is slightly darker than C&H (Domino's) Drivert. This extra flavor tastes great, but I could see the darker shade both looking at the two powders side by side, as well as in the milk and sugar icings side by side. That was the con. The pro is the granules dissolved much faster than C&H.[8] C&H Bakery Drivert (Domino's) - Clean pure sugar, very white icing, but takes quite a lot of stirring and resting and waiting for the granules to fully dissolve (they aren't granules/crystals like regular sugar though). It does eventually dissolve however, and as neither of thw two powdered invert sugars/fondants have corn starch, they also result in icings with zero grit.THE FINAL JUDGMENT:[1] For my sugar cookie glaze icing - either one of the two powdered invert sugars/fondants will be the ""go-to"" product. The resulting icing texture is an amazing smooth mouth feel like the liquid fondant center of a fine candy.[2] For any recipe that absolutely requires the powder form and can't accommodate the extra mixing to dissolve the fondant granules, I would say nothing less than INDIA TREE ever again. This whole taste test gave me a great appreciation for how vastly superior India Tree's powdered sugar is compared to all the other true powdered sugars.[3] For recipes such as cookies and cakes that call for powdered sugar (since color isn't an issue), Hain Organic Powdered Sugar would be a great choice for it's exceptional flavor.

"It really is amazing what a small space the 100 feet take up, like other reviewers have said.  Also, like other reviewers noted, as you spread / uncoil this strand - there is a point or two you get to where it starts to tangle, and it becomes a combination of untangling a slinky, un-knotting wet shoe laces, and de-snarling long hair after a day at the beach. I'm the soul of persistence and patience with those things, and I scoffed when I read about others getting frustrated with the tangle, but this REALLY tested my patience!!!  You can not be a brute because the wire kinks into permanent knots if you're not careful untangling.  However, I've gotten them all tacked up, lining my entire apartment at the top of the wall where it meets the ceiling - and they are never coming down again.  They look great.  The color is not as warm as my incandescent lamps but it's ok for contrast.  Also, I was slightly concerned that the copper wire would show up against my white walls, but it really doesn't. All you see is the lights.One thing I would note for anyone thinking it would be nice to dim these since they are a bit bright - I have dimmer switch cords attached to all my lamps, so I tried the dimmer on this strand of lights and they do NOT dim. They go from on, to flicking on/off, to off.  No dimming whatsoever.  There are other strands of LED copper lights that do have dimming, but they are shorter strands and don't connect (that I could find), and I wanted one long strand so there wouldn't be cords snaking up my walls every 20 feet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WYXRS2EWUF70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZBVPSO#wasThisHelpful","R2WYXRS2EWUF70","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this in August and have been delighted ever since. I love how it perfectly blends in with my chrome faucet, not unsightly at all. And even though it's been 6 months, I am still extremely pleased how much easier and better it is to use than the filter pitcher I was using for all these years.  I love how I can just fill up a pot of water to boil for cooking, right from the faucet, where it used to be a plan ahead hassle to wait for the pitcher to filter enough, or just compromise and use straight tap water.I confess I did not change the filter at 2 months, I only changed it tonight for the first time (almost 6 moths).  I noticed the last few weeks the stream was getting slower, and the last couple days the water tasted distinctly off.  I had a hard time unscrewing the old filter, I actually had to get an adjustable wrench and open it wide enough to grab to of those triangle grip corners - I think being on so long it had developed some sort of suction - I really couldn't get it with my hands and even with the wrench it took a few turns before it loosened (like the suction broke?).  The replacement filter screwed in as easy as pie.  Maybe I should not wait more than 2 months next time :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BHD2Z99GMZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064MKTFY#wasThisHelpful","R14BHD2Z99GMZI","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's nice and thick, but I didn't realize it would be so heavy, that's why I took off the last star.  That's because I've never had a yoga mat or carried one, I am guessing they are all dense and heavy material so the thicker they are the heavier.  If I had it to do over I would get a thinner mat - my main need was non slip b/c I do my yoga at home and my hands and feet were slipping on my rug, this stops the slipping. I thought I needed extra cushioning too but now I don't think that I really did, my rugs have rug cushions under them, just the anti slip properties of a thinner mat would have been plenty.I don't know if there are yoga mats out there that are thick, anti slip, and also lighter, maybe others more experienced would know that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGR64YYPEF44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EC9MCQ#wasThisHelpful","RHGR64YYPEF44","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I calculated that you have to have five of these gummies to add up to the equivalent of ONE of the Digestive Advantage capsules (which I've taken for years).

But in truth I don't need that for just a typical day. I preferred the seamless automatic option without me having to press the button to switch it over halfway through the day.  The Trianium is set with only the option of manual switch over, and to me that is just annoying (and unnecessary) to have to do that extra step halfway through each and every day. So what can (and has) happened is I don't press the charge button when the phone starts displaying the low battery notice, and when I return from whatever I was doing I see the battery completely drained and the iPhone shut down. Now I'm faced with waiting the amount of time the phone takes to charge up to 5% before I can get it back on (a half hour?).[2] I plug my phone in each night to charge.  With the Mophie, the case would blink for a few seconds to confirm it is charging, then the lights would stop blinking and go off the rest of the night.  In contrast the Trianium turns the lights on the back of the case on when you plug in the charger and they stay on the ENTIRE night. Initially they are BLINKING for the hour or so that it takes to charge up the case and phone, then they go to steady once charged, but they are still on and SHINING BRIGHT.  They are BRIGHT lights and being only a foot away from my face while I'm trying to sleep it's a big PITA, now I have to bury the phone in a basket and position the back of the case away so the bright light is lessened.[3] The Trianium case (like the Mophie case) comes around the phone with the edge raised a bit as a bumper, which is of course what you want, so when it's face down the phone is raised up to protect the phone face surface.  However, on the Trianium that thick bumper layer also comes right to the very edge of the finger print button (like a millimeter away?) which makes it just a little bit of a challenge to get your finger to lay flat and recognize the print.  On the Mophie case there is significantly more space between the case bumper and that button (3-4 millimeters?) which is an important improvement in easing the fingerprint recognition. I've posted photos from the same angle to show the comparison.[4] The Trianium case has it's own volume buttons built into the case that you press which in turn press the iPhone volume buttons.  It's hard to describe but they feel clunky and take a bit of extra pressing to activate the iPhone buttons underneath, just clunky enough that I find myself not wanting to bother using the volume buttons. The Mophie buttons somehow have more of a seamless feel, like the case buttons mimic the iPhone buttons in look and feel when pressing.PLUSES:[1] I will give the Trianium one point in favor, the sound SWITCH (on/off) area is cutout so you reach in with your finger or fingernail to turn the sound on or off easily. The Mophie, in contrast, has a case button which only very loosely engages with the iPhone's on/off button underneath so you have to press quite deliberately to actually move the tiny (real) switch underneath, otherwise if you just casually slide the switch (like with your fingernail) to what you think is on or off, you very likely haven't actually switched the real button on the iPhone (which you can tell because the screen confirms with the display that comes up showing the ""Ringer"" or ""Ringer Silent""). This is something I find to be a ridiculously flawed design point on the Mophie especially considering how much everything else about it is much finer engineering.Other than the points above, both cases do the basic job, which is extending the battery life, and generally protecting. I haven't experienced any of the problems other reviewers have noted, such as faulty or unreliable syncing or charging, nor have I dropped my phone with either case to discover whether it falls off or not. The bulk and weight seem to be comparable for both cases.  My preference is hands down the Mophie, the four negatives listed about the Trianium might seems minor but they add up to a lot of niggling irritations I am aware of each day and night, and the Mophie is simply better in those ways so that aside from the on/off switch, it's not calling attention to itself and just works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20P96KZBARWF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTCCHG6#wasThisHelpful","R20P96KZBARWF5","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's OK if your only concern is bright light, such as in a bathroom.  But as an equivalent substitute of a warm incandescent living room light, it's not even close.  I tried a 2400k LED which approached similar to incandescent, but side-by-side with an incandescent this 2700k was a lot cooler. It's weird to me that they can call these ""warm"" - as far as I can tell they are only warm in a totally ""relative"" sense, i.e. warmer than cooler LED lights, but they really aren't warm at all if you compare them with a normal standard warm incandescent.I don't know what machine/monitor rates these at 2700 and calls that warm or equivalent of incandescent, because my eyes can clearly see a big big difference.  The monitors have a faulty measuring ability if you ask me, since they don't match what the eye sees.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRGFGRENUDQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4V4VE0#wasThisHelpful","R3RRGFGRENUDQO","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a tiny NYC apt. with a tiny kitchen and very limited counter space, but I keep my iPad on my counter at all times since I use it primarily with my cookbook app.  However, the previous iPad stand I used kept my iPad down too close to the counter and it got a lot of splatters and splashes, and the stand took up a bit much real estate.  This Tail takes up a certain amount of counter real estate but it's way easier to navigate other items like cords etc. under and around the ""tail"", it's easier to re-position as needed because the ""tail"" can worm it's way into tight spaces, and my iPad is higher up out of splatter zone, and I love how easy it is to change the angle if needed.

"If you're just looking to neutralize moderately bad odors such as guest bathrooms, I personally think I'll stick with Lysol Neutra Air. A few of the smellier house guests used it and it really did neutralize, not just mix in with, the malodors.  I thought that the neutralizing concept was so exciting I'd go all the way and get a super powerful version - and tried this OZIUM.  However, unless you have a nursery, or pot smoke, or a sick room, like really severe odors to combat, I don't think you need something this powerful, because the smell of the spray itself is really yucky.  Yes it dissipates (after half hour or an hour I guess?) but meanwhile I avoid the room where it was sprayed exactly they way I'd avoid it if there was simply a malodorous house guest who'd just used the bathroom.  I can hardly say which smells worse in truth, and both smells naturally dissipate in the same amount of time anyway.  Hence my recommendation for moderate smells is something that smells good instantly, i.e. the Lysol Neutra Air - you don't have to wait a second for that to dissipate.  This OZIUM is for severe problems, in rooms where you need long term help and don't mind leaving the room abandoned for an hour while it works.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129SXV5Q66AJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PRYUAW#wasThisHelpful","R129SXV5Q66AJW","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Better tone than the others I've tried.  Despite the numbers the industry claims are equivalent to ""warm"" light color (at 2700k or 3000k the others did not even come close to the true warmth of incandescent), at 2400k this was actually almost the same warm/yellow light as the lamp next to it with a real incandescent bulb.However, the caveat is that LED bulbs do not get warmer as they are dimmed, they stay the same ""color"" they are at full brightness, which creates a hard to describe dim but white light, whereas real incandescent dim by getting warmer and warmer and more amber gold until they are like candle light.  LED may never do that.As such, if you aren't super concerned with the ability to dim down to rich golden amber candle light but generally warm is OK, then these are OK, and most definitely better than the standard so-called ""warm"" LED bulbs out there (i.e. 2700k-3200k) which if anything are more like the white flourescent color.Personally I've decided the golden amber candle-lit color ambience in my living room is far more important than saving a few bucks on lightening over a lifetime and I'm going to spring for the incandescent bulbs that are still around via loopholes (some of the squirel cage edison bulbs for example).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55FLC74KYX3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHX17BM#wasThisHelpful","R55FLC74KYX3C","A2EWF2OWK60DJW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EWF2OWK60DJW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a rather cheaply made product. It is flimsy and plasticky. The outer polypropylene shell is thin and looks cheap. The interior has a plasticky foil lining but there is hardly any insulation in it. The whole thing looks like something you may find in a dollar discount store. It doesn't look like it would stand up to daily use neither.The only thing going for it is the Realtree camo pattern. The print is ok (could have been sharper).

"This is an excellent Dummies guide. It provides in-depth coverage from Android Lollipop 5.1 as well as KitKat 4.4 and Jelly Bean 4.3. It is well written and organized, with clear instructions and explanations in various topics. Each topic is standalone and is easy to jump into. That is, you can simply lookup the things you want to do with your Android phone and jump right into it for the answer. I like how the author makes the text both easy and entertaining to read and follow. There are unexpected humors in addition to the traditional textbook instructions, so it's fun to read and learn about what you can do with your phone. Furthermore, the book is printed in full color which makes screenshots easy to view and compare to the actual screen on your phone.Overall, if you are new to the Android or simply want to find more about the new version 5.1, this book is for you. It breaks down the whole thing into small, standalone tasks that you can learn at your own pace, or just dive right into the specific topics for your answers.

"First off, this is my first NAS and my experience with NAS in general is rather limited. That being said, I find this entry-level NAS more than meets my needs for a general file server and UPnP media server. It runs fast and performs well with those expectations in mind.The AS1002T NAS is fairly easy to setup. No tools are required. Hand screws are used to secure the external case and to mount the hard drives inside. For this NAS, I picked up a couple of Western Digital Red hard drives and mounted them in the unit (I first formatted them in EXT4).The NAS is mostly plastic on the outside. However, it is sturdy and well built. The diamond-plate finish in the front panel is stylish. It runs very quietly. It has an exhaust fan at the back but it is no louder than the hard drives themselves. It also runs cool, barely warm to the touch. The 4 LED indicators are just about the right intensity, which works out nicely in my media center as it doesn't cause distraction in a darkened environment.As a file server, the NAS is pretty fast. I consistently get a read speed in the 100 MB/s range over a wired connection in my gigabit network. Write speed is a tad slower, around 90 MB/s, which is still plenty fast for my purpose. I do not use the built-in hardware encryption since I don't have a need for it and it supposedly reduces the transfer speed by more than half according to the manual.It also works great as a media server. It streams my music and videos with any problems. It serves my videos in their native M2V format to my HDTV perfectly. It doesn't need to transcode my videos. I don't expect an entry-level NAS to be able to do so anyway.The NAS is loaded with many apps. There are a FTP server, download center, iTunes server, surveillance center, syslog server, just to name a few. Honestly speaking, I don't know much about these apps and I don't really have a use for any of them anyway. I just need a file server with RAID 1 mirroring and a simple media server. For these purposes, the NAS works great for me.Overall, I really like this NAS. It's simple and cost-effective. It also runs cool and quiet. It serves my basic needs with good performance. At this price, it is an easy recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISMQ484MAECC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YN6IK4#wasThisHelpful","R2ISMQ484MAECC","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful hardcover cookbook with amazing recipes that are easy to follow and lovely to appreciate. There are recipes for meats & poultry, seafood, soups, vegetables, appetizers, breads and desserts. Practically a little something for everybody. Easy recipe is neatly organized and easy to glance through - a short description of the dish and serving size, followed by list of ingredients in the left column and the step-by-step instructions in the right column. Scattered throughout the pages are some of the eye-candy, mouth-watering, gorgeously taken, full-page photographs of the finished products for probably around half of the recipes in the book.Most of these recipes make use of commonly available, everyday ingredients instead of exotic ingredients that are pretty to read about but hard to prepare with. Some of these recipes are simple and easy to follow. Others are more gourmet and yet not too difficulty to prepare for. There are something for everything. Meat & seafood lovers, vegans, soup eaters, snack & dessert fans will be pleased to find a good variety of recipes that they will enjoy.Overall, this is a beautiful cookbook filled with many different recipes to try. My exposure to Portuguese cooking is very limited. As such, I can't verify the authenticity of these Portuguese recipes in the cookbook. That being said, these recipes do look delicious and not difficulty to follow. The book itself is gorgeously written and presented. If you are a fan of ethnic cooking or culinary art in general, you will love this cookbook (I do).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3629U1IULOXIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141943#wasThisHelpful","R3629U1IULOXIU","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are tons of materials that are practical and useful for students to improve their score on the new, revamped SAT exams.This book is heavy and substantial, nearly 2 3/4"" thick. It is organized into four main parts: (1) Math - a summary review of the math topics, with thoughtful strategy on how to tackle the specific problems and extra practices to drill on, (2) Evidence-Based Reading and Writing - Kaplan methods for reading comprehension, reasoning skills, writing & language and infographics, (3) the Essay - the Kaplan method for the SAT essay, and (4) 2 full new SAT test practices with answers. In addition to this printed book, there is a DVD filled video tutorials and access to an online center with additional study tools, as well as three more tests to practice on.All in all, this book is a tremendous resource for preparing for the new SAT exams. There are many study guides and tools for SAT preparation, but few are complete with everything neatly organized in an easily accessible form.

"I'm really impressed with this anti-fog treatment product. It works great just as advertised. I tried it on my own glasses and put them over a pot of boiling water. The steam didn't fog them up. They remained clear as if nothing was on its surface. It is amazing. Just a drop or two on the glass surface (both sides), then use the finger to spread and cover the entire surface and let it dry. Finally use a microfiber cloth to gently and lightly rub the surface to clean up any smudges (rubbing it too hard could remove the treatment). The included microfiber cloth is of great quality and cleans my glasses very well.All in all. This is an excellent anti-fog treatment product for any glasses and goggles. It works amazingly well. One application lasts nearly the whole day and the treatment is completely reversible. Simply wash it with soap and water to remove it permanently.

"These are decent bubble bath & shower gel. As a shower gel, they produce moderate amount of lathers and clean well but I also have to use more than usual in order to cover my whole body. The scent is very nice. I like the lavender the best, which is the most intense out of the three, with the milk & honey the least intense. The fragrance is intense initially, but dissipates quickly and by the time I finish rinsing, it's all gone.I don't do bubble both often but I tried it with the lavender bottle anyway. I followed the directions and put in the recommended amount. However, I was quickly disappointed by the results. It didn't produce many bubbles and they weren't long lasting neither. Half way through my bath, the bubbles mostly disappeared. The only saving grace was the nice lavender scent at the start of the bath.I do like that it is paraben, phthalate and SLS free, and very well suited for sensitive skin, and that it is also made in USA.Overall, I think they are best used as a show gel. If you like to infuse your senses with intense fragrance during a shower, this will work nicely. Keep in mind that the fragrance dissipates fairly quickly and quite a lot of the gel is necessary for a good shower. It cleans well and rinses off easily. That said, I don't think the retail price is worth it though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7VG4C5LYT0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVD9JOE#wasThisHelpful","RC7VG4C5LYT0P","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Learn Game Programming with Ruby is an introductory book to 2D game programming for beginners. It is based on the Ruby programming language and makes use of the Gosu 2D game development library and the Chipmunk physics library. Readers are assumed to have basic programming skills in Ruby as there is no tutorial. The book guides the readers through the process of writing four very different games, which cover many aspects of basic game programming that may be extended or pieced together as the basis for more complex games.The book first guides the reader to download and set up their Ruby development kit and libraries. From then on, it shows the readers how to write their first game, expand it, and then writing more but very different games as a way to show different techniques in game programming. The complete source code for the four games can be downloaded from the publisher's website.The last part of the book shows the readers how to package their game for sharing.The book is divided into the following main chapters, which should give you an idea of what the book is about.1. Introduction2. Get Ready3. Creating Your First Game4. Creating a Sprite-Based Game5. Managing Lots of Sprites6. Adding Scenes and Sounds7. Creating a Puzzle Game8. Making a Platformer Game with Physics9. Making a Side-Scrolling Game10. Package and Share Your GameThe book is well written and fun to follow. It's well suited to beginners who want to learn about 2D game programming in general. Ruby is one of the easier languages to learn. It's a great candidate for learning game programming in this book. Readers can focus on how to write games instead of learning how to program in Ruby. All in all, this book is a great and fun way to learn 2D game programming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1917WMCFTNRYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680500732#wasThisHelpful","R1917WMCFTNRYI","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a norm that notebook computers do not usually come with an Ethernet port these days since WiFi is so prevalent and widely available everywhere. That said, sometimes it is very useful to have a computer connected via Ethernet for setup and troubleshooting purposes. For instance, when I set up a brand new wireless router, I connect to it by hard wire and change its default IP and netmask. That's where this Ethernet adapter will come in handy.While this Ethernet adapter isn't the smallest I've seen, it has a very convenient feature - having the USB connector conveniently tugged in the adapter when it's not in use, so no more tangling cable sticking out.Setup is pretty easy. It is plug-and-play on my Windows 10 laptop as it recognizes it automatically. However, my MacBook Pro, which I have recently upgraded to El Capitan, does not recognize it until I download a driver for it. So it is not plug-and-play on a Mac. At the time of writing, drivers for Mac and Win2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 are available for download from the manufacturer's website.Transfer speed through this adapter is excellent. It's significantly faster than my wireless-N network and noticeably faster than my wireless-AC. The connection is very stable and I don't have any problems at all. One thing to note. You'll need to plug it into a USB 3.0 port in order to achieve the 1 gigabit Ethernet speed though. Also, this adapter doesn't appear to work on Wii U, despite what the Amazon's product description says (the manufacturer's product page makes no mention of Wii U compatibility neither).Overall, this is a great gigabit Ethernet adapter. It works great and the price is very affordable. A great value for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYKOVBT3C0W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUU3KC6#wasThisHelpful","R1CYKOVBT3C0W7","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent dental chews for small to medium sized dogs. There are three 3-point dental chews in each pack, each of which can easily be broken into 3 separate smaller chews. The chews are covered with nubs that are supposed to help clean their teeth. I usually give dental chews to my dog once or twice a week to help her maintain her dental health. While these chews will work fine as dental chews, they are really expensive (more than $1 per small chew). There are more affordable options that work great.My dog seems to enjoy these chews. They have a strong beefy flavor that she likes. They also seem to be hard to chew as she really needs to work hard on them. I don't think these chews would be suitable for senior dogs with dental problems. For younger dogs, these are quite long lasting chews that would keep them occupied and help clean their teeth.The number one ingredient is wheat starch, so these chews are not grain free. They are made in USA and appear to be quality treats.Overall, these are good dental chews, albeit expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS99UXXNXBET3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH4LRK#wasThisHelpful","RS99UXXNXBET3","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This treat lasted no longer than 15 minutes after I have given it to my small dog. It is advertised as long lasting chews but it is not when it's completely gone in less than 15 minutes. $8 for 15 minutes of enjoyment seems to be rather expensive. The dino shape is cute but I doubt dogs would care for the shape. There are some nubs on the chew which may have some dental benefits. The bacon & beef flavor is strong and seems appealing to her. It is said to be a natural treat but the number one ingredient is wheat. I usually prefer natural treats with no grain, corn, etc. I gave it to my dog anyway and she seemed to like it. I wish it would be more long lasting though. Overall, it is a decent chew but I don't think it is a good value though.List of ingredients: wheat starch, glycerin, pea protein, rice flour, powdered cellulose, lecithin, natural bacon flavor, natural roast beef flavor, dried chicken, natural flavor, oat fiber, potato starch, calcium carbonate, soy flour, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin supplement, niacin supplement, calcium pantothenate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, vitamin A supplement, vitamin E supplement, biotin, choline chloride, inositol, p-aminobenzoic acid, ferrous carbonate, magnesium oxide, dicalcium phosphate, potassium chloride, sodium selenite, calcium chloride, zinc oxide, copper oxide, manganous oxide, and sodium molybdate.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250OF23Q2YVQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123LGOTO#wasThisHelpful","R250OF23Q2YVQS","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a remarkable and handsome watch, very modern and masculine looking. It is substantial in size and weight, with a 45mm stainless steel case and a thickness of 13mm. There are three sub-dials for the chronograph, two of which are silver colored and look striking in the predominantly black bezel and main dial. There is also a date window between the 4 and 5 o'clock position. The bezel has a matte black finish and is fixed (nonrotatable).The watch really stands out on my medium sized wrist. It is hefty and substantial. Very manly looking. I have received a few compliments from friends and co-workers.The watch uses a Japanese chronograph quartz movement, specifically the Hattori Japan VD53. This is a popular and trusty Seiko caliber movement. The battery type is #371 SR920SW.The band length is adjustable, though you'll need some tools to remove a pin from each removable link in the band. There is an arrow marking to indicate the direction the pin will come out from. I usually use a blunt needle and a small hammer to push those pins out. If you're not comfortable, you can always take your watch to the watch store to get it adjusted for a small fee.The watch comes in a very attractive presentation box, which is an oversized, bright yellow Invicta box. Invicta makes some of the most deluxe, highly presentable boxes for consumer watches that I have seen. It looks very desirable for gifting purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20TP61NHIF91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XXJ0#wasThisHelpful","R20TP61NHIF91","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these dong treat bones hoping that they would occupy my dog for a good while since they are advertised to be long lasting. I used to buy rawhide bones until they began to upset her stomach but they were really long lasting. Well, not these salmon dog bones. They didn't even last 10 minutes each. That said, they do have a palatable smell that she was very excited about. When I gave her one, she immediately went to work on it. I do like they are made of limited ingredients and do not container grains. They did not cause her any stomach problems. Overall, they seem good and healthy but are not long lasting at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25CUL9MZRBBS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123LGDWM#wasThisHelpful","R25CUL9MZRBBS5","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Oxford NY Classic Fit Gabardine Dress Pants are excellent. They fit me perfectly for my size. They are soft and comfortable to wear. The polyester fabric is light and quite wrinkle resistant. The color is a true deep black and opaque although the fabric is light and thin.The waist band uses a metal hook and a button for closure. It also features a short elastic section on both sides that can extend a little, so these pants will remain comfortable even after a full meal. The zipper runs smoothly with problems. The pocket lining fabric is quite thick and durable. Anyhow, I have run these pants through the washer and dryer once, and they did neither shrink nor fade. It looks like they would be a long lasting pair of pants.Overall, I'm really impressed with these pants. They have the true classic look and yet have some nice features such as the waist band extender. They are nice and sharp looking as well. After having washed them and trying them for the day, I can't honestly find any problems with these pants. So they are 5 stars worthy to me. I would recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K48A8E6EEYIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVL28QC#wasThisHelpful","R3K48A8E6EEYIW","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just an average headphone at best. The build quality is decent but the sound is mediocre. I'm not overly impressed with it.The headphone comes with a bone shaped silicone cable organizer, 3 different sets of silicone earbud tips (S/M/L) and warranty paper. The angled earbuds and silicone tips are quite comfortable to wear, even for long hours. The earbuds don't seem to fall out easily (if you wear them correctly by pulling your ear a little as you insert each earbud deep into your ear canal). The flat cable is tangle resistant but a little kinky when it's first out of the box. There is good strain relief for the cable on the earbud end but none on the stereo plug end, so longevity of the cable at the plug end could be an issue. On a positive note, the straight plug is small and should fit through most phone cases without any problems.The control box is on the right earbud wire and has three buttons and a mic. Its build quality leaves a lot to be desired. The up volume button clicks when it is pressed but the down volume button doesn't for my review copy. It doesn't look like it is well built. Anyway, the middle button works as expected on my iPhone - single press for play/pause, double press for next track and triple press for previous track. The volume controls do not work on the iPhone. They work on Android though.The biggest problem with this headphone is the sound. It is mediocre. The bass is present but not as bass heavy as the ""extra bass"" label may have you believe. It is boosted but not deep. The treble is actually pretty good though. It is crisp and clear. On the other hand, the mid range is largely recessed and seriously lacking. Vocals do not sound rich nor full at all. It could really use a boost. The product box has a frequency response curve on it (see attached picture). It has a very noticeable dip around 1-2 kHz.Overall, this headphone is only average at best. For the price, there are other better sounding headphones to consider.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HQZ0WBQG7O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X4UVNE#wasThisHelpful","R18HQZ0WBQG7O9","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been to Manhattan and spent a good number of days exploring the borough extensively but I never thought of visiting Brooklyn. This Fordor's Brooklyn guide really intrigues me to visit this borough in my next trip to the NYC.This book is very unlike any guidebook that I have seen. It does not contain any photographs of the borough and anything from it. Instead, it has some artsy illustrations and illustrated maps, with the front cover being a good example of them. The book divides the borough into 18 neighborhoods that are individually covered in their own chapters. This is preceded by an overview introduction to borough that gives you a highlight of what it has to offer. Each chapter contains a brief introduction, top sights, shopping, places to eat & drink, hotels, nightlife, performing arts, etc. Basically, great lists of places and establishments with brief explanation of why people go there and for what, hopefully some good suggestions for everybody.All in all, this is an interesting and unique guidebook to Brooklyn, possibly the first of its kind for the borough. It is a rather small book, about 5/8"" thick, and quite portable that you can bring it with you during your trip. Good coverage of the neighborhoods in Brooklyn. I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36NLO3CQWE8YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101878231#wasThisHelpful","R36NLO3CQWE8YY","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used XEN-TAN self tanning products before and they work really well for me. This Mousse Intense Weekly Tan is no exception. It is in a mousse form that goes on the skin easily. I usually spread it evenly with a tanning mitt for a streak free application. It has a mild vanilla scent, totally unlike the chemical smells of other tanning products. It dries fairly quickly and leaves behind a nice instant color. The color is a natural looking medium olive undertone, without any orangey tinge. It's a great looking tan that I really like.The tan lasts about 4-5 days before another application is necessary. It isn't bad since it's rather easy and pleasant to apply. I am really amazed with the medium tan it leaves without any orangey hue. If you are trying this product, make sure you use a tanning mitt, it really makes a difference in a streak free application.

"I'm not really impressed with this outdoor agility kit. I have been looking for a good-quality and durable agility kit to train my dog with. Unfortunately, this isn't it.First off, it is quite small and short, just large enough for a small dog, maybe a small-medium dog. It will not work for a large dog. Secondly, the quality of the materials and construction leaves a lot to be desired. The plastic material used seems inferior and soft. It doesn't look durable to me. The nylon fabric in the tunnel is flimsy and thin. It seems like the whole kit isn't built to last.The weave poles are made of long, flimsy plastic tubes and measure 21.5"" in length. They each come with a plastic stake that you hammer into the ground and plug the tube onto it. The tubes look flimsy enough that they may eventually split at the ends which would make it impossible to keep them firmly on the stakes. The jump hoop is a joke. It is assembled by putting 5 arc pieces together to form the hoop, which is then attached to two similar tube poles via a coupler on each side. The couplers are 2-piece, loop and pole connectors attached together that are meant to break away under excessive force. It seemed like a good design until you realize the fact that the hoop is made of flimsy hollow tubes and the couplers are thin plastic parts. The tunnel is about 24"" in diameter and just over 2 feet long, too short to be of any use for an obstacle course. On the positive side, it has 4 little loops at the bottom with which you can hold the tunnel firmly to the ground using the metal stakes provided.Overall, this a mediocre agility kit for small to medium sized dogs. Perhaps, it may be adequate if you're simply looking for a starter kit to try out. However, if your dog has been through training classes, this kit is likely not going to work. This kit isn't built to last neither. It may be good for a season or two. One last thing, it does come with a nice circular zipper storage bag, so it is easy to carry or store away.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3R3ESXKJ9RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRBF4LU#wasThisHelpful","R2K3R3ESXKJ9RY","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great self-tanning lotion. It has a nice consistency that goes on the skin smoothly. I have the XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt which makes it easy to apply an even coat on the skin for a streak free application. It dries fairly quickly and leaves a nice color on the skin that doesn't stain clothing. I was initially worried that it would turn into an orangey or too dark a color that seems to be a common problem with many self-tanning lotion. I'm glad that it isn't the case. The resulting color is not too light nor too dark. It's a rather natural looking olive base color. It also has a pleasant, refreshing scent during the application. I'm really happy with it.The color doesn't begin to fade until the day 3 or day 4. So the weekly application is about right.

"This is my first time using a concealer and so far I'm really impressed with it. It does a fairly good job of hiding the razor burn that I got yesterday. It comes in a large chapstick tube container and appears like clay to me. It looks darker in the tube than it does on the skin. I used my finger to dab a bit of it and rub it on my razor burn spots. It takes a bit of time to get absorbed and blend in evenly. That said, it does mask the redness from razor burn fairly well but not the bumps or swelling. When I look close enough in the mirror, I can also see what appears to be a makeup on my face although it is very light.

The shiny finish really adds a new dimension to the overall decor.The faucet comes with a pop-up drain assembly, although it isn't specified in the product description. The installation manual is clear and easy to follow. I'm no plumber but I was able to follow the instructions and install the faucet and the drain assembly in a little over an hour.

"The Vitamin World Ultra Man Daily Multi is one of the most complete multivitamin supplements I have ever tried. Not only does it offer a wide variety of vitamins and minerals in one single formula but also provide them in high dosage. Most of these exceeds their recommended percent daily value, with vitamins B-1, B2, B6 and B-12 at 16-33x the daily value. Calcium, magnesium, chloride and potassium are quite low though. For some reason, iron is not provided in this supplement. In addition to vitamins and minerals, the supplement also includes some extra goodies, such as a proprietary blend of amino acids, a bioactive blend (pumpkin seed, oyster extract, saw palmetto extract) and an antioxidant blend.The timed release caplets are not large but quite easy to swallow. There is no aftertaste. Directions are to take 2 caplets daily preferably with a meal. I simply take one in the morning and another in the evening. A bottle of this should last for 90 days, which is a pretty good value for the current price (less than $10 per month). Hopefully this supplement would be able to fill in any dietary deficiency I may have as a result of a busy life and not eating right most of the time. It seems like a good, fully loaded supplement to take care of your body's needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TYLB2QMA8I0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9K8H5I#wasThisHelpful","R2TYLB2QMA8I0R","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice quality sport pants. They are a little small in the waist line and long in length. It appears that they would be well suited to slimmer and taller kids. The polyester fabric is soft and comfortable. It looks like it may be very lightly lined (hard to tell if it is a lining). The elastic waistband is about 1"" wide and quite heavy duty. The two front pockets are made from the same fabric, so they are sturdy and less likely to get a hole.The side stripes are gray in color with white edges (in between the stripe and pants), which are the actual color described in the product color selection. The stripes has a separate lining in the interior, which appears to be the ""piping"" stated in the product description. Nevertheless, there is an issue in those stripes. They are not consistent in their width. Some parts are narrower while others are wider. This may be a consistency issue in the cutting and workmanship. Though it doesn't affect the overall shape and durability of the pants in any way.All in all, these are good quality pants. The fabric quality is great and the workmanship is good. It's just narrower and lengthier than other athletic pants of the same size that I bought for my boy. They just hang down on his shoes and then some, but not long enough to trip him over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JD5QRQ5B2XTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01092ZJTA#wasThisHelpful","R2JD5QRQ5B2XTD","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are fantastic, college themed disposable cups. They are sturdy and similar to the popular Red Solo cups in terms of quality and strength. The 18 oz. size is great for party use. Hefty did not cut corners when it comes to printing the college logos on the cups. The printing is perfectly aligned and the colors are vivid and spot on. I did not find any problems with the printing at all. These cups are certainly a fun and an entertaining way to show your support for your favorite team. Great for tailgating or backyard BBQ's on the game day.

"This is fantastic and well made hooded jacket. It's sturdy and heavy, and apparently designed to keep warm in cool weather. The style is classic and nice looking. The interior of the torso area and the hood is lined with fleece that is soft and comfortable. The outer shell seems somewhat padded and robust. The branding and design is solidly embroidered in the outer shell, very well done. The zipper operates smoothly and doesn't catch the lining easily.My teenage son really likes this hoodie. It looks smart and cozy to him. The fit is snug and somewhat small. I would recommend one size up if you prefer a loose fit. The whole hoodie has a high quality feel to it and doesn't look cheaply made. It is very comfortable to wear and plenty warm for the late fall or early spring weather, maybe even a mild winter. I'm really amazed at the excellent quality at such an affordable price. I wish they would make an adult size for myself. I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OS7GZ70DJPZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O42ULGI#wasThisHelpful","R1OS7GZ70DJPZA","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting body lotion that you apply to wet skin at the end of a shower and rinse off. It appears to to work fairly well, except for a few issues.This in-shower body lotion is easy to spread on the wet body. It does take a fair amount of it to cover the whole body, so a bottle of it may not last very long. It rinses off easily and completely, but I don't feel nothing on my skin after I step outside of the shower. However, after my skin dries up, I do feel a slight tacky feel to it. This leads me to believe that the body lotion does leave a film or something on my skin even after I have rinsed it off. After using it for a few days, I can safely say that I do feel a noticeably softer and lightly moisturized skin. It doesn't feel as drastic as using a regular body lotion that you rub into your skin. It doesn't leave a greasy feel on my skin neither.Since you do use a fair amount of it to cover your wet body, some of it will inadvertently fall on the shower floor. It's slippery and you'll have to take the effort to rinse it thoroughly off the floor in order to prevent a fall risk. It does soften and moisturize the skin somewhat, but I don't find it consistent over the body. My torso, arms and thighs feel moisturized but my hands and feet do not. The regular Eucerin body lotion would give me a better result and a more consistent coverage. Anyhow, I'll have to give you that it does not leave a greasy feel at all.The lotion is fragrance free. That said, it has a very mild scent that's probably associated with the chemicals used. It's not unpleasant and hardly detectable during normal use anyway. The lotion is quite gentle on my sensitive skin. It doesn't bother me at all.Overall. this is a nice body lotion to use in a shower. However, I don't really feel it is as intensive as a regular body lotion. On the positive side, it does give you a truly non-greasy feel. No fragrance to linger around. You just have to clean up the floor after use, and use a regular body lotion once in a while to supplement it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16W8I2OCFH6EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107QOZ66#wasThisHelpful","R16W8I2OCFH6EY","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This seems to me like a flavored sports drink infused with electrolytes, branched-chain amino acids, antioxidants and an essential vitamin & mineral blend. I usually use regular sports drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade to replenish my hydration and energy needs during and after gym exercises. When I received the Everlast Nutrition Fuel, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works. About 5-10 minutes after I drank it, I could feel an energy boost that allowed me to carry on with my exercise routines. After the exercises, I also felt a quicker recovery both mentally and physically.The drink tastes just okay. It's like a flavored water with a weak citric taste. It is easy to make, just pour a stick of the powder into a 8-12 oz. chilled water and stir vigorously. The powder doesn't always dissolves completely and some settle at the bottom of the bottle. It's a little gritty near the bottom but it isn't too bad. Despite that, it does provide the fuel I need for my workout, and help me recover faster.I like that this drink doesn't contain caffeine that may boost energy at the expense of a caffeine crash afterwards. I have experienced no ill side effects after using this drink. It seems to work much better than my regular sports drinks. It is not very tasty but convenient and easy to use. I would recommend this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OY5TL67BBB4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7YZ7IO#wasThisHelpful","R1OY5TL67BBB4O","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This facial cleansing powder does work as advertised. Just a small dab of it on a wet hand creates a little foamy lather that is creamy and silky smooth. It is practically scentless and gentle on sensitive skin. The soapy lather is easy to apply to the wet face and rinse off fairly easily with few splashes of water. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. It also seems to have a slight moisturizing effect since my skin doesn't feel overly dry and tight right afterwards.It is interesting that this powder contains various flower and plant based extracts from chamomilla, ginkgo biloba, coneflower, rhodymenia palmata, chrysanthemum parthenium, just to name a few. Yet it is nearly scentless. There is a very mild scent but I could not really detect it during use. Moreover, it is very gentle and doesn't cause any reactions to my sensitive skin. As such, it is specially suitable for those with high sensitivity to fragrance or with sensitive skin.The only gripe I have with this product is the opening slider on top of the bottle. The slider is very easy to engage and open on a slight touch. If you throw it in your bag, it may open by itself and create a powdery mess inside the bag. I wish the manufacture would make the slider harder to engage or go with a flip-top lid that can snap shut tightly. Anyway, it is solely an issue with the packaging, not the cleansing powder itself.Overall, I'm very happy with this facial cleansing powder. It is easy to use and cleanses well. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. It is nearly scentless, gentle on the skin and not overly drying. Great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9UJEFGIZ6GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6C8WM#wasThisHelpful","RO9UJEFGIZ6GH","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a thoughtfully designed and well made waistpack for runners. I am not a runner but I enjoy hiking in a trail. I thought this belt is perfect for a long hike. It has good storage for my personal effects and a water bottle to keep me hydrated. So I ordered it to have it ready for a nice hike in the fall season.This belt is just about the right size for me. It has just enough storage for my wallet, phone and keys as well as some water for a half day hike. The main storage is a zipper compartment fixed on the belt. It's just large enough for my wallet and keys (there is an interior strap with a clip to secure keys). On the outside is a holster for the 10 oz. water bottle. The bottle is uniquely curved and shaped to avoid poking your body when you're wearing the belt. It is a snug fit in the holster so that it won't slip out by itself during running.The secondary storage is a removable zipper compartment with a velcro fastened, full-width belt loop that you attach to the belt where it is convenient to you. The compartment has a mesh fabric on the front and a soft divider inside. It's large enough for a large screen smartphone. The last module is a elastic pouch for the gel bottle. It is attached to the belt through a velcro fastened belt loop. I am not a fan of energy gels, so I just put gel pouch and the bottle away from the belt.The craftsmanship and materials used are top notch. The fabric feels soft and friction free, yet strong and durable. The compartments have breathable mesh and air spacer on the belt side so that your body may stay cool and comfortable. The compartments, water bottle holster and gel pouch have highly visible reflective trims on the exterior, which is a great safety feature for runners doing their runs after evening. Even the belt has two removable belt loops with the reflective strip on them.The only drawback of this waistpack is the water capacity. 10 oz. of water bottle plus 4 oz  gel bottle is not nearly enough for anything but a short run. Most runners will have to consume more water than this per hour anyway. However, I find this waistpack more suitable for hiking. It holds enough water for a 2-3 hour hike, depending on the temperature for the day.All in all, this is a well made waistpack for a short run or a morning hike. It has two separate compartments that are easily accessible and carries a small water bottle and an energy gel bottle. It is comfortable to wear, even for hours on end. The breathable fabric also helps you stay cool. A great product for runners and hikers alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IGMTBUO6KHZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7HCM2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2IGMTBUO6KHZ8","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute and good sounding Bluetooth speaker by AmazonBasics. It comes in two-tone blue color scheme. The dark blue hard plastic shell houses the micro-speaker and electronics while the light blue bumper and hang loop are soft and flexible silicone of some sort. You can hang it on your backpack or handbag and use it right there.Setup is very easy and straight forward. The multi-language instruction booklet is clear and easy to follow. It took me less than a minute to pair it to my iPhone. I wish the instruction booklet would depict the location of the charging port though. It's covered behind one side of the silicone bumper. The speaker has a built-in omni-directional microphone for phone calls. It is crisp and clear as far as voice communication is concerned.On the top of the silicone bumper are 3 buttons: power and + / - volume buttons. The power button is multi-functional. Depending on the current operating context and hold duration, you can use it to power on/off the speaker, enter pairing mode and answer phone calls. A LED indicator in the front shows the current status of the speaker. The built-in Lithium-ion battery provides up to 6 hours of operation on a single charge.The speaker is good sounding. The bass is nice for its size, booming but bloated. The treble is crisp and clear. It is also loud at the highest volume but distortion kicks in significantly. Overall, it is good sounding for a speaker of this size and price.My only gripe is the multi-function power button although it is minor. You press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to enter the pairing mode. You also press and hold the same button but for a longer duration in order to turn the speaker off. If you release the button too early, it enters the pairing mode instead of turning off.All in all, this is a good sounding Bluetooth speaker with microphone. I like that it's very portable and has a hang loop to attach to my backpack. It is not fancy but works great for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9LT0USTXZDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011W7IA42#wasThisHelpful","RL9LT0USTXZDJ","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm intrigued by the idea of having the Type I collagen and hyaluronic acid delivered to the body in the form of a drink mix. They have been clinically shown to provide natural support for skin and joint health, usually resulting in more hydrated skin and reduction of joint discomfort. I really like the idea of having an ultra-portable and easy-to-use, pre-measured packet that you simply mix into 12-20 oz. of water and drink up.The taste isn't for everyone though. It is sort of an artificial citric taste with a weak pineapple flavor. It also has an odd aftertaste. On a positive note, the powder dissolves well and the resulting drink is not gritty but has a rather smooth to the mouth. The taste is just okay for me, not the greatest and certainly not the worst.After having this drink mix daily for a week, my skin feels somewhat more hydrated and healthier looking. I'm starting to see the benefits of the ingredients in this drink mix. It is very convenient and the taste is palatable. It is rather pricey though. I may try some collagen + hyaluronic acid supplements in a capsule form instead as those are usually much cheaper in the long run.

"Biotin is a vitamin necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It supports the health of the skin, nerves, digestive tract, metabolism, and cells. We normally get biotin in foods naturally but some people with biotin deficiency may benefit from a supplement. Typically, adults need only 30mcg of biotin per day to maintain normal metabolic functions. That said, biotin appears to be generally safe and well-tolerated even at high intake levels. Many people take as high as 10000mcg a day with no documented side effects. The Vitamin World Super Biotin is a 5000mcg supplement which would be a good one to start with.I have not taken biotin specific supplement outside of regular multivitamins. As such, it is difficult to see any improvement on my skin, nails and hair within the short time frame that I've been taking it. On a positive note, I have not experienced any side effects so far. This 120-count bottle would last about 4 months at the recommended dosage of 1 capsule per day. That's pretty inexpensive.

One thing to note is that these capsules do not have papain, a powerful enzyme derived from papaya fruits and involved in breaking down tough protein fibers.  If you're looking for a papaya enzyme supplement, this would probably not work for you.Overall, this supplement appear to work just as great for me. What I really like is that it is much cheaper than the supplements that I had been taking. I'll probably buy this instead when I finish the whole bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EBUADF52H8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R29EBUADF52H8T","AJX9A4Q19UTJU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJX9A4Q19UTJU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 StarsIn a horrifyingly brutal world, AN EMBER IN THE ASHES brings a wonderfully thrilling, epically taunting, spectacularly brilliant, bombshell of book!! AN EMBER IN THE ASHES took me on a nonstop ride through a cruel reality of choices, sacrifices, and the true value of the power of love...A fast-paced plot with twist and turns to keep you on your toes guessing which way it'll turn, AN EMBER IN THE ASHES was just about everything I hoped for. I LOVED this book so sooooo hard!! It was dark, and dangerous, and thrilling, and so much fun to read!! It had this rough edge and paranormal aspects that I did not except from reading the synopsis, but added a more complex plot that only grew thicker with each chapter.The characters—all of them were interesting in their own special way, even the side ones. I think Sabaa Tahir did an amazing job with the character development, and the depth of their personalty. The main characters Laia and Elias were great heroines, and I loved how they found themselves at the same Academy for their own reasons and each had their own goals in what they needed to achieve, but how their stories intertwined and weaved themselves into each others, and by the end of the book they were the sole means of each others survival. Truly brilliant, I looooved that so much!!THE PLOT~ LAIA ~Laia is a Scholar trying to blend in and stay off the Empire's radar, but when her brother is arrested for treason and the rest of her family is murdered before her eyes, Laia is determined to find away to free the only remaining family she has left before he meets the same fate as her murdered family. But in a world so cruelly twisted, their is but little hope for anything if you're a Scholar. But that won't stop Laia from giving it all she has to free her brother from the clutches of the Martial's who have brought so many of their people to their deaths.Laia will have to join forces with the rebellion if she has any chance of freeing her brother from his cruel fate. But what the leader is asking in exchange for helping her is no easy task, and in order to overcome all the obstacles set out in front of her she will have to fight with everything she has to save brother.With little options, Laia reluctantly agrees to go undercover in the most deadliest place of all—the heart of the Empire, and spy on the most dangerous women in their world. The Commandant, who has brought more Scholar's to their death then anyone in her class. She is dangerous, deadly, and out for blood, and Laia has just walked into the Lions den...~ ELIAS ~Being the finest solider at Blackcliff Military Academy hasn't done Elias any favors. He yearns to be free of the chains that bind him, to finally be rid of the brutality he's forced to inflict day in and day out, and is secretly planning his escape. But before Elias can make his move, something far more dangerous then anything at the Academy approaches him with a proposition, one that could finally be his ticket to freedom of the wretch world he was forced into. But it won't be easy to complete, and the trials he'll have to endure will prove to be far more deadlier then anything he could of anticipated. And before it's all said an done, Elias may have to choose between his heart and his loyalties—the same loyalties that are his ticket to freedom... But how can Elias really be free when the things he has to endure and inflict will never really set him free inside, but really the opposite...When these two worlds collide they will intertwine in more ways then one, and will become each others crutch for survival. Who would think a Mask and a Scholar could be anything more then slave and master? But when sparks fly, and loyalties become twisted, Laia and Elias will have to trust each other to the fullest if their going to accomplish their goals, and may even find they've lost their hearts somewhere along the line...AN EMBER IN THE ASHES was full of twist and turns, action and adventure, lies and betrayals, love and romance, power and blood, sacrifice and ultimate choices that could change the fate of the Empire. It was a thrilling book that I absolutely loved. Though it was not as mind blowing as I hoped, but it was still pretty dam close, which is why I gave it the rating I did, but that didn't take much away from my opinion of this book. The ending was torture, absolute TORTURE!!! I have this love/hate relationship with the ending. And while it was thrilling and satisfying, it was too much of a cliffhanger to keep me hanging on the edge of the seat for another whole year until book two is released. But nevertheless, that ending was still epically awesome and amazingly thrilling, and I can't WAIT until I get back into this world again!!!Overall, AN EMBER IN THE ASHES was just about as good as I hoped, minus a few minor flaws, but nothing to serious to deter me from my overall love for this book. I loved the world setting, the characters, the surprising paranormal aspects, the trials, the hardships they had to endure, the slow burning romance, and just the overall feel of this book!! AN EMBER IN THE ASHES satisfies in more ways then one. I will be impatiently waiting until book two releases sometime in 2016 (I hope), and will be sure to read it as soon as it lands in my happy little hands. If you enjoy a dystopia setting, intertwined with a rich fantasy twist, tied into paranormal aspects, with twist and turns, and a fast-paced plot, then AN EMBER IN THE ASHES should definitely be your next read!!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Razorbill (Penguin) for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsA thrilling second installment, STRANGE SKIES was more then I anticipated, and left me yearning for more! After reading book one, and not really liking it as much as I hope too, but still liking it enough to have me wanting to read the sequel, I was a little reluctant to read STRANGE SKIES. But no worries, because STRANGE SKIES has proved to be more thrilling then I ever hoped, and surpassed it's predecessor in more ways then one.Kristi Helvig steps up the plot in this action-packed sequel that kept me on my toes and flipping the pages faster then I could read them. I was quickly sucked back into this world and after that heart-pounding cliffhanger, I was eager to see where it all goes from there.We got a ton load of more action in this sequel, and that's one thing that I thought book one lacked. Don't get me wrong, it did have it's fair share, but not as much as STRANGE SKIES, and not enough to appease my craving. But STRANGE SKIES turned out to be everything I hoped it be and more.But I loved being back with these characters and reliving their obstacles and struggles on this new planet Caelia, that has now become their new Earth. It was great to see them all finally get off of that sun scorched planet, and out into the cool sunny planet of Caelia. And now able to deal with their other issues that's been weighing them down, like The Consulate, and the back stabbing Kale that planed her assassination, and the treacherous boy she thought she loved.THE PLOT:Tora has finally made it off of Earth and to the livable planet of Caelia, but not the way she wanted. After being back-stabbed by someone she thought cared about her, she finds herself in the worst place she could possibly imagine, in the hands of The Consulate...Now kidnapped against her will, drugged and brainwashed to think The Consulate is on her side, Tora is unsure what to think anymore. Until the drugs wear off, and it all starts rushing back... She was shot, taken hostage, and is now dosed with this good feeling drug around the clock to keep her compliant. But most horrifying of all, she's with The Consulate..Tora has not fought her way though losing her complete family, a deserted planet, backstabbers around every corner, just to lay down and give it all up to The Consulate. But just when the odds seem to be stacked against her, Tora gets the break she's been waiting for. A past ally from the resistance comes to her aid and helps her break out of the hell The Consulate has been holding her at, and leads her strait into the hands of another enemy.Tora will have to determine who is friend and who is foe, while discovering the key to ending it all is through the guns that were stolen from her. But with the help of unexpected allies, Tora may just have the backup she needs to stop Kale and taken down The Consulate once and for all...Overall, STRANGE SKIES was a thrilling, heart-pounding sequel that you don't want to miss. Even though I did have some qualms about reading it due to my lack of feelings for book one. But nevertheless STRANGE SKIES proved me wrong and has me desperately craving book three and what's to come next in Tora's epic journey. If you like thrilling dystopians with action and adventure, and a fight for survival, with an awesome cast of characters, then STRANGE SKIES should definitely be your next read, as it does not disappoint!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Egmont USA for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsA hypnotic and alluring read, that delivers magic, corruption, rebellion, a kingdom in turmoil, an evil dictator, and the fight for survival that could possibly end it all for the better or worse...The CHANTRESS was an enticing blend of fantasy and historical fiction, that intertwined magic with a splash of romance to keep the reader reading well into the night. I was instantly hooked from the very first page. And I was VERY surprised of how much I liked the CHANTRESS, as I was always reluctant to read it for numerous reasons. And I've never really been too intrigued by the plot description from the synopsis either. But fortunately as my love for the fantasy genre grew, so did my open mind for other fantasy books I've always shunned in the past and was reluctant to read. But the CHANTRESS has proved me wrong even with it's minor flaws.The first small issue I had with the CHANTRESS was the pacing of the plot. It was VERY slow paced, and felt like it was taking baby steps to progress at some points. The plot was interesting, but the paced it moved threw me off a bit. I would of liked a faster plot, and it definitely could of benefited with an increase of action and adventure. Though it did have it's fair share of adventure, it needed, in my opinion more action.The other issue I had with the CHANTRESS was the romance. Now don't get me wrong, I liked that it was slow burning and not rushed at all. But it was too slow, and barely even any romance at all, at least not until the last chapter or so. And even then, it wasn't even really there either. But I did think that Lucy and her ""kinda"" love interest Nat made a cute couple, and I really hope we get more from their relationship in the next book, CHANTRESS ALCHEMY.But slow pace and lack of romance aside, I really enjoyed the foundation of this world and the things that did happen, even with the lack of suspense. The characters, especially Lucy, Nat, and Nat's adopted father figure Penebrygg were awesome characters and had such a strong voice that it would be nearly impossible not to like them. Even though none of them were the ""normal"" type of characters I usually read. I still enjoyed their voices and character traits, and the fleshed out development that Butler instilled in her wonderful cast of characters that I just loved to pieces.THE PLOT:""Sing, and the darkness will find you.""Lucy has lost everything because of one man, now it's time to awaken the power pulsing inside, and save London from the monsters unleashed to devourer it from the inside out...Shipwrecked on a island since she was eight-years-old, Lucy remembers very little of her life before then. She knows that her mother was lost at sea when they boarded that dreadful ship that deserted them to this abandoned island they now call home. Only other person she's seen since that shipwreck seven-long-years-ago, is her mother-like nurse Norrie that has kept her alive all these lonely years. But Lucy yearns to be free, to return to her hometown of London where her memories hide. But with no hope of rescue, Lucy and her nurse are destine to remain on that island for the rest of their days. Until the darkness she's been warned about finds her. And she's swept into a tornado of wind that tosses her in the very place she desired most, London. But right in the middle of grave danger...Back in London and more alone then she's ever been, Lucy finds the hard way that the kingdom has fallen into vengeful hands. Crowned to a boy-king in name only, but ruled by Scargrave and his vile creatures the Shadowgrims that are capable of tearing a man apart from the inside out, stripping him of all sense of sanity and humanity, and making him into a walking talking Shadowgrim lackey, only breathing to do their bidding...But that's not all Lucy discovers on her journey back to her hometown of London. It's revealed that she is a Chantress, and the very last one of her kind after Scargrave and his creatures the Shadowgrims, the only thing capable of defeating a Chantress hunted down every last one of them, and killed them all. Being the last Chantress, and an untrained one at that, Lucy is playing with fire, and is bound to get burned...But then Lucy stumbles upon members of a rebellion, working from the shadows to find ways with their intelligence to outwit Scargrave and his creature army. But now with a Chantress walking right into their needing hands, they may have just found the ultimate weapon to defeat them once and for all...Lucy will have to discover her true self and what it truly means to be a Chantress to stop the evil threatening to tear London apart. Being the only one strong enough to even stand a chance against Scargrave and his pet Shadowgrims, Lucy must learn as much as she can about herself and the power she possess within if she's going to have any chance of standing against them and prevailing once and for all.The CHANTRESS was a GREAT start to an amazing series that I absolutely adored! I plan to binge read book two and three as soon as possible. Because I'm dying to know what Lucy and her little gang will endure next. And the limits to which Lucy will be tested to achieve whatever new threat awaits her at the end of this epic trilogy that I know will NOT disappoint.Overall, the CHANTRESS was more then I anticipated, and though it was very slow paced, and I wanted a little bit more from the romance, I still found myself easily engrossed in the story and characters no matter it's flaws. And I am so happy I decided to give this book it's fair shot, and I'm eagerly anticipating continuing this series and the next journey it brings!! If you like magical worlds with VERY slow burning romance, a kingdom on the verge of self destruction, with evil lurking from the sky and around the corner, then CHANTRESS is one read you DON'T want to miss!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Simon & Schuster for reviewing purposes! All opinions express are my own and are not influenced in any way!A magical, musical read, that will leave you enchanted....","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOCNSP9H7587/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442457031#wasThisHelpful","R2GOCNSP9H7587","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 StarsMagically enchanting, and wonderfully addicting, THE BITTER KINGDOM delivers an explosive conclusion that will leave you breathless and yearning for more!!! From it's rich lure of fantasy blend, and it's thickened plot, to it's breathtakingly hypnotic romance, and non-stop action and adventure, and magical background that solidifies this series to it's fullest. THE BITTER KINGDOM was one hell of a finale that I am utterly satisfied with, but drastically needing more...I am speechless after reading THE BITTER KINGDOM. I feel like my feelings are all jumbled and no words I can form will do it nearly any justice. There are no words to express the full depth and love I have for this book--no series. This series is one of those series that will stay with me for a very long time. And I'm saddened to see it all end, as I still want more from these characters and this world. But either way I still really enjoyed the way this series ended, even though at the same time it felt incomplete. But it doesn't really matter because it was an EPIC journey though it all!!Like I said above, this book ended great, it was absolutely wonderful. But, I still did feel that their were still too many unanswered questions that were left open at the close of this series. And it kept picking at me long after this book was over. It felt like it wasn't the end of the series and that another book would follow. It just didn't wrap up as good as I hoped it would have. I would of liked to see how some of the side charters ended up after the battle was all said and done. I guess I just wanted more from the epilogue, and to see how things fared after the main plot was played out. BUT nevertheless, it still delivered in more ways then one, and has stole my heart and branded it's world forever in my soul.The writing was as elegant and suspenseful as ever, and the characters had so much growth and development that it was heart-warming to see the strength they were able to pull from each other through all their struggles. I loved watching them through each book as they went through and endured each obstacles that tested them to their fullest, and were able to find the strength and endurance at each turn to overcome their predicaments and become stronger and more determined then ever!THE PLOTElisa has failed her kingdom, and now she's paying the price for that failure...Betrayed by supposed allies in her most trusted circle, Elisa is now hunted, a wanted fugitive in her own kingdom. Hiding amongst her own people, trying to blend in and cope with the capture of the captain of her guard and the man she's slowly came to love. Elisa can't possibly imagine it getting anymore complicated, but boy is she wrong. It's about to become a sandstorm of madness...ELISA HAS 5 GOALS:1-Free her beloved Hector before he makes to Invierne in enemy hands, and surfers a fate unimaginable. 2-Safely enter the City of Invierne and stop the impending war that's on their way to her kingdoms doorstep. 3-Meet with the neighboring kingdoms Queens, her sister Alodia, and her good friend Cosmé, to forge a health alliance and hopefully join their kingdoms. 4-Stop civil war from tearing her kingdom apart at the hands of the fellow Quorum Lord Eduardo, before it's to late. 5-And finally―finally, restore her kingdom back to it's once glory, or better yet, make it even more remarkable then it ever was.Simple right? Ooh no, far from it!! Elisa's journey will be horrendous as it takes her all across neighboring kingdoms and back, fighting enemy's and supposed allies at every turn. But Elisa is steadfast on completing her 5 goals before all is lost to them all. She is their Queen, and their born savior, and she will not give up until all is saved, until her kingdom is back in good graces, no matter the sacrifices, she will endure them all...THE BITTER KINGDOM went above and beyond the limits I expected, and though it didn't end the way I thought, it still rocked this series to the very core and has me eagerly anticipating more from Rae Carson. Because this woman is brilliant, and truly has the special gift of creating magical worlds that not only draws the reader in, but also invest them into her world and wonderfully characters, that satisfies in more ways then one.Overall, THE BITTER KINGDOM is a thrilling conclusion that is not to be missed. This whole series is wonderful and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!! If you're looking for an epic adventure though enemy lands, and a battle to save a kingdom with magical elements, and a bitter sweet romance, then THE BITTER KINGDOM and the complete series is definitely for you!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7TV2U130NBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062026542#wasThisHelpful","R2U7TV2U130NBU","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 StarsA fast-paced, action-packed thrill-ride, full of magic, betrayals, and shocking revelations, THE INFINITE is a steaming hot read that's not to be missed!Now this is what I am talking about!! THE INFINITE was just the sequel I was hoping for!! This sequel was nearly perfect, and sooooo much better then THE GATES OF THREAD AND STONE!! Book one was seriously lacking (See my review HERE) on many aspects. But THE INFINITE has sealed my faith in this series and has me more invested then I thought I would ever be after reading this book. It did have a few hiccups along the way, but nothing to drastic to defer my love and overall enjoyment from this book.THE INFINITE was a tornado of betrayals, with back stabbing and shocking revelations along the way. And I have to admit, one particular betrayal I did NOT see coming at all. And I was more then a little hurt by the duplicity. The world building was evenly plotted with the right amount of treachery and power-wavers, magic, and rebels, and wild beastly animals to keep the plot interesting and not have to much of one aspect going on for too long. And I really liked that about this book, things were always changing―loyalties, friendships, betrayals, hearts, atmospheres, and so on... And it was refreshing to get such a complex and entertaining follow-up from this series. Bravo Lori M. Lee, well done with this explosive second installment to the GATES OF THREAD AND STONE Series!!!As for the characters, Kai pretty much stayed the same as she did in book one, though I did find myself warming up more to her sharp personality. But other then that there wasn't much character growth or regress in her personality. But just like the first book, Kai was willing to throw herself in the heart of danger to save the ones she loves. And I've always enjoyed that about Kai, and it was no exception in this book.Now Avan was a totally different character then he was in the first book. And I really had my qualms about him from the very beginning, and was in a way let down with his drastic change. Even though I knew it was crucial to the plot, I still didn't like it. With Avan dying and being reborn as an Infinite, he lost all sense of himself and his humanity. But he still managed to have this strange love for Kia, and his protective instinct to keep her safe, but that was about it. He thinks other humans below the Infinite, and not capable of thinking for themselves. And that was a big change from book one and a HUGE turn off too. Because I absolutely LOVED Avan soooooo much in the first book, but not so much in this one. I REALLY hope Kai weaves his memory threads and he get the pieces of himself back, because if not, MASON he we come...There was a slight lean towards a possible love triangle. But by the end of THE INFINITE, I think it's pretty clear it isn't going anywhere. But I have to admit that I was entertaining the thought of Kai ending up with Mason, especially with my loss of love for Avan. And I've ALWAYS loved Mason. From book one I found him an awesome side character with strong development with fierce and lovable character traits that quickly pulled me to him. I think he would be great for Kai. But then again, if Avan returned to his former self from book one, I think I would probably prefer Avan over Mason. But if Avan doesn't pull that cork out of his ass, and start acting like the sweet, sexy, slightly timid, but strong Avan that I knew and loved from book one, oh well, then he'll continue to lose my love for good this time!!! And that would be heartbreaking in the least!!THE PLOTKai is now living in the White Court after her battle and defeat over Ninu, The City of Ninurta's last Kahl before she killed him and severed his complete control over the Sentinels, including her brother Reev. She's still trying to cope with all she's been though and adjust to how much her life has changed since that encounter that made her take a life, even one as vile and dangerous as Ninu, but it still haunts her.But as much as Kai tries to deal with everything in the aftermath of her victory, their is one thing she just cannot adjust too, and that is the drastic change in her long time crush and love of her life Avan. After he was killed and brought back to life as an Infinite with tremendous power pulsing at his finger tips, he has changed, and she's seeing this new Avan with different eyes. She feels in more ways then one that she failed him, and now with no memories of her at all, and Avan's humanity all but gone, Kai just doesn't know how to handle that, and if she should just let him go, or fight for something that may never be again. Until Kai is forced to face this new Avan head on, and she horrifyingly realizes just how much this Avan has changed from her sweet, lovable, shy, but strong and protective Avan that she knew and loved. And she has no choice but to face the facts that he is gone, for good...But her problems with Avan become a back thought as a new threat is brought to the gates of The City of Ninurta, and they're shocked with the reality that their not alone, their is more life outside their walls, and they're in dire need of Ninurta's aid. Kai is opted to be at the forefront of it all since she saved the City from ultimate downfall at Ninu's hands by defeating him and restoring control back to the Sentinels and the people.But Kai could have never been prepared for what's to come on this epic journey across the void to this mysterious city in need of help. And Kai quickly learns she'll need every bit of strength and power she possess to overcome and beat this new threat at the City. And to face all the threats that just keep coming and coming.THE INFINITE was really an awesome sequel that I highly enjoyed. From it's fresh plot, to it's new betrayals, and shocking twist, and tremendous personality change. THE INFINITE did not disappoint, and has me yearning for Kai's next journey and what she'll endure next.Overall, THE INFINITE delivered way more then I anticipated after it's lacking predecessor. And definitely opened my eyes to the lengths this series can go and has me looking at Lori M. Lee in a new light. I highly recommend this book, and if you can get through book one then I think you'd be surprised at how much this sequel delivers and brings a whole new twist to this world. I can't wait to read the third book and see where it all goes next and if Kai will embrace her Infinite heritage and become the strong, powerful being she was really born to be...NOTE: I received a eARC from Skyscape for reviewing purposes!

"5 Stars  Wonderfully written, and brilliantly crafted, CHAOS was a dark and dangerous world full of monsters, vengeance, blood-lust and insanity, twisted with romance, sacrifices, and the power of true love...  CHAOS was an absolutely wonderful conclusion, with epic twist and turns, and nothing short of deadly. Sarah Fine packs a whole new punch in this explosive conclusion to the Guards of the Shadowlands trilogy that will leave you utterly satisfied, but still demanding more.  Pheww... What a ride!!! CHAOS was nonstop chills, thrills, action and adventure. I was left with a huge smile on my face when it was over. I can't remember the last time I felt utterly satisfied at the end of a series as I was this one.  Our main characters Malachi and Lela have been though so much together and apart, that it was truly heartwarming to finally see them come to the end of their journey. And I think Sarah Fine did a wonderful job with that closure—but at the same time still left it open enough in case she ever wants to revisit these characters in the future, in which I REALLY HOPE she does!  The plot thickens in this final installment in the Guards of the Shadowlands trilogy. And we finally—FINALLY, get to visit hell. And ooh, what a vicious hell it is too!! The Mazikin are even more vile then I thought they were. Vengeful, bloodthirsty, power-hungry animals, but what deliciously entertaining vile creatures they were! They were some nasty things, but made for a thrilling ride.  THE PLOT  Lela's world is shattered when Malachi is forcefully ripped from her life and taken to the worse kinda hell imaginable, the Mazikin City. She abandons all other responsibilities and dives head first into hell itself, and is determined to save the boy she's come to love—or die trying...  It was suppose to be them against the world—that's how it's always been since Malachi came into her life and brought the only sunshine it's seen in years. Now, she's not so sure life is meaningful without him. So Lela does the only thing she can, and storms the judges court and demands to go to hell and bring Malachi back herself. But what Lela doesn't except is the judge to willing submit without a fight, and not only support her mission, but also have a bigger mission for her in hell with the help from a former fallen ally that has her own mission in hell—Ana, a former guard who just so happens to have unfinished business in hell as well...  Lela and Ana have a plan:  Infiltrate the Mazikin City, scope it out, find Malachi and Takeshi, complete the judges mission, and get the hell out of there without getting killed in the process. Simple right?? I think not!! Two against the whole Mazikin city, fighting to find their men and completing their mission is going to be no easy feat, but Lela and Ana will stop at nothing until they save the ones they love. But once they actually get to the Mazikin City, they realize their is way more to this mission then they once thought. And how can they save two souls, when they're are thousands if not more in need of saving too? Can they abandoned all the other souls to only save the two they love, and can their hearts really bear that kind of sacrifice??  Lela, Malachi, Ana, and Takeshi all reunite in this epic journey through the treacherous depths of hell, and discover the full capabilities of the power of true love. All while facing down their ultimate battle as they try and fight their way out of hell and defeat the Mazikin once and for all...  CHAOS was a wonderful conclusion to an epic series that I absolutely adored. I really hope Sarah Fine decides to revisit this series again, because the love I have for Lela and Malachi runs deep, and I would be thrilled to have more from them and their horrifyingly wonderful world. But if it has to end, then the way it did was perfect, and satisfied in more ways then one. I loved the thickened plot, the character growth, and how love and loyalties were tested and proven, and the journey they all took and conquered together was torturous but endured all in the name of love. CHAOS was positivity emotional and utterly satisfying, and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!!  Overall, Sarah Fine knows how to pack a powerful story that utterly grabs you from the beginning and never lets up. I will read anything this woman writes and I'm sure I'll love it. I'm terribly saddened to see this series and characters come to an end—but what's the saying—All good things must come to an end!?!?!? And that definitely applies to this series. FIVE BRILLIANT STARS to CHAOS, the epic conclusion in Shadowlands trilogy that is not to be missed!!!NOTE: I received a eARC from Skyscape for reviewing purposes!

"3 StarsA spiraling rewind through time, in a twisted world where magic thrives and danger rules, the GATES OF THREAD AND STONE had a fascinating plot, though did not live up to all my exceptions, but was still engaging enough to keep me reading until the end.The GATES OF THREAD AND STONE was a totally different book then I thought it to be, and not as good as I hoped either. First, the plot was different then I anticipated, and confusing as hell at some parts. Their were a lot of parts where they were discussing their background and the roll of each person/being, and it was just too much to take in. The Infinite, the time god, the hollows, the mahjos, the sentinels, the cadets, the humans, and so on... It got to be too much for the plot and too much to remember after a while. And I finally just gave up caring and just rolled with it. And that was a let down in itself.But nevertheless, it still had enough intriguing aspects to keep me enticed. Which is why I gave it the 3 and not the 2 star rating I was debating on. Even with it's many flaws, I sill found myself enjoying the world of the GATES OF THREAD AND STONE. Some of the characters not so much. But I was curious to what lies at the end of the story, and all the hidden secrets revealed along the way. I guess that was the main force that kept me reading until the end.I LOVED Avan--the love interest to our main character Kai. He was so sweet and patient with her. But also was ready to strike at a minutes notice, and willing to endure the unthinkable to help Kai get through whatever situation she got herself in. He was just so lovable, and soooo HOT, I loved his overall personality.Now Kai was another issue altogether. I really had a love/hate relationship with her. From the very beginning I didn't really care for her. It was something about her that just drove me crazy and rubbed me the wrong way. She was bossy, demanding, unthoughtful at times, yelling at Avan when she should be redirecting that anger inward instead of at him. And the whole dynamics of her personally was just a turn off. And it made it really hard to enjoy the book since I had so many ups and downs with the main character. Which was one of the issues I had. But their were still some parts where I admired what she was doing for her brother, and the love she had for Avan, even if she had a s***ty way of showing it sometimes.THE PLOTSince Kai was eight, all she's ever known was her adopted brother Reev. He found her on the riverbank and took her in as his own. So when her brother goes missing, with rumors of the mysterious Red Rider as the culprit--kidnapping people and turning them into mindless hollows, using them as slaves any way he sees fit, Kai knows it's time to act. She cannot and will not sit by like the others while her brother is turned. She will find him, and she will save him, even if she has to leave the safety of the city walls to do it. And she will stop at nothing until he is back to her once and for all...Following the trail of the Red Rider takes Kai and her best friend and secret crush Avan beyond the city walls and into the dangerous outlands, where gargoyles hunt their prey, and one wrong turn can have them going in circles for days--if they even make it that long. But as Kai explores the world beyond the walls of Ninurta, she realizes everything is not as she thought, and the people she thought are not who--or what they claimed.Before all is said and done, Kai will have the chance of self discovery, something she's always wanted, but never could grasp. But as Kai untangles the secrets of her past, and the ones of Ninurta, they become the explosive that could ignite and shake the foundation of their world to the very core. And Kai will be forced to make choices--choices she never imagined she'd ever have to make, choices that could very well change the fate of Ninurta, forever...Overall, the GATES OF THREAD AND STONE was a little confusing, and not as good as I hoped, but still good enough to hold my attention and keep me reading until the very end. I will definitely be reading the sequel, because that cliffhanger was enough to have me instantly request the next book through Netgalley. I think if you enjoy fantasy books with a little bit of mystery, and a lot of adventure, and a tad bit of time twisting, with a slow romance, then you may find the GATES OF THREAD AND STONE an enjoyable read.NOTE: I received a eARC from Netgalley & Skyscape for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsTHE BOOK OF IVY was full of love, betrayals, murder plots, deception, and the courage to do what is in your heart, no matter the consequences...I've had THE BOOK OF IVY on my radar for a while now, but since it sounded vaguely familiar to another book I read, ABERRANT, I was reluctant to pick it up. But my curiosity won me over and I finally decided to give THE BOOK OF IVY it's fair shot regardless of the similarities I thought they had. But I am pleasantly surprised to admit that was not the case and the similarities were very minor, and it was definitely worth the read.THE BOOK OF IVY was very slow paced with hardly any action, but that was strangely okay with me. I still enjoyed the drama and suspense of it all. There were a lot of layers and plots and schemes and tons of betrayals that kept this story interesting enough even without the action and adventure. And the world-building was a little different then what I excepted, but still interesting enough. Though I would of liked to have more history on the war and conflict between the families, but I'm hoping we'll get more info in book two, THE REVOLUTION OF IVY.THE PLOTAfter the war, Ivy's ancestors founded Westfall Community, a place that the people could rebuild and start anew. But their was disagreement about how to keep things up and running, and who should run them. The Westfall's and the Lattimer's went head to head for the position, and as fate would have it, the Lattimer's were the ones who seized control of Westfall Community. But instead of killing the rival family, they made the Westfall's the lowest citizens of their Community, and forced them to marry off their future children to the future Lattimer children, and thus seizing even more control of the Westfall's and the Community.And then the murder plot begins...Ivy Westfall is on a mission, one that could change the world as they know it. One that could bring her family to their rightful place in power. One that could bring freedom back to their people. One that could save their women from marrying monsters. One that will turn her into, a murderer...For the mission she must complete is simple:""Marry the enemy, make him trust you, find the codes and guns, wait for the order, execute on site.""Easy right? To save her people Ivy must kill the only person that might really want to save them all--Bishop Lattimer, the enemy and the presidents son, but also the love of Ivy's life... She must kill the man she's grown to love if she's to change their world...So to sum it all up, THE BOOK OF IVY was way more then I anticipated. I reveled in this story and the slow paced plot with strong characters and a slow burning romance that made me want to stay up late for just one more chapter!!Overall, THE BOOK OF IVY is definitely a must read for dystopian fans out there. It's not your gritty, face-paced, action-packed dystopia, so if that's what your looking for you won't find it here. But if you want a slow burning romance, with a slower pace plot, fleshed with rich developed characters, with spunk and determination, and a desire to set what's wrong right, and to avoid the dirtier methods to get it, then THE BOOK OF IVY is something I'm sure you'll enjoy. I am soooo eagerly waiting for book two, THE REVOLUTION OF IVY. I can't WAIT to see what happens next, because that ending was a KILLER!!!!NOTE: I received a eARC from Entangled for reviewing purposes!

"3.5 StarsA richly entangled web of lies, deception, murder plots, schemes, and a thirst for power, A WICKED THING breaths a whole new version of the classic fairytale we've all seen and love, of the enchanted Princess Aurora, better known as THE SLEEPING BEAUTY...I've been DYING to read A WICKED THING since seeing that GORGEOUS cover that HaperTeen brilliantly came up with. I didn't even know what it was about before I instantly added it to my TBR pile, then when I read the synopsis I was sold. I LOVE retellings, especially ones with my favorite Disney Princess. So I was ecstatic when I received an ARC for review.But I did have my issues with A WICKED THING. It was very slow paced, I mean VERY!! It dragged almost throughout the whole book, and didn't have any action except the last chapter or so. I guess I just expected, or wanted more from A WICKED THING then what I got.And we had this weird love square type thing going on that just did not fit well with the story at all. Though I did like each of the three guys Aurora was entangled with, but not all of them as a love interest. If that makes any since...lol!! But I can sometimes put up with a good love triangle if it's done well, but I can't do a love square, that's just too much! But to be technical, Aurora really wasn't involved with all of them, but the attraction was evident with each guy. I really hope in the next book Thomas narrows them down to just one love interest, because I can't keep reading with all these guys on one girl!!!THE PLOT102 YEARS INTO THE PAST...(PAST TIME)Once upon a time, in a far away land, their lived the peaceful kingdom of Alyssinia, that unknowingly was about to have their world ripped out from under them. One glorious day, the rulers of this land were blessed with a beautiful baby girl that they named Princess Aurora. The kingdom rejoiced and welcomed their precious princess into the world. But as fate would have it, the wicked witch received news of this baby's birth, and the grand three day and three night of celebrations that she was purposely uninvited too. Furious, the wicked witch vowed vengeance and made it her sole mission to destroy the king and queen by striking them where it hurts worst--cursing their only child to an indefinite sleeping slumber after she pricks her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel....The King and Queen tried everything in their power to find the witch and force her to break the wretched curse, but to no avail, was she ever found. They're only hope now was secluding Princess Aurora from the harsh world and outsiders who could be the witch in disguise. Forcing Aurora to a life of solicitude and imprisonment in her tower, in hopes she'll evade the curse and make it through her eighteenth birthday to best the witch and overcome her wickedness. But the power of the curse was more then they could have anticipated, and on the night before her eighteenth birthday she was bewitched by a melody that enchanted her and lured her to the waiting spinning wheel where she pricked her finger on the spindle and inadvertently drained the land of magic, and ended the life she once knew. But more horrifying, she was immobilize in a slumber, until if the prophecy is to be believed, she will be awoken by the kiss of true love... and then the reawakened Princess will breath magic and life back to the miserable land that once flourished and prospered, and all will be glorious once more and they will live happily ever after...Or so, that's the way The Sleeping Beauty story was told...102 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE...(PRESENT TIME)Princess Aurora wakes from her slumber 102 years into the future to a kiss from a timid, but sweet Prince Rodric, and realizes life as she knew it passed her by while she slept on. Alone, confused, and helpless in this new world, Princess Aurora reluctantly stays with the new king and queen and their son, the Prince that awoken her. But Aurora quickly finds she's a pawn in this wicked game to keep the people of Alyssinia happy and continent with a dream she's suppose to portray, but unable to fulfill. She's to become this Princess they've all read about in fairytales, to become someone or something she is not. But with little power and no say, Aurora has no choice but to do as she's told and marry the Prince of Alyssinia and become this savior that she feels she isn't capable of...But all that changes when Aurora is finally pushed to the breaking point and is caught up in conspiracies and murder plots that threaten not only Alyssinia, but her very life... She's tired of the games and is ready to stand up for herself and the people of Alyssinia and is ready to make her first rebellious move against the crown, and set the kingdom on fire...Overall, A WICKED THING was not what I thought it would be, and very slow paced with hardly any action. But had a lot of drama and court intrigue, which I love in books. So I guess it kinda evened itself out, and though A WICKED THING was not what I thought it would be and definitely not as good as I hoped, it still turned out to be a pretty okay book that fiercely caught my interest near the end. I'll definitely be reading the sequel to see what's in store for Aurora, because that ending was pretty amazing, with it all coming to a head, and a cliffhanger that has me wanting more!!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from HarperTeen for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsA thrilling, twisted plot, with deception and corruption fueling the vengeance through time and back, with determined heroines ready to fight to the end for the truth, with betrayals and shocking revelations that will shake this world to the very core... BLACKOUT is a sequel not to be missed!!BLACKOUT was a much anticipated sequel for me after the ending of THE EIGHTH GUARDIAN! I LOVED book one and was ecstatic to get back into this complicated world. I really enjoyed BLACKOUT, and was so SHOCKED at the way it ended. Man, that cliffhanger almost killed me!! It was absolute torture not knowing what will happen next. If it's one thing that Meredith McCardle knows how to write, it's thrilling, heart-pounding anticipation to keep you reading or wanting to read more!! Well done McCardle!!One issue that I did have with BLACKOUT though, was the slow pacing. Sometimes I can look past it, and lately with some books I even enjoyed the slower pace and thicker world development. But in BLACKOUT, that was not the case. It felt like it was almost halfway through until something really stated happening. And after LOVING THE EIGHTH GUARDIAN, I had really high expectations of BLACKOUT, maybe even to a little to high.BUT... BLACKOUT still turned out to be pretty awesome nevertheless. I REALLY enjoy this world setting, and traveling back in time, and the characters were awesome. But my feelings for the love interest Abe, still has not increased much. But it really wasn't a big issue for me at all. But Iris was a great heroine: Strong, determined, smart, skillful, and prepared to go to any lengths to save her friends and the people in danger of the corruption.THE PLOTAmanda Obermann, code name Iris was recruited into Annum Guard--a secret organization that travels back in time to change the course of history and shape their world for a better tomorrow. But when corruption and betrayals sent the guard spiraling out of control, Iris realized the hard way that playing with time can become a deadly game...After the take-down of Alpha and his corruption within Annum Guard, Iris is trying to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and rebuild a new life in the guard with her longtime boyfriend, and love of her life Abe. But where everything is suppose to be coming together and mending, it's falling apart in shreds. And Iris isn't sure what to do about righting all the wrongs that are unfolding before her eyes at lightning speed. But when members of the guard start going missing, they all become targets to be next, including Abe, the one thing keeping her sane in all this insanity...Iris must unravel the web of deception and corruption that was left in the wake of Alpha's destruction. But where to start and who to trust becomes the key factor in taking down this unknown person named XP who happens to be the leader behind of it all. And knowing that any member of her team could be taken on any mission at anytime makes it even more frightening. But Iris is no rookie at dealing with shady people, and now that their playing with the ones she loves, theirs no ending to where she'd go and do to save the people she loves, even if she has to travel back to where it all started, alone...But as Iris uncovers hidden secrets years in the making, she realizes just how deep she's gotten herself in, and just how dangerous uncovering these hidden secrets really are. But most importantly, before it's all said and done she may be the last one standing, if she makes it out alive...Overall, BLACKOUT turned out to be a pretty good sequel, though I did enjoy it's predecessor more, but by the end I was hooked and totally shocked with the ending!! I think anyone who enjoys time travel with action and adventure, mystery and corruption, thrills and strong heroine's will definitely enjoy this trip back in time to uncover America's hidden secrets...;) I will be eagerly anticipating book three, and if it's anything like the first two books I'm sure I'll definitely enjoy it!!NOTE: I received an ARC from Skyscape/Amazon for reviewing purposes!

"4.5 StarsMAGIC STUDY was a spiraling world of magic, love, survival, determination, all weaved around the magical elements of danger, betrayal, drama, lies, and murder...MAGIC STUDY was just about everything I hoped for, almost... This book was so much fun and introduced a whole new world to this series that I couldn't get enough of.But the downside to MAGIC STUDY was that I wanted, no, NEED, more of VALEK!! He didn't show up until more then halfway though the book, then when we did, he wasn't there a lot. And that drove me CRAZY. Granted, it all still played out amazing, and had twist and turns that I loved, but I would of enjoyed them a lot more if Valek was there through most of them! ;)Another small issue I had was that in POISON STUDY Yelena and Valek didn't act on they're feelings until almost the end of the book, but when they finally did express they're true feelings for each other, it felt rushed and not as developed as I hoped for. But in a way it was understandable because they were in a dire situation where they weren't able to fully express their-selves.But in MAGIC STUDY, it still didn't really develop the way I wanted. They just picked up with how much they loved each other, but not a lot of talking about their feelings. Really, every time they got together they hardly even talked at all. And that drove me INSANE!!! I LOVE them as a couple. I think they're both awesome characters, and are well developed, but their relationship is not. I know they love each other, I mean it's definitely obvious. Because in POISON STUDY they're feelings built up from the beginning to almost the end, and had plenty of time for those feelings to progress and truly blossom into the love that they have for each other. But once they got together, I wanted more feelings, more talk, more togetherness, MORE OF THEM!! I don't know if that makes any sense, but nevertheless, I LOVE them together and apart, I just wish they had more time together to develop their feels for each other.That aside, the rest of the book was AMAZING!! I loved all the new and old characters that came into play in MAGIC STUDY, and the direction that the plot took. I loved all the magic and adventure, and meeting Yelena's family, and the strong bonds and allies she built. And the new enemies she established in Sitia. I would of liked to visit Ixia again, but that's okay I'm sure we will in the next book, FIRE STUDY!THE PLOTYelena has left Ixia behind, forced to flea or face execution from the Commander for being a magician and having the power of magic pulse through her veins. She's eager, but nervous about returning to her homeland of Sitia, where she will learn how to wield her magic and reunite with her long-lost-family that she was stolen from all those years ago. But Yelena realizes very quickly that not everyone is willing to accept her with open arms in the magical city. Some think she has ulterior motives, some are even willing to kill her for it...Now in Sitia and no longer forced to shield her powers, Yelena is able to let go and let free. But Yelena magic is stronger then she or her magician teacher and closet friend Iris, ever thought. Some are even threatened by her and the power she possesses, which happens to be progressing and becoming stronger with each passing day.But the power is not the problem, she has an enormous power within, what she is struggling with is the control. With her power quickly strengthening at alarming rate, and her displaying unique powers that were once feared, it makes grasping and controlling all this power unsteady and very dangerous. Yelena must learn to wield and control her magic quickly if she has any chance of surviving her homecoming to Sitia.Theirs a powerful magician stealing the souls of lesser magicians and claiming their magic for themselves. And if they're not stopped, not only will innocent lives be lost, but all of Sitia will fall under the control of the Soul Stealers power. Once the Soul Stealer claims enough souls and magical powers, he will be nearly unstoppable...With Yelena's strengthening power, and her unique abilities, she may be the only one equipped enough to stop the Soul Stealer before all of the Country plunges into darkness and evil...Yelena will have to dig deep within to discover who she really is and what she's actually capable of to complete the mission she's set out for. But she's unequipped to go at it alone. She must call on some old friends, including her most strongest ally of all, Valek, and build bonds with new allies in her hometown country of Sitia if she has any chance at stopping this madman before it's too late. But every step she takes seems like their is always someone there trying to keep her from conquering her goal. She will have to be prepared to face all, and determined to overcome the unthinkable if she's going to defeat the evil threatening to claim the country she's grown to love.MAGIC STUDY was almost as good as I hoped for, minus the issue I had with the relationship development, it was perfect! I only knocked a half of star off my rating for the lack of development in Yelena and Valek's relationship. BUT... I STILL LOVED THEM BOTH. No matter how much time they spent together or apart and how deep they're feelings were talked about with each other. I still enjoyed their time together and can't wait to see them reunite again in FIRE STUDY!!Overall, MAGIC STUDY was a magically alluring, and utterly addicting read from beginning to end. Maria V. Snyder captured my heart in POISON STUDY, and owned it with MAGIC STUDY, and I'm sure FIRE STUDY will be the link that ties them all together and completes my heart as whole.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242NQ84OF767H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778323927#wasThisHelpful","R242NQ84OF767H","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5 Blazing StarsO.M.G!!! This was PHENOMENAL!!! I absolutely, positivity, undoubtedly, wholeheartedly, dumbfoundedly, LOVED POISON STUDY with every fiber of my soul!!! It was just that amazing in soooo many ways!This book set tingles down my spine. The audiobooks were amazing! The narrator is one of those narrator who keeps you engaged and totally connected to the book and the characters. She was able to distinctively preform each character with a superb voice and talented acting that separated them from each other. And I LOVED IT!But the narration would of been nothing without the backup of the epic story. And Maria V. Snyder delivered on so many aspects!! She just blew my mind with this book. I was and still am dumbfounded over it's awesomeness, and instantly downloaded the audiobook of book two!The world building was original and utterly heart-pounding. I've never read anything like this book, so I was instantly enthralled and thrilled to have something so fresh and addicting like POISON STUDY! Maria V. Snyder built a complex world with such depth and underlying twist and turns that kept me absorbed and lulled me to the very last page.The characters, OMG, you don't want to get me stated there!! Yelena was wonderful, I loved watching her character growth throughout this book. In the beginning she was shattered and broken from her past and the threat of execution hanging over her head. But as the book progressed and Yelena started to find herself and see who she really was and what she was capable of, she started to showed great strength and was determined not to run and give up like she usually does, but to stand and fight until the very end. She was truly a wonderful female protagonist.And Valek, Ooh, he was unforgettable, and so dam fine!! He had this enchanting personality that I instantly liked. I loved him even before I knew who he was an what role he played. Their was something mysterious and compelling that drew me in. And listening to POISON STUDY on audio only increased that experience and made me fall in love with him even more. I loved his honorable and noble personally, and his strong, take charge demeanor, that only seemed to drive Yelena and myself even more insane!! Maria V. Snyder knows how to create unforgettable and desirable characters that leave everlasting footprints in your heart!!THE PLOTChoose: A quick death… Or slow poison...Yelena is a murderer. She killed a man and is now awaiting her execution. By a chance of luck she happens to be next in line for execution when the position for Food Taster becomes available for the Commander of Ixia. She is given a choice: Die now by the noose, or live and possibly die later by poison?? For Yelena the choice is obvious, die later, possibly?Now as the official Food Taster in training, her job is simple: Taste the Commanders meals for poison and keep him alive. Fail to detect the poison, and you will die a slow poisonous death. So Yelena has no choice but to strive to do her best, or die a horrible death. Oh, but that's not all. She has a slow acting poison running steadily through her blood. It acts as invisible restraints to keep her in line and ""escape free."" Only way to remain alive is to complete her duties and return to Valek, the Security Chief daily for her antidote, or she'll be dead in two days. What has she just gotten herself into...As the murder of a high ranking General's only son, she is hunted, ridiculed, and tormented by many, and untrusted by all. Yelena knows her crime of murder may be the cause of her death, but she doesn't care, she'd do it again if she had the opportunity. She is shattered, broken, but not beaten, and as she digs inside she finds an inner strength she didn't know was there, and discovers she has the will and strength to overcome just about anything...But Food Tasting is just the beginning of Yelena's journeys as assassins, gamblers, castle staff, spies, traitors, guards, Generals and magicians all want a piece of her for one reason or another. And she must learn the acts of self defense and the truth of a buried secret within if she's going to stay alive long enough to see tomorrow.Yelena finds herself entangled in the middle of conspiracy that may uncover the truth behind a lot of unanswered questions, and she may be the key to figuring out what is really going on in Ixia and why certain people are acting so strange.With her heart and soul captured by someone she thought was the enemy, and finding friends and unlikely allies in people she thought were foes, Yelena discovers anything is possible, and with the right people, anything is unstoppable...POISON STUDY was an EPIC thrilling read that didn't let up until the last page. It was full of pure awesomeness that I absorbed and craved more of. I definitely will be putting Maria V. Snyder on auto-buy from this day forward, and look forward to reading more of her creations in worlds of magic, mystery, betrayals, romance and love. She captured my heart and enticed my soul into becoming a dedicated loyal fan until the very end!!Overall, if you want a heart-pounding, soul touching, book craving, hands shaking type of read, with an enchanting world and unforgettable characters, then POISON STUDY needs to be your next read, trust me, it will NOT DISAPPOINT!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWO6HDZH7Q6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778324338#wasThisHelpful","R1LWO6HDZH7Q6U","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 StarsI've been so eager to read FROSTFIRE since I seen the amazing cover last year and fell madly in love with it. And the rest of the series covers are just as amazing, if not better!! And when I received my ARC for review, I nearly jumped for joy at it's awesomeness!!But honestly, I may have had my exceptions a little too high. I read Hocking's Zombie series and absolutely LOVED it. So I guess I may have set my standards to those same exceptions, because it wasn't as good as I hoped, and it ended without giving too much incite on the plot and the reasoning behind the plot of the story. But nevertheless, FROSTFIRE was still enjoyable and totally an engaging read, that I was quickly entangled with and didn't want to put down once I was ensnared.Let me elaborate...I loved the world building. The plot of the story was alluring and absolutely appealing. But the pacing and lack of depth didn't back up the story to the full worth of the plot. It had some plot holes, and not enough info to back it all up. It felt like it dragged a bit from time to time, and then their wasn't enough answers to support the full drama and mystery that made this story. And by the end of the book we still don't get answers to why things that happened in the book happened. And that was a little irritating because I desperately wanted to know WHY???THE PLOTBryn just wants to be normal, fit in with the same people she's pledged her allegiance too. She's an outcast among the Kanin tribe. Always has been and always will be if she doesn't do something to change it.Her dream is to become a Hogdragen, one of the finest guards the Kanin has to offer. But since she's half Skojare and half Kanin, she's considered to be the lesser of the full-breed Kanin. But Bryn has never let that stop her from trying, and she's not about to start now!So Bryn is determined to work her way up the ranks, starting with being a Tracker, tracking the Changelings and convincing them it's time to return home to their Kanin heritage. Thanks to her boss and good friend Ridley, he keeps her on a narrow path, reminding her that she is in fact something special, no matter what her race is. But it's getting harder and harder to deny the feelings she has for him. The rush she feels when he's around. The overpowering desire her body convulses with when he's close. But it's a dangerous, forbidden game she's playing here, and she may just be the one to get burnt.But there is something that haunts Bryn's dreams, something that almost destroyed her world, something that's come back to finish the job...Four years ago, a fallen hero named Konstantin went from being the most admired man, to the most hated in a matter a minutes. He crossed a line that not even Bryn, who has secretly been in love with him can forgive. Mater of fact, the betrayal hits more home to her family then any other Kanins, and she's determined to understand the reasoning behind his actions, and then see him put to justice for the crimes he's committed against her, her family, the kingdom, and the Changelings once and for all.But Bryn's dreams to rise the ranks and become a Hogdragen have to get put on hold when her nightmares literally come true. The Kanin traitor and wanted fugitive Konstantin has resurfaced after four years, and is picking their Changelings off one by one. Bryn and the rest of the trackers are unsure of his true motives and who else is really behind it all. But one thing is for certain, he must be stopped, and she is determined to find him and put an end to it once and for all.But as Bryn digs deeper into these kidnappings, something is telling her theirs more to the story then she once thought. Someone is sitting back in the shadows pulling the strings, but who, and why? And Konstantin was one of the Kanin's greatest Hogdragen in their history, so why was he so quickly willing to throw it all a way for what seems like nothing?It all makes no sense, but Bryn is out for answers—answers that seem to only create more questions. Bryn is willing to go to great lengths to reveal that truth behind the kidnappings and who's really behind them. But from the beginning the puzzles didn't seem to fit, and now more then ever, the pieces are starting to come together. But before all is said and done, the truth might bring the kingdoms to their knees...Overall, even with the lack of development and explanation, I still enjoyed it, a lot! I'm looking forward to continuing this series and seeing how it all plays out, and hopefully getting the answers that I desperately seek!! If you love books with magical worlds, built around tough, driven characters, with determination to survive, then you should definitely check out FROSTFIRE!!!**AUDIOBOOK IMPRESSIONS**I really enjoyed the narration of FROSTFIRE. The narrator, Eileen Stevens was well suited for this type of story. Her voice and acting portrayed a teenagers, and fit well with the plot. Her performance blended the right sounds, stops and pauses just at the right time. The emotional feel Eileen radiated with her voice allowed me to experience the characters feelings in overdrive! It's a wonderful feeling to have a narrator put you in the characters shoes with her define and alluring narration!! I will definitely listen to more books by this narrator in the future!!NOTE: I received a Physical ARC from St. Martin's Griffin & a audiobook from audible for reviewing purposes!

"4.5 StarsWow, what a thrilling intense adventure through time, that takes us through corruption, conspiracies, betrayals, lies, deception and murder!!! THE EIGHTH GUARDIAN is full of soo much awesomeness, all packed in one little book!!!I don't even know where to begin with all of this book's awesomeness! The world building was so complex and full of layers of plot and character development that made this book what it was, a bombshell of a debut!!The characters were interesting... They're was a few I didn't really care for at first, but then as the book progressed, they kinda grew on me. But I was and still am a little iffy of the love interest, Abe. He's supposed to love Iris (Amanda) with all his heart, and have her back until the very end, no matter what. Yet he didn't, not at first any way. I can't say to much on that without giving spoilers away, but there was a very big important part in this book where his loyalties and trust in the girl he loves is tested, and in my opinion, he failed, big time!!! Granted, something was hanging over his head, but he didn't believe in Iris at first, and was willing to separate himself before even knowing the truth behind it all. And with that part my whole faith in him--in them as a couple, went right out the window. As far as I know he is the main love interest in book two, BLACKOUT, but he better do some serious making up to Iris before he gets my love, again!!!But as far as the other characters go, they were great! The main character Iris was awesome!! Yes, she did kinda drive me crazy in the beginning, and even manged to get a couple eye rolls out of me from time to time. But then I put myself in her shoes, and if I was just ripped out of my life and tied to a bed and told time travel existed, and that I had to join or bad things world happen to me, then yeah, I would probably be acting the same way she was. So after that I softened towards her and got to see her for what she really was: An awesome, hardcore chick, that wasn't afraid to get the job done, even when the job seemed impossible!!! And that's why I loved Iris, she made the impossible, possible!!THE PLOTAmanda Obermann just wants to graduate from training school and become a CIA agent with her boyfriend and love of her life, Abe in tow. But things aren't as simple as she thought. There's a whole new world she's about to be pulled into, and she's totally unprepared for what's about to begin on Testing Day...Amanda Obermann, Code name Iris. She was forced to leave that birth name behind on Testing Day when she was knocked out, dragged out of school, tied to a gurney, and told she'd graduated testing day and is now apart of a secretive organization that travels back in time to change history to fit their future. But nothing is right about any of that, and Amanda--No, Iris, is determined to find out just what game they're really playing...Iris is considered an outsider among the Annum Guard--the secretive organization she's being forced into. She'll be the Eighth and final Guardian if she passes her probational period, and then will be granted the rare opportunity to travel back in time and change the course of history. But Iris is struggling with her adjustment in Annum Guard. With everyone being so secretive, and making her feel like she doesn't quite belong, it makes following her superiors not too high on her to do list. But her choices are very limited: Either join Annum Guard, or spend the rest of her life in an 8x8 cell, forced to forfeit her life, as Time Travel cannot be known to the public. So with Iris having little to no choice, she reluctantly does as she's told and joins Annum Guard. Until her final testing mission reveals something that could blow the whole top of the corruption within the guard, and who's really behind it.Iris is not prepared to sit back and take the fall for the corruption within. She's determined to uncover the truth behind everything, and everyone who is involved. But theirs just one problem? She's a wanted fugitive in the present for crimes she did not commit. So that means time and an unlikely teammate are her only allies...Iris will have to weave through time to uncover conspires, reliving the past of love ones she didn't know were entangled in the guard. While evading her teammates, trusting an unlikely ally, and staying one step ahead of time. Time is running out and the game has just begun, the race for her life is for sure, and death is inevitable, but who's death is what's uncertain....Race through time with Iris as she uncovers conspires, tangled webs, lies, deception, betrayals, and unexpected friendship and alliances.First I have to tell you I am not a fan of Time Travel books. Really, I try to steer clear of them all together. They're just not really my thing.... But, there was something about THE EIGHTH GUARDIAN that compelled me to want to read it. Something that was so appealing that I couldn't deny my urge. So I picked it up for review and waited forever to read it. But when I did FINALLY read it, OMG I was entranced!! Meredith McCardle has to be like the Time-Travel master!! It was full of soooo much drama and action and adventure. Intertwined with dates and times of history that gives us a whole new look at our countries past and their struggles. She seriously had to do her homework on this one, and I give her mad props for producing such a gem within the Time-Travel book world!!!NOTE: I received an ARC from Skyscape/Amazon for reviewing purposes!

"3.5 StarsA thrilling, heart pounding, fast paced adventure, INVASION was an enjoyable second installment to THE LAST PRINCESS SERIES, that I've been eager to read!! INVASION has been one of my most anticipated books after reading the first book, THE LAST PRINCESS and thoroughly enjoying it. I've been dying to get back to this world and the characters that I loved from book one.But to be honest, it had some let downs. After I started reading INVASION, I became a little weary of continuing. It felt as if I was rereading book one all over again. The similarities were insanely close, and the plot twist were eerily the same as book one. But because that was really the only complaint I had about it, I was able to push book one from my mind and enjoy INVASION for what it was; a great book that had me hooked, even with it's few flaws!THE PLOTEliza has saved England and her family from the crazed dictator, Cornelius Hollister—the man that almost succeed in taking everything she cares about, and he also happens to be the father of the man she's in love with. After the Seventeen days brought it's harsh and unfair disasters, and ushered their County into the dark times, and the cruel and evil rise and fall of the infamous dictator Cornelius Hollister, all seemed lost and unrepairable. But now with her sister Mary on the throne as Queen, and preparing to marry the love of her life that will become her king, all may not be as lost as they once thought. That is until they're happily ever after gets cut short, and their country is plummeted into the same dictatorship they've started to heal from.England has fallen, again...When a ship is spotted at sea after the many years of being cut off from the outside world, England thought they were all that was left. But they were wrong, and now this ship has come like a beacon in the night, bringing faith and hope to the people of England. But when they go aboard the ship out at sea, cut off from the rest of England's troops on land, they realized they've made a terrible mistake. They're are other survivors, but they don't want peace and alliance, they want to dictate and conquer, just like Cornelius Hollister did when he brought hell to England, it's begun, again...England quickly falls into enemy hands, unable to ward off their high tech weapons and quick seize, Eliza and the queen are taken hostage and forced to hand their country over to the most vicious and vile man they've ever met. The queen will be forced to marry their enemies leader, or suffer consequence she is not willing to endure. But Eliza is not ready to give up so easily, she's already faced down and won her kingdom back from one evil dictator, she will do it again, or die trying!!!Overall, INVASION was great book even with it's flaws and some unnecessary plot twist. With enjoyable characters, and a world setting that compelled me to keep reading, INVASION was a thrilling read . I think if you enjoy apocalypse/dystopian books with a fast plot, strong characters, and adventure to keep it going, then you'll enjoy this book. This book can be read as a standalone, you do not have to read the first book to understand this book. But, I do recommend that you should read it if you want to get the full understanding of this book. But, at the same time, if you already read the first book, you may have issues with this book due to the similarities being so similar. But if you can get past all the similarities then I think anyone who enjoys this type of genre would find it entertaining and enjoyable like I did!NOTE: I received a ARC from Poppy for reviewing purposes!

"4.5 WONDERFUL STARSTHE CROWN OF EMBERS was an EXPLOSIVE READ that I absolutely LOVED!! It took me on the ride of my life, and filled me with such awesomeness that kept me up reading late into night, craving just one-more-chapter I couldn't get enough of!!! I loved the world building, the characters, the villains, the magical aspects, frankly, I loved just about every single thing in this novel, no, in this series!!THE CROWN OF EMBERS was a gem waiting to be explored for me. It had layers upon layers of depth and character development, and more plot then I could grasp! Rae Carson is truly a book-god in my world! She has the gift of enchantment, for she surly put a hex on me with this magical story, because I absolutely, positively, undoubtedly, LOVE THE CROWN OF EMBERS SERIES so freaking much!!!THE PLOT:Elisa is the hero of her country.She saved her people from the Invierne and brought her country back from the brink of war. She defeated the Animagi that brought fire and death upon her kingdom. She channeled the Godstone's power and learned to wield it against her foes. She was Joya d'Arena's last hope, and she didn't fail them, and for that, she is their queen...Seventeen-year-old queen Elisa is anything but political familiar. She never wanted to be queen, let alone rule a whole country twice the size of her hometown county all by herself. But she is, and she must rise up from the ashes to piece her country back together bit by bit. But the enemy has sworn vengeance's, sworn that they will come like ghost in a dream. And they will get their revenge, one way or another, they're coming, the clock is ticking...With a newly inexperienced queen, a country trying to piece it's self back together, an enemy still striking from the shadows, a rebellion brewing, and civil war threatening to tear their country apart, theirs more then enough chaos and insanity to distract the country from it's enemies and traders threatening to rise up and seek it's vengeance's.But then the queen starts to fear her enemies are closer then she once thought, and plotting to destroy her and the country she's been fighting for. Her allies are in short supply, and the power she wields is no where near enough to defeat the Animagi that are hell bent on conquering her power and defeating their county. And Elisa is no closer in figuring out her next move. But time is running out, and her enemies are lying in wake, waiting for the perfect time to strike...But their is someone who also seems to spark hope within, and keeps her sanity from turning no matter the situation. It's the Commander of her royal guard, and keeper of her heart, Hector. He unknowingly sparks something deep within, that thrives anytime he's near. She has loved and lost once, but their is something about the Commander of her guard that makes her feel she can love again, only if he loved her too, something she's not sure she wants to find out, yet....So Elisa and a few of her most trusted allies cook up a ruse and travel to an ancient island that's suppose to be the heart of the Godstone's power. But she can't have her enemies on all sides knowing where she's going and why. So they must travel through harsh lands and waters to evade her enemies, locate the mythological island, learn how to absorb and harness it's power, get back to her castle and uncover the trader in they're political circle, defeat the Animagi threatening to wreck havoc, and some how keep the man she's falling in love with from leaving her, all while staying alive long enough to achieve it all. Yup, piece a cake, right? I think not!!!Overall, if your looking for a fast-paced read, with secrets and betrayals, war and death, friendship and love, and a queen destined to overcome all, and set her country free of it's foes, built around a magical background that pulses the story to it's fullest, then THE CROWN OF EMBERS is exactly the book you've been looking for!! I HIGHLY recommend it, and am eagerly anticipating the third and final book in this epically wonderful trilogy, that has sent chills down my spine time and time again!! And will forever go down as one of my favorite series of all time!!! THE CROWN OF EMBERS is a must read for any fantasy/adventure fan out there, it will not disappoint!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212E7AA50FI9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062026534#wasThisHelpful","R212E7AA50FI9H","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Epically Wonderful StarsTHIS SHATTERED WORLD was breathtakingly epic!! With it's fierce and determined characters, a plot that kept thickening, equally blended with a romance fighting to survive against the odds!! It is a sequel NOT to be missed!!But to be honest, I thought I was going to have issues getting back into this world because of the POV change. Because I LOVED the first book, THESE BROKEN STARS and fell hard for the main characters Lialic and Tarver, and was devastated when I found out that this book was going to be set in the same world, but in two different main characters POV, but with similar struggles as the first book. I was even tempted to pass it up just for that reason alone. But of course I couldn't, and let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T!!! Because THIS SHATTERED WORLD was AMAZING!!! So utterly, breathtakingly, amazing, in almost every possible way!!THE PLOTThe planet of Avon is at war. The rebels want peace, equality, they want change. They want their planet terraformed like their suppose to be working towards. They're tired of having to hide from the soldiers, tired of not having a say in their planets growth and functioning, tired of having to steal food and other necessities, tired of not having options--freedom, and their getting itchy. It will only take a spark to ignite the flame that sparks the revolution that turns the tides of this war...Jubilee Chase and Flynn Cormac should never have met...Jubilee Chase, now known as Captain Lee, is as loyal, fierce, and kickbutt as they come! She has a past that has made sure of that. She was sent to Avon like everyone else to crush the rebellion. But for her, it's more personal then anything, and she will do everything in her power to end the rebellion and instill peace back to Avon once and for all. That is until the famously known Flynn Cormac walks in her life and changes everything she once thought...Flynn Cormac, the brother of the former leader of the rebellion, is now the new Leader and trying to steer his people in a different direction then his sister did before she was executed for leading the rebellion. He is desperate to show his people that the violence the rebellion thrived on all those years ago, didn't end well for any of them, and now it is time to try a different way, without violence.But for Flynn to end the war, he must get the Intel he needs to instill the peace his people so desperately need. So doing the only thing he knows to get the answers he needs, he infiltrates the barracks as a guard, and finds something better then corrupt Intel, he finds Jubilee, and does the only thing he can to get himself out of the situation he's got himself in, he takes her hostage...Love, War, and Death, will paint the way when these two worlds collide, and sparks ignite the path to their uncertainty, but with a rebel and a solider, they've defeated the odds already, now they need to unite the two worlds as one, and seize control, before the corruption seizes them first...Lee and Flynn will have to face the unthinkable to end their war and save both sides. But they are only two against thousands, how can they defeat them odds and make them all see reason? How can they stop the senseless blood from being shed, how can they stop the hold the enemy has on them, before it's all too late...THIS SHATTERED WORLD was a fantastic read that I absolutely LOVED!!! It took my breath away and kept my heart-pounding until the very end. I am eager to see where Kaufman & Spooner take us next and what awesome characters and adventures will be introduced to. I know whatever they create is going to be just as awesome as the first, if not better, if that's even possible!Overall, if your looking for a read that will surely satisfy, with plenty of action, adventure, drama, betrayal, war and love, then THIS SHATTERED WORLD is for you. Because it left me utterly satisfied and definitely craving the next book!BRING IT KAUFMAN & SPOONER,I'M READY!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Disney Hyperion for reviewing purposes!

"5 BLISSFUL STARSIGNITE was amazing, absolutely A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!! I mean, WOW, there really are no words to put my feelings into check! Oh, it was powerful, and beautiful, and showed that love can conquer all! I was moved by this story. It was like an invisible hand was guiding my feelings and emotions, string them along and spinning them so fast I could hardly keep up. It was breathtaking, and gaspful, and oh, so dam painful, but by the end, it was utterly blissful!Sara Larson packs a powerful punch in this utterly hypnotic second installment in the DEFY series!! The writing was just as alluring and sweeping as the first time around! The world building unfolded nicely, and evenly flowed into the second book. The action and adventure just kept coming, with just the right amount of breaks to keeps us entertained, yet, gave us a little breathing room to interrupt what we just read. The plot had me spinning in every direction, as the twist and turns just kept coming, and had me in amazement as they unfolded into their pure awesomeness!!!THE PLOTAlexa has saved her kingdom from destruction by their own vicious king. She defeated the vile and deadly black sorcerer in order to save her people and the ones she loves. She helped bring peace and freedom to her people, and put the most amazing king any kingdom could have on the throne. But it all came at a price, and the cost for that victory was high, and all Alexa's sacrifices will forever be branded into her heart and soul. She battled with all her might to achieve that tranquility, but it's about to be threatened, again...The peacefulness the kingdom of Antion has come to know is about to come to an end. Their comfort and security is about to be breached. And again, Alex must step up and show her loyalties by defending her kingdom and the king she would give her life for. But their is something more sinister at work then anything they've ever experienced. And many innocents may suffer casualties, because their kingdom is on the brink of war, again...But the battle that Alex wages with herself is what weighs her down. Her love for her king comes rushing to the surface every time he's around. Feels she knows she shouldn't feel, and fought so hard to keep buried since he claimed his rightful place on the throne. But as every passing day comes, so do her feelings, threatening to take over, threatening to take what is hers, threatening to claim what has been given to her. But that is something she cannot allow to happen. She is unfit to be queen. She is just his scared guarded, burned, and... ruined. But King Damion feels differently, and he's love has never wavered, and is a constant reminder of what she yearns for, but is forbidden...Alex will have to put all her reservations and feelings aside, when threats from every direction arise. They are unsure of who is the enemy and who is ally. But whatever power is running rampant within their kingdom, it is unknown, and very powerful. And has the potential to bring their kingdom to it's knees, if not stopped. Alex will have to rely on herself and her friends if she as any chance of locating this threat and ending them before their kingdom falls under the deadly clutches of the enemy....AHHH, that was just beautiful!! It stole my breath away with every page, and had me enchanted by it's beauty. Before I started this series, I was sure I wasn't going to like it as much as I hoped. But the second I started reading, and got to know Alex, and her challenges, and her fierce, unwavering strength, and the worldbuilding it was built around, I just knew this story was going to steal my heart away. And steal it, it did!!!Overall, IGNITE blew me away, and had me on my toes the entire book, screaming for just one more page. I love these characters, and the world setting, and the strong fierce demeanor they carry, along with the compassionate, yet deadly way about them. The writing was swift and engaging, and totally addicting. The plot was full of depth and development, and the overall feel of the book took me back to the beginning and made me remember why I love this series so much. Entering the first page was like I never even left. I'll be in dire anticipation until book 3 releases and blows me away even more then this one!!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Scholastic Press for reviewing purposes!

"4.5 StarsTHE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS was absolutely brilliant! Thrilling and heart-pounding until the very end! Rae Carsono is an astonishing writer, that painted a world with creativity and magic unlike any I've ever explored. She blew the pages alive with her fierce characters and deadly world!! It truly was a brilliant YA Fantasy that stole my breath away with it's pure awesomeness!!!First, the characters were ALL so awesome and easy to like. I had my doubts though about the main character Elisa, as all she ever talked about was eating, and lacked the full desire to do anything besides indulge herself. BUT, that quickly changed as Elisa is taken from her safe and secure environment and placed into a different world all together with danger lurking around every corner, and then she quickly took on her role she was destined for. And then I was able to sit back and route for her the entire way. And the love interest and side characters were just as amazing and entertaining as Elisa was!! This book balanced it's self nicely, with not too much of one thing, and kept the atmosphere changing, and plot thickening, and I LOVED that!! We were always moving an changing our course in this novel, exploring new lands and territories with danger never far!! To say that THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS kept me on my toes would be an understatement.THE PLOTWar is on the horizons, and bloodshed and death is inevitable...The Kingdom of Joya d'Arena is struggling to win a war that their destine to lose without allying with another kingdom.

But what makes her special is not that she is a Princess, but that she is the bearer of the Godstone. A rare and precious stone that was placed in her navel at on seven-days-old by gods heavenly light. And as being the chosen one to bare gods precious stone, it means that she must serve her god and fulfill his will, even if his will ends in her death...Without a choice, Elisa reluctantly marries her king and travels to her new kingdom of Joya d'Arena. But marrying only for an alliance also means that it will be kept secret, and Elisa will become second to her new husband Alejandro's mistress. Feeling alone and more unwanted then she's ever felt, Elisa feels it couldn't possibly get any worse then it already has. But all that changes when she is kidnapped by the desert people, desperate for her help, no, desperate for the bearer's help. But as a once terrified Elisa is opened up to a whole new world, she realizes that she is more needed out here with the desert people then she ever was in any kingdom she resided in. But what is more distributing to Elisa is that she has been lied too, for years. Her family has kept secrets from her, and these people are the first ones to give her answers -- real answers.

Either way, Elisa might not make it out of this journey alive, as most of the bearers who ever lived died young, and died before completing their act of service...Elisa will learn many things on this journey, and may even find true love, not a cover up marriage like her and the king share. But what Elisa finds on this journey that is most important, is that she is capable of great things -- and that she has more strength and power within then she ever thought possible. And she will fight for her people, even if she has to die for them...I absolutely, positively, undoubtedly, LOVED THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS so FREAKING MUCH!!! It was wonderful and truly heartwarming, and filled with heart-pounding action, adventure, love, sacrifice and death!!! It was beautiful!!! Though I must admit it did have it's faults, and some annoying little parts, but what good book doesn't'?? It would of been unrealistic if it was all perfect with no qualms at all!! But all the little issues I had were easy to look around, and after a while they didn't even bother me anymore!!Overall, THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS was a wonderful surprise that I absolutely loved! It stole my breath away and had me craving the next book. It was such a magical world, twisted with pain and heartache that kept the twist and turns coming!

"4.5 StarsWhat an elegantly spiraling, tremendously beautiful, and utterly wonderful, bombshell of a book!! I absolutely LOVED PRINCESS OF THORNS in every possible way! From it's epic world building, and well developed characters, to it's beautiful version of the SLEEPING BEAUTY retelling that surpassed any and all expectations, and had me falling hopelessly in love with this wonderfully epic and truly beautiful story that rocked me to the core! PRINCESS OF THORNS is NOT a book to be missed!!!Stacey Jay has quickly become one of my new favorite authors of all times!! I've been wanting to read her other book, OF BEAUTY AND BEAST since hearing all the wonderful praise about it, but sadly, I never gotten around to it. So when PRINCESS OF THORNS arrived on my doorstep for review, I jumped at the chance to review an author I've been so desperately wanting to explore. And let me tell you, all the rave reviews and amazing rumors couldn't of prepared me for this rare gem I found within the PRINCESS OF THORNS!!!THE PLOT""Prophecy foretells that in the last days of the Long Summer, the Age of Reaping will dawn with the rise of the living darkness. The four kingdoms will dwell in shadow, and the souls of man feed the First One's hunger for a hundred years.""In a faraway land, their lies two kingdoms in despair, two kingdoms who's rulers have failed them, two kingdoms who's heir's to the throne are cursed, two kingdoms who will be forever doomed into darkness, if the curse is not broken, in time....Only one of the eleven Prince's of the kingdom of Kanvasol still remains. The curse that claims all heirs to the Kanvasol throne at the age of eighteen has already cursed ten of the eleven Prince's. And now as Niklaas, the last remaining Prince of Kanvasol eighteenth birthday drawls near, he knows his time is running out. But him being the youngest and most determined Prince of them all, he is not willing to accept that fate. He is not ready to give up and let the curse claim him, transforming his body from human flesh, to shrink inward and sprout feathers and wings, and be forced to take flight as a swan, forever cursed to be this beautiful animal, unaware of who he was and what he lost. He will not scum to this curse, and is determined to break the chains that bind him, hopefully before it's to late...The remaining Princess of the kingdom of Norvere is all the kingdoms last hope for survival. Gifted with the fairy blessed blood of her dying mother, shed for her to be bestowed the gifts and skills needed in order to save their people from the evil Ogre Queen and her soldiers that have taken their kingdom with force, and have succeeded in stealing the souls of the people of Norvere.Princess Aurora remained in hiding until her seventeenth year of age, only to venture out of her hidden sanctuary when the time comes not to let her mothers sacrifice be in vain. When Aurora's brother, Prince Jor is kidnapped on the way to one of their yearly visit, and then a vision of Jor being killed by his Ogre captives is foreseen, Princess Aurora knows the time has come to break the bounds that bind her, before all is lost and plunged into darkness, forever cursed to dwell in shadow and fear as the age of the reaping will curse them all to a life of misery, torture, and death...Prince Niklaas is ready to set himself free. He sets out to find the lost Princess Aurora, in hopes she will aid him in breaking the wretched curse his father cast upon him, ensuring Niklaas would never live to his eighteenth birthday to become the rightful king of Kanvasol. So Niklaas's only hope lies in finding the last remaining unwed Princess, and persuade her to marry him before it's too late.Niklaas and Aurora join forces, both needing something from the other, but unsure of the truth behind it. The journey is anything but easy, as the Ogre Queen is never far behind, and her lackeys are determined to bring Princess Aurora to their Queen, eager to fulfill the prophecy, and allow The Age Of Reaping to rise. And the longer the secrets that both Niklaas and Aurora harbor, the harder it is for them to remain true, because they could very well destroy the strong relationship they've forged, if ever revealed.Time is running out as Niklaas's eighteenth birthday drawls near, and Aurora knows the clock is ticking until her brothers fate comes true. They will have to put aside their differences and work together if their going to stay alive long enough to complete their missions. But what do you do if you heart is pulling you one way, but you mind is pulling you another???Overall, PRINCESS OF THORNS was a fantastic read that I absolutely adored!!! I am so eager to read more from this author, as I know it will be just as amazing as this book was! I have a feeling Stacy Jay is going to do great things in the YA Genre, and I will be right there waiting when she does!! If your looking for a romantic YA fantasy, that will sweep you into a world of lies, betrayals, sacrifice, determination, strength, and a forceful love that is determined to prevail, then PRINCESS OF THORNS is a MUST READ!!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Random House for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsPAWN was a thrilling, high stakes, emotionally-packed, roller coaster of ups and downs that flew by at immensely fast speed. I devoured PAWN so quickly, and before I knew it, the book was over and I was graveling over not having the next book!I've been so excited about reading PAWN ever since last year when I received an eARC. I loved the premise and thought it stuck out from the other kazillion dystopians out there. It surely lived up to my expectations and some! I think any fans of dystopian and even thrillers would find this one highly enjoyable!THE PLOTYOU CAN BE A VII. IF YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING.Kitty Doe has just turned Seventeen, and for her, her life is all but over. After taking the test that all seventeen year old's have to take, and only scoring a III, which is not the worse you could score, but by far from the best either. She has very limited options; either be assigned to cleaning the sewers far away from Benji, the only person who really matters in the world. Or, she can turn trick at a club for a month until Benji turns seventeen and takes his test and scores the VI that she knows he'll score, and then get the hell out off dodge. But... a third option has just been laid on the table, one very hard to resist....Kitty has just been offered the opportunity to join the most powerful family in their world. She will become a VII, the best possible score you can have. And with that VII comes power, fame, wealth, and anything material her heart desires. But of course, nothing comes without a price, and the price she will have to pay is the highest she can give.Kitty will have to sell her soul to the devil and give up everything and everyone she knows and loves to become a new person. But, she will not just become any person, she will become Lila Hart, the Prime Minister's niece who mysteriously died. But what she doesn't know is that Kitty Doe will exist no more, and she will be reborn, masked...With very little options, Kitty reluctantly accepts the offer, but before she realizes what she's signed up for, she awakens no loner as Kitty Doe, but now masked as Lila Hart. She will now have to master every aspect of Lila Hart's life if she has any hope of fooling the people into thinking she is in fact Lila Hart. But why is Lila's image so important that she can not be dead? What caused her death anyway? What is brewing so deep that Lila is needed to bring it back from the brink? Well Kitty is about to get those answers and more.She hears whispers of a rebellion... Talk of an uprising, secrets of what's sure to come. But as Kitty gets deeper into the game of being their pawn, she realizes that the odds of her escaping all of this when it's over are becoming slim to none. And that can only mean one thing.... murder, HER murder...Everything is coming to a head as Kitty starts to unravel the web of lies, deceptions, betrays, and ultimately, murder. She will have to forge unlikely allies in her new world. Form new bounds and allegiance, and reunite with old ones as she plays this dangerous game. But if Kitty has any hope of making it out alive, she will have to be what she's been trained to be, a pawn....Overall, PAWN was a blast to read! I highly enjoyed the world it was built around, and the characters that made it come alive. I can't WAIT to get back into this world and see what happens next, because that ending had me dying to read on!!NOTE: I received an eARC from Harlequin TEEN for reviewing purposes!

"4 Stars  Wow, what a surprisingly thrilling ride WINTERKILL was!! I was sure WINTERKILL was not going to be ""My kinda book"" but WHOA, my mind was changed pretty quickly! I highly enjoyed WINTERKILL, but I wasn't sure on how I was going to feel after it started. It was kinda slow, and dragged in the beginning. It felt like nothing was really happening besides a girl wanting to go out in the woods beyond. But it changed quickly after the first 15-20%, then I was in full flow of in engagement! I was swept into a world full of lies, secrets, deception, mystery, and.... murder. Yeah, it's definitely got the qualities of my ""Kinda Book!""  THE PLOT...  Deep in the mysterious woods, lies a forgotten village, secluded with ancient legends and whispers of beast that roam the woods, searching and preying, taking and claiming the lives of the people long ago, which are now remembered as, The Lost People.  What people have survived, remain in their walled village in the woods, trying to keep the peace and survive. They've bounded together for years, abiding by the Council and Leader's every word. To not abide, would be considered a wayward act, and being branded as a wayward is a serious crime, with serious consequences. As being deemed a wayward is risking the communities survival, and thus ruled unfit to remain in the community, and then are sentenced to the crossroads, to die...  At almost the age of sixteen, Emmeline is officially becoming of age. Which means she is just about the age of eligibility to be offered the opportunity to become bound to a man of binding age. She's never really given binding to a man too much thought, as she is looked down upon, and shunned for her grandmothers waywardness when she was a young girl in the village, and was sent to the crossroads, to die. So Em is marked, labeled a high risk for waywardness, and has been paying the price since birth.  Em fills her days helping in the village by gathering herbs, plants, and other useful flora she can find in the gathering areas. But she yearns for more. She desires to leave the boundaries of their village which is forbidden, and considered an act of waywardness that could land her a one way trip to the crossroads. But the desire is there, and it is strong, with reacquiring dreams that are calling to her. Telling her to find them, luring her to the woods beyond the boundaries of their save haven. And one day, the pull is too much for Em, and she gives in, and that's when everything changes...  Em explores the woods outside her world hoping to find what has been calling her. And that's when she finds... lies, secrets, betrayals, mystery, murder, and The Lost People. But she's playing on very dangerous ground, and if caught, not only her world, but the ones she loves, could come crumbling down.  Em will have to uncover who or what is calling to her, and just what do they really want? As the boundaries between friend and foe start to blend, and too many lines crossed, Em will have to decide what is worth fighting for, and just how far she's willing to go to set things right.  Em will have to make the ultimate choice, make the unknown, known, or leave it as it is. Which could be worse? Em's about to find out in this epic adventure as one girl fights for what she believes in.  Overall, WINTERKILL was an intensely great read, which I devoured as the mystery unfolded, and the pieces of the puzzle started fitting into place. By the end of the book I found myself really engaged, and dying to know what was going to happen next to these awesome characters that I've slowly grown to care for. It's definitely worthy the read, and I highly recommended it, even with it's slowwwww start!!! ;)  NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Amulet Books for reviewing purposes!

"4 Stars  ILLUSIONS OF FATE is a magically enchanting, highly emotional, and beautifully written. With a spiraling world of ups and downs, that will have you swaying with the need for more.  With it's highly complex characters, to it's richly dramatic world, and it's sweeping magical undertow, it's made for a thrilling adventure that will keep you on your toes until the very end.  I was hooked from the beginning of ILLUSIONS OF FATE. It was something about this book that instantly drew me in. But I noticed as the plot progressed, I started to find myself not as attached as I was in the earlier chapters. And while I still really enjoyed ILLUSIONS OF FATE, and would definitely recommended it, it just felt like it was lacking that special something in some areas.  One being that it felt rushed. At a mere 275 pages in a physical ARC, it could of been longer, it needed to be longer. The world building was fascinating, I loved the different magical groups and the mythological background. But it was not explored and revealed as much as it could of been. And the ending ended to abruptly. Seriously, one chapter there's the big scene that we've all been waiting for. Then the next, bam... it's over, no closure, not really anyway, well not enough for my taste. But if there is going to be a sequel, then it wouldn't be as bad. But I've heard rumors that there will not be a sequel. And if that is the case, then that's terrible, because A LOT is left unsaid and unrevealed. I just felt the author could of easily added 100 pages on and made the story more complex with a deeper route into the background and wrapped up the ending in a more drawn-out satisfying way.  THE PLOT  Jessamin left her home island of Melei to go to one of the best schools in the upper class country of Albion. But as Jessa starts to get into her normal routine in a new country, her world is thrown up into a chaotic uproar. Jessa has just been opened into a new world....of magic.  “I did my best to keep you from crossing paths with this world. And I shall do my best to protect you now that you have.”  When Jessa meets the enticing and dangerously alluring young Lord, Finn Ackerly, she is quickly swept into a magical world known only to the nobility. Jessa can't help but feel drawn to the attractively charming lord, but knows that something is different when she is around him. She's never known magic existed, let alone is the backbone to the nobles existence. But when it becomes clear that magic is in fact real, and it's not going away, she will have to decide what, and ultimately who is worth fighting for.  There is a deadly game being played by two very powerful lords, and Jessa just so happens to be dead smack in the middle of it all! She's become their pawn piece in their vicious game of magical war, and if Jessa wants to save the ones she's come to love, then she has no choice but to follow through and be the pawn in their vicious game of tug a war.  With no other options, Jessa will have to use every ally she has made to dig herself out of the mess she's been pulled into to beat the evil Minister of Defense, Lord Downpike at his own game. Because if she fails, not only the ones she's come to love, but also her home island will pay the ultimate price.  Overall, ILLUSIONS OF FATE was a quick, lighthearted, read, with thrilling characters that were entertaining and magical. I really enjoyed ILLUSIONS OF FATE, even with it's unrevealed secrets that I'm dying to know. It still was a great read and I would definitely recommend it.

"5 Stars  GRAVE MERCY was a dark spine-chilling, highly thrilling, and intensely beautiful adventure! I was captivated by this story, and the struggles that the characters had to go through. I was quickly swept into this engaging world until the very end!  Robin LaFevers has exceeded my expectations with GRAVE MERCY on soooo many levels. She delivered a complex world, with a fiercely strong heroine, with conspiracies and plots, lies and deceptions, and determined side characters with plenty of personality and charisma to have you yearning for more!  THE PLOT  Ismae Rienne was sired by the God of Death himself. At birth, her mother had tried to have her expelled from her womb, but ultimately failed. Now, fourteen years later, Ismae lives with her ""so called father,"" and endures his harsh words and even harder hands. She has no choice but to accept his treatment, for who would help the daughter of death? All who see her, shun her, all who hear of her, degrade her, and all who know her, hate her. She is unworthy of the air she breaths, at least that is until someone out there thinks she is worthy. And that is when Ismae's life changes....  Finally, her calling is revealed, and she is saved from having to endure the wrath of the husband her father has sold her too. She is whisked away to the convent of St. Mortain, where she will serve her God of Death, and live out his wishes by caring out his will of death. She will be trained in all the arts of killing a man, in which she finds there is many ways to do...  Three Years Later...  Blessed with her death kissed gifts from the God of Death, her quick witted mind, and all the training the convent has instilled in her. Ismae is finally ready to step foot outside the convent to carry out her gods wishes, to finally kill a man...  But Ismae finds that their is more to this world then she's been trained to think. She has made her vow that the Duchess she serves and the God she worships will always come first. But what of her heart? Is that to be forbidden what it yearns?  Ismae is thrust into a dangerous world at court where she's been assigned by the convent to identify the trader that is aiding the French eager to turn the tides of the oncoming war. But her convent insist that they've already found the trader. And it just so happens to be the same man that not only has befriended her, but has also stolen her heart. She knows that he is not the trader. She feels it with every ounce of her soul. But with no proof and no other solid suspect, she fears the order may come, and if it does, will she be able to carry out her gods will? Or... is it even her gods will she is upholding?  All these questions come to the surface as Ismae unravels the web of lies, deception and traitorous behavior to find the trader, keep the Duchess safe, all while trying to uphold her convents orders. But the orders are starting to collide with her heart, and she knows that the orders are thriving off misinformation. But with a vow she's made to never question the wishes of her god, how can she possibly not follow orders?  Ismae will have to determine who can be trusted, and who is worth killing. Because someone in the Duchess inner circle is the trader. But who, is the ultimate goal she will have to face. And when it comes down to it, will she be able to trust her convent, or her heart?  GRAVE MERCY was an absolutely AMAZING book!! I loved every single thing about it! If you haven't read it yet, please don't be like me and wait years before you finally decide to pick it up. I was kicking myself for waiting so long!  Overall, GRAVE MERCY was a powerful, pulse racing, hands shaking, thrilling adventure, that was more then I could of predicted. With it's powerful political intrigue, and strongly fierce characters, GRAVE MERCY is one to keep you up late, demanding just one more chapter. I would HIGHLY recommend GRAVE MERCY to anyone!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ZX1J0QPM6Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054762834X#wasThisHelpful","R29ZX1J0QPM6Y2","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 StarsTHE JEWEL has been one of my most anticipated books of the year. But to tell you the truth, I never really read the full synopsis. I just seen the amazing cover, and that it was a dystopian, and I was sold! So I went into THE JEWEL a little blind, and really had no idea that their was any kind of magic in this book. Which there was actually a lot. Really, the story was built around magic, and what it was capable to do for the Royals. So to say I was shocked to see how much magic was in this book, well that would be an understatement.BUT... I still found myself quickly pulled into this world of magic, wealth, beauty, slaves, politics, plots, conspiracies, and so much more. Even though I was surprised at the route that THE JEWEL took, I still LOVED the world building, and the foundation of their world. The setting was appalling, yet so addicting.THE PLOT... ""The Jewel means wealth. The Jewel means beauty. The Jewel means royalty. But for girls like Violet, the Jewel means servitude."" The Jewel is a place of riches and wealth, of extravagances and beauty, of dominance and power. A place where the Royals are the predators, and the low class citizens of the Marsh are their prey...Centuries ago, the Royal line was coming to an end. The woman of Royal blood were not capable to bare healthy children. Their babies were born sickly or deformed, and eventually died. But there were some women who were still able to bare healthy children.And then a ""brilliant"" doctor brought hope back to the Royals when he discovered Surrogates, and they're worth to the them. How vital they were to the survival of the Royal blood, and keeping their line going strong.And that is when the world changed both for the woman of Royalty, but also for the poor woman of the Marsh, that now became incubators for the Royal babies....They were now their slaves...Violet is about to know what it means to become a Surrogate. She's always been known as Violet, but that is coming to an end, and now she will officially become #197. A very rare and highly valuable piece of property. She is marked among the highest in her Southgate class of girls—Surrogates. She has mastered 2 of the 3 Augury powers, thus making her one of the highest desired Surrogates among the Royalty. She is about to be owned, forced to carry a baby that is not her own. She is about to have her life sold and destroyed...Violet is sold for a very high price to the Duchess Of The Lake, one of the four founding houses of The Jewel. The Duchess is cunning, vengeful, and as cutthroat as they come. And she has been waiting for Violet for a very, very long time, nineteen years to be exact. She has plans to move up the Royal latter and become someone she was suppose to be before it was taken from her. The Duchess wants revenge, and has a thirst for blood. She's prepared to use any means necessary to get what she wants. And Violet just so happens to be her stepping stone to get there.Violet is brought to a world unlike anything she's ever experienced. At first, she is swayed and awed by the beauty and extravagance the Duchess bestows to her. But then Violet starts to unravel some of the Duchess plots and schemes, and finds that she is the key to conquering them. Violet begins to second guess everything she's once thought, and starts to plot ways to become free from the Duchess. And she finds that there is someone that is very eager to aid her in her mission...Then Violet meets the Duchess niece's companion,  Ash, and immediately, sparks fly between them. It's practically, ""Love at first sight"" and Violet starts to feel things she's never felt. Things she's never been ""allowed"" to feel. Feeling that could get both her and Ash in a load of trouble if their caught.With Surrogates being murdered by the competition, and her own reservations about bearing the Duchess child, her mixed feelings about Ash, and her overwhelming desire to be free. Violet is more then determined to take a stand. But just when she thinks she has it all figured out, her world comes shattering down, and Violet has just ran out of time to pick up the pieces...I thought THE JEWEL was a pretty good, if not a great book. But the romance was the one and only issue I had in the whole book. It was definitely not the strong suit in this novel. I think if Ash and Violet's feeling and romance were fleshed out a bit, and maybe if Ash was introduced earlier into the story, and their feeling progressed over time, and not rushed in the last quarter or so of the book. Then I think it would of made the story a lot more enjoyable, and more realistic. But with the plot as awesome as it was, I was easily able to put the romance on the back burner and focus on the actual plot.Overall, THE JEWEL was a great start to a highly intense series, that I will definitely be continuing. When it ended, I thought my world shattered with it!! Amy Ewing sure knows how to end a story to make her readers come back for more!! Epic ending, with secrets revealed, worlds shattered, and fist flying! I can't wait to get my hands on book 2 and she where Ewing takes us next. And I'm dying to see the second books cover, because I LOVED THE JEWEL'S cover!! It's one of my favorite covers of the year!!! Bring it Ewing, I'm ready for book 2!!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Harper Teen for reviewing purposes!

"4 StarsA BREATH OF FROST was a spiraling, spellbinding, magical world, with tons of magic and romance, that unfolded into a world filled of witches, warlocks, ghouls, hellhounds, underworlds, magical elements, spells, and a turmoil of murders and mystery! It was breathtakingly beautiful. Every last page had me compelled to read more. It truly was unlike anything I've ever read.THE PLOT...It's 1814 in the sparkling city of London, where witchcraft is unknown, and only revealed to those with witchcraft lineage, and other deadly paranormal beings. It's beautiful, yet dangerous, and very deadly...But for Emma, Gretchen, and Penelope, the only thing they know is the sparkling ballroom parties, fantasy dresses, and their noble name. But all that changes when Emma accidentally breaks a perfume bottle at the ball, or so she thought it was a perfume bottle. Emma actually broke a very powerful binding spell when she dropped that bottle. And now the 3 cousins, Emma, Gretchen, and Penelope's true destiny is finally revealed...The cousins return from the ball with unknown powers, and uneasy feelings that their is more to their world then they once thought. But that's not all that happened when Emma broke that bottle. People are dying, but not just any people, witches. And for some crazy reason, the wind pushes Emma to the bodies, every single one of them. With Emma being at every murder scene, and her mothers defiance against the Order (The witch police), and her mothers insanity for her defiance. Emma becomes their number one suspect for the murders. But why are these witches being murdered, and why does the wind push her to every one? But then Emma desperately gets her answers. When she broke her mothers bottle, she not only unbound her and her cousins powers, but she also opened the gates to the underworld. And unknowingly, allowed the Greymalkin sisters to rise and enter the portals from the underworld, to their world. But the Greymalkin sisters have come with a purpose, to kill and drain witches for their powers, so they can build enough strength and power to eventually solidify, and become whole enough to reclaim their old life in their world to wreck havoc, and keep killing and draining witches...With Emma now the Orders number one suspect, and the crazy things happening to her, like growing antlers out of her head...Yep, you heard me right, ANTLERS... Oh, and lets not forget about her attraction to the insanely seductive, yet dangerously alluring Cormac Blackburn. And also a member of the Order that is hunting her!! And while she battles her undying attraction to him, and he fights to keep the Order at bay from her, she also knows that he has vowed an oath to always put the Order first. So where does that leave Emma and him, since you know, they think she's a murderer and all?? Emma will go on a journey like no other, as she unravels secrets and horrifying truths that were never meant to be revealed. It's why her mother sacrificed her sanity by trapping her familiar in a bottle, thus driving her mad. And if these buried secrets ever came to the surface and were revealed, it could very well get Emma killed...Emma will have to trust herself and her cousins, while building allies with madcaps, and secret allies with the handsome, yet dangerously alluring Cormac. All while trying to master her powers and unravel her families secrets, while evading the Order, and trying to stay away from all the murders that are literally pulling her to them. Oh, and staying out of the Greymalkin sisters paths, that she inadvertently can't stay a way from. Because Emma is treading on very dangerous territory, and one wrong move and she could meet her end, either by the Order, or the warlock Sisters, or the murderer on the loose aiding the warlocks sisters and killing witches. She's on her most deadliest adventure yet, and it may be her last...Overall, A BREATH OF FROST was a magically enchanting, and highly addicting world that was more then enough to keep me glued to the last page, not wanting to do anything until it was over. It's definitely a series that I will read for many years to come! I can't wait to jump into book two and continue these cousins journey, because I have no doubt that Alyxandra Harvey will surpass A BREATH OF FROST and have me falling in love with a whole story, but from the same series!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Bloomsbury for reviewing purposes!

"THE FIRE WISH was an exceptional book that I devoured so quickly. Then I became furious with myself for reading it so quickly, because I just wanted to continue Najwa and Zayele journey so badly!!As this being my first jinni book, I was curious to see what was in store. And I am thrilled to say that I loved the the unique world-building, and the thick-plotted world in THE FIRE WISH!! And after reading this book and practically loving it, I know it will not be the last jinni book I read!! A jinni, and a princess trading lives??? YES, that is enough to make me want it. It's different then your normal YA book, and that's one reason I loved it!! And another reason I had to read it was that Aladdin was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up, and though it was different, it still had similarities, and I loved that!!THE PLOT...Najwa is a jinni living in the Kingdom Jinn, training in the Corps to be a spy in the upcoming war with the humans. But the day she breaches the humans wards in the Baghdad palace, everything changes. On her third trip sneaking past the palace wards, her luck finally runs out and she is caught by Zayele and forced to grant her a wish that will change both girls lives, forever...Zayele is a human living with her tribe when the Vizier walks into their village and informs them that the Prince of Baghdad is looking for his first bride. But it's only when her father and the Vizier inform her that she will be Prince Kamal's first wife, and the Princess of Baghdad, that Zayele's world gets ripped out from under her, and her life is forever changed!But when Zayele runs into the only thing that can save her from her horrible fate at being a bride to a man she doesn't love, she eagerly takes it! She forces Najwa, a jinni that snuck past the palace defenses to grant her a way out, but the wish doesn't turn out to be what she thought it would be.With a wish went wrong, Zayele a human, and Najwa a jinni, find themselves switched and forced to live each others lives, if they can pull it off. Living in two very different worlds, and with the jinni and human war on the horizon, both girls know that getting caught as each other is not an option. One wrong move could cost them their lives...A magical adventure...Ooh, that was just a beautiful story on so many levels!! It was truly one of a kind, and with a writing that captivated and allured me, I know for sure that I will be reading more from this author!!But I have to admit that the beginning of this book had me tempted to put it down for a while. But as the chapters went on, and I found myself slowly getting more attached to both characters, I just knew there was no putting this down, and that I HAD to stick it out to the end to find out what would happen to both this girls. And I am sooo happy that I did not let the slow beginning weigh my decision to DNF this for a while, because I would of been furious at myself to not reading it when I had the chance!!! I was also a little skeptical when I started reading the dual POV's. I'm not to eager to jump into a book if it's told from two POV's. But surprisingly, it was easy to adjust to the two very different lives, and the change of character. And after a few chapters, I was quickly immersed into the flow of the story, and I thoroughly enjoyed both characters POV!!Overall, I highly recommend THE FIRE WISH for any YA, fantasy fan who wants a different kinda read, with awesome characters, a ongoing war, and two very sweet romances that will have you yearning for more. If you can get past the slow start and the dual POV's, then I think any YA, fantasy fan will love this one as much as I did!!! NOTE: I received an ARC from Random House for reviewing purposes.

"There's only one word to describe ONE PAST MIDNIGHT!! And that's ""Unputdownable""!!! I know we tend to hear that a lot in reviews, but I've racked my brain over and over to come up with the perfect word to describe the feeling I felt while reading this book, and this is the one word that best described my feelings while reading ONE PAST MIDNIGHT!! ""UN-PUT-DOWN-A-BLE!!!!I was hooked from the first paragraph. I was so intrigued by the plot that it immediately sucked me in. Between the writing and plot I was unwilling to put it down. I've never been a big fan of parallel worlds, but ONE PAST MIDNIGHT was phenomenal!!!THE PLOT...Sabine has been living 2 different lives for as long as she can remember. She's use to having her life one way, then 24 hours later, switching to her same self, but everything else in her life is different. One life she rebels and has a poor quality of life. The other, she is important and has a wealthy rich life, with everything she could possible want. She has grown use to it, but every life shift always takes a little piece of her with it. Until one day, it all changes, and Sabine finds a loop hole that she eagerly jumps through. But what is she really risking, and ultimately, what is the cost she will have to pay?ONE PAST MIDNIGHT was an original, thick-plotted, spiraling world that I adored!! I felt for Sabine and the struggles she had to endure with every life switch. I know I personally could not be one person in one life, then switch to the same me, but with everything different, and still hold the memories and be able to keep my sanity!! Nope, I would of been locked away in a mental hospital never to be let out!! So I kinda admired Sabine for her keeping her sanity, and the strength she possessed!!Overall, I enjoyed ONE PAST MIDNIGHT a lot more then I anticipated, and I am so glad I gave it a shot, because I would of definitely been missing out!!! If you want a fresh original, parallel world, with twist and turns, that are sure to please? Then ONE PAST MIDNIGHT is sure to be your next read!!!NOTE: I received an ARC from Bloomsbury for reviewing purposes.

"4 Stars  EXTRACTION was an fantastic book that I really enjoyed! It was a great ""Pick me up"" kinda book! I felt myself slowly going into a reading slump before reading it, then as I progressed in the book I found myself wrapped up in this terrifying, yet addicting world in EXTRACTION and my reading slump was official over.  I was fascinated by this world and how it was setup. I've read plenty of dystopian novels, probably more dystopian then any other genre. But they're was something about EXTRACTION that made it feel different then your normal dystopian novel. It was plotted similar to your average dystopian, but at the same time, it felt different then anything I've ever read, and I loved that about EXTRACTION.  THE PLOT...  The planet of Kiel is toxic and has been killing millions for many years. But what little humans have survived live either on the Surface with the moons lethal acid, working themselves to the bloody bone, or live underground where it's much safer from the moons acid (Moonshine as they call it.) But not all the sectors underground are as good as they seem. The ones living in the Crust, Mantle, and Lower are also forced to work themselves sick. They've been deemed unworthy, only capable of working to support the Core. The Core being the brains that runs their new-found world on the planet of Keil. They are called The Developers, the scientists that created their undergrounds safe havens. They are the dictators, and they are vile and vicious, and wouldn't think twice about taking you out if they found it in their best interest. And all the ones living above them, are all doomed, for death!!  But their is one way out, if your lucky. On your 16th birthday you are given a test that will determine your promise score. For they only want the smart, the strong, and the obedient people in the Core, where life is easy compared to above. The ones living underground in the Core are the privileged, and were either born into an authority position, or were hand picked on their 16th birthday to enter the Core and contribute to the Cores survival.  Clementine is one of the unlucky, she lives on the surface with the moons lethal acid. She has seen first hand what the acid can do to a person if given  minutes within it. Only reason she is still breathing is because The Developers have built a protective shield to help keep the acid from penetrating and entering their planet of Kiel. But that does not mean it does not leak through sometimes, because it does, and it can be deadly.  Clementine lives in the work camps working day and night to support the Core. She has waited sixteen long years for her opportunity to take the Extraction testing and get off the deadly surface. She has wanted nothing more, except one person, her boyfriend Logan. But if she's approved for Extraction, she will have to leave him behind, for good!  But as Clementine digs deeper into the Core and their plans, she realizes that all is not what it seems, and the clock is ticking if she doesn't do something to stop the evil plans the leaders have set in motion. Then all might be lost for the surface dwellers, and that means Logan too, and that is something she can not have.  Clementine will have to make some tough decisions along the way, some that will not only change the fate of her and Logan, but the fate of the rest of the population. And if she's not careful, all could be lost and everything she's been fighting for would of been for nothing!  EXTRACTION was an awesome dystopian that I devoured quickly. I've grown to care for these characters and the horrible situations they've endured, and the strength they were able to find when all seemed lost.  Overall, EXTRACTION was a freshly terrifying, yet fantastically additive dystopian, that will have you on the edge of your seat demanding more! EXTRACTION was everything I needed to get me out of my reading slump, and had more then enough action and adventure to keep me engaged. And before I knew it, EXTRACTION was over and I was needing more!! I am so excited for the next book, and the cover of REBELLION is sooo AMAZING!!!

"4 StarsI can't even begin to form the right words to express my feelings on this book. It had me going high, really, really high. Then BAM, I would drop down and keep goingggg. But it was awesome to experience all these feelings from one EPIC book!!!The best way to describe my feelings is that CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was intense. I was on my toes, pacing as I was reading. I couldn't get it down fast enough to satiate my urge. It was like I knew something fantastic was coming, and every chapter was getting me closer to what I knew was going to blow me away, because I could feel it. And then it finally came, and WOW, I was in awe, and in amazement, and in such a great desire for the next book (Luckily I already have it ;) I thought it was way better then the first book, and it had just enough of everything I wanted.THE PLOT...Celaena is back, and she's more deadlier then ever! She's finally made it to the top and became the Kings Champion. But for Celaena, that was just the beginning, as the real test begins now, and she will have to decide where her heart really lies. Now is when she will have to swallow her pride and do as she's told, or die where she's standing. The time has come for her to do all the dirty work the king desires. Her task? To kill all who threaten the Kings empire. To kill innocents, to slaughter them like pigs all because they want to live a life without fear, without bowing down to a man they despise. And Celaena has only 2 choices, she can do as she's told, and finally be free after 4 years of doing the Kings evil bidding's. Or, she can defy the king and be killed on the spot!! But neither of them 2 options sound appealing to Celaena. But what if there was a 3rd choice? A gray area she could play with?? And then the wheels start turning and the fun starts for Celaena...Celaena will have to do the unthinkable if she's going to follow the path she chooses. She will have to face some dark secrets she has kept hidden, and buried away for as long as she can remember. But as the truth surfaces and Celaena faces deadly secrets, she will have to make the ultimate choice if she's going to stay alive long enough to make a difference. Because if her secrets were revealed, she would become the hunted, not the hunter...The CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was an amazing sequel to THRONE OF GLASS. I liked THRONE OF GLASS, but it was lacking the action and adventure I craved. But CROWN OF MIDNIGHT sedated every craving and some!! I can't wait to dive into HEIR OF FIRE soon, and see what happens next in Celaena's journey. Because it ended on one hell of a cliffhanger that had me screaming for more!!Overall, CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was just the sequel I was hoping for. I swept up into it's fast-paced, action-packed, magical-filled, fantasy world that took me on the ride of my life!!! This series has become one of my new faves, and I'm excited to see where Maas takes us next!NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Bloomsbury for reviewing purposes!

"4.5 StarsOoh, the FEELS!!! This book pulled more feelings out of me then I knew I had. It was intense and overwhelming!! I was breathless, and in awe with the direction that this book took. PRODIGY is a action-packed, emotion-filled, heart-pounding of a sequel, that I devoured! I really did not see that ending coming, I was left with my mouthing hanging wide open and tears threatening to fall. To say I was pleased and SHOCKED with PRODIGY, that would be an understatement, I was ELATED and totally satisfied with this book!!!  THE PLOT...  The Republic is on the brink of collapse. The government is losing their stronghold on the people. The Republic has failed them, used an abused them, and the people are fed up, and are now ready to fight back... But then the unthinkable happens, and they're world is thrown into an uproar of chaos and mayhem that could very well change the world as they know it, either for the good, or the bad...A Bombshell Of A Sequel!!  **JUNE SIDE**  With the help from the Patriots, a rebel organization that revolts against the Republic, June has barely succeed in breaking Day out from his execution. But not without a price, a heavy price that will be paid one way or another. Now on the run and being two of the most wanted criminals in the Republic, June and Day have very little options. They can either join the Patriots on their mission to bring back the old United States, or they can run, and hide and try to make it to the colonies to seek refuge, if they make it that far. With little else, June and Day are reluctantly recruited into Patriots. June is now tasked with an elite roll in the mission, she will have to push aside all feelings of an old allegiance with the Republic if she has any chance of successfully completing her mission.  But as the plot thickens, June realizes that their is lies, secrets and conspiracy's that must be uncovered before she can go though with anything. But as it all starts to unfold, she finds herself in deeper then she anticipated, and that their is more to this plot then she once thought, and that it's to be paid in blood, and in highly powerful blood at that!!  **DAY SIDE**  Day injured and mourning his families death is tasked with his own special place in the mission, one that could very well change his life for either the good, or bad. But one thing is for certain, if he has any chance at saving his brother from the deadly clutches of the Republic, then the Patriots are his best chance to save his brother and get the hell out of the Republic once and for all.  But with Day's fierce trust in June, and her reluctance to go through with the mission, Day is starting to second guess his part in all of it, and if he can even go through with it. But he knows they only have once shot to get this right, and missing it could mean serious consequences, and even death for him, June, and maybe even his little brother Eden...  Day and June are finally fighting on the same side, but as they come closer to the end, they realize that they both have different agendas about what needs to be done, and who can really be trusted. But one thing is for sure, this plot runs deeper then they once thought, and their may be more enemies lurking around them then they realized. And choosing the wrong side could not only doom them, but the rest of the people in the Republic.  Overall, PRODIGY was a bombshell of a second book, with twist and turns that made me what to scream, cry, and laugh my heart out. I loved June and Day together or apart, they are just awesome protagonists! And with that serious cliffhanger ending, I'm dying to sink my teeth into the next novel, CHAMPION and see how it all ends. Because it seems like with that ending it could go so many different directions, and I'm eager to see which path Marie Lu takes us on!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30STDEEFNTJAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399256768#wasThisHelpful","R30STDEEFNTJAC","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my eye on THE TESTING long before it was released. I even received an eARC from the publisher for review. I was just sooo excited to read this, but for some crazy reason, I didn't. I kept thinking how awesome this series sounds, and how much I love dystopians, but I kept putting it off. So finally, when I received my credits from audible audio, I said what the hell, it's finally time to give THE TESTING it's fair shot. And OMG, I found myself instantly drawn into this story. The narrator was amazing, and the mystery was alluring, and I was easily able to get into the vibes. I couldn't help but to pick this audiobook up every free chance I got.  THE PLOT...  Cia has always lived a fairly good life, better then most anyway. With a big family, all brothers, and two loving successful parents that any child would appreciate. She's been preparing for the opportunity to be chosen for The Testing. But when the time comes to graduate and become an official adult, Cia's world becomes a living nightmare.  Cia's dreams have finally come true, she's officially been chosen for The Testing!! And she can't be more thrilled. She's always hoped for the opportunity to show her government just how much she can contribute in making the Commonwealth a better place for their future. And now after all her hard work, it's finally paid off. Until The Testing actually starts and Cia finally sees The Testing for what it really is, a death trap in waiting!  Cia has no choice but to go through with The Testing, or risk treason against the United Commonwealth. And that right there could mean a death sentence in itself. But Cia's not giving up, she's smart, determined, and not easily manipulated. And besides, Cia has one thing that gives her an advantage, and just might keep her alive long enough to get through The Testing. She has her fathers words, his warnings, his own experiences through The Testing. But as The Testing gets deeper, and Cia finds herself getting closer to the finish line, her fathers words ring in her ears ""Trust no one."" But Cia finds herself drawn to her childhood friend Tomas, and feels for some reason, he can be trusted. But what about the other Testing Candidates? Can they be trusted? Who's real, and who isn't? Who is befriending her to betray her? And who is befriending her to ally with her?  As the plot thickens, and The Testing Candidates get further into The Testing, they will have to determine who is deadly, and who is just trying survive. Because before all is said and done, they will come face to face with death, but whether or not they survive is up to them. But Cia may find that there is more cutthroats then not, and if she has any chance of surviving, she will have to do as her father said ""Trust no one!"" But surly, she can trust Tomas, can't she?  THE TESTING was a great addition to the Dystopian genre, that is sure to please many readers. I'm looking forward to finishing this series and seeing what happens next in Cia and Tomas's adventure!  Overall, THE TESTING was a fast-paced, action-packed, thrill-ride, that is not to be missed!

"RUIN AND RISING was everything I could of hoped for and more! It had a phenomenal ending that left me utterly satisfied!! I was pleased with every angle this book took. Though I have to admit that I found myself a little shocked at the direction that this book did take. But in the end, I was left feeling complete and at peace with the series in a whole. But I will mourn the route that it didn't take, and the ones that didn't make it. But to say I'm happy with the way it ended would be an understatement, I'm ELATED!!!  THE PLOT..  Alina is left all but shattered after her last battle with The Darkling in the Little Palace. She has failed to defeat him once again, and lost countless of lives in the process. She was not strong enough to defeat The Darkling, and she's paying for it now.  Hiding in the vast underground tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina finds herself at her worst. With all her power dried up and gone, Alina and her remaining group are at the mercy of the Apparat and his followers. The Zealots who worship Alina as a Saint, but are under command of the Apparat. With Alina and her group weakened and highly outnumbered, they group will have to work together and use every bit of wits and strength they have to find a way out of the tunnels and away from the power-hungry Apparat. Because Alina is getting stronger everyday, and she's not ready to give up just yet. She wants out of hiding and to search for the only thing that's standing in her way of defeating The Darking, the Firdbird!!!  Alina and her group set out on their final journey to find the Firebird, and hopefully the charismatic, strategizing lost prince, that took a piece of her heart with him. But they will have to overcome many obstacles and attacks along the way if they have any chance of finding the Firebird and making it to The Darkling before it's too late. Because The Darkling is getting smarter, he's taking bigger risk, and he's done playing games with Alina. And he's coming at her full force, so this time, she better be ready!  The time has come for the ultimate battle of good versus evil! Which side will be left standing to rule all of Ravka? Which way will the world sway? Will they be left cowering to an evil ruler? Or be relishing in the glory of a new world? Find out in this EPIC last installment of The Grisha Trilogy!!  I am so happy with this series. I know some people aren't happy with the way it ended, but I personally loved it!! I wanted this ending to happen, but I prepared myself for the worst. If it's one thing that ALLEGINAT has taught me, it's to EXPECT ANYTHING!!! So I was ready for any outcome to happen!! But this is the one I was rooting for, well not exactly. But I am HIGHLY satisfied, with plenty of tears along the way!!  Overall, THE GRISHA TRILOGY will go down as one of my favorite series ever!! And I am so sad to see it all end! I will miss every single one of these characters that I have grown to love. They have all found their way into my heart, and have a special place within where they will stay! Leigh Bardugo, I am ready for whatever you bring us next! BRING... IT... ON!!!!!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JG775MO6I1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVRVEG0#wasThisHelpful","R12JG775MO6I1W","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars  MIDNIGHT THIEF was a fascinating, emotionally-punched, action-packed, thrilling, fantasy book that I devoured so quickly it had me tripping over words trying to get them read so fast!! It was SO much fun, with twist and turns that just kept coming!! It will definitely go down as one of my favorite fantasy's of 2014!!!  Livia Blackburne delivers WAYYYY more then I anticipated in this novel!!! When I read the synopsis about the Demon Riders, a clan of vicious warriors who ride bloodthirsty wildcats, I really didn't know what to expect with that. But WOW, what it turned out to be was definitely a pleasant surprise, that kept throwing twist at me!!  THE PACING:  BUT.... I have to admit that the beginning had me doubtful! I was tempted to put it down for a later date!! I know, I know, I'm ASHAMED of myself for even thinking that now!!! Because if I would of put it down when I was contemplating it, then I would of been kicking myself in the butt later! Because ANYONE who loves fantasy would definitely be missing out, BIG TIME!!!  The beginning started out really slow, and kinda boring! I'm guessing Livia Blackburne had to have a slow start so she could build the foundation and the surrounding walls of this novel. Because it's so complex, with layers that have to be peeled back for us to get the full picture of this book. But something told me to hold out, that it's gonna get better. And sure enough, about 25 to 30% in, I was HOOKED!!!  I literally couldn't put it down without sneaking in a chapter or 2 when I was suppose to be doing other things (Like cooking or cleaning, Oops!  THE WRITING:  The writing was okay. It wasn't the highlight of this novel. It didn't captivate me or anything like that. But it was still enough for me to get the feels of what the characters were going through. One thing that kinda bugged me, was that this book was supposed to be in 1100 or 1200's, but it didn't feel like we were in that time zone. Well besides the obvious things. Like washing outside in a basin, and the little things like that. But the language and wording didn't make me feel like I was in the 1100's. But that was easy to overlook when I got to the 25% mark!!  THE CHARACTERS:  I LOVED the main characters. Even the side ones were pretty awesome too!! The main character Kyra was an awesome protagonist. She always kept things interesting when she was around (Even if she wasn't trying too) And surprisingly, she wasn't this badass, sword wielding, not to be messed with type of chick that I'm use too! (Which is a BIG change for me) But she was still an awesome real character, that was just trying to stay alive in the Forge while scaling the walls and thieving to stay alive and pay the rent. But what I really liked was that we get to see so much growth from Kyra in this novel. We get to see her make BIG mistakes in the beginning, and watch it all unfold and play out. Then slowly watch Kyra go through the motions of working through them, and to right the MANY wrongs she made!!! And I admired that about her! By the end of MIDNIGHT THIEF, Kyra became a fierce, strong, not to be walked on, determined, fight for what she believed in, kick-butt, character that I'd grown to love!  THE PLOT:  Kyra has been on her own since she was young. Living on the rough, no nonsense streets of Forge ever since she can remember, just trying to stay alive and find her next meal! Until the day she meets her new found adopted brother Flick, and he offers Kyra something she never had, a family!!! But even with a new family, Kyra's troubles are far from over. She struggles to pay the rent and has found that scaling the walls and breaking into the wallhugers property, thieving from the rich, has become an easy means to survive. I mean it's not like their going to go without anyway! *Cough* Selfish bastards *cough cough* ;) But when James, a mysterious guy offers Kyra a chance to make more then enough money to get by and some, she feels compelled to give in to the comfortable life that she's never had. So she excepts his offer and later realizes just how much of  a mistake that was, and she'll have to pay for it, maybe even with her life!!  James is the leader of the Assassins Guild, and he has bigger plans for Kyra then she thought! He wants more then just the thieving and scouting that they agreed upon! But when Kyra realizes that, it's a little too late, and now she's stuck in James's lethal trap, and everything and everyone she loves will be at risk! Before it's all said and done Kyra will have to decide if she's willing to play by James's rules, or if she's willing to risk it all for an out! But if Kyra chooses wrong, it could not only change the course of her life, but the whole kingdom!  Tristam, a Palace knight wants revenge! He's on a mission to avenge his best friends murder by the Demon Riders, a clan of vicious warriors who ride bloodthirsty wildcats, and disappears into the forest. He will stop at nothing to bring his friends murderers to justice! But when fate intertwines Kyra and Tristam's world, they will have to put their differences aside and join forces, to accomplish a common goal. But as they start to dig deeper, and truths start to surface, they come to realize that everything is not as it seemed, and if they don't stop the plots and schemes against the Palace and lands, then they both might not make it out alive, let alone the innocents in the kingdom!!!  OVERALL:  MIDNIGHT THIEF is an action-packed (After you get to the 25% mark), fast-paced, adventure-filled, heart-pounding, fantastic fantasy, that is not to be missed! I got more then I bargained for with MIDNIGHT THIEF, and it is a series I will be reading years down the road!!  NOTE: I received an ARC for reviewing purposes! All opinions express are my own, and are not influenced in any way!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M22WBKI6V8GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423176383#wasThisHelpful","R3M22WBKI6V8GJ","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THRONE OF GLASS has been a book that I've been wanting to read for so long. But for whatever reason I always kept putting it off. So when I recently discovered how much I loved audiobooks, I decided it was finally time to jump into it and give it a shot. But, I was surprised to find a totally different book then what I imagined!! It was still a good book, BUT... it just didn't turn out to be what I thought it would be! It didn't have the action and adventure that I hoped for. Through almost the whole book we heard about how much of a bad-a** Celaena Sardothien was. How much she could cut through anything or anyone. But it's not until the very end that we really see her strip-down and show what she's really about. And even then, it was tainted, and not the full wrath of what she is ""supposedly"" capable of.There was a lot of magical elements that I was not expecting. Honestly, I wasn't excepting any, because that's what synopsis says,"" In a land without magic.""But, even though it was a surprise, I found myself engaged and intrigued as the story unfolded into a mysterious world where magic, lies, fear, evil, and a murderous king rules with an iron fist, and will cut though anyone to clear his path to complete control!Even with it's flaws, THRONE OF GLASS was still pretty amazing! I am so eager to see where this series goes, because it could take so many different routes and still make sense and be amazing. And I love that when an author can end a book and is able to have you guessing where the series will go. Some books you just know how it's all going to end without having to read it. But Sarah Maas has created a series that will forever keep me second guessing myself!! Mad props to Ms Mass for that!!!!THE PLOTIn a kingdom ruled by a vicious king, who slaughter all who appose him, a kingdom lay in despair and submission as the lesser citizens live cowering to their king. As the nobility live in a luxurious life full of wealth and riches, and power.Celaena Sardothien was raised to be a killer. She was brought up with blood on her hands. Killing has become as easy as breathing for Celaena. Because she kills with precise and precision, she kills to keep breathing, she kills because she is the best, she kills because she's Ardalan's best assassin, and everyone knows it, and fears it!!Celaena is paying for her crimes in the salt mines of Endovier, forever cursed to the hard labor of the mines and cruelty of the guards, until her dying day. Until one day, Celaena is given a choice, an opportunity to get out of the mines and become the kings lackey. But she'll be free of the certain death that the salt mines are sure to bring. Free of watching all the endless deaths of those around her. Free after 5 years of killing for the king. But it won't come easy, and she'll have to prove her worth against other killers just like herself!Celaena is offered the chance to become the kings champion. But with it come a price... The title is not given to her, she will have to prove worthy of the title in a battle with other killers, thieves, assassins, and the lowest of the low. But she's Celaena Sardothien, so just how much trouble could that be? Well she's about to find out!!!Celaena is not prepared for what she finds out of the salt mines and with a taste of free air. She is not ready for what secrets lie hidden within the castle, long since forgotten and abandoned. Buried beneath centuries of secrets, lies, and forbidden magic that was outlawed by the king himself. Secrets in which the king would kill anyone who possess, even his future champion.Celaena will come face to face with the truths of what the kingdom is really built on, terrible secrets that could not only get her killed, but bring whole kingdoms to their knees. She will have to battle her way through the unthinkable to get to the top, but once she's there, she will have to make the ultimate choice of where her loyalties lie, and who she can really trust! But she'll have to stay alive long enough to make it there!!!  Even though THRONE OF GLASS was not what I excepted it to be, it was still pretty epic on so many levels. I just finished reading the second book and loved that one sooo much more. I plan on jumping into the third book sometime very soon!! It's an amazing series with layers upon layers that have to be dug through and peeled back to comprehend the full wrath of what lies beneath this series. The best way to describe this series would be by saying ""There is more, WAY more then what meets the eye""I think this is a series that everyone should read, no matter what your genres or reading level is. It's one of those series that stays with you long after its over. Not just because of the characters and action. But because of what these people go through. Of so many people brought to their knees in front of one man. For the determination and struggles that these people had to go through. And for the loss that they continue to go through with each book. It's so complex, and a must read for so many reasons!!!!Overall, THRONE OF GLASS was a great start to an amazing series that I know is going to be EPIC by the time it's complete! I'm eager to see how it all turns out!! I would definitely recommend it and will be eagerly continuing this series!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250YI5BAW33XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619630346#wasThisHelpful","R250YI5BAW33XU","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SIEGE AND STORM was AMAZINGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!! So utterly amazing!! I forgot how much I loved this world in SHADOW AND BONE, but I was pleasantly pleased to have SIEGE AND STORM remind me of just how much this series means to me!! I'm just mad that I waited so long to read it. But.... on the other hand, I'm happy I did wait because I was able to dive right into RUIN AND RISING, the last book in the trilogy (Which I'm reading now and loving it just as much as SIEGE AND STORM, if not more. Shhh... no hints ;)SIEGE AND STORM has this darkness about it that no other book I've read ever had. And it was refreshing to have a book with such darkness, yet a light that's breaking through the barrier to bring balance into the story. It was amazing, to say the least!!THE PLOT...Alina Starkov is on the run from her last encounter with the vicious Darkliing. He's hunted Alina in the past, and she knows he's hunting her now. And he'll continue to hunt her until he captures her and possesses her Sun Gift Power she wields. He's evil and deadly and has nothing but darkness inside of him. He will unleash a tornado of dead bodies in his wake until he gets what he wants, and he wants Alina, all of her...Alina just barely made it out alive in her last battle with The Darkling, and she's not ready to take that chance again. Her and her best friend and love of her life Mal, escaped the fold, but not without paying a high price in blood. Lots of lives were sacrificed for them to escape. Now Alina and Mal are just trying to lay low and make enough money to disappear together and leave their terrible past behind them, forever. But The Darkling is not ready to let her go, he's on her trail, and he'll find her, he always does, but this time he might just take all that she loves.Alina and Mal will have to join forces with a powerful ally if their going to survive. They realize they can't run from The Darkling, they can't escape him, the only way to be rid of him and his evilness is to end him of his wretched life once and for all! As their plans make a 180 in a different direction, and more problems arise, they will have to be prepared not to run from The Darkling, but go to war with him, but this time, she may not make it out alive...SIEGE AND STORM was sooo much better then the first book SHADOW AND BONE! And the first book blew me away, but this book was EXPLOSIVE!!! We were introduced to new characters in this second book, and Sturmhond was one of them. And let me tell you, he was so dreamy and funny, and totally swoon worthy!! I just wish he was in the first book too, and we were able to get more of him!!!Overall SIEGE AND STORM was one of the best books I've read this year. And that's saying a lot because I've read some pretty awesome books this year!! But SIEGE AND STORM has come very close to the top!! If you like darkness, with a touch of light, good versus evil, and a deadly game of catch the mouse in the trap, then I'm sure you're going to love SIEGE AND STORM as much as I did!!!NOTE: I received an ARC for reviewing purposes.

"Why, WHY did I wait so long to read CINDER???Because I can't for the life of me figure it out!! Now, just knowing how amazing it was, and that I was denying myself the pleasure of this amazing book, just depress me! I was enchanted by this book. I listened to almost the whole thing on audio, and believe me when I say, not only did the actual story amazed me, and the characters, and the plot line, but the narrator was amazinggggg, absolutely stunning!! She was so enticing, preforming like a painter, painting vivid visions in my mind with her alluring voice, and descriptive detail! Every character that came into the story took a new breath of life. She was able to preform and execute each character with their own voice that fitted with that character. And it allowed me to feel more attached to the characters (If it was even possible to become anymore attached then I already was) I just loved her story telling and audio performance, and I look forward to listening to SCARLET and CRESS from her voice on audio.CINDER was just EPIC!!! Truly original and heart-throbbingly painful! It had parts where I was in awe in a hazy dream-scape of the sweet bliss and romance attempts. And parts where I wanted to bury my face in embarrassment, like the things happening to Cinder were happening to me. Like I was that connected to the book and the characters. Then there were parts where I wanted to scream!! Scream at some of the things that were happening. And I loved that I could see some of the original Cinderella story in CINDER. It was like a remix of Cinderella with plenty of original elements, but stuck to the roots of the original fairytale.THE PLOT...The world as we know it has changed. Scientific breakthroughs have gone through the roof with discoveries that have changed the world. Scientist have been able to do the unthinkable. They have been able to give seriously injured or near dead people a second chance at life. Only downfall? You're not all human, anymore...You'll become a, Cyborg!!!Cinder is one of the lucky to have been given a second chance at life. Or cursed, depending on how you look at it. But either way she was given a second chance at life after a terrible incident occurred. She is now half-human & half machine. She is Cyborg!!!AND THIS IS HER STORY!!!Cinder lives her life shunned by society, looked-down upon for being a Cyborg, because of what she is, not who she is. And if that isn't enough, she has a terrible stepmother and stepsister that treat her like a floor-mat, stepped upon when they please. Luckily one of Cinder's two stepsisters is not like that. She treats Cinder like an equal, like a real sister should. And then there's Cinder's only real friend, and she's not even human either. She's an android. All machine programed to do what they're owner wants, but is still able to have a personality chip installed, and have some of the same characteristic traits as a human would. That is Cinder's family circle. A devil of a stepmother, a hater of stepsister, a stepsister who loves her, but won't speak up for her, and a android of a friend, Oh, and a stepfather who died. That's it, welcome to Cinder's world!Cinder fills her days slaving as a mechanic in the New Beijing's market. Fixing androids and electrics to make money that she'll never see. Forced to immediately hand it over to her evil guardian. Well owner, because that's what she is. Her stepmother Adri owns Cinder, as does everyone else who has a Cyborg in they're home. Looked-down upon like they're an alien race. No good for nothing but serving their guardians. And that is what Cinder is, nothing!  Worthless of anything... Until one day, it all changes...Everything Cinder has ever known is about to be questioned. Out of nowhere the prince walks into her life and her heart. There's an evil queen from another plant called Luna, that's hell bent on ending their world. Killing them or turning them into mindless slaves to obtain power and control to become the ruler of their plant. And there's a plague that's sweeping through the kingdom, killing off the citizens and claiming lives no matter the cost. And on top of that, Cinder has to fight her undying affections she's feeling for the prince. Because if he ever knew what she was, he would be repulsed, disgusted by what she really is. More questions are arising then answers, but as Cinder starts to dig deeper, she starts to realize that she might just matter more then she thought, and she may be the last hope their world has, if only she can make it out, alive!Overall, CINDER was an alluringly captivating, truly enchanting, massively impressive, mastermind of a book, that I will devour over and over again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEYTHJ13SJ2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312641893#wasThisHelpful","R2FEYTHJ13SJ2S","A1WFMMP7L8WCGC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WFMMP7L8WCGC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CRUEL BEAUTY, were do I even begin?I have such mixed feeling about this one! While I liked it, I didn't love it like I thought I would. When I seen a retelling of Beauty and the Beast that sounded as beautiful and amazing as CRUEL BEAUTY did, I was jumping up and down!! I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Which I'm really surprised I waited as long as I did to read it!! Beauty And The Beast was/IS my favorite Disney fairytale of all time!! There's some fairytales that come close, but nothing as much as I love Beauty And The Beast! So I was hyped to get lost in the story. But sadly, something about CRUEL BEAUTY did not work for me. :/I listened to most of it on audio, while I read some of it from my physical copy. It was only my second audiobook ever, so it was a little different listening to it then reading the whole thing. And I wasn't a fan of the narrators voice and her story telling. So that could of very well have played a part into me not loving CRUEL BEAUTY. Now, that said, I did NOT hate CRUEL BEAUTY, not even close! I really enjoyed it, but not like I thought I would, and definitely not loved it like I hoped for.LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN.I'm not a huge fan of Mythology, and some of the parts were A LOT a little confusing for me. With enchanted room after room, all the back story that played into this novel, and the plot that kept changing course, it just got to be too much for me. I guess I got overwhelmed by the amount of info that was dropped on us at one time. I still can't really tell you why most of the things that happened in CRUEL BEAUTY happened. What was the cause and reasoning? I can't answer that either. Nope, that's how much I got lost in the story, and not the lost like wow, this is amazing! No, the lost like wandering, not knowing where it's going or what's going on!Another thing that disconnected me from the book was that I wasn't that attracted to the characters. And that is always something I need to be able to connect with the book. If the character(s) aren't someone that I care about, well then the story just goes down hill for me. If an author can make me care about their characters, then the plot will become secondary for me. But I did not find that connection here in CRUEL BEAUTY with any of the characters. So that was a big let down.But I loved the idea of the book. I loved that it was a Beauty And The Beast retelling. That it had magic, and fantasy that was enchanting and unpredictable. That the main character was strong and didn't give up no matter what obstacles were thrown in front of her. That their was an evil so wicked and terrifying, that it could bring whole kingdoms down. The elegant writing and beautiful story telling that was perfect for a Beauty And The Beast retelling. That it reminded us that beauty is skin deep.Now, for my review of CRUEL BEAUTY in a GIF!!NOTE, I could not add GIF's (Pictures)A kingdom in despair, doomed if not saved!2 sisters, one safe and secure for a happy life. The other, ultimately doomed from birth. Turned over for a sacrifice to save their people.A Prince of shadow demons, ruler of all evil in their world!A gentle lord disguised as a monster, only to be as gentle as his title.An enchanted castle, with room upon room of enchanted findings.A mythology background that feeds the story.Evil Shadow creatures lurking, just waiting for the chance to strike and bring pain, suffering and death to their world.One saying that must never be forgotten:""Don't look at the Shadow's too long or a Demon might look back.A  girls heart revealed. Her desire and density intertwined as one.One heart fighting for the enemy, determined to prove his worth.And ultimately, a damaged girl just wanting to be loved. Needing to matter to someone. A risk that will either save her people or doom them.2 lives, 1 destiny, a battle against all odds! A sacrifice that will save them or doom them all.TO BE CONTINUED...Yeah, I definitely like the sound of that. But for me it didn't play out like that. It dragged in a lot of places, and I felt bored trapped in room after room of confusing back story, and mythology that I just could not understand, or really didn't care to understand.So, will I read the next book in the CRUEL UNIVERSE Series? Who knows? Probably not, but depending on how the blurb for that one sounds, I might. But if I do decide to give it a shot, it will be in a book, NOT an audiobook!! I just could not get into the narrator Elizabeth Knowelden's story telling!Overall, CRUEL BEAUTY is a great read, but turned out not to be for me. I understand why so many people loved it! It has so many amazing interest, and beautiful writing that many could grasp onto and love.NOTE: I received an ARC for reviewing purposes!

"I have always loved caramel creams since I was a child.  I still do, and I occasionally indulge when I catch them on sale.Recently, I decided to try Goetze’s Caramel Creams in the 4 oz. yellow box.  The first thing I notice about these candies is the fact that they didn’t have that shinny caramel sparkle that I am accustomed to.Unfortunately, these are unremarkable candies.  I immediately noticed a flour after taste so I decided to read the ingredients on the label.Not only are these not authentic caramels, but the ingredients give it away right up front.

"This was my favorite brand of cocoa.  After purchasing a few canisters in CA, I was spoiled for any other brand.During business trips, I traveled to Ghirardelli in Orlando and San Francisco to buy huge quantities so I'm not left bare cupboard.Well, my supply ran out in 2014.  I ventured over to Disney Market Place to restock.I was so disappointed when I couldn't find my traditional 16 oz. canister of cocoa.  It isn't just in a different package, it's also a completely different product and here's why...Ghirardelli Premium Hot Cocoa - 16 oz.

Think millions annually here folks.  Ghirardelli's 2013 annual report states net income $303,000,000.00.Now with the 52% (profit) increase for this particular product--wow.  You do the math.Not sure if the product is still being made in the USA because they've changed their label to read 'distributed' by Ghirardelli whose parent company is Lindt & Sprungli Maitre Chocolatier Suisse Depus 1845--foreign direct investment.In January 6, 2009, they laid of 107 of their workers in the San Francisco USA plant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32T501WBMKXRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZX0IGI#wasThisHelpful","R32T501WBMKXRY","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, the container is BPA-Free although it is not posted on the packaging.""  I suggested they add BPA-Free right next to Kosher.

"Newman's Own Organic Raisins are nothing short of amazing.  But that is certainly no surprise for me.I've been hooked on Newman's Own baked goods and other products since they first became available in the Florida's organic markets.They are beyond plump and juicy.  The flavor and tender sweetness makes these the most delicious raisins I ever tasted.The texture is substantial.  You feel like your eating 'fresh' produce.  They are so flavorful.  I have to be careful not to grab more than a few handfuls.What also makes them fantastic is the quality of production.  I mean, I have yet to find hard stems, sticks, or other indescribable debris in their products.The raisins are not gummy, hard, and cement stuck together.  There's no crunchy tidbits when you scoop a handful in your mouth.Raisins should never be crunchy so I don't know what I swallowed in those other brands.  You also cannot miss the wonderful aroma when you open the paper canister--fresh, fruity, and addictive.Just another clean high quality Newman's Own product made in the USA by U.S. Certified Organic Farmers and Processors--the perfect raisins.I also cannot help but mention the integrity of this company.  The product is sold by weight and not by volume.  Hence, you actually get 15 oz. of product.  I also love the traditional packaging which can be recycled.With Newman's Own you always get your moneys worth in quality and weight; and there products are worth every dollar.Fat FreeGMO FreeGluten FreePeanut FreeTree Nut FreePesticide Free","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AKED4BKY3TUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA1KU8#wasThisHelpful","R3AKED4BKY3TUL","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My doctor recommended this product for pain and the inflammation in my body.  I was in an auto accident and I had a great deal of pain and inflammation build up.I had some amazing results with this product.  I noticed that my sinus, mucus, chest congestion, and breathing problems all but vanished.Well, I ran out of the product and it was on backorder with my doctor.  After a month my breathing problems returned and I am miserable.  I also noticed that inner hip pain returned.It is rather pricey, but it works to alleviate inflammation and minor aches and pains in the body.  The side effect is also clear breathing for me.It is to be noted that my doctor gave me the Inflavonoid regular, but is had none of the qualities of the Inflavonoid Intensive Care.

"I am delighted to find that Dole is beginning to transition away from BPA coated cans.I love this product because they contain no artificial sugars like their competitosr.I also love this product because it is always fresh and tasty.  I eat it as a low carb desert with vanilla yogurt.I also love it because it is one of the few deserts that does not raise my Dad's blood glucose level through the roof.When he returned from the hospital, I researched several foods that were good for diabetics to eat because they often crave sweets.  This was one of the suggested foods.I place four to six in a crystal desert dish and top with an organic plain or vanilla yogurt.  I also switch it up and put them in gello topped with a dollop of cottage cheese, whip cream, or yogurt.I put them in salads and wraps with a low carb ranch dressing and good quality proteins.  They go well with fish, pork, beef, chicken, or veggies.  They enhance the flavor of raw or cooked foods.He loves it!Thus far, his blood sugar never shoots up after eating this desert.  He has gone off his diabetic meds because of low carb eating, raw veggies, low carb fruits, and quality proteins.This has to be my all time favorite because it is so versatile and delicious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHF9O4WRPF7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RYBUD0#wasThisHelpful","RVHF9O4WRPF7Q","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Pyrex brand has out performed the other brand in everyway.Not sure what the implication of this would be, but the Pyrex brand glass is crystal clear whereas the other brand has green undertones.Durability excellentFound some that were labeled BPA freeLighter weight than other brandsCrystal clear glassTops do not deteriorate quicklyGreat for carrying breakfast or lunch on the run with spilling (oatmeal)Tops & bottoms dishwasher safe","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNPHNK2J60I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFTB0#wasThisHelpful","RXNPHNK2J60I","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:04 MinsUpdated 11/12/14I am humble enough to admit when I'm wrong.  I decided to dump the green blouse after I laid it flat to dry.  You're not going to believe this, but that orange discoloration vanished.  Yes, I kid you not and here's the photo to prove it.  Don't ask me what happened.  I took chemistry and I don't get it--see video  I have to update and change my rating and give credit where credit is due.  They only get a 4 because I took off a point for distress....bizarre!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been using Oxi Clean for over 8 years and it has worked beautifully on clothing with significant stains, i.e., blood, organic stains, food stains, dirt, red wine, and tomato stains, etc.I typically purchase the liquid, but when I saw the economical 11.7 lb. 252 Loads box of Oxi Clean I grabbed it up quickly.I have used Oxi Clean with the washing machine to wash huge loads, and I have used Oxi Clean to soak individual garments.I have used Oxi Clean on synthetic fabrics, natural fabrics, and blends.  I have used it to wash nylon and rayon clothing before this disaster--so it was well tested.I have used Oxi Clean on dark garments, light garments, bright garments, white garments, carpets, and comforters, etc.Today, I used Oxi Clean to soak my brand new $65.00 hand wash only lime green Coldwater Creek side-tie blouse (81% rayon & 19% nylon).  I only wore the pricy blouse once.After soaking the blouse for about 30 minutes, Oxi Clean turned the garment orange specked in several places.I got the blouse on sale for $65.00 and now it is completely ruined.  Coldwater Creek when out of business earlier this year so I won't be able to replace the lovely blouse.I checked the box to see whether there were any warnings regarding various fabrics and I found only the following statements:It states on the box that the product is chlorine free, loads of laundry brightened, safe for all colors, do not use on wool, wool blends, silks, leathers, or fabrics labeled dry clean only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHQ76915FK2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GI8UOO#wasThisHelpful","R2LHQ76915FK2J","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been consuming this product since I was a child.  Haven't read the label in years.Tasted something oddly different so I decided to read the label.  Read the labels of your old favorites...because times are a changing.The new and improved Del Monte 'corporate version' leaves a great deal to be desired, i.e., artificial sweeteners, excessive artificial preservatives, 150 mg of sodium in my fruit, and what's with the neon pink orange dye.I preferred the old recipe I consumer as a kid--juicy, safe, wholesome and natural.Firstly, there marketing agents have labeled the product 'no sugar added'.  The question begs to be asked, are they trying to save sugar money at the expense of consumer health?This product absolutely has added sugar.  What kind you say?  Sorbitol and Sucralose (aka splenda) are artificial sweeteners that carry a number of side effects.You can research on the American Cancer Society or Truth in Labeling website.  Sucralose was developed in Europe in the 70s and was referred to as E955.Sucralose is so toxic there is actually an organization name for the product...Sucralose Toxicity Information Center that place it in the same category as DDT and PCBs.Secondly, the larger cheaper 64 oz. version is in a plastic jar package that may or may not be BPA free.Thirdly, the product is no longer employing American growers.  The product is imported from Mexico.This is an issue because I worked for a mega Dutch food company for years and the way around USA environmental safety laws, consumer health protection laws, and worker safety laws was to move the product to a country that does not ban pesticides and chemicals that have been banned in America.I'm buying more fresh fruits these days.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7IJ8HRUHV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYIWK26#wasThisHelpful","R3E7IJ8HRUHV9","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lone RangerRating:  PG13Actors:  Johnny Depp, Armie HammerTime:  149 minutesI should have known that any movie by Jerry Bruckheimer would contain significant violence, ghastly carnage, and bizarre gore.However, I was shocked that the film was actually produced for children by Disney.The content is extremely violent.  There are several scenes where the major protagonist mutilates his living victim and eats his heart whilst his murderous, cross-dressing, and hardened companions look on in horror.The movie is riddled with several of his victims who want justice for loosing limbs to the cannibalistic antagonist.  The reluctant Lone Ranger plays second fiddle to the secondary character Tonto.  Hammer plays quite the cowardly ranger who refuses to succumb to violence.  This is strange since the entire movie is just that--caulk full of violence, gore, and dead animals.The film has a humanistic universal message that gets lost in the violence.  The film is not appropriately rated.  It is important for adults to preview films, even those produced by Disney, prior to allowing young children to view.This is Johnny Depp as himself.  He plays the film close to the edge much like his earlier gory pirate film.  He's the same strange over the top character, but just donning a different costume.  Further, Depp as a Native American doesn't play well here.  Really, Disney couldn't locate a single authentic Native American Actor for this lead.Here is a list of content specifics that Bruckheimer and Disney have produced for PG13:• Cross-Dressing• Violence• Dead Animals• Cannibalism• Gun Violence• Gore• Culturally Insensitive• Prostitution","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2A9W66PD08N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJYJWVW#wasThisHelpful","R1E2A9W66PD08N","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased a earlier model of a seatbelt harness for my two pet pals Darby & Hampshire.The older model had a fabric loop that you slide the auto seatbelt through.  This often resulted in a tangled mess, and it was difficult to transition from car to destination.When I purchased the newer model of the seatbelt harness for a visiting pet pal, I really liked the new update in the model.It had the auto seat safety belt that merely clicked into place in a snap making for quick and easy transitions.It didn't tangle, secured the pet in comfort, and allowed for easy transitions.  My pet pals could now lay comfortably in their car beds.  I didn't have to stop during long and short trips to untangle them.I was also delighted that I didn't have to order two new seatbelt safety harnesses ($30/ea.), but rather I could order just the new hardware--auto seat safety belt.The belt is made of durable material, metal hardware that won't snap, crack, or break.

"I have a 5 year old ShihTzu named Hampshire and a 6 year old Tibetan Spaniel named Darby.  Both are pink skinned dogs.The pet salon where I get my dogs groomed ran out of my normal flea shampoo Kenic Flea Rid ($9.99).  The manager said this was also an excellent quality shampoo.This shampoo is good, but my dogs scratched constantly after using it.  I finally got so panicked about their scratching that I stopped using it.  Several times I had to wash it off with a regular grooming shampoo.

"This is one of the most superior harnesses I have ever owned.  It is made of sturdy and high quality materials.I originally bought their earlier version which had the seatbelt loop wherein you pull the seatbelt through the harness loop attachment.Motivation:While pet sitting a two year old bichon, I purchased the new version.  I wanted to keep him safe and I purchased the new version which has the easy to fit D-ring secure leash attachment that clips into the seat belt lock and clasps onto the harness with the metal D-ring.  I purchased the S/M for the bichon who measures 18"" in length.  However, he is not the average size bichon toy size.Simply clip the leash attachment into the seat belt lock and clip it onto the metal ring on the harness.  Easy in and out of the car.You don't have to remove the leash attachment once it's locked in place.  Merely unclasp at the harness and re-clasp when returning.The new version also allows the pet to sit, stand, or lie comfortably, does not get tangled, and stays secure without obstruction or wrappingI loved this new design so much I upgraded and purchased two more new ones for my pups.Product Description:The harness is 100% nylon, wipes clean with a damp cloth, has a D-ring metal attachment, and safety strap swivel claps.  The product is distributed by AlphaKey Pet Products, Beverly, MA via Taiwan.Sizing:I ordered a total of two sm/med for my ShihTzu Hampshire and my Tibetan Spaniel Darby who both measure 16"" in length.For this product you will have to measure the girth as well.  I found the XS just too tiny for my 18-20 lb. pets.  I purchased the S/M black harness.  The harness also comes in blue and pink, but I didn't want to have to launder too often so I chose black.With patients and multiple adjustments, I finally got it just right.  It took three of us at the pet shop and some time to get it right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPZWB3QP5G2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B1QFT2#wasThisHelpful","R1MPZWB3QP5G2K","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She co-stars with her ex-husband Richard Burton who is a power house actor.

It is also the widescreen version which I don't typically enjoy.

"I ordered these reusable/washable waterproof bed pads for my Dad (75 yrs.) after he had two strokes within one month.He has only partial usage of his left leg and left arm.  He has incontinence and requires adult hygiene health care.  He is bed ridden and we have to use a lift to get him into his wheelchair and or recliner.We found the ones at the rehab and hospital to be too small.  The longer pads make it easier for the family and the CNA to change Dad and the soiled linens without removing Dad from his electric bed.The longer the pads, the easier it is to shift the patient from one side of the bed to the other and to roll the linens beneath the patient.  With other pads that are shorter we could not get a solid grip to lift, pull, roll, and tuck.We tidy Dad, shift him to one side, and then roll and tuck the pads.  We do the same for the other side and the bed is changed and fresh pads are in place.  We typically use two at a time, but please don't lump them together or stack them on top of each other.  Create a flat slightly overlapping placement because the other types of placements will cause skin deterioration and what the medical team calls 'break down'.To view this CNA technique, google it on uTube.  It's an awesome skill.  The pads are the key.  If they're too short or too small, you'll have to change the bed linens more often and leaking will be an issue.  We hurt ourselves and that's bad for Dad.We've learned a whole new respect for the CNA's and nurses aides.  Registered nurses and LPN's don't perform this service.  Many refuse to perform this service and look to the certified nursing aides (CNA) so they don't have to get their hands dirty.So to make Dad's life easier, help the CNAs and aides, and to make us more effective we rave about these comfy pads.FYI--You don't want to skimp on these in exchange for the noisy cheap plastic type that crunch when you touch them.  They're uncomfortable and they're are more like plastic bags.These pads are invaluable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9WI22ETVNPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QSDFL4#wasThisHelpful","R1S9WI22ETVNPC","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was an extremely well directed and well done film.  It wasn't your typical boring cinema-bio.  Meryl nails the accent in a subtle, gentle, classy, and dignified manner. Loved the historical references and historic events that shaped Great Britain.Initially, Thatcher's husband, Dennis, was obviously an extremely confident man who certainly didn't feel threatened by his wife's brilliance and spunk. He appeared to revel in it.Love these lines from the movie--Margaret Thatcher:  ""Ones life must matter.  Ones life must mean more than that.  People don't think anymore.  They only have feelings.  What we think we become.""For all her errors, this woman was awesome.  The longest serving Priminister (president) in history.  She made history.  Just shows how history can be tainted by the phallic political agenda.  Thatcher's legacy should be studied in American history classes and universities.Thatcher certainly held her own and stood firm in a career inflated by much testosterone driven ego--parliament.  She appeared to speak for the common woman and man, i.e., jobs, unions, IRA bombings, unemployment, economic health, industrialism, economics, assassination attempts.  Her country appeared to be at war with itself.What an awesome speech, ""It's time to put the great back in Great Britain.""I loved the scene when her assistant drapes her in a classic set of double strand 8-9 mm white pearls--what a lady.  I have always hated those Texas-size and country Barbara Bush pearls.  We may have won the war but it took us centuries to catch up with the Brits...a female president (priminister).Love this line--Margaret Thatcher:  ""It used to be about doing something.  Now it's about being something.""  This reminds me of a proverb written by Solomon, ""Everything is vanity...""This was a fascinating portrayal of Thatcher's life.Who said a woman cannot be a warrior.  Have you ever seen a pride intimidate the king of the jungle when protect their offspring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MK9Q69DTK9B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XTUVI#wasThisHelpful","R3MK9Q69DTK9B5","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barbara is the quintessential loving, concerned, and supportive mother who embarks on a road trip with the hope of helping her overly anxious, condescending, and narcissistic son overcome his self inflicted solitude.Joyce (Barbara's character) loves life and she is a people person whereas her reserved son is a withdrawn and conservative chemist who loves his mother.This is a charming film that every parent should watch with their teenage and or adult child.  Though Andrew and Joyce (Mom) seem to be completly opposite in their sensibilities, they are actually more alike than they think. They not only form a partnership, but they form an incredible new parent child bond.The dialogue is common place for parental interaction, but Barbara adds oomph to the script.  Her delivery is impeccable.Joyce (Barbara) meets a really hot cowboy guy Ben Graw.  Love this line--Andrew (son): Why do you want to feed me all the time?  Food is love.  Andy seems to open up and come alive as the movie progresses.The movie held my interest and my attention.  The characters became so real to me that I forgot I was watching a movie.  It didn't insult my intelligence, and nor was it typical or boring.  I laughed, worried, and felt empathy for the characters. Charming and lovely movie.I hope you enjoy this charming and light hearted comedy as much as I did.  I tried not to give away too much of the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDP4V82RW3ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMT9SQA#wasThisHelpful","R2UDP4V82RW3ZI","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(SEE PHOTO ATTACHED)--The following photo was uploaded to attest to the quality of Vaneli or Van Eli shoes made in China.I have been wearing Vaneli shoes since 1999, and I have over 275 pairs.  I have been wearing Vaneli's since they were made in Europe, namely Spain.I still enjoy these oldies but goodies.  They still look great!  However, the new crop of shoes that have been produced in China are outrageous.Rather than using durable or leather insets like Vaneli's of old, they use something similar to wallpaper.  It peels off and the black mesh underneath sticks to your feet with a sticky glue.I have had shoes that have been nicked at the hill only to discover that they were stuffed with chalk.Yes people, school board chalk covered with a simulated cover resembling wooden paneling from the 70s.I'm dating myself, but if you remember when wooden paneling was popular during the 'Brady Bunch' era you may recall that homes used wallpaper that resembled wood because paneling was so expensive.It is to be noted that the shoes in the photo have only been worn three time and I am not hard on my shoes.I typically walk from the car to the front door of any event, and I always carry walking shoes so I don't damage my heels.I paid some $175 (sale) for these shoes, and as you can see they are slightly worn on the bottom. The proof is in the pudding, but for this review the photo!This is the sixth pair of new shoes that have disintegrated in this manner.  I became so irritated that I stopped shopping at the Orlando store.I guess I wasn't the only one, because the store closed it's doors March 2013.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z05G49E48WJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUJ0T92#wasThisHelpful","R1Z05G49E48WJG","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the top of the line Samsung refrigerator 11 months ago.  The new refrigerator came with the initial filter.I noticed immediately that my drinking water and ice cube quality had improved substantially.There was such an improvement in the taste, smell, and odor of my water that when the filter needed replacing, I noticed the difference immediately.It was definitely the water filter.  I could not drink the water once the filter expired.  The red light came on and my dislike for tap water revived.I went to the hardware store to purchase a new filter and the price was through the roof.  I also went online to the Samsung website and the price was even more excessive.I decided to check Amazon, and I got a terrific deal on the 3 pack refrigerator water filter.  I saved money, eliminated the use of bottled water, and fell back in love with the quality of my water.Thus far, I have had 3 filter replacements in an 11 month time period.  I'm sure if you have a larger family, you may have to replace it more often.This is a superb product that is saving me money.  I don't have to purchase bottle water and deal with that terrible plastic taste and odor.I also feel safer because I don't have to deal with the possible toxic side effects of plastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER2TBSJHE561/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UB1O9Q#wasThisHelpful","RER2TBSJHE561","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Anti Monkey Butt Anti Friction Powder contains cornstarch, calamine powder, tricalcium phosphate, and patented microparticle polymer fragrance.I was introduced to Lady Anti Monkey Butt by a friend who purchased it at Walmart.  However, when I went back several times to repurchase they didn't have the product in stock--just the Baby Anti Monkey Butt.I fell in love with the product because of the wonderful fragrance and the smooth satiny feeling.  I also liked that it absorbs sweat and controls friction in private areas and discreet bra areas.I feel more confident and comfortable when I use Lady Anti Monkey Butt.  I cannot start my day without the product.  I live in Orlando, FL and the weather is so hot that just walking from your car to the building causes irritation.It keeps me dryer than many other types of powders I have used over the years.  However, remember it's a powder and whereever you dust you will get a dusting.I quickly hop in the shower to powder up so I don't dust the bathroom.  This has worked to reduce excess dusting of the bedroom and bathroom.The manufacturers claims are accurate and the product is wonderful.  I highly recommend Lady Anti Monkey Butt Anti Friction Powder.  They also make one for men too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYIMIQ51FBGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VEYWO6#wasThisHelpful","R1UYIMIQ51FBGU","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best tasting apple juice on the market, and I buy it for five (5) primary reasons:(1) Martinelli's tastes like the juice I produce from fresh produce when using my juicer, and there are no additives like corn syrup or other sweetners.(2,3) Martinelli's is safe to consume because it contains U.S. grown produce, and it is also processed in the U.S.--Other countries do no have the same environment protection laws that we have here in the U.S., and nor do they have FDA consumer protection laws when it comes to banned pesticides that are known cancer causers--Alar.(4) I only purchase foods and beverages that are housed in glass bottles or containers because I am aware of the dangers associated with plastics--I am well read on the toxic dangers that are caused by long-term exposure to petroleum based products such as plastsic, and the cancer connection between plastics and the manifestation of cancer in younger and younger persons who consume foods from plastic containers, e.g., water, fastfood, processed foods, soda, etc.(5) The glass containers are environmentally friendly, recyclable, and they are collectors items--The bottles are a work of glass art, and they can be repurposed for a multitude of uses--bottle art, rustic art, glass art, vases, center pieces, candle holders, storage (flour, sugar, grains, beans, etc.), home decor, water collection, planters, cookie cutters, emergency water storage, meat tenderizing, liquid storage (paint, fermentation, home made beer), art supply storage, science projects, freshly brewed ice teas, cold coffee beverages, etc.Martinelli's is a bit pricey ($5-$6/1.5L), but the health effects and the avoidance of toxcities is worth the price--cancer is expensive.I typically purchase the product at my local grocer, but with the Amazon price I get more for my money and a better deal.I just wish Martinelli made other juices!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZCAAJMTOYWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055VQRKG#wasThisHelpful","R2XZCAAJMTOYWU","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally chose this pattern for my wedding back in 1989.  I am so delighted with the delicate pattern and classic style.The sterling is high quality, and I really enjoy polishing it to a fine sparkle.  The pattern is not bulky but very refined and charming.I purchased 12-5PC place settings for $109 each between 1989-1999 from a wholesale fine china shop in Long Island, NY.  The value of these place settings is now around $900/5PC setting.They have increased substantially in value. This is Reed and Barton's finest pattern of sterling flatware.They would not be suitable for engraving because of the delicate floral pattern at the handle base.  Engraving would ruin this pattern.Unlike many sterling makers, my butter knife is completely sterling silver and not a sterling handle with stainless blade.This is something you will want to ask the merchant because it makes a difference in the value of the piece.Many manufacturers are skimping and adding stainless blades rather than the traditional sterling blade.  This decreases the value of the piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULU6IH3745C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000B2RLF#wasThisHelpful","R3ULU6IH3745C7","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first came across this lovely fragrant oil at a whole foods market.  It was a bit pricey ($10) for a 1.3 mL bottle, but I thought I'd give it a try.This is a mild but provocatively scented oil.  Whenever I wear it I get, ""What smells so good.""I hugged a male friend at the turn of the new year and he exclaimed, ""Wow you smell good"" and then he wooped it up.After some time, you may become too accustomed to the fragrance, but every one else can smell the aroma.One day I was in the car sweating with the windows down and the sunroof opened when I got a whiff of a lovely fragrance.  I couldn't figure it out--it was me.I also bought several natural perfumes that day, but none get more attention than this little bottle of musk.This little power house is worth the money--it's a head turner.  It also doesn't interfere with my asthma and it won't run people away in a crowd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3TF99GYW4KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068QD89U#wasThisHelpful","R2U3TF99GYW4KC","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I examined both the Level 1 and Level 2 programs for the Ready for Phonics:  A fun way to learn to read for children three to seven DVD series.Both DVDs are 67 minutes, copy written in 2004, and include CDs with worksheets.  The DVDs' use video animation, songs, music, fables, and familiar characters from children's literature to teach phonics and phonemic awareness.The Level 1 DVD covers the following skills--Phonics:Alphabet review (Pp, Cc, Kk, Nn, Ii, Hh, Jj, Bb, Ll, Aa, Gg, Dd, Ff, Mm, Oo, Rr, Qq, Zz, Vv, Yy, Uu, Ss, Ww, Tt, Ee, & Xx)Phonemic Awareness:Sight words, numbers song, words for Numbers, words for colorsThe Level 2 DVD covers the following skills--Phonics:Vowels, long vowels, short vowels, short vowel story, Y as a vowel, & side-by-side vowelsPhonemic Awareness:Word families, 110 most used words, World is Round Song, blends, diagraphs, silent e, plural & bossy rGrammar:Capitalization, periods & questions marksI reviewed this series with the intent of using it to enhance the reading curriculum for my elementary students.The animation is rather dated when compared with other series--School Zone.  The skills are not as thoroughly addressed as I would have preferred.Age appropriate seqencing and repetition are lacking and some skills that are introduced are not thoroughly covered.  For example, at the beginning of the video long vowels are introduced.Yet, the video skips directly to short vowels sounds without providing comprehensive examples, images, nor a review of long vowels sounds.  The video rushes through short vowels and leads directly into word families using short vowel sounds.This perhaps is an excellent series that can be used as bellwork or during transitional periods--dismissal.  I found it rather confusing and it is therefore ineffective for use during the 90 minute reading block.These DVDs may be more appropriate for home use or for entertainment purposes (parents).  However, it falls rather short on educational effectiveness (teachers).

"I purchased individual pieces of these pans for baking some time ago.  This pan was new and had not been used before.I recently starting using them and found them to be extremely inferior.Initially I thought that I had overcooked my meatloaf because it developed a thin scorched crust on the bottom.Needless to say, when I washed the pan I found that it was the nonstick coating that had adhered to my meatloaf.We were actually eating the nonstick coating that had dislodged from the bottom of the pan.  The rest of the coating came off in the dishwasher.I also found that the coating is definitely not nonstick.  It was difficult to clean even though I brushed it with a generous amount of olive oil.I rate this pan 0/4 for function, 5/5 for form, 5/5 for appearance prior to use, and 0/5 for durability.I am not certain about the health affects associated with consuming the nonstick coating, but I'm sure it's not suppose to be edible.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144S23DG68Y82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HI3VIG#wasThisHelpful","R144S23DG68Y82","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this product just to give it a try because I had tried so many other products to keep my bowl fresh between scrubbing.I wanted a product to keep my master bedroom smelling clean and fresh. I also wanted a product that would reduce the bowl ring and yellowing.I wanted a product that would not be too toxic or have an overwhelming fragrance. After trying several products, I happened upon this product, but I was ready to be dissatisfied.This product surprised me when I opened the box. There is a tube, clips, 2-tablets, and specialized equipment that requires installation. However, the installation instructions are a breeze.When I initially spotted the tablets, I remember the unfortunate damaged caused by those giant chlorine tablets. With this product you will have no such damage.The tubes easily connect to the overflow tube, and the tablets are housed in a plastic compartment so you don't damage your internal hardware. With each flush, you clean and freshen your bowl.The fragrance is so mild you don't smell it. This product really works to keep the bowl fresh, yellow-free, and there is no chemical smell.I give this product 5/5 for function, 5/5 for easy installation, 5/5 for fragrance, and 5/5 for design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DE5T6P8WN5LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B0TZKE#wasThisHelpful","R3DE5T6P8WN5LW","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Delta Elevated Toilet Seat at a local discount home decor store that sounds like Moss.  I purchased the item for $14.99 plus 7% tax.The product was cumbersome to install, and you will need tools (Phillips screw driver, 1/4"" straight blade screwdriver, & pliers) to install it properly.This item is best installed by someone who is familiar with the make up of bathroom fixtures.  This was a super buy.I wanted an elevated seat for the bathroom bowl because I started to have significant mobility issue with my knees and back.  I am also 5'11 and most seats are simply too low for my frame.The product raises the seat to a very comfortable level of 4"" and ADA height.  It has locking hardware that must be installed.It also has sturdy support handles that hold weight pressure of around 200 lbs. without sliding.  The front opening provides easy access, and there is ample space between the two handles.I actually feel as though I am not bending at all.  The product comes with a 10 year warantee. I was unable to decipher the installation directions for the locking hardware.However, I positioned the seat over the existing toilet seat and it fits rather well and it stays safely in place.I understand that this is not the mfg suggested recommendation for installation, but I am comfortable with this use.However, I do not recommend this for someone who has a sever handicap or serious balance issues--please follow the mfg recommendations.I give this product 5/5 for appearance, 5/5 for function, 5/5 for durability, and 4/5 for installation difficulty.The product is also light weight and easy to maneuver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1W6W08X1K3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANPEIQE#wasThisHelpful","R1L1W6W08X1K3U","ANUUF3N6B9NTA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANUUF3N6B9NTA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I took 3 capsules per night and my pain vanished.  I now take it 2-3 times each month and still no pain.Not only have I been able to reduce dependence on too many substances, but my pain is significantly reduced.I can bend without pain and walk up the stairs in my two-story home without knee, hip, and back pain.I continue to take my calcium, biotin, and turmeric.

"This Lucien men's watch is handsome, comfortable, and after a month's usage is holding up nicely to routine daily wear.  I wish I could say that I was putting this watch through the paces of the glamorous jet set, testing it in exotic locales where a timepiece is a personal status symbol, but for the needs of a regular guy, I'd say this watch does just fine.So far, the best aspect of this watch is its look - it is a very handsome watch with a striking royal blue face against chrome and with a black leather strap.  Interestingly, even though the watch has a leather band, it uses a metal hasp to unlock and expand the band for removal - I may not be describing it correctly, but the result is you can pop off the watch without undoing the little pin that holds the leather band in place.  The result is that even though you're using a leather band, the band won't get the worn-out look so many leather bands get through daily wear - this watch will look new for a long time.This watch is for regular everyday use and does not provide any features for, say, an extreme athlete or world traveler.  The watch has three sub-dials - one tracks the day of the week (""Mon,"" ""Tues,"" ""Wed,"" etc.), one tracks the day of the month (by number), and the third tracks the seconds.  No stop watch, no pedometer, no heart rate, no tracking multiple time zones simultaneously, etc.  Which is all fine, but before buying a watch you want to know what you're getting.  The watch is also water-resistant, so if you're one of those rare folks who has to have a watch on while swimming, look elsewhere.I'm sure that an aristocrat will size up this watch as a 'value' watch in no time.  It is reasonably priced, attractive, and seems designed to last a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3CAP5IYURYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXIM1S#wasThisHelpful","RB3CAP5IYURYL","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These four short exercise/resistance bands are an excellent low-cost addition to your home or travel fitness regimen.The kid includes four exercise bands, each about two inches wide and ten inches long.  These bands are designed to be stretched about 2.5 times their relaxed length, so they provide for a good range of motion.  These bands are color-coded according to varying degrees of resistance - yellow is 'easy' and blue is 'extra heavy.'  The kit also includes a handy travel bag that easily holds the four bands for convenient travel or storage.  Altogether, the kit weighs less than a pound and occupies virtually no space in your bag - any decent laptop computer bag has a pocket that will easily hold the bag completely full.These exercise bands are an excellent and affordable augmentation to your workout gear, particularly if you like to get in a bit of a workout while traveling.  These resistance bands can be used for a variety of stretching and toning exercises and are excellent for exercises that are hard to replicate with free weights.  A classic band workout is to lie on your side with a band around your ankles or knees.  All you need to do is lift your top leg for 10-20 reps and the resistance of the band will take care of the rest - three sets on both sides three or four times a week (as part of a regular fitness regime) will pay dividends.  While this kit does not come with an instructional/workout DVD, a few minutes on Youtube and you'll find several suggestions for band workouts.What is terrific about these bands is that they are incredibly convenient.  You can take them anywhere - they effectively eliminate excuses from doing basic workouts.  I watched a bit of football over the weekend, and was able to use the bands to stretch my hamstrings while watching the game.  All you do is sit on the edge of the couch, loop the band around the ball of your foot, and gently lift your leg and pull (it's your hamstring, so be careful).  I also fly regularly on business from the West Coast to the East Coast, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate using these bands to stretch out the kinks of a cross-country flight.Other band kits offer five or six bands, but given that I do not make these bands a core component of my workout the four available bands provide a suitable range of resistance.  I do not use the yellow (light resistance) band yet as it provides too little resistance, but it's possible that I just haven't found the right exercise yet.  The light resistance band also might be a terrific aid for anyone doing rehabilitation work following an injury.All things considered, these bands are an excellent low-cost addition to your home fitness regime.  Highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VVCT4H4SO6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3MZVXO#wasThisHelpful","R21VVCT4H4SO6W","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simon Toyne's ""The Searcher"" is my first Toyne novel, but it follows on his successful ""Sanctus"" trilogy of religious-themed thrillers.  Based on ""The Searcher,"" I have some reading to catch up on.""The Searcher"" is set in a remote Arizona town near the Mexican border - a tapped out mining town founded once upon a time by Jack Cassidy, a wandering priest who found divine revelation and material treasure in the wilderness.  Set in the modern day, the town of Redemption, Arizona, is hardly a dot on the map but it is the most important place in the world for its townsfolk.In the opening chapters, Redemption may be consumed by an inferno, which is interesting for two reasons.  First, the inferno was caused by a plane crash, and a few of the locals know that someone very very important was on that plane . . . and someone even more important will exact horrible revenge on everyone concerned (or just nearby) if that death is confirmed. Second, there seems to be one survivor of the plane crash.  His name is Solomon Creed.Or so he thinks.  Creed has amnesia.  Creed has no idea where he is or who he is.  But Creed is unusual in that he is almost perfectly white - white skin, white hair, light grey eyes - more a marble statue walking the earth than an albino.  Creed also knows things instantly - how do diagnose a burn victim, the chemical composition of pharmaceuticals, and whether someone is suicidal - without any understanding of how.  And Creed knows that he has been sent to Redemption to save a man.  A man who was buried earlier that day.In lesser hands, this story could be ridiculous bordering on comical.  In Toyne's careful telling, the story of Solomon Creed's arrival in Redemption is a true thriller.  The town of Redemption has a rich, complex history, and Toyne doles out the details with great skill, so the story evolves logically and relentlessly, and developments may occur at critical times but never serve as escapes for a writer who's written himself into a corner.  Solomon Creed is a fascinating hero, bestowed with amazing talents and gifts yet never falling into boring superman territory.  And the supporting characters of Redemption are given flaws and positive attributes.  While there are a couple of true villains, in general Toyne imbues these characters with depth and humanity.  To be sure, this is not ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" where a villain gets the Jaime Lannister treatment, but ""The Searcher"" is also only about half as long as one of Martin's tomes.I'll stop now to keep this spoiler-free, but ""The Searcher"" is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had as a reader this year.  I give this five stars not because this is a book that I want to re-read immediately or is an all-time classic, but it's been a long time since I've read the first volume in a planned series of books that had me so eagerly looking forward to the next installment.  I may have to go back to Lee Child's ""Killing Floor.""Highly recommended for fans of thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAOO3WGEA0CZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","RAOO3WGEA0CZZ","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long-time Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff spent years covering Newark, New Jersey, as part of her turf in the paper's New York bureau, and her command of the subject matter comes through in the riveting, maddening ""The Prize: Who's in Charge of America's Schools?""  Russakoff uses the attempt to reform Newark's broken public school system to explore how the district broke and why it is so difficult to fix the darn thing.The Newark public school system provides all the ingredients necessary for a standard Hollywood ""great teacher saves troubled students"" flick.  Years political cronyism, white flight to the suburbs, and broken promises have destroyed the Newark public schools - at the time of this book, total spending on a per-pupil basis was around $20,000, third-highest in the nation, and yet the illiteracy and failure rates were appalling - in some classes, less than five percent of students could read at grade level.  You had a bloated bureaucracy and a system that rewarded seniority over achievement, targets obviously in need of a straight-talking, no-nonsense, passionate hero to come in and save the day with a great monologue or two.And you had the potential heroes.  Newark Democratic Mayor Cory Booker was a national rock star of a politician - a young, Stanford-educated Rhodes Scholar - who was (seemingly) committed to turning around Newark's schools.  New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie, a political star in his own right, also wanted to take his no-nonsense approach to clean house in Newark, both for the good of the students . . . . crushing the local teacher's union was just a cherry on that sundae.  And best of all, Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg announced - on Oprah! - that he would personally dedicate $100 million to the reform effort in Newark and wanted to help convince his friends to pony up a matching $100 million.  The set up was perfect - a bipartisan team of political leaders were going to put politics aside for the good of the kids, and they had seemingly unlimited funds - what can't be done with $200 million?And then, reality hit.  Russakoff brilliantly follows the collapse of this wonderful opportunity under the weight of paranoia, politics, missteps, and competing agendas.  While there is no end to the problems that come in trying to reform a school district as horrific as Newark's, one of the biggest issues was that the school reform movement - led by idealistic scholars and financed by massive endowments and billionaires - tends to be tone-deaf to the concerns of the local community.  In many ways, that's reasonable - the local folks are the ones who the school reformers blame for ruining the schools in the first place.  But this is a democracy, and in Newark the reform movement thought that it could lay out its plan for change and that the locals would simply accept it - and who could possibly defend Newark's current schools?The locals, however, have a voice, and in Newark there is a long history of being taken advantage of or lied to - and there is not a really kind way of saying this - by white people who don't live there.  That describes the reformers in a nutshell.  And the reformers were taking on huge issues. Right or wrong, teaching was one of the best jobs in Newark, with union protections and healthy salaries, so when the reformers make the elimination of tenure a core issue, the locals fight back.  That's just one example of how the tone-deaf school reformers failed to build any grassroots support for their initiatives.  To be fair, much of the opposition they faced was cynical - people protecting their own cushy jobs at the expense of the students - but the reformers have a lot of responsibility here, too.Russakoff is truly a fly on the wall for this whole debacle.  She is there as Cory Booker turns from rock star to political liability.  She is there when superintendent Cami Anderson gets shouted down at a public meeting (and called the devil!).  She is there when a young teacher helps a young boy get up to grade level in reading, only to have it all come crashing down the next year.  And she is there when an idealistic young teacher - who has all the talent and desire to improve Newark's public schools - wrestles with the decision to teach at a charter school.""The Prize"" is a pretty short book, but it is an essential read for anyone who cares at all about education and the state of our cities.  That should be pretty much everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGKG4PVKXA18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547840055#wasThisHelpful","R3CGKG4PVKXA18","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Panasonic collapsible 'travel' earphones are a good value for travelers who want something more than earbuds but who are not hard-core music enthusiasts.We live in a day and age when you can spend far more on first-rate earphones than you need to on a first-rate music player.  Part of the confusion is that there's no obvious design feature that allows you to see at a glance that a certain set of earphones is inherently better than another - you've got to put the darn things on to discover how things sound, how much outside sound is squelched, etc.The Panasonic collapsible travel earphones cost less than $30, fold up into a convenient small bundle, and provide a decent sound and are reasonably comfortable.  I have a higher end set of earphones from AKG that beats these earphones on virtually every metric, but they cost a lot more.The sound issues become more apparent if you're closely listening to your music - if you're more of an audiobook or podcast listener, these earphones will serve just fine.If you're spending less than $30 on your earphones, you have to accept that you're not getting the highest-quality music experience.  So the next key variable is how comfortable are these earphones - can I wear them on a long travel day and still feel OK when I get to my destination?  On that score, these earphones are perfectly satisfactory. Each earpiece has a good-but-not-amazing pillow/pad, and the phones are sufficiently flexible that you don't feel like they are squishing your head after half an hour.All in all, a good value buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1U5N068FEGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMVLPIK#wasThisHelpful","R2M1U5N068FEGL","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charles Belfoure (""The Paris Architect"") is an architect by profession and training, and that comes through in his entertaining but paper-thin second novel, ""House of Thieves.""The good news is that Mr. Belfoure has a command of setting and the ability to create a terrific potboiler of a plot.  As an architect, it should be no surprise that Mr. Belfoure has an eye for detail.  In ""House of Thieves,"" the New York City of the late 19th century comes alive.  A successful architect, John Cross, lives the stereotypical life of a society gentleman.  He is respected and wealthy, but he must be stoic on the outside - a single whiff of scandal will see him and his entire family exiled forever from the good standing among the Knickerbocker families.  His wife, Helen, is brilliant and gorgeous, but John more or less ignores her because society expects him to (and forces both of them into stupidly rigid roles).  His eldest son, George, is a Harvard graduate and seems destined to be a great academic. His daughter, Julia, will be the belle of the New York society debutante scene, and his younger son Charlie is cute and adorable.But all the Crosses have their own sins (get the pun?) that threaten to bring ruin to all.  Worst of all is George's gambling addiction, which puts him in hock to the criminal underworld.  To pay off his son's debts, John must use his knowledge of building design to help the gangsters rob from the elite of New York society.  And, of course, once Cross proves that he's pretty good at it, the gangsters find ways to keep him part of the family . . . or else his will be erased forever.All this is great stuff, and there are other departures from the Straight and Narrow for the other members of the Cross clan.As long as Belfoure describes what people are doing or the world they are living in, ""House of Thieves"" is a fine, first-rate entertainment.  Belfoure offers a lot of Architecture 101, but he never does so at the expense of the plot or story, and he has a keen sense for the Upstairs/Downstairs life of Manhattan at the time.But, unfortunately, when Belfoure's characters talk to each other, the sand gets in the gears, often painfully so.  Writing dialogue is extremely difficult, and the dialogue of ""House of Thieves"" is workmanlike at best.  Belfoure unfortunately underlines his dialogue with adverbs, such as:  ""'I am so sorry . . . ,' he said apologetically.""  He already said that he's sorry - why throw in ""apologetically""?  Dialogue is too often used for the recitation of basic facts - the exposition gets old.Belfoure also doesn't quite have a handle on his characters.  The Crosses are a mercurial bunch.  One moment, John Cross is an out-of-shape flabby architect, the next he's putting pistol shots through a window from a moving elevated train car.  Cross learns that he enjoys the thrills of stealing, but at other times he's horrified by what he's done.  I'm fine with people vacillating, but the problem with Cross is that he seems to forget either that he enjoys stealing or was bothered by it . . . he just bounces from one emotion to another.  And this pervades all the Crosses - each of them in their own way finds their way to a double life, and it all goes far too easy for them except for the occasional passage of unease.Supporting characters are for the most part threadbare, and once their use is up Belfoure can dispose of them with unseemly speed . . . the body count of ""House of Thieves"" is pretty high, but Belfoure is content to rip off the bandage rather than build a more appropriate level of tension and terror.All in all, ""House of Thieves"" is a good book.  I hope Hollywood pays attention - with a first-rate screenwriter, this could be adapted into one hell of an entertaining movie.  (Heavily adapted, mind you.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ERPDKHCK5F1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149261789X#wasThisHelpful","R1ERPDKHCK5F1K","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott Shane, as a reporter for the New York Times assigned to cover the intelligence community, could probably use his job as the means to launch any number of trashy spy novels loosely based on real-world events.  Fortunately for us, while Shane may write such books in the future, at present he's written a very serious book about a very serious topic - the American use of drone technology to wage war in the Middle East (and by extension, everywhere).In ""Objective Troy,"" Shane explains that while the use of unmanned flying machines has been a military dream for decades, in recent years America has developed the drone into one of its most effective tools for waging war.  The drone is also among our most controversial military tools.  The drone is a near-perfect tool for the modern American military - we can fight without putting our soldiers' lives in jeopardy.  Proponents of drone technology also cite the drone's amazing surveillance capabilities, claiming that we can use drones to verify facts on the ground with an accuracy we could only dream about a few years ago.  Also, the drone is a much more 'timely' weapon because it can launch a rocket from very close range.  In the 'old days,' the rocket or missile was often launched from a ship, resulting in a delay of a few hours between the decision to launch and the strike.  This delay, drone supporters argue, led to an unacceptable number of missed targets and collateral damage.The drone is not without controversy, of course.  The sheer one-sided nature of drone warfare in the Middle East is cause for resentment.  Drones are not invisible or silent - many communities have learned to head for cover if they hear or see a drone.  Drones are also not surgical instruments, and collateral damage still results from many drone strikes.  There is also a misconception that the drone pilots are essentially playing videogames.  Shane observes that drone pilots spend scores of hours tracking individual targets before an attack is ever made, and the drone pilot sees the carnage that ensues.  This process is taking a toll on the drone pilots - it may not be bloody, but it's there.To drive his narrative, Shane chooses two fascinating characters.  The first is President Barack Obama, who successfully used his opposition to the Iraq War to win the White House.  This led many to assume that President Obama would be a peacenik, and that is definitely not the case.  Under the Obama Administration, the use of drone technology has escalated and the body count is high.The second character is not exactly a household name in America, but perhaps he should be.  Anwar al-Malaki, American born and raised in America by America-loving parents, was a successful and (apparently) moderate imam near Washington DC on 9/11.  Over the ensuing years, the imam who initially condemned the 9/11 attacks to his brother grew increasingly hostile to the United States, and eventually became the object of a successful manhunt by the Obama Administration, and a drone strike took his life.The immediacy of these two stories brings the real-world impact of the drone home.  While it is true that al-Malaki remains a bit of a cipher - we know a bit of his story, but not enough - Shane uses al-Malaki's story as well as President Obama's to explain how the drone is no longer a technology that we can ignore.Sure, the military may have tanks and nuclear missiles, but these colossally expensive weapons might as well be science fiction for most Americans.  But drones are cheap, plentiful, and incredibly effective.

Writers can have a lot of fun when the narrator of the story is completely untrustworthy, and yet over the course of the story builds the reader's trust, only to pull the rug out from under the reader at the climax of the story.  Unfortunately, the Unreliable Narrator story is perhaps the most susceptible to spoilers, so I will be brief with this review.Cleave's hero, Jerry Grey, is about as sympathetic a protagonist as you might find these days - he's married, with a grown-up daughter any man would be proud to call his own, and a successful crime writer under the pseudonym Henry Cutter.  But Jerry is in the early stages of one of those diseases that you would not wish on your worst enemy - Alzheimer's.  Writing in his Madness Journal - he has good days, but they are few and getting more rare - Jerry writes about his descent into dementia.  Filled with the frustration and fear of increasing gaps in his memory, Jerry's early pages in the Madness Journal are pathetic, bordering on the depressing - particularly since Jerry is living in a nursing home that is maddening in its Pleasantville cocoon of safety and calm.But there's a wrinkle. Jerry, at bad moments, believes that he's the killer from one of his crime novels.  That's one thing. Then, there's the fact that other people around Jerry, including the police, start thinking that he might be the same person as well.Cleave builds ""Trust No One"" slowly - this is not a Grisham-esque page-turner - but with increasing power and dread.  Focusing on Alzheimer's as it does, ""Trust No One"" is often a dark book, but it's also a bit of fun as the reader tries to stay one step ahead of Jerry, the Unreliable Narrator who claims that he can't remember what he had for breakfast, but on occasion believes that he actually murdered someone in a manner identical to the murder in one of his books.Recommended, but not the feel-good book of the year.  I reserve the right to up this review to four stars.  As of right now, I'm not sure I'm going to re-read ""Trust No One"" anytime soon, but that may change.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QR3ED351909N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779171#wasThisHelpful","R3QR3ED351909N","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll write this review from my perspective rather than that of my four-year old son, who is transfixed by CybeRex, ""the Robotic Battling Dinosaur,"" complete wtih Batman figure.  Apparently this is part of the ""Batman Unlimited"" storyline where the Joker has corrupted technology to his own twisted ends . . .That's the logic that leads to Batman riding a computerized/mechanical/t-rex hybrid. That's a tough one for me to get my head around, and when I look at this big blue monstrosity, it looks fairly ridiculous.Still, it's a pretty cool toy. Batman rides the CybeRex like Han Solo on a Taun-Taun, and CybeRex is reasonably articulated with moving legs, tail (with Bat-battle-axe tip) and even the little T-rex arms.  The CybeRex even has a cage attached to his gut for holding the bad guys Batman captures.But what makes this ride alternately bizarre and cool is that if you squeeze a big trigger under CybeRex's tail, Batman lifts up on a huge cannon that slides out of CybeRex's back and you can shoot ""battle discs.""  That's pretty darn cool.This toy is of pretty good size - CybeRex is around 18 inches long when fully assembled, and the Batman figure is about three or four inches high.  As you can expect, he's not a very canonical Batman - no cape, and his hands are larger than his head. He does look suitably grim, though.The battle discs are not launched with a great deal of force, so it's safe for kids to play with them without hurting each other - you do have the standard choking hazards for the wee ones, and there's a good chance that you'll have to spend some time hunting down the discs after your kid plays with the toy for a few minutes.  But that goes with the territory.Oddly enough, the bizarre nature of this toy - Batman and dinosaurs - can make this toy a great 'bridge' toy if your kid has other superhero toys as well as some toy dinosaurs - these are two genres that don't cross over very often, so here's your chance.Worth a shot, but you can't use it to indoctrinate your kid into the Batman canon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1RR2KXJBY82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TANQ#wasThisHelpful","R2R1RR2KXJBY82","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How does the Vatican walk the ""miracle"" highwire in our modern age?  The Catholic Church is founded on literally miraculous events, and every year there are scores of believers (and cynics) who claim to have witnessed a miracle - whether a faith healing, a statue of Mary that weeps tears of blood, or the face of Jesus appearing in their toast.  While it would be easy for some to dismiss each of these events as self-delusions or hoaxes, the Church has plenty of reasons to take them seriously - not least of them being that the Church officially believes in the power of miracles.Long-time Vatican reporter, journalist and author John Thavis (""The Vatican Diaries"") turns his insightful eye and brilliant pen to these issues with ""The Vatican Prophecies: Investigating Supernatural Signs, Apparitions and Miracles in the Modern Age.""  His exploration is fast-moving but in-depth - the writing is a master class of direct storytelling, grounded in truth and with a storyteller's eye for detail.  Balanced and thorough, Thavis takes the reader on explorations of some of the key 'miracles' of the modern age that simultaneously trouble and give hope to Christians everywhere.  But given the fact that the Vatican is the most wealthy, most powerful and most influential Christian organization in the world, its ""seal of approval"" for any miracle is by far the most important.  Thavis explores such thorny issues as the Shroud of Turin, miraculous healings, and the repeated visions of Mary in Medjugorje, Bosnia, examining the complex issues of faith, science, and the Church's desire to be taken seriously in an increasingly technological/scientific world.""The Vatican Prophecies"" is no rant or screed - Thavis writes with balance, explaining the facts as they are and allowing the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.  The visions of Medjugorge, for example, are examined both through the tales of the visionaries as well as the complex political history of the area - not to mention several other episodes across the world where people have claimed to have seen or spoken with Mary.  The Shroud of Turn gets a thorough investigation, from its murky history to its recent debunking to its current renaissance after the debunking was questioned.Through it all, the Church explores these issues with reserve consistent with a two-thousand year old organization.  It was refreshing to read of the Church's candid statement that it prefers many of these miracles to fade from view rather than become popular sensations.  While you may not be surprised at the ability of people to cash in on these phenomenae, I greatly enjoyed exploring how seriously the Church takes these events and how sensitive the Church is to both its role in our modern world while recognizing, at the same time, that sometimes it is hard to explain why someone is cured of cancer unless you accept the miraculous.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R970I7F3SWV9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426892#wasThisHelpful","R970I7F3SWV9D","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not normally a fan of biography - it usually takes me too long to get through the ""early years"" to the time that makes the subject noteworthy. All too often the tenuous links the author uses to connect the youthful prodigy to the accomplished adult are strained and not all that interesting. So you can get a plodding tour of events, but hardly a riveting story.My observations do not hold true for the life of Theodore Roosevelt, whose tale is as fascinating as any real-life American story could possibly be. How could the story of an asthmatic, sickly youth who, by sheer force of will and energy, become a Harvard-educated cowboy, bear hunter, adventurer, soldier, scourage of civic corruption, military hero, governor, vice president, and president - all before the age of 50?Teddy Roosevelt's life is fascinating enough, and Edmund Morris tells the tale exceedingly well. A mediocre author can render dull even the most riveting plot, but Morris elevates the story and keeps it exciting even as he walks through virtually every signficant moment in a lifetime overstuffed with them. Morris finds the valuable stuff in childhood, college, courtship, heartbreak, travel, combat, politics . . . suffice it to say that Morris can go into deep details when he needs to, but can also get you laughing with a one-sentence description of Teddy Roosevelt climbing a mountain so quickly he left his guide gasping for breath halfway up.The study of Roosevelt is essential to understanding America's emergence onto the national stage in the late 19th and early 20th century. Most Americans alive today only know the America of the post-WWII boom, and it is essential to our understanding of ourselves that we were not always theh straw that stirred the global drink. Thanks to Teddy, we were never quite the same country again, and understanding his role in the country's philosophical growth is vital to understanding the idea of being an ""American.""Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAFHCPAKONAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375756787#wasThisHelpful","R1LAFHCPAKONAL","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sleeping pad caught my eye with its distinctive Swiss cheese design and the inclusion of a 'pillow' - all of my previous sleeping pads for backpacking have been the traditional rectangular affairs.  While I haven't had the opportunity for extended usage of this pad yet, my initial experience strongly suggests that it will get used often.The pocketed design of this pad helps to make it very light weight, VERY fast to blow up, and exceptionally small when folded up - all as advertised. But my family usually does the kind of camping that doesn't require back packs be as lightweight as possible (kids still too young for long tramping). Still, the small size and weight makes this convenient when packing gear. Sleeping on the pocketed design feels a little like a massaging pad with pressure points and I thought it was really comfortable. I'm a back sleeper and didn't experience any problems with the holes in the pad as some side sleepers mentioned.Deflating and rolling it back up are both quick and easy.The only negative for me was the pillow. The design isn't bad and it's easy to adjust the firmness by letting a little air out since it has a separate inflation valve. My complaint is that even when fully inflated it is just even in height with the pad and I sleep best with a pillow that props my head up higher than my body. This is a personal preference so the pillow would probably be perfect for someone who likes a lower pillow height.All in all, a fine sleeping pad and well-suited for back-packing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INZCHFPQJQ7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3INZCHFPQJQ7T","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A five-star review is a delicate thing - should it be reserved for products that are truly ""Great,"" that hit the high water marks across the board for quality, enjoyment, stand-the-test-of-time Classics?  That's a fair interpretation.  For such an interpretation, I should reserve five-star reviews for personal favorites such as ""Casablanca,"" ""Shogun,"" and Tina Fey's impersonation of Sarah Palin.But what to do with a book where you had virtually no expectations or underlying assumptions, being your first exposure to the author, and you find a voice that is (at least to your uninformed eyes), completely original, surprising, and entertaining?  Sascha Arango's first novel, ""The Truth and Other Lies,"" made my cross-country flight from DC to Portland a delight, even though I fly coach and five-plus hours of being treated like a polite sardine wears thin.  Arango apparently has a highly commendable track record of writing for German TV, and his first novel reveals that he will do just fine as a novelist, thank you very much.""TTaOL"" focuses on one Henry Hayden, an anti-hero right up your alley is you've enjoyed the talents of Mr. Ripley or even the psychoses of Patrick Bateman.  You can't avoid certain spoilers here, as Henry is a chameleon, a villain wearing the skin of an extremely successful, overly decent human being. A successful author of multiple thrillers who shows no signs of stopping, he lives well on his coastal farm with his adoring (and seemingly-adored) wife and dog, and he is also one of those guys who in their late 30s looks like he walked off of a Ralph Lauren advertisement.  Immune to love handles or second chins, Henry eats well, drinks well, and discretely seduces well as he goes from book signing to publishing launch to awards banquets, lapping up the adoration of fans from across the world.And (here's the first spoiler) - he's never written a word.Arango fills his novel with an original cast of characters, each humanized to a certain degree, recognizable yet unfamiliar enough to be surprising.  Henry moves among them with ease at first, but then with greater desperation and fear as events spin out of control.  For a man who has built his life on lies, what could be more horrifying than to have those lies exposed?  For Henry, there are so many lies, and a few of them go back so many years . . .A true page-turner, ""TTaOL"" flies by - Arango's novel is as chiseled as Henry's jawline.  Multiple storylines and perspectives weave together almost seamlessly, and even a couple of supporting characters who would otherwise scream ""FROM CENTRAL CASTING"" bring their own idiosyncracies and foibles to the story.  After suffering through some ""thrillers"" this year hardly worth the title, ""TTaOL"" came as a refreshing burst of sunshine - there are authors out there who can surprise and entertain you, and Arango has proven that he's one of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCI1I7VVQ009/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679555X#wasThisHelpful","RKCI1I7VVQ009","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this slim book (paperback edition clocks in at a little over 200 pages, complete with appendices that include questions for the author, discussion questions, etc.), Nadia Bolz-Weber explores through anecdotes from her life how we encounter God in our interactions with other people, and these other people are invariably not ""saints"" in the classic sense.That's fitting, because Bolz-Weber (perhaps we should call her Pastrix, since has written a book with that title) is in no sense your stereotypical Lutheran pastor.  Yes, she gets a lot of mileage out of her look - she looks like a tattooed graduate student who took a year off to follow the Ramones on tour.  But Bolz-Weber also acknowledges that her path to the church followed several years of addiction and questionable decision-making.  That she does so with such candor, humor and insight makes her books worth reading.If you struggle with Christianity because you associate it with the unthinking, eye-glazed, utterly-without-doubt ""God is good,"" ""Just do what the Bible says,"" and ""Acting right makes you a Christian"" crowd,  Bolz-Weber is the perfect tonic for you.  In this book, she thinks critically about being a Christian in today's world - she confronts her own prejudices (defiantly liberal, she learns to her chagrin that a person she admires is a gun-toting 2nd Amendment fan, and also that she enjoys firing a gun) and struggles (can she find the grace to say a prayer for the lunatic who shot up the Sandy Hook elementary school?) with a great deal of insight.  Fortunately, she's a good enough writer that the navel-gazing doesn't last too long - she keeps things moving, like a good pastor should.Ultimately, Bolz-Weber's message is simple:  Jesus did not come to Earth to live among the upper classes, who have the resources to live good,  charitable lives without much real struggle.  Jesus lived among those who struggled, who suffered, and who had made some very bad decisions on their own.  That is us, and Bolz-Weber reminds us that the struggle for holiness is both human and holy.Highly recommended for anyone struggling with fitting in with the stereotypical Christian church.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OV6XEK0BZER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601427557#wasThisHelpful","R15OV6XEK0BZER","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These kitchen tools are made of typical silicone and are very flexible and non-stick. There is metal inside the handle of each tool, extending down into the business end of each utensil, giving just the right amount of support. The spoon and spatula have become my go-to tools because of that great support paired with the flexibility that is so great about silicone. I've run them through the dishwasher several times and they have come out perfectly.My favorite feature - the once piece design. Unlike silicone tools that have handles that separate from their handles, causing buildup of crud in the handle hole of the silicone, these are seamless, and therefore perfectly clean, and easy to hold too.My lease favorite feature - the pasta fork. Even though the metal interior extends partially into the fork end, it doesn't extend in to the tines of the fork, and this makes it much less useful than my traditional metal pasta fork. The silicone flops around, making it less functional. It's not completely useless, but I'm going to stick with my metal pasta fork.I'd say that the one-piece design makes this set a great pickup if you're looking for new silicone kitchen tools.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BB1UT8EE6E7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKQT09K#wasThisHelpful","R2BB1UT8EE6E7D","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three kids, so it's fair to say that we are more than a little familiar with Marvel's Avengers movie franchise.  Given the staggering hype surrounding these movies and their multibillion dollar box office, I am more or less numb to the latest toys, games, posters, clothes, etc., featuring Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and the gang - much to the agony of my four-year old son, who has a Pavlovian response to all things Avenger.But there is something irresistable about a foot-tall talking action figure.  Reminiscent of the great GI Joe action figures of my younger days, this Captain America action figure is a keeper.  Reasonably articulate (not every single joint is movable, but there's enough mobility to allow my son to pretend old Cap is alive) and with a detachable shield, this is the Captain America from the Age of Ultron movies.  Accordingly, his suit colors is a little more vibrant than the darker, more muted (and awesome) suit from the first Captain America movie.Captain America also talks, and the voice sounds great.  He has twelve different quotes, which is enough variety to keep the younger kids from getting bored.  Officially, this action figure will 'interact' with the Hulkbuster Titan Hero action figure who has catchphrases assigned specifically to Cap, but we don't have that action figure to verify.A perfect gift for the young Captain America fan in your household, this Captain America figure appears to be solidly built to withstand pretty serious four-year-old play.  The detachable shield can get lost, so you may want to make sure this toy doesn't make it out your front door.  I would also not be surprised to see this action figure decorating the cubicles of a few overgrown kids in the office - it's that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RM3ZDN09KHA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZIRY#wasThisHelpful","R3RM3ZDN09KHA6","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great iron that I would actually give 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I had that choice. As a reference my hair is pretty average, not coarse or fine, wavy, frizzy if I don't use product, long, and about 50% gray, but colored. I have owned several different kinds of flat irons over the years, and my Remington irons have always lasted until I decide to retire them to ""backup"" status because they are several years old. I've had more expensive brands fail around 12 months, so even though I've only used this iron for about a month I already love the reliability of the Remington brand. To start, I have to admit I was actually feeling cynical about the Vapor Infusion Technology because in my experience this is exactly the kind of new technology that doesn't work as advertised or stops working pretty quickly. I decided to load the reservoir with the included macadamia conditioning treatment and give the vapor a try, a little worried that it would make my hair look greasy. The result was fantastic! Not at all greasy, all my flyaways were gone, and I didn't have to use the anti-frizz post-styling treatment I usually use. I wash my hair every three days and I worried that by day 3 my hair would look greasy because of the oil in the vapor, but it didn't. The Vapor Infusion Technology has its own on/off button, so I did not use it on day 2 or 3 for my touch-up styling. If the Vapor Infusion Technology fails before the iron gets old I'll update this review, but for now I'm loving this option. I haven't tried using distilled water instead of the provided oil since the oil works so well and allows me to skip my other styling product.The reasons I would take away half a star if I could are for a few small reasons - first, it looks like the Macadamia oil for the Vapor chamber can only be ordered off the Remington site right now, which makes it inconvenient to replace and the instructions don't include any information about what types of conditioning treatments to shop for. Second, I prefer 2"" plates for my long hair and I have had to slow down a bit using this 1"" iron, so adding the vapor technology to a 2"" iron would be welcomed, and last, I'm used to seeing a temperature number on my other Remington irons but this iron just starts with 2 dots, adding one dot for each increase you push. The instructions tell you the temperature range for each number of dots, but I don't want to memorize that. I've learned that 3 dots is my ideal setting, so maybe this is a nit-picky criticism. Because I've seen a couple reviews mention heat-up time I will say that I don't get this complaint at all - I turn my iron on when I start my makeup, and a few minutes later when I move on to using the iron it is hot and ready to go, and stays hot. So, my criticisms are minor and as of right now I'm really happy with this iron!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UZKMY9WL8E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6C9U#wasThisHelpful","R25UZKMY9WL8E6","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeff Shaara has won his spurs over the years as one of the most thorough researchers and storytellers in the genre of historical fiction.  Invariably focusing on America's military history, Shaara has published novels on the American Revolution (""Rise to Rebellion,"" ""The Glorious Cause""), the two World Wars (""To the Last Man,"" ""The Steel Wave,"" etc.), the Mexican War (""Gone for Soldiers""), and the Civil War (""Gods and Generals,"" etc.).  In each novel, Shaara follows the same structure employed by his father Michael Shaara in the immortal ""The Killer Angels"" of shifting perspective from one character to another.While George R.R. Martin may also use the shifting-character perspective in ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" and both writers produce door-stop sized books (""The Fateful Lightning"" clocks in at north of 600 pages), the similarities end there.  Shaara's prose is workmanlike and he spends a lot of time inside the heads of men (usually white men) who are thinking of logistics, tactics, and strategy.  Sure, there are battles and action scenes, but Shaara generally writes with reserve and has grounded his characters in great heaping gobs of research.  One of Shaara's main characters in ""Lightning"" is General Sherman, and it's clear that when Shaara puts us inside Sherman's head, he's done so based on extensive research into the general's writings, letters, speeches, etc., to get a measure of the man.  As a result, we get a more realistic character than a Tyrion Lannister, and some would say less entertaining.While Shaara's books may on occasion teeter on the dull side, I find his relentless commitment to realism refreshing.  Other historical novelists, such as Conn Iggulden, write with more style and verve, but can also completely toss history out the window - I'm thinking about Iggulden's decision to make Caesar's murderer Brutus the mightiest swordsman the Roman world had ever known.  Shaara would never take such flights from the historical record - instead, one gets the sense that Shaara is holding up a tinted mirror to history - he's not writing history, but he's writing a close reflection of it.  You can rest assured that when Shaara describes a battle or an event, it actually happened or is closely representative of what actually happened (as Shaara has gleaned from his research) - not that the event was made up from whole cloth.""The Fateful Lightning"" focuses on Sherman's notorious march to the sea following the burning of Atlanta.  This is the march that broke the back of the Confederacy and left scars that lasted for generations.  As a result, ""Lightning"" is not an easy read - this is one of the ugliest chapters in America's military history, and Shaara does not sugarcoat it.But Sherman's march is a major American event, and its story needs to be told and understood.  High marks to Shaara for telling it, and telling it well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Q82VGO236ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549198#wasThisHelpful","R36Q82VGO236ST","A2PNTEDGMOLMOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cooler was exactly what I expected.First off, what I measured; Current draw at 13.5 Volts was about 4.7 Amperes. At 12.2 Volts the current draw was about 3.5 Amperes. The manual says 3.5 to 4.8 Amperes, The manual agrees with my measurements.Secondly, this is a thermoelectric cooler.  It uses about 40 - 60 Watts of energy so it will not cool down a load of warm soda in a few hours. The manual recommends running this for a few hours prior to adding your material. If you put warm sodas in this, expect to wait 20-25 (or more) hours for them to get cold. If you put in cold sodas, this will keep them very cold while running.Regarding the cord heating problems that others have stated. I connected this to a 'motorcycle' DC receptacle that I had purchased years ago. My receptacle got quite warm while this cooler was running. This was not a problem with the cooler's plug. It was my receptacle not being able to handle the current draw. If you have a good quality receptacle, this device will work good, without heat problems. My plug did not get hot or melt. If you have a worn receptacle it could get hot.The plug on this device has a built in (removable) 7.5 Ampere fuse. I would not recommend running this with on a vehicle with the motor off as it would probably run your battery down in after a few hours, there is no low voltage shut off built in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OGSAW58ZW2XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZYH4BM#wasThisHelpful","R1OGSAW58ZW2XG","A2MOJANFPX353G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MOJANFPX353G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 12 Gauge. I ordered two 100 foot rolls for some long-wire antenna projects I have planned. The same gauge costs quite a bit more at the local hardware store. The HW store wire probably has much better insulation quality. For a HAM radio dipole, I just do not care that much about the insulation.

"This works as advertised with my HF rig, switching between two antenna. I don't know about db loss, my S meter reads the same noise level on both antenna with or without this switch hooked up (not scientific, could easily have 1db loss and not notice it on the meter). The SWR also measures the same hooked up or not (that is the important part for me). For me this is a useful device. I have used it at 100 Watts for 20 minute (two-way) QSOs on 20 and 10 meters without noticing any problems or heat build up. It works on 40 meters also, I just have not used much there for any long QSO.For the record: If I could afford a KW amplifier, I could also afford a better switch, enough said there.For the price, on the 100W HF FT-450D I have, it is well worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CZ27761D9C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MZQ2F8#wasThisHelpful","R4CZ27761D9C5","A2MOJANFPX353G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MOJANFPX353G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine arrived with one switch position inoperative and the other intermittent. One of the internal contacts was bent and easily fixable. The other problem was a loose set screw on one of the connectors making a poor ground. It is now working fine with my 100 watt HF rig. I was not expecting a 'project' when I purchased this. I would guess the factory needs to tighten up some on the QA.I will keep it and use it, as it works for my purposes. I would not recommend trying to run 1000 Watts through it. If you got one with a bent contact you would stand a good chance of melting some parts with a KW. Also there is a sort of neutral center position where both antenna connections could be active, just something to be aware of. The SWR will be wonky with both antenna hooked up.Not too bad of a switch for the money I paid and my expectations.

"I had tried two other speakers in this price range before I found this one. If you spend any time listening to a non squelched radio this speaker does a good job of taking the edge off of the static. The audio filter is switchable via a button on the side of the speaker. The only bad thing is that the plastic cover that fits over the button slides off fairly easily. A drop of glue fixes that.Sound quality for the price is excellent, you will lose some higher frequency audio with the filter on, but voice is still easily understandable. Pulling out that weak SSB signal is indeed easier with the audio HF cutoff filter on. The plastic case is of decent quality and the bracket is metal.

"The antenna works. It is actually a modified J pole design. I did not discover that until I was putting it together. The reason it did not get more than 4 stars is that I was expecting a fairly wide band, antenna that I did not need to mess with. I guess 'wide band' is a somewhat relative term when it comes to antennas.The length of the main radiator and the matching network are easily adjustable.After many trips to the roof and a lot of experimenting, I was able to obtain a useful bandwidth (for me) with SWR from 1.4:1 at 50.1 Mhz to 1:7.1 at 53.1 Mhz. This antenna needs to have a choke coil of some type. Mine is just a coil of about 6 turns of the feed line coax around a 'coke can' sized loop before it enters my house. Google 'J pole choke' or decoupling for more details. Without a choke, just about anything you do inside with the feed line will effect the SWR, trust me on this.All in all, once adjusted, it is a good antenna for most 6 meter uses. I can cover the SSB part of the band up to the FM repeaters that I need to hit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7M76ZT4UO6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCX9QJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2N7M76ZT4UO6Z","A2MOJANFPX353G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MOJANFPX353G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am powering two different 12V, 100W, Amateur radio HF / VHF / UHF transceivers with this.My previous power supply model was a 'cheap knock' off that claimed 30 amps, but burned out while I was drawing 15.

Good clean power for a 12V radio.The output voltage is adjustable from about 12.1 to 15 volts.

"Good wide band / dual band antenna. On a 1 meter mast above my roof top, fed with 50 feet of RG-8x, I measured the following with 5 watts:70 CM @ 446.5 Mhz - 1.15:1 SWR2M @ 146.5 MHZ - 1.2:1MURS 1.8:1GMRS 1.08:1For UHF, the gain figure is more than enough to offset transmission line loss (I went cheap on the coax). Also, gain works both ways, so the RX is a better quality.Your results may vary due to antenna height and local obstructions. For my rather poor installation, I am very happy with the results. I live in an area of Southern Cal with mountain top repeaters averaging 18 miles away. I only need 5 watts to hit all of those. What attracted me to this antenna was the gain figure. I wanted to be able to talk simplex to mobile and HT units. This is a good antenna for that. The GMRS coverage is an added bonus for me.

"First off, this is one tall honking antenna. That being said, I put it up by myself in about 45 minutes. Two people would be better, it can be done with one. Right now it is mounted to the side of my wood frame single story house on a 15 foot pole. I am happy with the results. I will be modifying the mounting in the future.I am a fairly new amateur radio operator. I have been a short-wave listener for decades. I was also an avid CB guy back in the day.I purchased this mainly for use on 10 meters. On my 15 foot mounting pole, the SWR on about 28.3xx MHZ is absolutely flat with a 5 watt CW signal. At 100 watts the SWR meter will move a little to about 1.2:1. On 15 meters the SWR is about 1.3:1 with 25 watts.With my MJF-945E antenna tuner, this thing is usable on 6 meters. I got a 1.4:1 SWR with a 25 watt CW tuning signal on 6 meters. The SWR started going up with the power after about 25 watts, my mounting location is a bit poor and I am guessing that my feed line was radiating.The cool thing for me, is that this antenna does a heck of a job of pulling in 40 meter (and HF shortwave), if you just like to listen in. It is also a quiet antenna. I was a bit surprised at all of the 40 meter conversations I was hearing, and I did not need to use the radio's DNR. Below about 5 MHZ, the RX signal strength started dropping on my FT-450D.I am completely happy with this buy.Edit 12/25/2014:The more I use this antenna on 10 meters, the more I am amazed by how well it works. When the band is open, it is an incredible antenna. I had a QSO from my Southern Cal location into Tokyo Japan yesterday with only 10 watts of TX power on USB. A few minutes later I was talking into Georgia (US) on 5 watts. My radio will not go any lower on transmit or I would have tried. I would have to guess that the lower radiation angle lets the signal hit the ionosphere at an optimum angle for a bounce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R88HGBZ1UNQ1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017J3XMU#wasThisHelpful","R88HGBZ1UNQ1Z","A2MOJANFPX353G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MOJANFPX353G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How well this tunes pretty much depends on how well it is put up. The science is there, I think most people (like me) just do not do a very good job of installing it. The height above ground and any angle on the radials will make a difference. Mine is strung out about 8 feet above the roof top and has about a 100 degree angle on the two radials. On 40 meters it is a perfect 1:1 match. I can tune it on all of the other bands, including 6 meters, with my MFJ-945E. Without the tuner, the antenna has too high of a SWR for transmitting anywhere but 40, at least in my installation.I like it because it is mostly invisible to the casual observer. It is also relatively inexpensive. I am new to ham radio as a talker, long time listener. I have a 100 watt HF/6 meter and a 50 watt 2 meter rig. The base of the 2 meter antenna made a good mounting point for one of the legs on this antenna.I would recommend this to anyone, like me, who wants the ability to work HF but cannot afford to or does not want to turn their home into an antenna farm. A good antenna tuner is something you will probably need if you plan to transmit more than a few watts.** UPDATE**  30 Mar 15I have experimented with some clamp on ferrite 'bead' type devices (10 of them) and found I had a little bit of SWR tuning available by moving the the devices up and down my 25 foot  feed line. I ended up placing them right under the BALUN and got 1.8:1 on 40 meters and about 1.2:1 on 20 meters. The strange thing is that I got about 1.3:1 SWR on 10 meters and have had reports that this OCF long wire puts out about the same signal as my IMax-2000 vertical on 10 meters. The built in tuner on my Yaesu FT-450D can easily set a 1:1 SWR for the TX. I will upload a photo of my final configuration. These are fun antennas to experiment with.

"These do not come fully charged. When I first got them I put them in a EBL two channel charger and they both charged for about 3 hours prior to cutting off.I did run a discharge test with a 117 ohm resistive load. The discharge voltage curve was basically linear from a start of 8.4 volts down to about 7 volts, that took about 8.5 hours This, to me, would be the useful life. The end of the curve was from 7 volts down to the cut off voltage of 6 volts, that part took about 20 minutes.Keep in mind, this data was taken from the very first cycle of this battery. Li-ion cells will have a slightly greater capacity after a few cycles. My test results: Resistive load of 117 ohms, start voltage 8.5 v, end voltage 7 v, average discharge current 66 ma, battery capacity measured as 560 mAh.These are made up from two Li-ion 3.7 v cells. They will never charge up to an actual 9 volts, 8.4 v is about it. If the device you are powering is OK with this voltage range (most are), then the EBL 9V Li-ion is a good replacement for a 9 v alkaline battery.I am using my batteries in a TENS/EMS unit. The unit I have works very well with these. I figure that if I use a battery 3 or 4 times, it will already have given me the same service/price of a new alkaline battery. After that, I will have 100s of uses for free. I am not going to run all of those numbers out, but a great potential for saving money exists without sacrificing anything.enjoy* Added May 4, 2014 - I did run a few more discharge tests on this one battery. The third discharge was similar to the first, except that the end of charge, from 7.0V down to cutoff at 6.0 volts lasted about 22 minutes. If I figure that energy in, the battery measures about 610 mAh. That is a good deal of energy at a predictable voltage for a battery this size. I can definitely recommend this battery.:)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0AHWO0UIS6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ4NJ7E#wasThisHelpful","R1D0AHWO0UIS6J","A2MOJANFPX353G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MOJANFPX353G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own an older, more expensive TENS/EMS unit that works very well for me. This unit is good in that it has a greater variety of the shorter pulse settings.I fell asleep last night with two electrodes on my lower back and the setting on 'back'. This unit is that good. The program varies the unit's different settings automatically.I only use one channel at a time, my past experience is that using both channels on any unit, is that they are underpowered.My only complaint, is that the rotary 'level' controls are not the same. I found this out by accident, not a good way to find out. One side makes the intensity level go up when you rotate the knob upward. The other side of this box makes the intensity level go down when you rotate the control upward.

"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products.This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers.Pros:-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function.-Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup.Cons:-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen).-The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be.Overall: This is a good buy.

"I discovered Susanna Kearsley's books a few years ago through the utterly wonderful The Winter Sea. It was love from start to finish with that book, and I eagerly checked out a few more of her backlist. I never fell quite as hard with the others as I did with The Winter Sea though, and so when I heard about A Desperate Fortune it didn't automatically zip to the top of my TBR. But then my friend Beth read and loved it and did that thing where she smiles enigmatically and says, ""You'll have to tell me when you've read it."" Implying that I will. And that it will likely go well. I trust her implicitly. But I am a bit of an uncooperative reading soul these days, and so I knew I would come to it when I came to it. Attempting to force things lately tends to backfire spectacularly. Then the other night I crawled into bed and cast about. As one does. I figured I'd give it a shot. Just the first few pages. Just to see . . .Sara Thomas has learned how to manage her life. She prefers to work alone when at all possible. She plays Sudoku when she gets anxious. She occasionally meets someone she's interested in seeing more. It lasts a few weeks, and then she ends it before she has to explain why it won't work long-term. She has her beloved cousin Jacqui to point her in the right direction in social situations, or provide her with the necessary reprieve as needed. So when Jacqui comes to her with an intriguing proposition related to one of her famous historians, Sara is interested. Having always loved code-breaking, she takes on the challenge of deciphering the fragment, only to find out the next step is a trip to France and the overwhelming task of deciphering the entirety of a young woman's journal. A young woman from the 18th century. Mary Dundas was born a Scot but raised in France. Her unusual tale takes her from the French countryside to the heart of Paris to the shadow Jacobite court in Rome. And Sara is along for the ride as she moves temporarily into the home of the woman who currently owns the journal and learns to navigate life in a small French village and the kind advances of an unusual family that lives there.I'm such a sucker for a Jacobite Rebellion tale. This likely dates all the way back to Patricia Calvert's wonderful Hadder MacColl, which I read and loved as a kid. It was encouraged on by Jennifer Roberson's Lady of the Glen, which I read and loved as a teen. Ms. Kearsley excels at the time period as well, and her books have been such a delight to discover and love as an adult. As is often the case with a Kearsley book, I fell in love with the characters in the contemporary storyline first. I was fond of Sara instantly, as she matter-of-factly outlined her life with Asperger's, her reliance on her cousin Jacqui's social cues and advice, and her foray into amateur code-breaking as a form of independence in France. It took me a bit longer to warm up to Mary Dundas and her perilous journey. I am known to struggle with a road trip, but as soon as Mary made her way to Paris and took up the reins of her ruse, I fell into her story as well. The introduction of one mysterious Highlander by the name of MacPherson did not hurt in the slightest. As lasting imagery from this novel goes, it is those atmospheric scenes from Mary's life that linger in my mind. The unsettling glow of MacPherson's pipe lighting in a dark room. The tucking of a small dog into a rough cloak as tired feet press on. Two figures standing quietly just inches apart near the bridges of Rome.But my favorite scene of all (which I can't resist quoting a bit of for you here) comes from Sara's story. Sara's and Luc's.***""I can't sustain a real relationship. I always mess things up."" I'd meant to state that calmly as a fact, but my voice wobbled on the final words and Luc's own voice grew gentle in response.""How do you mess things up?""In every way conceivable, I could have told him. ""I just do.""""It might not happen this time.""""Yes, it will. It always does. I'm just not capable—""""Who told you that?"" His words, still quiet, cut across my own with an insistence that I simply couldn't bring myself to answer, so I briefly closed my eyes and closed my mind against the memories.Luc fell silent too, and when my eyes came open he was watching me. Not crowding me, but standing close enough that I was very much aware of him.He asked me, ""If you could . . . if you were capable of having a relationship, would you want one with me?""""Yes.""""You like me.""""Yes.""""Good. So your plan was that we should spend time with each other, and then you would leave me?""""Yes.""Luc gave a nod, and remarkably I saw the curve of his smile. ""What?"" I asked.""It's a terrible plan."" He came closer. ""No, really, you need to revise it. I'll help you.""***Two lovely, very subtle romances thread their way through the dual timelines. I found myself immeasurably charmed by both of them. The pacing on the whole is quite slow, languorously so. But my interest and attention never flagged. It merely meant my consumption of the novel was a more leisurely and relaxed affair—an experience I thoroughly treasure. Susanna Kearsley's books always feel like the warmth of a fire on a winter night to me. If you find yourself with a few hours to spend on a cozy evening in the near future, I can't think of a more enjoyable read to tuck in with than A Desperate Fortune. I'll be gifting it this holiday season for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUBO3D0PB0AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492602027#wasThisHelpful","R1XUBO3D0PB0AG","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, cards on the table? This is my favorite cover of the year. Actually, my favorite book design of the year full stop. The pages are all edged black, which is just exquisitely pleasing on a level I would never have expected, particularly set as they are against the blood red endpapers. I cannot stop touching them, even now that I'm done. The feathers and towers motif repeats itself throughout on each of the chapter title pages, and it is just a visceral pleasure every time. If you haven't picked up a copy in person, do yourself a favor and drop in at your favorite bookstore whether you plan on buying a copy or not, just for the treat of paging through this gorgeous book. That said, I feel it's important to point out that I was not a fan of Ms. Bardugo's Grisha trilogy. I crapped out partway through the first book, as the characters were just persistently doing nothing for me. But when I heard Leigh Bardugo would be appearing at my local indie bookstore as part of the Six of Crows tour, something in me just clicked and I knew this book would be the one for me.A thread of evil is wending its way through the admittedly quite evil already streets of Ketterdam. Someone is forcibly administering a deadly drug to Grisha and using the wildly enhanced powers it induces until they're nothing but dried up husks. When the thread finds its way to criminal mastermind Kaz Brekker's shady door, he decides it's time for a little fun/profit. Kaz rounds up the six choicest of his ragtag thieves and thugs from the Dregs in order to pull off the heist of the century. Accompanied by Inej the Wraith, Nina the Heartrender, Jesper the sharpshooter, Matthias the convict, and Wylan the demolition man/flautist, Kaz plans to break into the fabled Ice Court and steal a very wanted man in exchange for rather a hefty sum. To be split six ways. Most of the gang have a reason or six to need their cut of the take; all of them have a reason trust Kaz. And so they agree (or have their arms sufficiently twisted) to take part in the insane scheme, despite (or perhaps because of) the swirling dynamics of resentment, hope, and hatred that pervade every aspect the group. Whether they make it out alive almost seems beside the point.""Kaz Brekker didn't need a reason.""Ever since that introductory line, I have had a bit of a Kaz problem. It's like Leigh Bardugo was aware I'd been pining for a really good thief for awhile now and decided to take pity on me and deliver, oh, just one of the best to ever crawl out of a city slum and become de facto leader of an underworld empire. And make no mistake—Kaz is utterly ruthless. There is no soft underbelly to this close-lipped, leather-gloved, cane-wielding dark genius. The thing about Kaz, though, is that he is all in. And what he lacks in softness he more than makes up for in absolute magnetism and an ever-so-slowly unfolding history that I had no interest in looking away from. And that history only begins to unfold once the reader, too, has become a part of the inner circle. The other thing about Kaz is that he had the clever sense to find and retain Inej. And Inej is awesome. She works as the top spy for the Dregs and answers only (if and when she chooses to) to Kaz. Only she sees him without his gloves on. Only she is able to disappear into a thread of smoke, out of the clutches of the rival gangs who scrabble for power in the Barrel. An early encounter:***""Were you trained as a dancer?""""An acrobat."" She paused. ""My family . . . we're all acrobats.""""High wire?""""And swings. Juggling. Tumbling.""""Did you work with a net?""""Only when I was very little.""""Good. There aren't any nets in Ketterdam. Have you ever been in a fight?""She shook her head.""Killed someone?""Her eyes widened. ""No.""""Ever think about it?""She paused and then crossed her arms. ""Every night.""***I love them. And if I fell in love with these two the fastest, it was only because they clawed their way in first. But I found myself enamored of all six of these hoodlums in very little time at all. So much so that it's difficult to talk about them, where they are now, and what might become of them, particularly Nina and Matthias. It's worth mentioning that the overarching issues remain unresolved at the wild and breathtaking conclusion of this volume. The sequel (it is to be a duet, a duology, a lovely two-book entity, what have you) is due out next fall, so getting yourself into it will ensure a fair bit of agony. But what are we bibliophiles if not up for a little drawn-out angst? I cannot imagine my reading year without this gem. It was the absolute highlight—young adult fantasy at its most entertaining, full of killer charm and a killer instinct. Like Kaz, I'm afraid I am all in. Come what may (and no doubt will), this ride is worth its weight in cold, hard kruge. No mourners. No funerals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWM03DQ5GJNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792120#wasThisHelpful","RWWM03DQ5GJNN","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've never purchased bolt cutters before, it can be difficult to understand why they're so expensive. Bolt cutters have to achieve several tricks of leverage and strength in order to do their job. A complex hinge design multiplies the force applied to the handles many times by the time it reaches the cutting end. The blade itself has to be very strong, as it will likely be cutting hardened steel, e.g. padlocks, chains. All of these components are expensive to design and build well. Any experience with a cheap bolt cutter will quickly teach you the importance of buying a quality one. This bolt cutter by HK Porter is not very large, but sufficient for most any difficult household cutting task. It's important to be aware that bolt cutters of this size, when opened to their maximum width, are only able to accommodate items between 1/4 and 1/2 inch in width/diameter. If you need a bolt cutter to cut a large diameter chain or that sort of thing, you will need larger 24"" or 36"" cutters. In my cutting tests with this bolt cutter, it easily cut through everything I threw at it, from strong wire to steel. If it fit easily into the cutting end, it was able to cut through it. The cutting removed the black coating on the blade, but no damage seems to have been inflicted on the blade that would inhibit its further use. I'll keep using this cutter and update this review if I have any issues in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXVBZGRPVTNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UUCY3G#wasThisHelpful","R1EXVBZGRPVTNE","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start off with, this review is assuming the current $109 Amazon price point, not the absurd $700 regular price. Also, the watch I received was gold-plated, with an indigo face. The packaging is exquisite, and the only part of the package that would make one having spent $700 on this timepiece feel like they'd gotten their money's worth. The original band is enormous and had to be sized down. That will be the case with most watches of this type. If you have large wrists, rest assured it should still fit you. The instructions for setting up the watch were easy to follow, and so far the timepiece has remained very accurate. The watch face on mine is easy to read, and the large crown easy to pop out and set. The metal links on the band can make a faint rattly sound when touched or tapped. And although I'm not a watch connoisseur, it feels slightly cheap in that way. However, this piece is mainly cosmetic and people do notice it and comment on it favorably. If that is what you're after, this seems like a fairly reasonable price for a dress watch by Invicta.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N8SXTKKFECWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XWXC#wasThisHelpful","R1N8SXTKKFECWB","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start this review off with admitting that I do not run. However, I take long daily walks which often stretch over ten miles, and hydration can become an issue. The 10-Plus waistpack seemed like a nice lightweight solution to carrying a small amount of water without resorting to something heavy like a Camelbak. The water bottle fits into a plastic holster with a flexible elastic band on the bottom and a small elastic bungee, which will loop around the nozzle to hold it tightly in place. This system works well. With a little practice, it's easy to get it out and back in without looking. The nozzle is easily popped out with your teeth, and squeezing the bottle provides a well-measured splash of water or liquid into your mouth. It's clearly designed with the runner in mind. I can imagine if I was breathing hard and using this bottle, it would work very well. The gel flask is easy to fill, easy to remove and replace, and about the perfect size for my use. The belt is easily adjustable, and it's all extremely lightweight. And even with both the gel flask and water bottle filled, I really couldn't feel much difference with the belt on. The one design frustration has been that my cellphone (iPhone 6 plus) is a bit too large for the pouch designed for cellphones. Admittedly, it's a large phone. But as that's become rather normal, I wish the pocket was an inch and a half longer and would fit all mainstream phones. There's no question this is something of a niche product. At $50, it's probably only worth the money if it's something you'll use regularly. If you're an avid runner or hiker, however, I think it's well-designed and makes good sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386W6R1WVRZLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7HCM2Y#wasThisHelpful","R386W6R1WVRZLY","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stanley Classic stainless steel growler has really been surprisingly effective at keeping water, juice, and soda cold and carbonated for a long, long time. The double wall vacuum-insulated design keeps both hot and cold drinks at the desired temperature all day. When I tested it with ice water, the ice was still frozen 30 hours later. The single latch sealed lid will keep soda or beer carbonated and the liquid inside never touches any material but stainless steel. Plastic is only used minimally on the exterior of the lid and the handle. The growler is very big and heavy. It holds 64 oz. of liquid and full weighs more than seven lbs. The spout design is excellent, allowing a very easy and clean pour. It's also very stable when sitting on its base. We have found it to be a superb way to keep drinks cold on long drives. The large handle and easy pour allow for easy filling of cups even while driving. The Stanley Classic growler feels so far like the kind of thing that ends up lasting a very long time. And while reasonably expensive, it feels worth it so far. We will keep using this product a long time, and if any problems develop with it down the road, I will update this review and let you know. Until then, five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LF5PL2QBHBZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISPNC#wasThisHelpful","R2LF5PL2QBHBZO","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am the most amateur of campers, and I've been getting by with my old mummy bag from junior high for years (way beyond its expiration date). So I was excited to move on to the Jenny 20 Degree sleeping bag. I've never bought anything from Slumberjack before, but I was impressed with the lightweight, yet comfortable bag and the smooth zipper. I have had none of the trouble other reviewers have mentioned about a defective zipper. The zipper works smoothly and has a flap that comes over it to keep cold air out. The bag is roomy, leaving plenty of wiggle room for my 5 foot 5 inch self. But I imagine it would be far too bulky and heavy for backpacking, if that's your bent. The fabric is quite slippery and the bag expands quite a bit when first removed from its carry bag. I haven't been able to roll it up tightly enough to fit it back in, which is disappointing. Otherwise, I have no complaints.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BPKBS3DYBKXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I40Y#wasThisHelpful","R3BPKBS3DYBKXV","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This laminator has been perfect for day to day, household laminating needs. It warms up quickly and is ready to roll in about one minute. There are two temperature adjustment settings for when you are laminating thin or thicker material (cardstock). The lamination seems to be very good, with a tight seal and no bubbling or scorching. Unlike other laminators I've used in the past, this one does not require a protective sleeve. You can simply put what you're laminating into a laminate and run it through. It works great every time and there's no protective sleeve to lose. The right side of the unit features a very convenient handle. This is nice, as anything this shape is likely to be stored in a closet or on a shelf by sliding it straight in. So this is easy to remove from the storage area and carry without fear of dropping it. I laminate mostly full-size pages, chore charts for kids, and things like that. And it's just been great. At this price, this product feels like a real bargain. It's well-made. Everything feels of higher quality than you would expect for the price. I will update this review with any further developments as I continue to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDF7MQYH0NTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3CGD3E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDF7MQYH0NTY","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WowWee REVs are a great toy. The kind of toy I imagined someday having when I was ten (30 years ago). These cars are compact and well-made. They're heavy, don't feel fragile, and have survived many, many bumps into walls and chair legs. Pairing them was easy by simply following the onscreen directions in the app or the included printed instructions. It's worth noting that they failed to pair with a couple of older smartphones. But this is to be expected. All modern phones (say, three years old or newer) worked perfectly. My only complaint with driving the REVs is the time it takes to get used to controlling such fast cars with finite thumb movements on the small screen. I really do wish that there was a way to use an analog controller. That said, with time you get better and better at it. It's very fun to play these cars in two-player mode. My 11-year-old son and I had a ball, and these are sure to produce lots of laughter and cheering. When playing in single-player mode, you can place the second car into an AI mode, from which it can track and hunt your car. In the AI mode, you can select different ""drivers"" for that car, which essentially increases the difficulty level. In the easiest mode, you can get some hits on the other car and avoid being hit too many times, and with a little practice win fairly regularly. But if you turn the AI all the way up by selecting the most advanced ""driver,"":you will be decimated time after time, and it's a testament to the quality of the system WowWee has built. Battery life so far has been quite good, allowing several hours of play from 4 AA batteries. The app is responsive and pairs quickly, and the cars have survived all of the damage we've inflicted on them. We've really enjoyed the REVs, and I think that they're a great family toy. I will update this review with any further thoughts or developments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUNCETRSU05J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVGIBX0#wasThisHelpful","R1SUNCETRSU05J","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"iHealth's flagship blood pressure monitor is an easy-to-use and consistently accurate device. It requires a smartphone with the iHealth app installed, and it requires that the user have a basic understanding of Bluetooth pairing and a certain comfort level using apps. But within these parameters, it's very easy to use on a daily basis. The app is simple and well-designed. It's easy to see the fluctuation in your blood pressure over time, and it even compares your blood pressure at different times of the day so that you can see when your blood pressure tends to be high and/or low. It's important to note that you can't just throw this monitor on anyone's arm and take their blood pressure without adding a false data point into your log. That data point can be deleted, however this is best suited for personal use and not as a household monitor for everyone to share. It is possible for multiple users with multiple smartphones to use one cuff, but it requires some minor Bluetooth juggling. Traditionally, these types of cuffs can struggle to accurately read the blood pressure of someone with chronically low blood pressure. But mine is consistently low (90/58), and I've struggled with many blood pressure cuffs (even in doctor's offices), but this one has no trouble accurately reading my blood pressure. The device is USB rechargeable and seems to hold a charge well and recharge quickly. It's a little expensive at $80, but if monitoring your blood pressure is important to you, it's probably money well spent. I will update this review if any future issues arise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Q22NF8H5K8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANJAKF8#wasThisHelpful","R15Q22NF8H5K8T","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most pleasurable reviews I've written this year was the one I wrote in January for Every Breath—the first book in Ellie Marney's spectacularly good teen Sherlock Holmes series. I enjoyed the book so much and was so blasted eager to spread the word. Now I'm even more over the moon to tell you I've read Every Word, and it is every bit as good as the first. In fact, it's better. Everything that was good in Every Breath is essentially ratcheted up in this sophomore entry, and there isn't one misstep along the way. I was on the edge of my seat for every page. I was that worried about my beloved Watts and Mycroft. And with excellent reason. Ms. Marney spends zero time beating about the bush and jumps right into pulse-pounding action and gut-wrenching emotion. Which basically means I was in heaven from start to finish.It's not that Rachel Watts would have preferred to have been able to say goodbye to her sometime partner/accomplice James Mycroft before he left for parts unknown. It's that she absolutely cannot believe he left without her, let alone without telling her. Knowing he's still on the trail of unraveling his parents' tragic deaths, she doesn't trust him at all on his own in London investigating an eerily similar car crash to the one that orphaned him. And so it's not a question of if, but when she will hare off after him. She's prepared for the supreme lack of welcome she'll receive when he finds out she's followed him. But she can't let him face that many demons alone and is determined to back him up in whatever capacity he needs. What she doesn't expect is how thorny a ""simple"" forensics investigation becomes once it expands to include additional murders and the disappearance of a copy of Shakespeare's First Folio. Together, the two dogged investigators must navigate the increasingly treacherous waters of a multifaceted mystery as well as their own knotty relationship.***But in that second, in his face, I see the whole world. I finally understand something crucial.James Mycroft did die in that car crash seven years ago. Seeing what he saw, experiencing all that pain, that ten-year-old boy passed away. The person who returned was not the same. He was changed so completely, so physically and mentally transformed, it was as though a whole different individual was born. A different boy, living in a different place, with a guardian and no parents, a boy with no past and only one name . . .All the blood rushes out of my cheeks as that name falls off my lips. ""Mycroft . . . ""***I'm such a worrier. I always worry when I know an installment in a series is going to switch up locations on me, even when that means spending the majority of the story in London. I should learn to just roll with the punches, but I never seem to. So I was apprehensive that Watts-and-Mycroft might not translate as well in a new locale, and I was even more concerned about the obstacles they would encounter and how Mycroft would handle Watts flagrantly disobeying his wishes and inserting herself (even farther) into his most private pain. Of course, none of it turned out to be a problem whatsoever. I mean, it's far from smooth sailing. There's pain and anger galore, and everyone gets hurts and alternately holds it in and has it out with the objects of their pain and anger. But it's all so gloriously done that it only endeared these characters and their story to me further. Watts is spectacularly direct when it comes to Mycroft and his massive issues. When he throws out another wild pitch, she doesn't even flinch but watches it sail by and then raises a metaphorical eyebrow at his display. It was hugely gratifying, watching them negotiate one another, to say nothing of the brilliance that is their combined deductive exploits. Truly, together they are a force to be reckoned with.Which is not to say that they don't struggle mightily (and on every front) in this book. Because if ever a book was fraught, it's this one. I was prepared for a lot of things, but I wasn't prepared for how dire it got in the end, for just how far through the fire Marney was going to drag her two protagonists. It was incredibly effective in ensuring that I was with them. The peril felt almost unbearably real. But the wonderful bit is that through all the anxiety and grim darkness are woven the most beautiful threads of love and hope. Along with a downright explosive amount of chemistry. These two, you guys. Seriously. I want to quote each of my favorite exchanges here, but they are all far too spoilery. So I will content myself with assuring you of the excellence of the storytelling and imploring you to read it, too, so that Watts and Mycroft will have more of us on their side when they confront the fallout of what they've done in the next volume. I, for one, am terrified. Deliciously so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q71HOHF2EOUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770497757#wasThisHelpful","R1Q71HOHF2EOUS","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to account for the number of lightning cables that my family has chewed through. With three iPhone users in the house, and an assortment of wall chargers, car chargers, and cables plugged into computers, it feels like we buy a new lightning cable every week. All of this experience has taught us that not all lightning cables are the same. The Apple brand cables work very well ergonomically. They're flexible, thin, and the connectors make a positive connection. However, they have proven to be very fragile, particularly considering the astronomical price. This AmazonBasics cable falls into a more reasonable price range. It works well and charges quickly despite its longer length, which means the cabling is designed to carry the current required over its length (we've learned that some 6 and 10-ft cables lose so much power over the cable run that they will barely keep a phone charged when connected). The connectors seem well made, and so far after a couple weeks of regular to heavy use there have been no shorts or defects found where the insulated cable enters the connectors--a common fault in less expensive cables. The cable, however, is a bit stiff, harder to wrap up and easily stash, and doesn't hang limply but likes to form angles and a larger loop, making is somewhat more unwieldy than a more supple cable would be. Also, it does not work better or seem any sturdier than a good budget brand cable like Anker. I will keep using this cable and update this review with any problems that arise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN67S2KKV3PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S9N6OO#wasThisHelpful","R2WN67S2KKV3PP","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a lot of headphones and use them frequently both professionally and personally. I was interested in trying the AmazonBasics Premium headphones because they cover a useful section of the market to be familiar with. The AmazonBasics are an over-the-ear design intended to block some sound and prevent others from being able to hear the music that you're listening to leaking from the earpieces. The detachable cord features a very basic remote and microphone, so you can take calls or play, pause, and skip songs. However, it oddly lacks a volume control. The build quality is quite good for the price. Plastic is used throughout, but the headband features a soft, squishy pad, as do the ear surrounds. Comfort is quite good, although on my head the cups do not seal around my ears very well. Sound quality is where I was most disappointed. The overall tonal characteristic of these headphones is heavy and somewhat veiled. The bass response is prominent, but not particularly clean. And the highs lack the crispness I would expect at this price point. Complaints aside, the music is all there. And if you're not particularly fussy about the sound quality, and haven't spent much time with more expensive headphones, I don't expect the sound from these to bother anyone overly. If you're shopping around, you might want to first try a much less expensive headphone, which I actually prefer, in the Sennheiser HD201s. At half the price, they're worth trying first. I will continue to listen to these over the next few weeks, and if any problems or new observations arise, will update my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFLT0PC4SLK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3OH45G#wasThisHelpful","RIFLT0PC4SLK1","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I've been quietly missing the Garretts for the last three years. I remember picking up My Life Next Door based on its comparisons to Anna and the French Kiss and being pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful an exploration it was of families and first loves. And while I swooned over Jase and Sam right along with every other reader with a pulse, it was those forbidden Garrets that kept me thoroughly enthralled. Which is why my anticipation grew daily from the moment I heard about The Boy Most Likely To right up until release day. And then, perversely, when it finally came I worried. What if the balance is off? What if Tim isn't redeemable? What if (as was a touch true in the first book) Alice-and-Tim weren't the equals I wanted them to be? The thousand niggling questions of an anxious, but resolute reader such as myself . . . But, happily, the pull of returning to the cozy kitchen of the Garretts didn't allow me to hold out for long. And it was a warm welcome back indeed.Tim Mason doesn't expect anyone to believe him. He knows that ship sailed years ago when he started drinking, got his very own dealer, and required oblivion in order to get by. Now he's clean, sober, and being kicked out of his father's house at last. Already kicked out of high school, he takes his best friend Jase up on his offer of a place to stay, packs a single box, and moves into the dilapidated apartment over the Garrett's garage. But when Jase's older sister Alice discovers her little brother has up and allowed his deadbeat friend to move into the apartment she wanted, that trouble Tim can never seem to escape begins brewing once more. It doesn't help that he's had a crush on Alice forever and that her dolt of a jock boyfriend keeps giving him the evil eye anytime he comes within a five mile radius of Alice. Of course, Alice can take care of herself. She's been keeping herself as well as her entire motley family afloat since the car accident that put her dad in the hospital, thank you very much. And she has no time for a boy who's proven time and again that he wants nothing more from life than a good time.I love Alice, and you know why? Because she gives approximately zero damns about Tim from the word go. She has her priorities set, she knows what she wants, and she works so freaking hard to take care of the people in her care. Never mind that she never asked for seven siblings with another on the way and that she may have to defer nursing school again if those hospital bills keep coming. I love Tim, too, and you know why? Because he's serious about changing his life in his way. He may have no earthly idea how, but his eyes are clear despite being clouded for years. He sees Alice, recognizes what she is, and he never messes around with her. Despite their tacitly acknowledged attraction. Living in such close proximity to one another does lead to something of a softening of enemy lines, especially as Tim is incapable of turning the flirting off when it comes to Alice, even as he knows she's too good for him on pretty much every level. But just when things are maybe sort of starting to look up, his past comes back to haunt him in the most serious of ways.What I love is that the whole debacle never grows too overwrought, that Alice accepts the latest of Tim's mess-ups just like she does every other blow she's taken standing up in her life. Which is not to say that she doesn't give him the grief he deserves over it. Which is also not to say that Tim doesn't accept said grief as his due. She just doesn't let it derail her, which is one of the best of many things about Alice. And he doesn't let it destroy him. Which is, yeah, one of a host of things I just really loved about Tim. The pain is there, and it is real. Along with the daily, crushing uncertainty of youth. The creeping sense that you may not be able to escape your past (in Tim's case) or your present bonds (in Alice's). The lovely bit is the way Huntley Fitzpatrick works it all out, the way Tim and Alice's story unfolds against the backdrop of all of the messy, wonderful Garretts, Tim's twin sister Nan's struggles, as well as the quietly supportive and aching additions of his fellow AA members. The way that with increased clarity comes the realization that escape doesn't necessarily have to be the goal. A pivotal scene told from Alice's point of view when she comes to understand Tim's situation a little more clearly:***I carry both mugs from the kitchen, set his down in front of him.“Look. Stay. I mean . . . I can wait. It’s only fair. Jase didn’t know I wanted it anyway. Four months is nothing. You can be here for four months and then . . . “ I trail off.Then what?Troubled gray eyes search my face for a long time. Finally, he sighs, shakes his head. “Nah. I’ll find somewhere else. You deserve it. You’ve earned it.”Like a home’s something you have to earn when you’re seventeen.He’s a kid. Not a man, not on some deadline. But with his jaw set and raised—I know that face. The I’m going to push on through, no problem, I’ll deal. Moving right along. Nothing to see here face. Know it as well as my own. It is my own. And I picture the rest of the lines on that paper.Tim Mason: The Boy Most Likely To . . .Forget his own name even before we doTurn down the hottest girl in the world for the coldest beerBe six feet under by our fifth reunionDon’t go that way, Tim. Such a stupid, stupid waste. “I mean it,” I say aloud. “Stay.”Pause.“I want you here,” I add, my cheeks flaring. He shifts on the couch and I’m hyper-aware of him next to me, the smell of soap and shampoo, the heat of him, the alive of him.“Please, stay.”My words fall into the silence, and something changes. Tim’s shoulders straighten. He stills, but not frozen, more like . . . more like . . . alert.“Yeah? Then . . . I’ll be here,” he says quietly.***The narrative alternates back and forth between Tim and Alice's perspectives, a touch that I appreciated and one that definitely aids in the reader having enough time with them to not only love, but get, these two individuals. No one has an easy time of it, and I wasn't sure at times things were going to work out in a way that felt both realistic and well (not a requirement, but frequently a hope). But it was such an enjoyable journey, and it has a last line that sticks with you the way I always want them to. Even now—a couple of days later—I'm murmuring it to myself as my lips curve in a satisfied smile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EU5I4X3Q3UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803741421#wasThisHelpful","R2EU5I4X3Q3UJ","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This RC toy is crazy. On the plus side, the one trick this car has up its sleeve does work well. It's designed to move over any surface: carpet, grass, dirt, snow, even water. All of these it will do. When both screws are turning forward, it seems pretty much unstoppable, unless it hits an obstacle. However, it's quite slow and almost impossible to control in any meaningful or precise way. It's capable of going sideways in either direction with both screws turning the same way, but it isn't very straight and travels in an odd, slow arc. When you drive it forward, it moves fairly straight and slowly. But when you try and turn it, it just goes off in a fairly random, diagonal way with one screw turning faster than the other and no finite control over the speed of the screws. If you were to put this car in an obstacle course, all would be lost. My kids have enjoyed playing with it, but their inability to control it precisely becomes quickly fatiguing and frustration always follows. As an oddity for hardcore RC fans, there is something of value here. For all else, a more traditional car or truck is much more rewarding.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DC1ZL8XP2VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXQ0A84#wasThisHelpful","R16DC1ZL8XP2VW","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned several high performance flashlights over the years, and the recent generation of super bright LED flashlights are the best I've ever had. The Streamlight ProTac has one primary feature that sets it apart from other 800 lumen plus LED lights. It is USB rechargeable. This means that you can charge it with any micro USB cord and charge it off of any camping/solar/car adapter. This makes it ideal for an emergency bag, first aid kit, or roadside emergency car kit.As for the details of the flashlight, it's well constructed. It's dimmable through a somewhat fussy ""tap"" button on the rear. Lightly tapping the button without fully depressing it cycles through three modes: full bright, strobe, and low. The strobe function would be very useful for signaling for help in an emergency situation, but that is hopefully an unlikely use. So I would prefer to have the strobe function a little deeper in the tap menu. The tap menu is in fact customizable through an even fussier series of button presses (instructions available on Streamlight's website), and it's actually worth waiting through the complexity of doing this to get the tap sequence the way you like it.The flashlight on high has an 850 lumen output and a nicely focused and usable beam. Unfortunately, the focus of the beam is not adjustable. A steel collar slides down to expose the USB charge connector. When that collar is up and the connector is covered, the light is waterproof. This collar slides well and has a high quality feel. Batter life is around 30 minutes in my testing on high, and well over an hour on low. The battery is not replaceable, but charges quickly and a small LED light next to the charging port changes from red to green when the battery is charged. The light includes a built in pocket clip and a nylon Velcro case. I'm very pleased with this light so far and will update my review with any additional observations as time goes by.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RG0Z974A0QW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBAE8Q2#wasThisHelpful","R2RG0Z974A0QW1","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the same Rival crock-pot for the last twelve years and have always been fairly pleased with it, though I wished it had more options and settings. When I first tested out this Black & Decker, I was immediately impressed by the variable temperatures and the ability to both sear and saute before setting it to cook for hours.The removable ceramic pot is also impressive, both light and easy to clean. The pot and glass lid are dishwasher safe and clean up beautifully, far more easily than my older (much heavier and unwieldy) Rival enamel insert, which I was forever scrubbing caked on food out of. I also like that this insert is a bit shallower (but half a quart larger) than my old one. It makes it easier to sea all of the contents as they cook and gauge how they are cooking.In the Black & Decker, meats come out extremely tender and ""fally-aparty"" on the low setting. I have not used the high very much as I tend to prefer my meats cooked long and low. I will update this review once I've used the high.My only complaint is the steel handles on the ceramic insert. While the lid handle is covered in silicone so as to make it easy to pick up without burning yourself, the side handles are not. As a result, they heat up so as to be too hot to handle without an oven mitt or hot pot holder. This flaw knocked a star off for me, as it seems a simple thing to have covered those handles in silicone as well as the lid handle. Other than that, I have zero complaints with this crock-pot and I look forward to hours of use and delectable results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3477S92AW8DOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5XJ9NI#wasThisHelpful","R3477S92AW8DOC","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bluetooth headphones have to get a lot of things right to work as an everyday headphone. They have to pair to your phone reliably and easily. They have to be comfortable, sound good, and the microphone needs to work well in a variety of environments when talking on the phone. The Sol Republic Shadows get high marks on a couple of these categories. The sound quality is above average for the price. Although the rubber tips did not fit my ears well, after upgrading the tips to the Comply Comfort Plus, these fit my ears extremely well, sealed out noise well, and sounded good. How these in-ear type headphones fit is so dependent on the shape of the wearer's ears and the type of fit that they prefer that it's impossible to predict how comfortable they will be generally. But these smooth rubber tips simply slipped right out of my ears, even after trying all three included sizes. The Comply tips are well worth the $20 cost.The design of the earband on the Shadows is somewhat different from other Bluetooth headset designs. The neckband is made of soft, pliable rubber and simply hangs around the neck like a scarf, and the earbuds dangle down on either side. How well they stay in place seems to depend quite a bit on what type of shirt I'm wearing. If I tuck the ear pieces into my t-shirt, they seem to stay in place fairly well. But if I am more active, I have a couple of times realized they were about to slip off one side or the other. And the possibility of simply realizing one day that these are no longer around my neck and have dropped off at some point during the day is a real concern. That said, they are the most comfortable Bluetooth set to wear all day that I've ever tried.The Shadows paired instantly to my iPhone 6 Plus and have never failed to pair as soon as I turned them on. Full marks for the Bluetooth implementation by Sol Republic.The biggest complaint I have with the Sol Republic Shadows is the complete lack of wind protection for the microphone. My experience so far has been that unless the wind is absolutely still, if I take a call outside, all the person on the other end can hear is wind noise. The microphone seems to be set up in the worst possible way to deal with any air moving over it. So be warned, if you tend to talk on the phone on your headphones outdoors a lot, these headphones are not the right choice.Overall, I'm sticking with the Sol Republic Shadows as my primary daily Bluetooth headset, and I'll update this review if any new issues creep up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8Q05IVCBPO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY6WCV2#wasThisHelpful","R1V8Q05IVCBPO2","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Imaginary Lines was fine. Just fine. Not the best in the series and not the worst. My main problem with Imaginary Lines was that, in previous books, Abe was the most charming of characters, just begging for his own story. But when his turn finally came, this Abe felt like an entirely different beast, not nearly as charming or compelling as he was in previous installments. I struggled to want Tamar to achieve her lifelong crush. I simply felt she was worth more, deserved more than she got in Abe. Very competently written, as always, but lacking the spark and tenacity of the first book in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27868ASEW7K5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKBHIQM#wasThisHelpful","R27868ASEW7K5L","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Say Yes to the Marquess began so very promisingly. Clio's untenable situation and her tenuous connection with Rafe immediately secured my emotions. But as the events of the story progressed, things began to run downhill alarmingly quickly. The entire plotline with the dog was ridiculous from start to finish. I found the characters' actions highly implausible in the second half of the book given the genuine feelings they had expressed for one another. It felt as though the heartfelt beginning descended into a bit of a farce, and the change was too jarring for me. I still remain so enchanted by the first book, however, that I plan on picking up the next one and hoping for the best despite this disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJK6D6JT4FUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006224020X#wasThisHelpful","R2JJK6D6JT4FUU","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Madeline Ash has been such a golden find this year. I first discovered her through her latest novel Love and Other Lies, which I utterly enjoyed. Ash writes emotional, heartfelt romances with such a light hand that they are a pleasure to read in every sense of the word. So when I saw her novella The Secret Prince pop up, it took me no time at all to dive in.My only complaint is that it is far too short. I fell immediately in love with Dee and Jed and would have followed them much farther than across an ocean from LA to a tiny European principality and back again. And since my emotions were so definitively engaged, I did wish the reader had a chance to spend more time with them exploring their unfortunate history after their reunion in Los Angeles (this was my favorite section) and then again in Leguarday as they negotiated the unusual terms of what a life together might look like. To say nothing of the miles and miles of potential regarding Jed's father. Everything ties up so neatly and quickly, I presume in order to fit it all into novella form.But Ash's writing is fully up to the task of delving deeper into the psyches of these two banged up kids and, given the slim page count, I felt that we got a healthy amount of bang for our buck. She doesn't shy away from the painful, complex moments when two hurt individuals are trying and failing and trying again not to make things worse. And she absolutely knows her way around the tentative exploration that follows, with one hand protecting your heart and the other shakily reaching out.Her Secret Prince is a sweet (if too short) contemporary fairy tale, and I look forward to Ash's next full-length novel with much anticipation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGH356CF963Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU0M8JA#wasThisHelpful","R2QGH356CF963Z","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never ordered a couch online before, and it was with not a little trepidation that I clicked the button and awaited its arrival. Happily, I have been nothing but utterly pleased with this sofa in the weeks since its arrival. It arrived in excellent condition. The only assembly required is twisting the four wooden feet on and unpacking the two vacuum-sealed pillows to allow them to take their normal shape. The pillows are double-sided, with a flower tapestry on one side and the fabric of the couch itself on the other. They are filled with down and are therefore not super poofy, but they are very attractive and well-made.The color itself is even more attractive in person than the pictures indicate. Rather than a muddy, indeterminate brown, it is actually a soft, warm golden brown that would work as a nice neutral in a wide range of rooms. The fabric is soft and warm, retaining the look of a worn leather without any of the coldness leathers often have. This is one of my favorite features of this sofa. Another favorite is the attached back cushions, while the bottom cushions are detachable. The contrast stitching across the cushions is another pleasing design element.All in all, it's a comfortable piece. I am 5'5"" and my feet rest comfortably flat on the floor. But the couch is still large and roomy enough for my 6' husband, and its size gives it a nice, cozy presence in the room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JB7KW1KNHVF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QM2KYU6#wasThisHelpful","R1JB7KW1KNHVF5","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well-made potholder. It moves and bends easily in your hand as you grip pans and pots, and they are not kidding around with those silicone grips. They are insanely strong and ensure the hot pan or pot will not be slipping out of your grip any time soon. On the flip side, they make it extremely difficult to let go of a pan and set it down. So when I was transferring a sheet of cookies to cool on the counter, I had trouble setting it down easily (or at all). It seemed dangerous when handling such a hot pan. This pot holder works splendidly as a trivet on the table and, if you have two, is great for holding and moving pots with handles. But for cookie sheets and actual pans, its strength is actually a weakness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1SC0ZARIIXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABQU08#wasThisHelpful","RG1SC0ZARIIXY","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We make a lot of toast in our house. We have three children and put out about 20 slices of toast a week so we have specific needs when it comes to toasters. Our reference toaster has been the Magimix Vision for over a year and it works very well (perfectly, really), but its absurdly expensive. When we needed a second toaster I decided to try this Black & Decker which claims to be 50% faster than most others. This is very appealing plus this unit looks great and is only $20! So how does it perform?First off, it's every bit as fast as it claims. It's almost exactly twice as fast as the Magimix! The dial that sets how dark the toast gets goes to 7 so I started at 4 (which is where I set the Magimix to get the darkness I prefer). I also dropped a piece into the Magimix at the same setting to let them race and compare results. The B&D was done in a very quick 1:02! The vastly more expensive Magimix cooked on for another 1:13 before popping up. The two pieces of toast were almost exactly the same color and for a second I thought I might have just found the perfect toaster. Then I flipped the piece of toast out of the B&D over to discover it was much lighter on the other side. A second test yielded the same result. I have included photos of both sides of the same piece of toast out of the Black & Decker. For me this is a deal breaker. I really don't like having toast under-cooked on one side and as I like my toast a bit lighter than some, it seems to be hard to get the even results I like.A couple of other notes on the Black & Decker. The toaster looks great. We've come a long way with these stainless steel units and I can't believe how nice this thing looks on my counter considering the price. The controls are simple and well labeled. There is a cancel button that pops the toast up whenever you need it (this is a must have feature). The dial that adjusts darkness really works and level 1 leaves bread lightly warmed where level 7 burns it. Also, and possibly as a result of the speed this thing can toast, the top of the unit gets very very hot. It will burn you and I would not let my younger kids use this particular toaster.This toaster is tough to recommend. It's fast and beautiful and the price is very good, but it doesn't make toast the way I like and that's frustrating. If you like your toast a little darker, and don't mind one side being a bit lighter, then this is probably a superb value. If you need it done evenly, I would look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGJH6AWQWUC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HVAO#wasThisHelpful","RNGJH6AWQWUC9","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 100% polyester tablecloth looks and feels like linen, which makes it drape nicely over the table and work well for casual or fancier meals. I would not use it for outdoor BBQ or picnic scenarios, however, as it would definitely stain easily, particularly the white one I have. It does wash up and dry well, though, with a minimum of shrinkage because of the material. It is quite thin, and I can see my wood table a little through it.

"I stayed away from Madeline Miller's debut novel for awhile for several reasons, among them my fear of the inevitable sorrow, as well as the usual concern when one comes to a retelling of characters and stories one loves. But eventually that cover—the gold foil, the glorious gold foil—and the parade of ecstatic reviews got to me enough that I grabbed a copy the next time I was at the library and settled down that night to see.Patroclus has always led the uneasiest of lives. Disparaged for his slight build and his relative weakness in comparison to his father, he has been a somewhat second-class citizen in his own father's court. Then one day an accident occurs and a young nobleman dies as a result. Patroclus is deemed at fault and so is exiled to be fostered in the realm of the legendary King Peleus. It is there that he meets Peleus' song Achilles. Achilles is everything Patroclus wishes he could be, bright and brave and the most talented of warriors where Patroclus is dull and shy and physically inferior. Which is why no one is more shocked than Patroclus when Achilles takes him as his personal companion. And so the two young boys form the fastest of friendships as they live together, train together, and run wild through the olive groves together. But through it all they can never seem to escape the shadow of the coming war or the prophecy that Achilles would go on to become the greatest hero the Greeks had ever known.***If I had had words to speak such a thing, I would have. But there were none that seemed big enough for it, to hold that swelling truth.As if he had heard me, he reached for my hand. I did not need to look; his fingers were etched into my memory, slender and petal-veined, strong and quick and never wrong,""Patroclus,"" he said. He was always better with words than I.***This is the part where I confess I was vastly unprepared for the depth of feeling this novel would incite. I have been enamored of Greek mythology basically as far back as I can remember, and I recall with perfect clarity the chills that ran down my spine the first time I read the opening lines of The Iliad. I've read a number of retellings since, but I realized few of them worked hard to make Achilles sympathetic. Or at least more sympathetic than Hector. And while each incarnation left me impressed with Achilles' grandeur, I remained always firmly in Hector's camp. The Song of Achilles is told entirely from Patroclus' perspective, and his mind is as sharp and perceptive as his friend's body is honed and agile. The result is an extremely nuanced portrait of both young men. I savored the opportunity to watch them grow up together, to see Achilles handle the heavy layers of expectation and destiny, to watch how he dealt with his human father and his immortal mother. Thetis is a force to be reckoned with and I, like Patroclus, worried about the depth of her influence over Achilles. As ever with this epic tale, the question of which force will hold sway in the end is a desperate one. It's impossible to shake the feeling of dread while reading, but Miller does such a fine job of allowing you to soak up those golden moments leading up to the war, to come to know and love both Achilles and Patroclus enough that you understand why they make the choices they do in the end. And I can honestly say that my knowing what was coming in no way impeded my experience, the words were that expertly chosen and woven together with a level of skill that left my cup full to the brim.***The sorrow was so large it threatened to tear through my skin. When he died, all things swift and beautiful and bright would be buried with him. I opened my mouth, but it was too late.""I will go,"" he said. ""I will go to Troy.""The rosy gleam of his lip, the fevered green of his eyes. There was not a line anywhere on his face, nothing creased or graying; all crisp. He was spring, golden and bright. Envious Death would drink his blood, and grow young again.He was watching me, his eyes as deep as earth.""Will you come with me?"" he asked.The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one.***What an exquisite agony reading The Song of Achilles was. I wept more than once. But the sorrow was handled well, in such a way as to allow it its full and brutal impact before winding to a close so beautiful I felt the breath leave my lungs. How I loved them. Patroclus and his brilliant Achilles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNBXQHV9BTOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060627#wasThisHelpful","R3UNBXQHV9BTOV","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's worth pointing out that I'm not a huge connoisseur of small town contemporaries, and I was not a little concerned that this one would prove to be (as has happened a number of times in the past) a little too cozy for my taste. But of course the range within that subgenre is as wide as it is with any other, and I think I just hadn't come across the right recipe. Happily, Virginia Kantra's Dare Island series hit just the right spot for this quasi-cozy-phobic reader.Allison Carter came to Dare Island in the hopes of shedding the scales of her parents' expectations and finding fulfillment teaching high school English in the somewhat isolated fishing village. Matt Fletcher spent his early life at the whim of his father's career in the Marines, but has called the island his home long enough now for it to mean something. As a single father who captains a charter fishing boat for a living and lives with and helps support his aging parents at their inn, he is not in any way looking for a long-term relationship. Longing for just the sort of permanence Matt is working hard to avoid, Allison is nevertheless reluctant to get into any sort of relationship with him, especially given the fact that his son Josh is one of her students. But the two somewhat isolated individuals continue to be thrown together by circumstance (and Josh's performance, or lack thereof, at school) and soon it becomes a not inconsiderable struggle to find reasons give at least some semblance of togetherness a try.Growing up, I spent many summers at my aunt and uncle's house in North Carolina. I have countless fond memories of sweltering summer days, chasing fireflies at night, and trips to the coast full of hours of splashing in the turf and falling asleep tangled in a bed of cousins listening to the crash of the waves. All of this to say that it took Dare Island and I no time at all to appreciate each other's charms. The setting is such a strength in this novel, and that is saying something, because it is a novel full to the brim of swoony romance and heady glances, weighty family drama and genuine humor. Given how many elements Kantra was balancing, I kept expecting at least one to veer into the cheesy, the melodramatic, or the overwrought. And yet not one did. Somehow she made me care for not only Allison and Matt, but every single one of Matt's family members, from his sweetheart parents and his scalawag son, to his somewhat heedless younger brother and his unexpected niece. This attentive character development made it a pleasure to follow whomever the narrative revolved to with each chapter. The focus definitely hinges on Allison and Matt's relationship, but so much of what goes down plays against the very important background of the Fletcher family and the charming inn they all inhabit. I loved how good Allison is with children, from the teenage students in her classes to Matt's troubled niece Taylor who gets dumped in their laps after her mother's sudden death.The Fletchers themselves are a very loving family, but they need Allison, no matter how much Matt might like to think he's a lone reed. And Allison herself is so careful and conscientious when it comes to carrying on a relationship with a single father and being there to help as much as she can without stepping on any toes. I always loved Allison. It's no small challenge she and Matt face in daring to test the waters of their attraction. But what was between them fit itself unobtrusively into the spaces inside them that were empty. It felt real and sweet, and it so clearly made their hours and days better. I love it when a romance manages to demonstrate that. And while there were a couple of expected misunderstandings here and there, I appreciated how they were handled and how my emotions never felt toyed with or forcibly disengaged by unnecessary drama or inconsistencies. The whole thing builds to a particularly lovely resolution scene in the inn and I put Carolina Home down completely satisfied. Of course, I immediately binged on the rest of the series. And a good time was had by all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KX5ARJ86GOHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425250938#wasThisHelpful","R1KX5ARJ86GOHQ","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aristotle narrates his life about as bluntly and intimately as an aggressively lackadaisical fifteen-year-old boy can. At least until that patently private boy meets one Dante Quintana and sees just how open and welcoming a boy (and his family) can be. It's the summer of 1985 and Ari spends most of each day struggling to find reasons to leave the house, ways to occupy himself aside from brooding about his father who seems to have dealt with his experiences in Vietnam by adopting a policy of silence. When he meanders over to the pool one day, Ari meets a boy with a squeaky voice and the kindred name of Dante who offers to teach him how to swim. Ari begrudgingly accepts. From that point on, a friendship develops that takes both boys by surprise and bids good to change their lives permanently. Accompanying them on this journey are their parents who love them unreservedly but who have their own struggles as they deal with their individual histories and the ways in which they reach into the present to shape their sons' lives as well as their own.""I have always felt terrible inside. The reasons for this keep changing.""Benjamin Alire Sáenz had me at Richie Valens. He had me somewhere amid the opening lines, at Ari going to bed wishing the world would be different when he woke up and then waking up to wonder what went through Richie Valens' head before the plane crashed. He had me at, ""Hey, Buddy! The music's over."" This book crushed me, it's that beautiful. I began it one night after tucking my kids into bed and—a few dozen pages later—blithely accepted the fact that I would be staying up however long it took to read it through to completion. The novel is told entirely from Ari's perspective, and it's difficult for me to tell you how much I grew to care for that boy. In simple and occasionally halting terms, he ruminates on his unease around other boys, his admiration for his mother, his longing to broach the subject of his imprisoned brother. The folding of lively, loquacious Dante into his life happens almost without Ari or the reader noticing, it is that seamless and that natural. Having some experience with friends coming into my life unexpectedly and yet at precisely the moment I so needed them to, my heart lodged itself firmly between these two boys and informed me it would be going nowhere. Since we mostly get our impressions of Dante through Ari's eyes, I occasionally worried a bit (perhaps taking my cues from Ari's deep seated anxiety) that he would flit away too soon. Before Ari or I had parsed out how to make room in our lives for such a bright star. Loving Dante is a foregone conclusion, with his inability to wear shoes, his love of reading, and his complicated relationship with his Mexican heritage.I love how time passes in this novel, how the summers felt exactly as unlimited and free as they do in high school, how being separated from your dearest friend for a year can hurt in ways you've never experienced, and how you try to fill the hole with the distraction of work and smaller friendships. Perhaps the most beautiful experience of reading this book, though, was the privilege of watching Ari awaken (on so many levels), of watching his dual relationships—with Dante and with his father—grow and increase his understanding of himself and humanity in general. The nature of Ari's observations are always arresting, but by the end they become so very rich and simple in their beauty. Here, a lovely example taken from a moment when Ari struggles to convey his feelings when faced with a show of gratitude and love from Dante's parents:***""What am I supposed to do?"" I knew my voice was cracking. But I refused to cry. What was there to cry about? ""I don't know what to do."" I looked at Mrs. Quintana and I looked at Sam. ""Dante's my friend."" I wanted to tell them that I'd never had a friend, not ever, not a real one. Until Dante. I wanted to tell them that I never knew that people like Dante existed in the world, people who looked at the stars, and knew the mysteries of water, and knew enough to know that birds belonged to the heavens and weren't meant to be shot down from their graceful flights by mean and stupid boys. I wanted to tell them that he had changed my life and that I would never be the same, not ever. And that somehow it felt like it was Dante who had saved my life and not the other way around. I wanted to tell them that he was the first human being aside from my mother who had ever made me want to talk about the things that scared me. I wanted to tell them so many things and yet I didn't have the words. So I just stupidly repeated myself. ""Dante's my friend.""***All four of the parents are such nuanced and present characters in this story and I adored that and them. Throughout the narrative, Sáenz explores the ways in which we need our parents, in which love between a parent and child is endlessly complex and often so difficult to encompass and express in any adequate way. This complexity resonated with me so profoundly, as did basically everything about this beautiful, beautiful love story. Finest kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366B9O8SSXVDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442408936#wasThisHelpful","R366B9O8SSXVDH","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once I realized this book existed and that it featured Olympic figure skaters, well . . . that was all she wrote, folks. I am a huge figure skating fan. And while I actually haven't read many books that focus on the sport, there was simply no way I was going to not read a book billed as ""The Cutting Edge with a Russian twist."" I adored that movie as a kid. And with the figure skating World Championships coming up in a couple of weeks, I thought it was the perfect time to highlight this little gem.Carrie Parker is fairly certain life as she knew it is over when her career as a pairs figure skater comes to a grinding and spectacular halt courtesy of a scandal involving her partner and a judge. Which is why she literally jumps at an unexpected and unusual invitation to travel to Russia and audition for a suddenly open position. What she does not expect is that the male partner will turn out to be a familiar (and wholly unwelcome) face. Anton Belikov is in need of a partner STAT. His longtime skating partner (and girlfriend) Olga has up and left him for greener pastures and a partner more likely to see her to the gold medal podium at the Olympics. Determined to achieve his dream and make a go of it without her, Anton warily follows his coach's advice and auditions the disgraced but unquestionably talented American. However, with the barriers of language, culture, politics (and a distant night only Carrie remembers) looming between them, success on or off the ice is no guarantee for this unlikely team.I was just so taken with Pairing Off. From the very start, I could tell the story was going to wrap itself around me. Carrie is immediately sympathetic, and though the narrative touches ever so briefly on the long ago night she and Anton met, it is nonetheless clear to the reader how it affected both of them and how it will play an uneven but key role in their development as an actual pair. What I was not expecting was how deeply I would fall in love with Moscow and Carrie's experiences there. Harmon writes with great affection and joie de vivre when it comes to the streets and alleys, gardens and soaring architecture of the Russian capital. It is nothing short of a delight accompanying Carrie on her explorations, and I was so pleased that aspect of her new life was allocated adequate page time. Carrie's willingness to fight her attendant isolation and uncertainty in a foreign clime with an open and inquisitive mind and with consistent forays out into her new home endeared her to me even as it filled me with wanderlust. And as she learns the ropes of her adopted country, so does she learn the ways of her adopted partner. A favorite passage in which Carrie gets into a spot of trouble and calls Anton to help her out:***""I've never been happier to see someone in my life.""""What the hell were you doing?"" he shouted. ""Trying to get killed? I told you to stay near city center!""She stared, looking for Anton, not this furious, wild-eyed stranger. ""And you also told me about the park where I could go hiking! Look, I'm not your employee and I'll go where I please. I got a little lost. It could happen to anyone.""""But it didn't happen to anyone. It happened to you!""Carrie felt her eyes grow wide. Was he suggesting she wasn't expendable? Or was his real concern the hassle of finding another Olga replacement? Much more likely. Her chest tightened and it was hard to breathe. ""Yeah, well I'm sorry to be an inconvenience. If I'd known you were going to yell at me, I never would have called."" She fumbled for her map and shook it open. ""The subway's two blocks that way. Drop me off. I'll get home just fine.""""Don't be ridiculous. I'm not dropping you at subway,"" he muttered. ""I was close by anyway. It's good you called.""""Otherwise you'd be auditioning new pair girls tomorrow.""He jerked his head around, and shot an angry look across the car. ""Is that what you think I care about?""""Isn't it?""The tense silence was filled by the muffled sounds of traffic outside. Jaw tight, Anton turned his gaze back to the road. ""You and I are in this together. Partners, like I said before."" His voice softened. ""Not just two skaters making tricks.""***There is very little not to love about Anton. Yet I appreciated how slowly their relationship developed. He was still handling a long distance relationship with a girlfriend who abandoned him professionally. She was struggling to reconcile the man she sees before her with the one she spent only a handful of hours with years ago and who does not seem to remember her at all. Their respective families are complicated and play strong roles in shaping the way they see the world and the fears and hopes they harbor for their futures. There are layers upon layers between these two, and I relished the gradual dismantling and rebuilding they had to go through on their way to forming a firm and equal partnership. This quiet, romantic book is such a lovely read and one of my favorites of the year thus far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWU034S0VA16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQJI7QE#wasThisHelpful","R2UWU034S0VA16","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This camera works very well and was as easy to setup as a camera of this type could be expected to be. I drilled a hole through the brick under the eave on the corner of my house and ran power to the unit. I placed it high enough that you would need a ladder to cut power to the camera. The view is of the front of my house, about 20' from the front door. The instructions included were clear and easy to follow and I had the camera online in 2 minutes. The free app will actually notify your phone when the camera detects motion, and this feature has never once given me a false notification. The resolution is more than enough to let me clearly see who as at my door and it works from anywhere I am. I enjoy watching the kids head out the door to school when I'm on the road. There is also a mic built into the camera which can be activated in the app. Once on, it works surprisingly well, and I can easly listen to a conversation anyone is having at the front door.The camera includes IR LEDs for night viewing, but in my installation (approx. 20' from the front door) the IR light is not quite reaching the door. I CAN see clearly if someone is there, but the image is not very bright. This is more a function of how far I have the camera from the door than a failing of the design of the camera.All in all I highly recommend this camera! Anyone can install and set this up and if a remote view of your home or office is what you're after, this camera will make it easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWD3KU6O5DQUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ24PEQ#wasThisHelpful","RWD3KU6O5DQUA","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the TASCAM US-4X4 USB for about two months now to record podcasts. I came to the TASCAM from a simple AKG PERCEPTION 120 USB condenser mic which had been working well, but I wanted a way to use a high quality dynamic mic which would not require the silent recording environment that a sensitive condenser mic always will. I mated the TASCAM to a Rhode Procaster with an XLR cable and connected the USB cable to my PC. Everything worked perfectly.Hardware:The TASCAM is a well made piece of kit. The unit is heavy, the controls have good feedback and feel and all connections are solid and reliable.Full phantom power is available if you need to power a condenser mic. My Rhode does not require it so I have not tested it, but it's a full 48v power supply and I'm certain it works well.The TASCAM operates as both recording and playback device through the USB connection, so if you set it up as such, you can monitor all computer audio through the headphone jacks and mix that feed with the signal from your line inputs. This allows you to monitor your mic feed without lag and still hear, for example, the other end of a Skype conversation. This system works very well when I'm using Skype to interview people for a podcast.Each input includes both an XLR and an unbalanced connection and have individual signal and peak lights. This is very helpful when quickly setting levels.For some reason TASCAM did not include a power switch into the design of the 4X4, and that's a shame. The only way shut the unit down is to unplug it. The one time the device seemed to disappear from my computer, unplugging and restarting the TASCAM solved the problem instantly.A USB indicator light on the TASCAM reliably tells you a propoer USB connection is in place.Software:Two separate software packages are included with the hardware and I managed to install them both. However, I do all of my recording with Reaper and have not played with the included software. That said, the inclusion of two software options is a plus.There is very little to complain about with the TASCAM 4X4 USB. Aside from the absence of a power switch, nothing has bothered me about the design or quality of the this unit, and I expect I will be using it for a long time. The audio quality is truly excellent and the mic preamps are very very quiet. I fully recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSDUJPG419SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXF1JW#wasThisHelpful","R3PSDUJPG419SK","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this return to Bascom and the Waverly sisters with some trepidation as Garden Spells was so lovely and contained in and of itself. I worried this revisit might mess with my original positive impression. Unfortunately, most of my fears were confirmed. The setup feels like a thin excuse to flash through the lives of beloved characters. But there is little reason or depth behind doing so. The writing is, as ever, just as lovely as we've come to expect from Addison Allen.

"Teenage Sherlock Holmes, Watson is a girl, and the story is told from her perspective. This is essentially all the information I needed in order to make the decision to dive into Every Breath at the earliest opportunity. But in case you're wavering, it's also fun to know that this is Australian author Ellie Marney's debut novel, that it is a YA contemporary mystery, and the first in a series to boot. Next up, I think we should just take a moment to talk covers. I have yet to purchase my own copy (that's earmarked for the next paycheck), but both the US and Aussie covers have a lot going for them. The Aussie one gets tons of points for having Watts actually on the cover, for one thing. But in a very rare move, I'm leaning US if only because it's not a photo of actual people (never works out well for me) and because, well, his throat. Also his hair and his entire posture. But his throat. That's Mycroft. I love him this cover.Rachel Watts' friendship with her neighbor James Mycroft is something of a full time job. Newly (and unwillingly) arrived from the countryside, Rachel struggles to find a place for herself in Melbourne. Unused to navigating city life after the loss of the family farm, she and her older brother and parents find themselves acting almost like strangers as they adjust to their new home and environment. But then Mycroft enters her life, with his jittery brilliance, his obsession with forensics, and his ongoing allergy to school. And soon her days are not quite as numb, filled as they are with contributing her powers of observation (and cooking skills) to the latest in a long line of Mycroft's investigations. But this most recent involves a murder. And not just any stranger, but that of Homeless Dave—a man they both knew. Unable to accept the official police verdict, Mycroft and Watts set themselves to the task of tracking down the truth behind Dave's violent death and bringing the mysterious killer to justice.I'll admit, I was a little nervous at first. I was nervous the high school setting, and possibly the nature of the relationship between Watts and Mycroft, would pall too quickly or somehow not resonate with me in just the right way. As nerves go, basically your run of the mill stuff. But I've read one fantastic Sherlock Holmes adaptation and I was so keen to find another. Happily, Rachel herself was the first to set me at ease. Her transition to the city has been a particularly difficult one, and the dry but upfront way in which she expressed that difficulty struck a chord of sympathy within me:***I like it in his room—the starry lights, the feeling of sanctuary. I'm still not used to dealing with a lot of other people. I've known Mycroft, and Mai and her boyfriend, Gus, since last November, and they still feel like ""a lot of other people."" Actually, Mycroft alone could probably qualify as seeming like ""a lot of other people."" He does so much crazy stuff you could imagine more than a single offender.***That passage could just as easily been an entry from one of my high school journals. Other people, man. Not for the faint of heart. I love that the story is told from Watts' perspective. She has very honed powers of observation, though she herself might decry that claim. But it means that not only is she vital to Mycroft's ongoing efforts, she also does an incredibly effective job of introducing the reader to her singular friend. And if her focus is more frequently drawn to to Mycroft than it is anyone else in the room, it isn't any wonder as his magnetism and zaniness and pain fairly claw their way off the page. Gratefully, his presence never overshadows Watts. Not even a little bit, as we are firmly grounded inside her viewpoint and know just how hard she works to keep everyone in her life afloat and not lose track of her own needs, even if she is reticent about voicing them aloud. The mystery itself makes for a fun, often dark ride, and I enjoyed sitting back and accompanying them in their rounds. But the heart of Every Breath is, without question, the chemistry between Watts and Mycroft. Ms. Marney quite simply nails their need on the head. The pacing and development of Watts-and-Mycroft is one long and delicious thread running alongside the unfolding of the murder investigation. As the precarious hold they each have on their lives begins to unravel against the backdrop of Watts' uncertainty and Mycroft's desperation, the solace they take in being together, the rightness of their fit, is so soothing it is tangible. I currently have the sequel on order from Australia and am sitting here feeling antsy just thinking about what these two might be getting up to without me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0RK6S04M8UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1ISJZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3N0RK6S04M8UI","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started a Meredith Duran book some time ago and stalled out early on for reasons I can no longer quite remember. I know it wasn't the writing, which definitely struck me as adept. I think it was more to do with the setting and I not clicking. Also the sense I was getting that the characters were going to hurt each other—possibly at some length—before they found any middle ground. Either way, I wasn't up for it at the time. And then I'm fairly certain I went on to mix Ms. Duran up with Tessa Dare and forgot to return after trying and sort of spectacularly failing to engage with Dare's Spindle's Cove series. Which is why I'm very glad Fool Me Twice was brought to my attention a few days ago. It jogged my memory and I remembered I'd always meant to go back and investigate Duran's work further to see if there might be a better fit among her backlist. As it turns out, her most recent novel and I were destined to get on in spades.Olivia Mather has set her scruples aside in favor of staying alive. With her mother's husband's dangerous henchman lurking around every dark corner, she decides to use the only weapon she has and infiltrate the home of the Duke of Marwick. As a maid in the duke's home, she feels certain it won't take her above a week to root out his correspondence containing the evidence she needs to ensure the villainous Bertram will leave her alone for good. When she accidentally stumbles into the role of housekeeper, Olivia figures so much the better. But it quickly becomes clear that the home she has walked into is not so easily navigable as she presumed. For the duke is rumored to have run mad at the revelation of his dead wife's betrayal. He has not left his room in above a year. His terrified servants tiptoe about the house and shirk their duties. With time running short and her only hope residing in the duke's rooms, Olivia must take charge of the crumbling household and find a way to lure the crumbling man inside out into the light.As you know, I can never resist a Beauty and the Beast tale and Fool Me Twice situates itself nicely in the genre with a wonderfully game, feisty heroine and a decidedly bitter, wounded beast. The novel itself is a study in contrasts. Duran's writing is light, often taking an elegant turn. The characters enjoy sparring with one another—verbally, physically, emotionally—you name it. There is much wit and teasing. But. These high and light emotions often run unchecked into much darker fare. Olivia and Marwick excel at demolishing one another, raging beautifully when the thread of their connection dances too close to the gaping lesions they so ferociously protect. While Alistair's injuries are clearly the fresher, Olivia makes a rather shattering command decision not to sidestep her goal in order to save him additional pain. The results are . . . well, devastating for both of them. And I'm really not sure who I was more angry with. Or who I ached for more. I just wanted them to wash their hands of the pain of their pasts and agree to stop pouring salt into old wounds. An example of the light:***""Have you a death wish?"" he snarled. ""Or have you, perhaps, lost the ability to understand English?""She backed away from him, angling toward the door. He matched her step for step, prowling like a lion on the scent of a lamb—not a comfortable analogy. But these innocent books. She was stumbling over them, gilt-edged, calfskin-bound, priceless. She must save them from him.She had one foot out the door when she caught sight again of the illustrated manuscript. She could not abandon it here. The poor darling! She lunged forward and snatched it up.""Put that down!"" he roared.""You may keep them all,"" she cried. ""Move the entire library up here, but you will not keep them on the floor!""She hopped backward and pulled the door shut in his face.***One of my favorite aspects of the narrative is how it continually refers to what has been lost for both of these individuals, engaging with the agonizing question of whether or not those things can (or should) be regained. To say nothing of how far they will go to stave off danger (in Olivia's case) and exact revenge (in Marwick's). Duran's style, setup, and execution requires the reader be rooting for both Olivia and Marwick in order to make it through the utter hell they hand each other on an hourly basis. In order to reach the point where their eyes finally open enough to see beyond the surface implications of their actions, which are admittedly questionable in a number of cases. I wondered a moment or two whether I might lose my grip on my affection for one of them. But then I do like my protagonists flawed. And I am not at all certain I would have responded to Olivia if she had been a little less ruthless or Marwick had he been a little more malleable. And because their innate admiration for each other is unwavering, I remained with them lo, unto the end. Fool Me Twice is a decided highlight among historicals and of my reading year thus far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18V8WYUZ3JPPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7U1M#wasThisHelpful","R18V8WYUZ3JPPQ","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not that I haven't made my feelings about Liza Palmer's books abundantly clear, because I know that I have. It's that her latest novel—Girl Before a Mirror—is so good it's giving her others a run for their money as my favorite (and I honestly didn't think my love for Nowhere But Home could be surpassed). So good I've already reread it once and am fending off a second reread even as I type this. There are other books out there, and they all deserve a chance. I know this, and I feel their call keenly. But. I had supreme difficulty letting go of this one, and I can see myself diving back in regularly and indefinitely just to spend time with these characters again and to experience Anna's hilarious and thoughtful journey along with her once more. It was just as good the second time around, and I know it will only wear better with time.Anna Wyatt finds herself in the unenviable position of not having a clue what to wish for as she blows out the candle on her 40th birthday. Surrounded by her friends, their spouses, and her beloved (if beleaguered) younger brother Ferdie, Anna feels affectionate but a bit blank. A year into a self-imposed dating sabbatical, she's been taking stock of her life and cleaning house of anything (or anyone) extraneous. The result is she finds herself in an undeniably clean, but somewhat sterile place, in need of inspiration and not sure where to look. Hoping to advance at the ad agency where she works, she tracks down Lumineux Shower Gel—a dying product in need of revival. Saddled with hopeful newbie graphic designer/sidekick Sasha, Anna finds inspiration in the unlikely form of Sasha's well-read copy of bestselling romance novelist Helen Brubaker's new self-help book Be the Heroine, Find Your Hero. And before they know it, Anna and Sasha are on their way to Arizona and the annual RomanceCon. Pairing up with the con and Ms. Brubaker herself, Anna and Sasha wind up judging the Mr. RomanceCon competition, with the winner slated to be the new spokesman for Lumineux Shower Gel. Determined to seal the deal and make it out of Romance Land alive, Anna is in no way prepared for the exuberance of the convention, the viciousness of the Arizona heat, and the charming Britishness of one Mr. Lincoln Mallory with his blue oxford cloth shirts and his steady gaze.The thing about Liza Palmer's protagonists is that they're all so very different, from each other and from me. They're in advertising, and they're pastry chefs, they work in prisons or in art restoration. And yet they are so very real, so full of the same questions and vague but earnest hopes and fears that I feel on a daily basis. And so we are comrades. And I care. I care so much from the very start. And Anna Wyatt, with her self-control and her clever mind and her Miss Marple Theory, was no exception. I had her back from page one, as she gazed around at the faces of her friends and tried not to let the gathering uncertainty show on her face. Her story is so compelling because it addresses, so humorously and with unadorned frankness, questions of control, empowerment, guilt, success, and love. Add in some seriously wonderful explorations of female friendship and sibling love and one truly epic romance convention, and you have got the kind of tale I couldn't look away from if my life depended on it. And then . . . there's Lincoln Mallory, who I love so much I start to drift when I think about him too closely. With those oxford cloth shirts and those tense hands in his pockets. At one point there are suspenders involved and . . . well. You'll meet him on your own, but here is one of my favorite of their hilarious and charming exchanges:***I stand in the lobby, flipping my phone around in my hands. I pull Lincoln's business card out of my purse. Again. I flip the card over and dial. My fingers are tingling and this terrified numbness pings throughout my body, settling in my toes. I swallow. And swallow. Blink my eyes. It's like I'm giving myself errands to run around my body so I won't—""This is Lincoln Mallory."" Vomit.""Hey, hi. It's Anna. Anna Wyatt from the other night. From the . . . um . . . from the elevator? And the apple . . . breakfast time—""""I'm going to stop you there, love. I know who you are even without the reminder of apple breakfast time,"" he says. His voice is even better than I remember it.""I apologize for my late call,"" I say, still not having taken a breath now going on nine minutes.""I assumed you were busy at your Booty Ball."" Lincoln Mallory saying booty will go down in history as one of my favorite things in the world.""You still hungry?"" I ask.""I've already eaten, but I did manage to get something for dessert.""""And what's that then?""""It's a surprise,"" he says. My face flushes. ""When your Booty Ball ran long—a sentence I never thought I'd say, quite frankly—I had to strike out on the field trip on my own.""""So you're holding this dessert hostage.""""You make it sound so devious.""I scan the lobby. The hotel bar. The kiss. I close my eyes.And leap.""What's your room number?""""409.""""I'll be right up.""""Cheers,"" he says.""But just for dessert.""""I do like a woman with her priorities in order."" Silence. ""Anna?""""I didn't know if you'd hung up,"" I say.""I hadn't.""""Right.""""But I will now.""""Sure. Okay,"" I say. Silence. ""Hello?""""It's never not funny, is it?""""I mean . . . ,"" I say, unable to keep from laughing.***These two. I mean. And it's always like this with them. The entire time I was reading I alternated between helpless laughter and a sort of fierce longing for their fears to be allayed, for their paths to somehow continue intersecting despite . . . everything. Because, of course, Lincoln's history is as mesmerizing and complicated as Anna's, and I felt every ounce of their combined and individual uneasiness and wanting. It is endlessly relieving to read about characters you would genuinely want to know, would want to sit with in a hotel bar or on a Manhattan sidewalk and just talk to. And I will never not appreciate how these two said what they wanted to, even if it came out mangled and fumbling, how they pursued their truth with an intentness I admire. It is these simple, thoughtful moments that make me pause as I'm reading to mark their effect (and possibly read them aloud to the nearest warm body so that I'm not alone in my wonder). Girl Before a Mirror is filled with them. I've decided the only way to start a new year is with an instant and permanent resident on my beloved bookshelf. Done and done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RLOXYW48NXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297244#wasThisHelpful","R36RLOXYW48NXD","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This anthology is worth it for the Ruthie Knox story alone. I read several (if not all) of the other novellas, and was mildly pleased with each. But Redemption is head and shoulders above the rest and that's all there is to it. Knox is pretty much always a safe bet, but she plain kills it with this sad, wintry tale of two lonely individuals who are dead certain they're using each other to stave off utter despair.

"Last year I read my very first ever Christmas novellas and shocked myself at how much I enjoyed them. I mean I read a few duds, sure, but I read some real gems as well. And so a couple of weeks ago I found myself eagerly looking forward to rereading a couple of my favorites this holiday season as well as hopefully discovering a few new ones. Happily, the very first new one I read proved to be a home run. I kind of knew it would be, given how much I loved Mary Ann Rivers' debut novella The Story Guy earlier this year. When I heard her next book was a Christmas novella, I snatched it up the day it released and snuggled up with my Nook for a little pre-holiday reading.Jenny Wright was diagnosed right at the most inopportune of times--right after she uprooted her life entirely, moved halfway across the country, and started a new job in a new place. And even after being diagnosed with a rare degenerative eye disease, she chose to stay in her new life. Even though her mother begged her to come back home where she could look after her. Even though her colleagues walked a little more cautiously around her. And even as the days grew shorter and the darkness crept in. The one bright point in those days is the time after she gets home from work and settles in on the couch with her computer. That's when she gets to chat with C. Though they've never actually met, he used to live in the house she currently rents. And when she forwarded a piece of mail on to him, they struck up an online relationship. C is a macro photographer. Most days the two of them talk about his pictures, her thoughts, anything they like. Though their interactions grow more intimate, Jenny knows she can't handle more. She has enough on her plate navigating her work, her occupational therapy, and just getting through each day intact. When her worlds collide, she is wholly unprepared for the fallout.***I think my best bet is to keep still and let the snow fall, let the days get long again, the light return its hours to me, a few more chances a day to figure out what it is I can comfortably keep in front of me and see.For me, there isn't some miracle cure, this is my life, or my disease will progress and my life will change focus again, and I'll have another new life.I need C to stay right where he is now because for now, I don't know enough to move from where I am.My hypothesis is that the light will come back, both outside and inside me.I'm afraid and angry, but the light is a theory I want to prove.Until then, I just have to keep the experiment going with as many controls as possible.One bus, back and forth.One store.One man, his words under glass.***Yes. I just knew Ms. Rivers would bring her words. And how beautifully they were voiced through Jenny. I really loved her, you guys. My throat constricted on her behalf from moment to moment. And though I cannot fathom the terror she lived with each day, I know enough of fear to swallow hard at every one of her ruminations on the encroaching darkness. What I love most about Mary Ann Rivers' stories is how with one hand she keeps a ruthless stranglehold on false hope, and with the other she offers the most delicate of joys. I feel both rational and enchanted when I read them. Her writing does not require that I sacrifice either. And so I love it. Which is good, because she brings the sadness and no mistake. Because Jenny's condition is not sugar coated, I worried about getting my hopes up for her future, in general terms as well as with the man in her life. I worried a lot for a single novella. But I loved every page. And there were (as there should be) lovely startling flares of humor as well.***I wonder if he practices making awkward and nerdy look sort of cool. Like he fills his house with furniture that is the wrong scale for his tall body and buys plaid shirts in bulk and tells his barber to leave crazy, too-long pieces of hair mixed in with the regularly cut hair so everything always looks messy.Then he runs his hands through his hair and puts on his plaid shirts and uses mirrors to watch himself sit in uncomfortable furniture until comfortable furniture looks like it's the one with the problem.***I loved him in the same way Jenny did. Uncertainly. Desperately. In awkward pieces and with a number of reservations. Neither of them faced easy choices and the untenable nature of their situation gave me pause more than once. But as the snow fell, how my love grew. When I think about reading Snowfall, I picture it in soft black and white with the occasional flash of color in the threads of his plaid shirt, in the string of Christmas lights hung with the fierceness of hope for light in the coming year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DH7P9XRBYJIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O02AMKW#wasThisHelpful","R1DH7P9XRBYJIT","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember thinking nothing could top Shiver and then being introduced to Cole St. Clair in Linger and realizing Maggie Stiefvater had several more tricks left in her bag. Then Cole and Isabel proceeded to go for each other's throats and I forgot to worry at all. I loved them so much, though, that the continuation of their storyline was perhaps my biggest problem with Forever—the ""conclusion"" to the ""trilogy."" The two of them were just left hanging. And because at that point I really felt like Sam and Grace's story was winding down just as Cole and Isabel's was ramping up, I had a hard time with the wide open, barn door left swinging in the wind ending they were given. The funny thing is that I desperately wanted more but really didn't give any thought to the possibility of her writing more. That ship had sailed, we'd all moved on to killer water horses and dead Welsh kings. Which is why when the news hit that there would in fact be a companion novel to the Shiver trilogy and that it would clue us in on what was going down with our favorite emotional assassins, well, that my friends was a good day.Cole St. Clair is back from the dead and better than ever. He's landed in L.A. and is slated to record his new record as part of a reality webseries with the notorious Baby North—a Hollywood producer known for destroying her subjects as a matter of course. But that's not why he's really in L.A. Not really. Cole is there because that's where Isabel Culpeper is. And in Cole's book, Isabel is pretty much the only thing worth pursuing. If he can revive his music career and make a killer album along the way, so much the better. But Isabel is supremely less than thrilled to see the former NARKOTIKA rocker darken her doorstep. That is to say, it is achingly good to see him. But everything about Cole has spelled nothing but trouble for Isabel, especially his addictive tendencies, be they for drugs, women, or turning into a big, bad wolf whenever the notion (or temperature) takes him. And so begins this epic dance between the two unhappiest people in L.A. Isabel refuses to be drawn into the glitzy hell that is Cole's life, and Cole refuses to be put off his dogged pursuit of the one girl he can be himself with. And as they dance, they're forced to step around Cole's former bandmates (both alive and dead), the new ones Baby North foists upon him, and the last dying gasps of Isabel's parents' marriage. The question is whether the whole cast and crew of the Cole & Isabel show will drag them under or whether they'll find a way to be. Together.***What I had earned was a trophy for generalized disinterest. It felt as if it had taken all of my energy to be so limply disengaged.As I pulled aside the linen curtain to the back room, I heard the front door open again. If it was Christina returning to make a second effort at my leggings, I was going to be forced to get loud, and I didn't like getting loud.But it wasn't Christina I heard at the front of the store.Instead, a very familiar voice said, ""No, no, I'm looking for something very particular. Oh, wait, I just saw it.""I turned around.Cole St. Clair smiled lazily at me.I gave so many damns at once that it actually hurt.***This is the passage that started me smiling, and I really did not stop until several hours after closing the book. If ever a pair of ruthless protagonists launched a full-scale assault on my emotions, Cole & Isabel are the ones. And just as I was hoping it would be, it was so crazy good to be back in their presence and to just listen to them snipe at each other and put an icily blank (Isabel) or dazzlingly jaded (Cole) face on things. The bright and shameless L.A. setting proved to be such a solid change-up for Stiefvater and the rest of the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. Gone are the freezing temperatures, wooded forests, and quiet ennui of Minnesota. Bring on the baking sun and the sand and the concrete jungle that barely masks too many emotions, too much energy and life being shoved and sculpted into ill-fitting, empty boxes. They are both so strong in this book, Cole & Isabel. The signature alternating POV chapters sing with the distilled and chilled 100-proof vodka that runs in their veins in the place of warm blood. What's more, every side character worked for me, from Isabel's psychotically domestic cousin Sofia to Cole's clear-eyed ex-bass player Jeremy and his hilariously deadpan driver Leon. It was good to be somewhere new with new faces and new threats. The entire paranormal side of this series was notably dialed down in favor of the more human element. Sometimes Cole is a wolf. Sometimes he chooses to become one in lieu of shooting some other form of oblivion up his arm. Sometimes these two facts make Isabel want to murder someone. Preferably him. And that's it. These things are real. But more real, more tantalizing, is the possibility that if they could each just stop killing themselves trying to prove they don't give a damn—just for a minute—they might find a space in which the pain is held at bay. And the hope of that minute, that swoony, devastating minute of peace that could turn into two minutes and then an hour and then a kind of life worth something? That's worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100GRANFCOIMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545654572#wasThisHelpful","R100GRANFCOIMP","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again I surface from a haze of mandatory rereading of each and every one of my favorite parts in the previous two novels in the Raven Cycle to write this review of the third and latest installment. I finished Blue Lily, Lily Blue and lay awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, seeing nothing but the quicksilver leaves of Cabeswater, hearing nothing but Adam's soft drawl over the tune of Ronan's inappropriate Irish jigs, and tasting nothing but mint on my tongue. It's a heady experience giving yourself over to one of Maggie's novels and not a decision to be taken lightly. Knowing that she persists in ending each book on a teaser (of sorts), I prepared myself for the worst (though I know she's really saving that for the fourth and final book). And, as ever, as the whole thing crashes to its temporary conclusion, some threads are flung far and wide even as others (the core ones) tighten their hold, both on each other and on me.Warning: this is the third book in a quartet. I shall attempt to minimize the spoilers. But not at the expense of THE FEELINGS. As Ronan might say, Vos admonitos.Given her druthers, Blue Sargent would eat yogurt for every meal. She would grow a handful of inches taller. And she would spend each and every day with the boys. And while her mother disapproves of at least two of those three choices, her mother is not around anymore. To put too fine a point on it, Maura has up and disappeared. And the women of 300 Fox Way are at a loss as to know exactly what to do to fetch her back. And so Blue eats her yogurt. And she bemoans her diminutive height. And she spends as many and as much of her days as possible hunting with Gansey, Ronan, Adam, and Noah. And all the while she quietly tries to will her mother back before the nameless evil that threatens to awaken does just that. Meanwhile, Adam is holding tightly to every shred of sanity and temper he possesses in order to mend his fences with Gansey, continue to heal Cabeswater as needed, and come to terms with his role in the group and in the grander scheme of the search for Glendower. And in many respects his work is rewarded with greater clarity on several fronts. Ronan Lynch continues to live with every one of his secrets (and to be keeper of a not insignificant portion of my heart). And Noah . . . vacillates . . . as only Noah can. To say nothing of the Gray Man's adopted quest, Calla's fiercely protective eye, Persephone's training of Adam, and Gansey's sometime mentor calling for tea. More threads are added to the weft with every step of this penultimate tale.***""You can be just friends with people, you know,"" Orla said. ""I think it's crazy how you're in love with all those raven boys.""Orla wasn't wrong, of course. But what she didn't realize about Blue and her boys was that they were all in love with one another. She was no less obsessed with them than they were with her, or one another, analyzing every conversation and gesture, drawing out every joke into a longer and longer running gag, spending each moment either with one another or thinking about when next they would be with one another. Blue was perfectly aware that it was possible to have a friendship that wasn't all-encompassing, that wasn't blinding, deafening, maddening, quickening. It was just that now that she'd had this kind, she didn't want the other.***In the words of Whitman, ""We were together. I forget the rest."" This is precisely how I feel whenever I sit back down with Blue and her Raven Boys. Okay. We're together now. Everything else can fall away. I love how, despite Maura's absence, everyone felt less alone to me in this one than they did in the last. In Blue Lily, Lily Blue, three books in, they genuinely have each other. Even more importantly, they acknowledge that they have each other and just how much that means. Sometimes, in the case of Ronan, they acknowledge it in remorseless and epithetical Latin. Sometimes, in the case of Adam, in the minutest acceptance of an unexpected kindness. And sometimes, in the case of Gansey and Blue, only in the most glancing and breath-holding of looks or moments, drifting along the tenuous line of a telephone. But acknowledge it and rely upon it they do. And that seemingly simple step goes miles and miles to shoring up a few of this reader's myriad anxieties. The trust and surety that previously extended unilaterally here and there within the group expand in this volume to each relationship, in every combination. They find themselves reaching out, across status and gender and ley lines. And, as a result, Gansey (who has arguably been the most alone of all these kids who have been so very alone) is no longer quite so internally isolated. And the same goes for each of the magnificent individuals he has gathered around him. With all dark things looming ahead of them, this one change felt vastly important to me. And dark things do loom ahead. So dark at times it is difficult not to flinch. But there is always the glorious light to match the darkness—the lightning humor in Gansey's eyes, in Ronan's laugh, and on Blue's tongue.***Sometimes, Gansey forgot how much he liked school and how good he was at it. But he couldn't forget it on mornings like this one—fall fog rising out of the fields and lifting in front of the mountains, the Pig running cool and loud, Ronan climbing out of the passenger seat and knocking knuckles on the roof with teeth flashing, dewy grass misting the black toes of his shoes, bag slung over his blazer, narrow-eyed Adam bumping fists as they met on the sidewalk, boys around them laughing and calling to one another, making space for the three of them because this had been a thing for so long: Gansey-Lynch-Parrish.***This thing. Oh, this thing. The three of them. The five of them. The quest for the sleeping king. It's just that I love them, you know? I love that we get the sure sense they were going on before us and that they will continue on without us after the fourth book comes to a close. As for that close, we shall not speak of it. For I am full to the brim of fears and awful premonitions. As such, I plan on tucking myself away at 300 Fox Way until next October. Just to be safe. Safe as life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SX46TLMAA55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545424968#wasThisHelpful","R28SX46TLMAA55","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, that cover. I love everything about that cover. And, as such, deciding whether or not to read Jackaby involved me sitting on my hands, dithering about whether or not the insides would match the outsides. As I am wont to do. But the truth is the mash-up of historical fantasy and the Doctor Who-meets-Sherlock Holmes teaser made it no kind of question at all as to whether or not I'd be picking it up. This is William Ritter's debut novel and the first in a series (happy day) as the ending clearly indicates. I picked it up a few weeks back on vacation and read it through in one big swallow. And while my body may have been sitting on the beach, my mind was far away tramping down a cold, winter street in New Fiddleham. The whole experience was deliciously dark and dreary. Of course, it was also ineluctably charming and smart. Which is to say I didn't stand a chance and cannot wait for the next one to come out.The year is 1892. The place: New England. Abigail Rook has fled her staid life. Leaving her disbelieving parents behind in England, she has sailed to the new world, specifically to the dockside town of New Fiddleham in search of . . . she knows not what. Gifted with the ability to parse the importance of ordinary details, she is sure that with a little fortitude (and a lot of luck), she will be able to make a place for herself in this unfamiliar clime. And it turns out, she's right. Her first night in town, she runs across an extraordinary personage who appears to carry an unholy amount of bits and bobs on his person and who goes by the unlikely moniker of R.F. Jackaby. Jackaby, it turns out, is a private investigator of the unusual variety. He takes cases that involve the inexplicable, the paranormal, the ones that regularly stymie the local constabulary. Stumbling into Jackaby's latest case, Abigail is intrigued and finds herself following the odd man home and inserting herself into his daily routine as an investigative assistant. She is, of course, not the first to fill that role (the fate of the last one remains a bit murky) and she fears she will not be the last. But for the present, she can think of nothing else she would rather be doing. And so the two are off as they trace the footsteps of an increasingly erratic serial killer.Abigail and Jackaby are immediate magic. I say that acknowledging that there is not a romantic note between them, though there are a couple of jokes along that vein and their reactions are priceless. There is a lovely hint of romantic potential for Abigail and a certain young detective who is not as disbelieving in Jackaby's ability as his supervisors are. But the hint dances around, remaining in the realm of potential for this volume at least. And that is all to the good, because this entertaining and absorbing debut is a charming and twisty mystery at heart. Chock full of Celtic mythology and regularly terrifying glimpses of the macabre, Jackaby is a recipe for a ripping good romp. I loved how excellently Abigail and Jackaby complemented each other and how quietly but firmly they came to respect and care for one another as colleagues and as accomplices (only when the occasion required, of course). Every scene that features them rambling around Jackaby's home is a delight, as the house itself constitutes one of my favorite characters. The hysterical fate of Jackaby's former assistant, along with the mysterious and heretofore lonely fates of a few of his other lodgers captured my affections. I know why Jackaby chose Abigail, but I was so pleased Abigail chose him. They needed each other. Their enjoyable banter and madcap dashes through the seedy underbelly of New Fiddleham kept me on my toes all the way to the exciting conclusion. As I believe a good book never reveals all its secrets, I know there is much more just waiting to unfurl in the sequel. I am all anticipation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XZQC057LN4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616203536#wasThisHelpful","R21XZQC057LN4X","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe I had heard the title of this Victorian mystery bandied about some and never did chase it down on account of the title itself. Something to do with a proliferation of the so-and-so's wife titles at the time, I would imagine. But. I'm so very glad I listened to a friend and gave it a shot. Anna Lee Huber's series (which stands at three novels at the present time with a fourth due out this summer) is excellent. As you might have guessed, this series is a straight shot for you Deanna Raybourn and Tasha Alexander fans out there. While the Lady Julia Grey series is a touch more dramatic and the Lady Emily Ashton one quite a bit lighter, Kiera Darby is compelling entirely on her own merits and I can't wait to further my exploits with her in future installments.Lady Kiera Darby wants only to hide away and lick her wounds. Gone to her sister's estate in Scotland to recuperate from the tumultuous events of her husband's death and her own criminal trial, Kiera takes refuge in her painting and in the satisfactory distance she's finally put between herself and the prying eyes of London society. Unfortunately, her well-meaning sister and brother-in-law have planned a house party and invited some of the very elite members of society she so longs to escape. Knowing what they think of her and her role (albeit unwilling) in her husband's distasteful profession, each day becomes an endless struggle. But when a murder takes place on the premises, Kiera's skill is called upon by private inquiry agent Sebastian Gage. At first put off by Gage's somewhat pedestrian talent and clear suspicion of her, Lady Darby is reluctant to pursue the increasingly disturbing events at the estate. But determined to prove her own innocence, she concedes to work with Gage and the two fall into a competent and intriguing partnership.How I love Kiera. I love that the story opens after the horrible spectacle has taken place. The whole opening has an exhausted, almost gun shy feel to it as we come to know Kiera and gradually find out just what led to her ostracizing from society and the slow death she suffered at the hands of the most indifferent and cruel of husbands. The entirety of The Anatomist's Wife is quiet. In the best sense. Quietly affecting. Quietly horrific. Quietly strong and hopeful. I was immediately fond of it and its occupants. Which brings us to Gage. I found him engaging (forgive me) from the beginning, though he does initially come off a bit of the fop to both Kiera and the reader. While unerringly confident, he doesn't ooze brooding arrogance in quite the same way that others of his ilk do. I wasn't sure which way the wind would blow with Gage. But I appreciated the healthy dose of skepticism that flourished between he and Kiera. And I unquestionably relished the accompanying slow, slow burn as their eyes were opened to how effective they could be as an investigative team, as well as how close they were growing as friends. Such partners they were. Such kindred spirits. I am with them. To the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NHBMCCU3DXCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EXNOZI#wasThisHelpful","R3NHBMCCU3DXCO","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this book up for one reason and one reason only—because Sarah MacLean recommended it as one of her top historicals ever, like ever. Apparently, that's all it takes for me when it comes from the lady who gave us Callie and Ralston. This was my first of Lisa Kleypas' historicals. Having read and been mildly okay with one of her contemporaries and read and absolutely loved one of her others, I figured the wind could reasonably be expected to blow any number of ways with The Devil in Winter. Some authors transition beautifully from one genre/time period to another. Others, I feel, face more of an uphill battle. Spoiler alert: Ms. Kleypas appears to know her way around whichever she feels like tackling at the time. I will say that I initially read a library copy and held off on purchasing my own because I was not fond of the U.S. cover. So much lavender. I can't . . . with just so much lavender. But then. The UK cover waltzed onto the scene. With Evie standing in the snow. Just . . . looking. It is everything the book deserves and it, of course, had to be mine.Evangeline Jenner has summoned what remains of her flagging courage and made a command decision. Said decision involves sneaking into the home of vaunted rake Sebastian St. Vincent and demanding he run off to Gretna Green with her to be married before her hideous relatives can stash her in a closet and force her to marry her cousin, thereby gaining control of her dying father's gambling money. (Did that last sentence put a silly grin on anyone else's face? Just me?) Having been beaten down and pushed aside her entire life, Evie just wants to be free. If a loveless marriage to a known dissolute is what it takes, she will gladly pay the price. St. Vincent will get the money he so desperately needs to pay his father's debts and the two can happily live the rest of their lives separately. After his initial amusement and disbelief at the shy wallflower's proposal, the wayward viscount finds himself accepting and the two of them go haring off for parts north as fast as possible before anyone can say them nay. Before either of them know it, the marriage has been solemnized and it's back to London and the grim reality of bidding farewell to Evie's father along with the unexpectedly complicated feelings they experience in the face of the prospect of going their separate ways.The Devil in Winter has one hell of a beginning and that's all there is to it. Talk about hook, line, and sinker. I fell in love with Evie almost with her first exhalation. What a sad and dim life she led leading up to the moment she felt forced to go to St. Vincent with an offer she wouldn't let him refuse. And how I liked her for the way she faced him down and stutteringly told him the way things were going down. As for Sebastian, I grew to like him quickly for how quickly he grew to like Evie. For his wicked wit and hilariously cavalier attitude toward life and the ton. And for the appalled look on his face when he realizes he might . . . he just might be falling in love with his wife. It was a pleasure watching Evie's shoulders slowly relax while in Sebastian's company, just as it was a treat watching that very attitude of his grow less and less cavalier when it came to his wife and the altered way he saw the world as a husband. So very much against his will. But there it is. The story did bobble just a bit for me back in London as the two take up residence in Jenner's gambling hell and I felt things veering a touch close to the shallow. But the ship rights itself soon enough as they stumble up against each other's expectations and the scars (in Evie's case) and indiscretions (in Sebastian's) of their respective pasts. This was helped along by Kleypas' uncanny knack for suddenly and unceremoniously shoving the two of them in a hallway or billiard hall or sick room at just the right moment so they could sort themselves out. I'm ever so fond of them, Evie and Sebastian. I will always be glad they came to stay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSQYMS4LCXBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKRDI#wasThisHelpful","R1TSQYMS4LCXBM","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This label maker is superb! I've been using a Brother P-touch 1000 for several years, and it's worked fine, but I didn't realize what I was missing! The Epson is designed for to be used by someone who makes a lot of labels. It's auto cut feature eliminates tape waste by cutting the label right next to the text (my Brother would have a long leader of blank tape that you then had to cut off and throw away). I love that you can simply pop the tape cartridge out and replace it anytime with a different type of tape. I've used several different tapes now and they all work so well! Florescent tape for labeling the kids backpacks for school, I labeled a bunch of wired around my home entertainment system with the excellent ""cable wrap"" labels. And we wrapped some presents and labeled them with the lovely ""ribbon"" label. This endless flexibility makes the LW-700 a very useful creative tool, if you are inclined to use it. From a build quality and feature set perspective this printer has nothing to complain about. It's well made and well laid out. I was printing labels and within 3 minutes of cracking open the box, and had no issues whatsoever. I really like that this printer can be plugged in and that the adapter is included. The PC interface is also a welcome feature if you plan do make more sophisticated multi-line lables.All in all there is nothing I can say against this excellent product.

"I struggled with this one. It starts off with the most charming of bangs. And it was nothing short of a giddy revelation when I realized that the protagonist, Poppy, has a connection with the Marches of Lady Julia Grey fame. I adore that family something fierce. And when it became clear who she was, I settled in for a a meeting of the minds with old and new friends alike. The whole thing smacked of fun and intrigue. But Raybourn's standalones often falter for me, for some reason. They arrange themselves beautifully in the beginning and then wind up feeling like work, despite the ever-lovely writing. The characterizations feel more slapdash than I am used to from her Julia Grey series and I frequently have trouble falling as deeply in love with the leads as I would like, or rather, as I feel I need to in order to follow them across the world and in and out of scrapes and each other's pockets. In this case, there was more than enough material for some really excellent depth and emotion, but we were caught up and flung wide on the mystery trail far too quickly. The trail became the point and I, personally, mourned the unexplored internal conflicts as those enticing veneers remained unscratched.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBN2SLH78VFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317757#wasThisHelpful","R1IBN2SLH78VFR","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am pleased with this 14-piece Faberware set. The four different pot sizes are such a nice addition to the few pots I already had, and I now use each of them on a weekly basis. They are easy to handle, lift, and move, and they clean up easily and nicely both in the sink and in the dishwasher. Food cooks evenly and they stack cleanly and compactly in my cupboard.

"My love for Diana Peterfreund's Secret Society Girl novels led me to this book. The thing is, those are my kind of New Adult novels. And I think I've been sort of quietly looking for more in that vein ever since. And then a couple of months ago I ran across Diana enthusiastically recommending a new series for fans of the SSG books. It's called the Ivy Years series and it is written by Sarina Bowen. Needless to say, I investigated further. When I found out the books were also sports-related, I said to the internet, Say no more, internet. You have my attention. And that night I jumped in and started the first book—The Year We Fell Down (which, by the way, such a great title)—and I thoroughly enjoyed Bowen's easy style, down to Earth characters (well, most of time, I'm looking at you Hartley), and the fabulous college setting. So when the second book came out, I was all set to dive right back into life at Harkness, particularly when I heard it featured Bridger—a character from the first book who I really liked but who I had more than few concerns about.Bridger McCaulley's life does not resemble what it used to be. Not that it's ever been easy, but there was a period there where he worried . . . less . . . and partied more. And he played hockey like nobody's business. Those days are gone now that he's wholly responsible for his little sister. And it doesn't help matters that it's all on the down low since child protective services would have a heyday if they knew a college hockey star was hiding a little girl away in his dorm room. Scarlet Crowley's life also altered suddenly and irrevocably and for the worse. She's come to Harkness to escape as many of her problems as possible, starting by enrolling under a different name in order to stave off as much of the media as possible. When the truth about her father's charity was made public, the life she led became impossible and she hopes distance from her parents and her father's crimes will allow her to build her own life. When the two meet, sparks fly, but they agree not to take things any further than study dates in the cafeteria. Bridger has no time to speak of and a pack of responsibilities weighing him down to the ground. Scarlet fears discovery and the look on Bridger's face were he ever to find out the kind of family she comes from. But it proves to be difficult for each of them to give up that regular human contact again. With someone who might just understand.As I said, I enjoyed (my impatience with Hartley aside) most everything about the first book in the series. But I loved everything about The Year We Hid Away. How lovely a thing it is when you get to know a previously secondary character better only to find out they were exactly who you were hoping they would be all along. Getting to know Bridger was just such an experience. There was so much more to him than his escapades the year before led you to believe, and every one of those added layers made him an infinitely sympathetic character. He is crazy strong, is Bridger. And determined to go it alone, if just to adequately protect his little sister Lucy from additional disappointment and pain. He rightly judges she has suffered enough. But then so has he. And it takes Scarlet entering his tightly closed off life to see that and know how to help. It was so interesting watching these two hockey players interact while on enforced hiatuses from the sport they love. In fact, one of my favorite aspects of this story is the equal treatment the two protagonists get. Their stories, their histories, they are equally valued and play appropriately weighty roles in their present. They are not just back stories, but fleshed out narratives explaining the way they are, the challenges they live with. And they fold so seamlessly into the force bringing and holding them together. An early encounter snippet:***""You never say very much about Miami Beach,"" Bridger said as we lingered over our coffee. ""Or your family.""I didn't bother to hide my flinch. ""Miami Beach is the best. My family . . . not so much. I don't really talk about them. It isn't a nice story."" The truth was, I didn't want to lie any more than necessary to those deep green eyes.Bridger's face flashed with sympathy. ""Okay. It's exactly the same for me, but I didn't expect that. Because you look like someone from a family with a nice story.""""And you don't?"" I countered.He put one hand on his own cheek and covered mine with his other. ""You make a good point. Maybe there's no look. I should probably stop thinking that everyone else in this room has it easier than me.""I turned my head, and together we both scanned the laughing, eating, bustle that was the student center at noon. It sure looked happy out there. For just a moment, I was a goalie again, analyzing the play, scouting for trouble.""Nah,"" I said finally, turning back to Bridger. ""I still think most of them have it pretty good.""Bridger grinned. ""This is the cynical table,"" he said, tapping his fingertip on the wood grain.""Party of two,"" I agreed.***Their Tuesday and Thursday lunch/study dates never failed to bring a smile to my face. And the natural and seemingly inevitable way they grew into a relationship with a healthy amount of depth kept the smile upon my face. They are able to take a breather of sorts and step away from being self-conscious when they're together. It feels like a reprieve, doled out in careful doses. No wonder they look to increase those doses. I also appreciated the way Bowen handles the ""finding out"" of the respective pasts. It was a recipe for maturity while still paying tribute to their actual ages and the extent of their life experiences. As is the case with the best romances, I am so very glad they found each other. As for myself, I am so very happy to have found a fresh voice in the new adult genre.

"I wanted to love this book, but I found myself unable to connect with the characters on any meaningful level. Girl Defective is quirky and off beat in the best kind of way, but its determined lack of focus keeps all the disparate elements from coming together. Sky, her wayward father, her adorable secret agent of a little brother Gully, her dubious friend Nancy, and her father's new employee Luke are each intriguing in their own way. But I felt they were cheated a bit of their potential to shine as individual and full-fledged characters. The slightly odd inclusion of the mystery also felt a bit off, as well as the link Sky feels with the dead girl, as neither was integrated enough to shed light on Sky or the secondary cast. Aussie YA is a veritable gold mine in general, but this one was a miss for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2972TFK5OT5DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442497602#wasThisHelpful","R2972TFK5OT5DO","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not know how Cassie Alexander manages to serve up two installments in her wonderful Edie Spence series each year, but I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Please to be continuing in this vein, Ms. Alexander! Because this series just gets better and better. And finishing SHAPESHIFTED knowing I still have Deadshifted to look forward to at the end of this year just fills me with both gratitude and excitement. I worry about my favorite urban fantasy heroines. I worry. I am frequently forced to be away from them at times when I would really rather not leave. And when it comes to Edie, that was getting to be pretty much all the time. Her life was fairly decently fractured at the end of the last book. I wasn't sure how she would cope with the enforced changes, and I wondered how long she would spend on the outside once things started up again in the new book. The questions that occupy my mind, you guys. You wouldn't know it to look at me, but it's a cacophony in here. So when SHAPESHIFTED landed on my doorstep, I spent next to no time at all clearing my night (and my TBR) in order to dive right in.No one believes Edie's story. Not that she's talking that much. She is seeing a therapist to try to deal with the . . . issues . . . that plague her. But even her therapist's open mind isn't wide enough to fit the host of supernatural creatures that make up her day-to-day life. Or at least that used to. Having been effectively shunned by the Creepy Crawly Community at large (and having lost her job at their hands), Edie is understandably finding it difficult to move on. Grasping at the ropes of her old life, she begins searching for work in a less hostile environment. The trouble is--after spending that long living on a constant surge of adrenalin, the sleep clinic she's temping for just is not holding her attention. At all. And so when an opportunity at an underfunded inner city clinic arises, she jumps at the chance. The weird thing is that, even though he hired her, the new boss doesn't seem to want her around much. To say nothing of the skeleton staff who openly scorn her ability to hack it in her new environment. And it does appear that she's landed in very much the wrong part of town when it comes to health. Vampire gang wars rule this section of the city, and old grudges die hard. A mysterious local deity known as Santa Muerte seems to have an unusual control over the poor denizens of the city, and everyone walks in fear of the unknown. No stranger to fear, Edie plunges into the chaos, determined to find answers to several of her most burning questions.""I just wasn't good at keeping track of people. The fact that no one ever seemed to keep track of me either was not lost on me.""It's quiet observations such as this one that make my heart hurt for Edie. They seem to form the rails on which she runs. They're also why I love her so darn much. She can be blindingly frank and impossibly cagey all in the same breath. When faced with a steaming pile of crap (which is oftener than she would like), she calls shenanigans.""I'm confused--do you want me to be incredibly honorable and report you to authorities and not get hired? Or do you want me to be useful, morally hazy, and gainfully employed? Because, personally? I like the one where I wind up with a job.""And so I find myself grinning and grimacing in equal measure while following her exploits. Similar to my beloved Kate Daniels series, the world Edie inhabits is . . . messy. People die in the most undignified of ways. Monsters (both human and otherwise) stalk the dark alleyways. And no one is glossy or polished by a long shot. Even the smoothest of shifters, as we find out in this volume, run up against walls they cannot scale. And so while Edie is flawed and eminently breakable, so are the shifting, swirling creatures around her. It makes for an equity I find monumentally appealing (and often missing in paranormals at large). I did wonder a little at first at the meandering buildup in this one. Pleased to see a familiar face here and there, the new ones took up a lot of page time and I wasn't sure how attached I was willing to get. But I soon began to appreciate the myriad threads being woven together, and when a turn I didn't see coming presented itself in all its sudden glory, I gasped aloud (sending DH into a fit of snickers). It was a good turn. And it was pretty much Point of No Return from that moment on. The marvelous climaxes and denouements in this series impress the hell out of me. This one, in particular, had me holding my breath for the outcome I discovered I wanted so badly. When it comes to urban fantasy, I want to feel all the feelings and I want them close to the vest while I feel them. It's a tall order, I know. But Cassie Alexander knows what's up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DK0204PW9GJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312553412#wasThisHelpful","R2DK0204PW9GJO","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will admit, I liked the cover of Allison Parr's debut novel RUSH ME right off the bat when I first saw it floating around the blogosphere. I could tell it was going to be marketed new adult as soon as I saw it, and that's probably a marketing win right there. But the reason I liked it was because everything I knew about the book seemed to come together in the cover. The bold stripes of color and the font work really well for this sports romance. I particularly liked the colors set across the black and white photo, and that the couple was sort of naturally or ordinarily presented (and attired). It was both a relief and an eye-catcher, if you will. I still waffled back and forth a bit on picking it up until I read Li's review over at Me and My Books. In it, she compared it to another new adult title she'd read and found this one to be decidedly preferred. And so that (and the extremely attractive price) was all it took to push me over the edge from waffling to buying.Rachael can't seem to gain any traction. She took the unpaid internship with a small-ish publishing house in the hopes that it would open doors to a career in the industry. But it seems she's just biding her time, blowing through her savings, not getting anywhere. The same could be said for her love live, or lack thereof. These days the only kind of social life she engages in is when her roommate Eva drags her out with her gaggle of fellow theater friends. Which is how Rachael finds herself one night in the wrong apartment at the wrong party. Surrounded by a host of men too brawny and women too clingy to be Eva's crowd, she realizes she's crashed some sort of sports-related party or other. Infinitely outside her comfort zone, she attempts to beat a path out of there. Unfortunately, said path is barred by a couple of bruisers who assume she's just another in a long line of groupies. The situation devolves from there. Utterly disgusted, she walks out without her scarf. And it's a nice enough scarf that she's forced to return to retrieve it. And wouldn't you know in the cold light of day, some of those big, bad football players don't look all that big and bad. They invite her in. They're interested in what she has to say. All but Ryan Carter. The star quarterback is convinced she's there for one reason and one reason only. He wants her gone in no uncertain terms. But by the time he makes his opinion known, the team has already sort of adopted her. And perhaps most surprising of all, Rachael finds herself . . . wanting to stay.I love a good prickly protagonist. Or two. Together, Rachael and Ryan are definitely the kind of stiff, stubborn immovable forces I love. Plenty of push and pull (and swoon) for your buck. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting going into RUSH ME, but what I got was more substantial and enjoyable from the word go. These characters possessed fully developed lives and, happily, all the different aspects of those lives made appearances on the page. The palpable presence of family, education, co-workers, teammates, and religion helped me construct a vision of people I could love, who could love each other, despite their very normal, very real fears and the miles of vastly different experiences separating them. I've never lived in Manhattan, but I've visited several times over the years, and I thoroughly enjoyed living inside Rachael's Manhattan for the duration of this book. Her observations and insights about the people and places around her held my attention. While she may have struggled discerning the motivations of some key players in her life, her point of view felt continually real to me. Here, a favorite passage that immediately landed me right at her side:""The room's centerpiece, a seven-tiered fountain, obscured the flock. Bubbly champagne frothed downward as waiters reached out to catch the golden ambrosia. They circulated through the room with their balanced platters, passing by women in long gowns and men in black jackets. Murmured voices were underlain by the slightest whisper of classical music. Precious stones winked in earrings and cuff links, and guests appraised each other from behind their champagne flutes. A young woman in a red dress tossed a flirtatious glance at a young man on an older lady's arm, while two men huddled together in the shadows, trading secrets over empty glasses. People touched and parted, a dance of consequence, as everyone tried to break into circles higher than their own.""It was a pleasure accompanying her through that dance of consequence, especially as she got to know Ryan and the team and was able to see her city and its people in an entirely new way. It was another pleasure absorbing the wry humor of this story. A quick exchange between Rachael and her roommate:***""Ryan Carter wants to have dinner with me on Friday. And like a dozen other people. But still."" I collapsed onto the sofa and kicked off my shoes.Eva frowned. ""But aren't you in a fight?""""Yes. I don't know. Is this a really bad idea? Apparently he suggested it.""Eva's grin broadened and her dark eyes twinkled. She peeled off the rubber dish gloves and dropped down next to me on the sagging cushions. ""I think it's a great idea.""""But what if he's a Wickham?""She shrugged. ""Maybe you're a Lydia.""I shuddered. ""Don't say such things."" Lydia might have caught Wickham in the end, but she was still vain and flippant and unlikeable. ""I want to be Elizabeth.""Eva gave me a look.""Fine."" My head dropped against the back of the couch. ""I'm a Jane. I'm a Jane, okay?"" The staid older sister.""There's nothing wrong with being a Jane.""""That's what the Elizabeths always say,"" I muttered darkly.***What can I say? I appreciate a quietly tossed in Pride and Prejudice moment. In fact, I appreciated everything about this sweet, surprisingly grounded story of opposites attracting against a backdrop of professional football and the big city.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39J76Q7MM29O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APEXMJM#wasThisHelpful","R39J76Q7MM29O7","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I actually read Samantha Young's debut contemporary romance On Dublin Street quite awhile ago. And then I just never reviewed it. It may have simply gotten lost in the shuffle or I got distracted by some shiny object or what have you. The thing is, I enjoyed it fine. It lingered around the edges of my consciousness enough that I was looking forward to the sequel and immediately purchased a copy upon its release earlier this month. DOWN LONDON ROAD takes place not long after the events of On Dublin Street and focuses on Joss' friend and co-worker Johanna. I wasn't sure what to expect going in, given that Johanna was not the most sympathetic of characters in the first book. But I'm coming to learn that those somewhat acerbic, occasionally deceptively simple side characters often come into their own with a vengeance when it's their turn in the spotlight. And I so love it when that happens. I was also awfully eager to return to the setting itself. I didn't get to spend as long as I'd have liked when I was in Edinburgh and I've longed to go back ever since. Happily, reading these books sent me straight back to wandering those same streets, ducking in and out of cafés, and generally soaking it all up.Jo Walker has perfected the art of keeping all her balls in the air. From a young age, she's been the responsible one in her family (and I use the term ""family"" very loosely). Having bid good riddance to her deadbeat dad, Jo supports her alcoholic mum, her teenage brother Cole, and herself secretarying by day, bartending by night, and professionally girlfriending both day and night. Ever since the day she realized she could attract rich older men, she's taken that role seriously. And she's never been without a sugar daddy for long. The lives of three people depend upon it, in fact. And so while she never stays in a dead end relationship and she always chooses her partners with the utmost care, she's also never really been in love. Money always trumps emotions when it comes to keeping food on the table, taking care of Cole, and ensuring that the blackness that touched her own life growing up never stretches out to mar his. And she's learned to be all right with it. Really, she has. But when she attends an art exhibition on the arm of her current boyfriend Malcolm and makes the acquaintance of one Cameron MacCabe, the sparks (both good and bad) that fly threaten to throw off her delicate juggling act. And when she winds up helping Cam out by putting in a good word for him at the bar where she works, Jo unwittingly sets in motion a series of events sure to get in the way of the safe, structured course she has all mapped out.I fell in love with Jo before I knew what had happened to me. Ms. Young proved to be exceedingly clever when it comes to her characterization of this steely young woman. Because I really did not care for her in the first book. But it turns out that I, like every other character present, was seeing her but not really seeing her. We all of us were only grasping the barest slice of what made up Johanna. Then all of a sudden, in this installment, I became privy to what was really going on behind the curtain. As Cameron later observes, this is one complex lady. And I loved her so very much. My heart broke over Jo (and Cole) over and over again as I watched them shoot for normal and miss by a mile. The demons in their past are dark and the ones in their present are little better. But, page after page, it was as though I could feel the strength in her spine, immutable and unwavering. I didn't wonder at Cameron falling in love with her. I only wondered that out of her long string of sophisticated, urbane boyfriends not one realized just exactly what he had. Though Jo does have self-preservation down pat, and that includes a rather alarmingly efficient smoothing away of anything that could be perceived as a flaw to potential providers. Which is why Cameron presents such a problem. Essentially the polar opposite of a potential provider, he is out of work and entirely unsophisticated and urbane. At least that's how he appears, with his laid back manner and his unusual tattoos. Yeah, I didn't wonder at Jo's feelings for Cam either. I just wondered if she would ever let loose her choke hold on security long enough to figure out what they meant. The thing is--and this is important--I wouldn't have blamed her if she hadn't. That's how much I loved Jo. I wanted them to be together so badly, and yet I would have understood if she'd passed in favor of saving Cole (and herself) more pain and fear and want. And I just want to give Samantha Young all the rounds of applause for so brilliantly keeping the focus on her heroine. Everything else was secondary, beautiful--but secondary. A short, sweet favorite moment:""When you first tore me a new one, I wanted to know you. And when I got to know you, when I stood across a kitchen and you told me not to kill a spider because it didn't say much for us as a species if we killed something because we feared it, I knew.""I'm not saying who says it and I'm not saying who they say it to. All I am saying is--it's a good scene. This entire book is made up of good scenes, complex and nuanced characters, and one supremely encompassing romance. DOWN LONDON ROAD is the kind of contemporary romance you can sink your teeth into. I had an alarmingly good time reading it, and I will unquestioningly be back for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNIDCZPJI8KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419715#wasThisHelpful","R3HNIDCZPJI8KT","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It doesn't happen very often in life, that utterly unexpected sequel that drops in your lap years after the original book came out. Most of the time, you discover series you love and blow through them at lightning speed and then are left to pick up the shattered pieces of yourself when the whole glorious thing is over. Or you stumble across gold with the very first book and are forced to not-so-patiently wait one year (or more) for each new installment. But occasionally an author hits you with one out of left field. I first read and adored A Certain Slant of Light not too long after it was published in 2006. It felt like a perfectly contained standalone novel to me at the time. And it still is. If you only read that one, you will be left content. But there are a couple of . . . I hesitate to call them side characters . . . that you certainly would not object to spending more time with, if you know what I mean (series addicts: I know you know what I mean.) So when I discovered that Laura Whitcomb was writing a companion novel (sequel of sorts) told from one of those character's perspectives, well. I was more than okay with it.Jenny is not okay. Having returned to her body after unexpectedly vacating it for a period of time, she has no real recollection of what happened in the interim. All she knows is that she was . . . gone . . . for awhile. And when she came back, there was a boy who seemed to know her but not know her. Billy held in his hand a Polaroid of the two of them together. They looked happy. They looked like they belonged together. And yet Jenny and Billy do not know each other. They don't have the kind of shared memories that the photograph suggests. Instead, what they have is a disturbingly similar (if different in the details) history of shame, painful family issues, and a longing for escape. And, as it turns out, Billy was gone for awhile, too. What they begin to discover is that a fair bit happened while they were away. And one of the presences involved is not through involving herself in their lives. Meanwhile, real life has gone on around them. Jenny's father has moved out and is threatening (as he always has) to control everything about her life. Billy's brother is suspicious (as he always is) of his little brother's activities. The two lost teens attempt to get to know one another and, perhaps, puzzle out their bizarre connection. But it seems the ramifications of the events they have no memory of will impede their fledgling attempts and impact their presents in very real and unsettling ways.""And that's where every ghost story begins, with a death.""Laura Whitcomb uses all her words and that is all there is to it. It was so comforting (and not a little emotional) to be back inside the beautiful canopy of language she creates. Somehow she manages to return us to that absolutely unique atmosphere evoked in A Certain Slant of Light, and it is as though we were never away. Helen is a point of view character this time around as well, and it was easy to fall back into the cadence of her thoughts. But since I felt her story resolved nicely in the last book, Jenny was the one I really wanted to be with. So it proved to be somewhat of a distraction when Helen's presence in the story occasionally threatened to overwhelm Jenny's. I fully understood her preoccupation with Jenny's fate, but I could have done with a little less from her directly. Because when Helen fades into the background and allows us an unfettered view of Jenny and Billy together . . . it is magnetic. As in the final chapter of A Certain Slant of Light, the bond between these two is breathtakingly tentative. I would have followed them anywhere they wanted to go. And Whitcomb does take them places, beyond the boundaries of time and space, in fact. A favorite passage that takes place fairly early on and far, far away:***He swiped his fingers across our view of the sky, like he was flicking away a speck of dust or a drop of water, and the night surged forward. The stars, staying perfectly aligned, curved across the sky--time had sped into the future an hour.I gasped at this and grabbed his hand, pulling it back toward our bodies as if he might accidentally throw the earth off its rotation. The stars slowed again, appearing to have stopped.""How did you do that?"" I whispered.""I took us somewhere we hadn't been yet,"" he said. ""Forward in time.""He said it so matter-of-factly, but the idea made me shiver on the inside.""Just a little,"" he reassured me.""Thats . . . so cool."" I pointed at one particularly bright star and gave it a push with my fingertip in the air. The map of stars glided forward again, constellations staying aligned as they gracefully passed over us, not a long way, just a bit into the tail of the night, an hour or two closer to morning.He made a sound of alarm, a fake cry, and then laughed, ""Here."" He lifted his arm to mind, our hands together, our index fingers pointing up. As one, without saying aloud what we would do, we moved the stars a few minutes westward, then froze. ""Look what we can do together,"" he said.***And so while the story spends a rather unnecessary amount of time detailing Helen's anxieties and desires for her former host, it redeems itself by winding its way around again to the heart of this sequel--two shell-shocked and lonely young people who find each other and, in each other, hope.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I62PELTSL6H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547367546#wasThisHelpful","R3I62PELTSL6H9","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I realize I'm likely the last person to the table here, but I literally had not heard anything about it before I ran across it on a list of books a reviewer liked way more than she thought she would. What a happy list, right? Then I sifted through the almost overwhelmingly positive reactions from my Goodreads peeps and decided this book I would normally have been firmly on the fence about might actually be a book very much for me. I don't generally go in for survival stories. And May-December relationships work for me even less often than survival stories do. A novel that combines both seemed doomed to DNF status. But. I had a feeling. One of those good ones. Originally self-published by Tracey Garvis Graves, ON THE ISLAND was later picked up by Penguin. As far as the cover goes, I will simply say that I wish it reflected the harrowing nature of Anna's story a bit more.It wasn't what she wanted to do this summer. But it has to be better than sitting around at home making no forward progress at all. Which is exactly what she'd be doing if she stayed. Anna and her longtime boyfriend John have been rather pointedly not circling the issue of taking their relationship to the next level for years now, and Anna can't take it anymore. So she accepts the offer to tutor T.J. Callahan at his family's summer rental home in the Maldives. Seventeen-year-old T.J. is recovering from Hodgkin's lymphoma and is way behind in school. His parents set up this summer vacation to celebrate the remission of his cancer and to help him ease back into his former life again. And so the somewhat mutually reluctant Anna and T.J. board a plane to the Maldives to meet up with his parents and sisters who are already there. But when their pilot has a heart attack in mid-air, their plane goes down somewhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Injured and completely alone, the two of them manage to make it to a nearby island where they attempt to survive and somehow signal the searchers that must be out there looking for them. But as the days and weeks stretch on, it seems clear that any rescuers who might have been looking have given up by now.It shouldn't work. I mean, we all know what the inevitable is in such a situation, do we not? And it really shouldn't work. But somehow it just . . . does. Graves' writing is very straightforward and unadorned. Yet somehow that lack of pretension perfectly suits the starkness of Anna and T.J.'s situation. In fact, I thought the whole stranded on a desert island scenario was handled remarkably well. I had no trouble at all sinking into the monotony (and occasional terror) of their days. Both rather pragmatic, they develop into a strong team as they learn to do what they have to to survive, including everything from climbing trees to knock down unidentifiable fruit to dealing with injuries and building shelter. I confess, I drank it in. Nothing about their story feels rushed. And, as the years pass, it almost takes you by surprise how protective and fond of these characters you become. I appreciated the consistency with which Ms. Graves drew Anna and T.J. Perhaps most relieving of all is that they remain their ages. There is no romantic blurring of the lines between a thirty-year-old woman and a teenage boy on the cusp of manhood. The issue is always there throughout the entire book. And while the extremity and desperation of the circumstances do force their hands to a degree, that consistency and unrushed approach pays off in a big way when the inevitable eventually does happen. And that payoff sees you (and them) through the remainder of their story, which includes the unimaginable return to their lives that were and all the resistance and post-traumatic strain that entails. I didn't expect to harbor the feelings I do for this book. It has its flaws, to be sure. But I read it through in one sitting. The sweetness and openness that form its backbone are infectious, and I in no way regret the little piece of my heart it stole.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWEA5DH6PJKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014219672X#wasThisHelpful","R3PWEA5DH6PJKE","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel like contemporary YA and I are going through a rough patch. We're having trouble seeing eye to eye. We seem to be going in different directions. We don't want the same things anymore. Take your pick. I realize this is likely just an unfortunate string of mismatches, but after a little while it's hard not to take it personally, you know? So much good chatter surrounded today's release of Jessi Kirby's GOLDEN. Not having ready Kirby's previous two novels, I found myself curious about the fervor. Then I heard whispers of a decade-old unresolved mystery and something about Robert Frost and I was on board. Somewhat uninspiring Generic Sunlit Girl cover aside, I like that it doesn't lead the reader too much as to what to expect inside. That combined with my lack of knowledge of the author's work in general made it possible for me to go in with fairly untouched expectations. Which is always a nice thing.Parker Frost (yes, that Frost her father maintains) is on the cusp of greatness. She's ready to blow the Popsicle stand that is her small-town home and head off to Stanford for some real living. She's got Valedictorian status in her hip pocket. The only obstacle remaining between her and her dream is a scholarship speech. Knowing Parker, she can slap that puppy out in her sleep and still have time for coffee with her best friend Kat. But when her English teacher asks her to send out a stack of journals to his old students, she stumbles across something that might force her to throw all her carefully laid plans by the wayside. That something is the personal journal of Julianna Farnetti. Presumed dead (along with her longtime boyfriend Shane Cruz) in a violent car crash ten years ago, Julianna has achieved the status of local legend by now. But as Parker gives into temptation and reads the journal, she realizes that not everything in the young lovers' lives was as it seemed. And now, inexplicably, Parker finds herself on a mission to resolve their deaths and, just possibly along the way, find the answers to her own burgeoning questions about the life that she leads and the kind of person she wants to be.It started out well. I liked Parker fine. I liked the cute, somewhat fuzzily arrogant boy who seemed to have his eye on her. Though her best friend Kat immediately felt like the usual carboard cut-out, wilder than the heroine but with a heart of gold best friend that so frequently populates coming-of-age novels of this ilk, I figured as long as she didn't play too obnoxiously large of a role, we should be able to rub along tolerably well. Her mother was an irritatingly nebulous, overbearing presence in her life, but the mystery felt intriguing and, most of all, important to Parker. So I read on and found myself wanting to know more of Julianna and Shane and the mysterious Orion. Soon, I was far more interested in spending time within the pages of the journal than with the living, breathing teens in the present day who were fumbling to unravel the past. I had no trouble understanding Parker's preoccupation with Julianna's story, but I lost my preoccupation with Parker and hers. And since not all that much time is actually spent inside the pages of the journal, I found my emotions invested in the areas guaranteed to give me the least payoff. The boy (and his interest in Parker) never materialized, always shunted to the backseat. Kat did stay in the picture. And while I bought her affection for Parker, I longed for more depth between them. And then there is the title and the whole Robert Frost thing. And let me tell you, it is a Thing. Frost poems herald the start of each chapter, they run through Parker's head, they insinuate themselves into every fold and crevice of the story. And it was just too much for this reader, too much browbeating with the theme. I get it, Ponyboy. Nothing gold can stay. You've got to grasp life by the horns when you have the chance. I just don't respond well to the painfully earnest shoving of these truisms down my throat. I finished GOLDEN actually angry. Angry at my time spent with another undifferentiated, underdeveloped, well-meaning contemporary. There. Is that cantankerous enough for you? For what it's worth (and as is the trend lately), I am alone in my high dudgeon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L19K5RBFLX28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442452161#wasThisHelpful","R3L19K5RBFLX28","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever seen Out of Africa? It's this old Sydney Pollack film starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, and it is sort of loosely based on Isak Dinesen's (pseudonym of Danish author Karen Blixen) autobiographical book of the same name. It (and its soundtrack) was a staple in my house growing up, and when I first read the brief synopsis for Deanna Raybourn's latest standalone novel, A SPEAR OF SUMMER GRASS, it was literally the first thing that popped into my mind. They just sounded fairly similar what with the same setting, though the time period is a good decade later in Raybourn's novel than in Pollack's film. Since I have fond memories of the movie as a girl, this only upped my eagerness to read the book. I get all excited when an author I love changes things up on her readers. I am a devoted fan of Raybourn's Lady Julia Grey Victorian mystery series and I thoroughly enjoyed her standalone Gothic novel, The Dead Travel Fast. As far as I was concerned 1920s Africa complete with a British/American flapper fish out of water could only spell bliss.Delilah Drummond is a household name among the London and Paris socialite sets. Daughter of an infamous society wife in her own right, Delilah has worked her way through a few marriages of her own. Unfortunately, the latest crashed and burned so luridly that her mother and current stepfather have called Delilah home for a little Come to Jesus. In fact, they're packing her off to Kenya so she can cool her heels a bit while the scandal back home runs its course. It so happens her stepfather (the best in a long line of her mother's spurious husbands) has an estate called Fairlight on the Kenyan savanna. Accompanied only by her cousin and sometime maid Dodo, Delilah arrives at Fairlight to find the place crumbling around her feet. Determined not to let the man (or men) in her life get her down, she immediately starts issuing orders, procuring help from the local Africans in setting the manor to rights. It doesn't take long for the European expat social life to find Delilah and she is more than happy to dive into the swirling politics and pandering that involves. She even runs across a few old friends in the process, as well as encountering some new ones. Most notably a Canadian transplant by the name of Ryder White--a man as wild as the African wilderness he inhabits and one who just might be larger than life enough to measure up to Delilah herself.I do love this setting and time period. And what a master Deanna Raybourn is at capturing the sights, tastes, and sounds of the worlds her characters inhabit. The descriptions of everything from the scrumptious clothes to the sweeping landscape positively drip with vibrancy. And the writing, as always, is exquisite. Where I ran into trouble was, oddly, with the characters. Delilah is hard as nails. She's as bright and devil-may-care as they come, and she has zero interest in anything that does not involve pleasure. Interestingly, that was not always the case. We are given a few meager hints that indicate a more sedate and driven past, one in which she married for love (for once) and worked as a nurse during the war. All that was smashed to smithereens, of course, and she is who she has become--a woman who barely resembles the girl she once was. Now doesn't that back story sound intriguing? Add to that the truly crushing details of her last marriage and the fallout it must have left somewhere inside her, and we have got ourselves a recipe for some serious character depth and development! The thing is . . . it never happens. I mean it rather dismayingly never happens. The bits of depth we get are distributed seemingly at random, in too small quantities, and in entirely the wrong places to maintain the thread and drive of Delilah's story. The result being that she is by and large wholly unsympathetic. Sort of monumentally callous and insipid, as a matter of fact. She dashes about her story taking pleasure where she will, heedless of the consequences, lifting her hand for a dubious good deed here or there, but more often intentionally risking her neck and courting destruction by toying with the caged lion that is Ryder. Who, by the way, I found little better than Delilah as far as his ability to secure any scrap of my affection goes. The potential was there on the grand scale. But somehow the decadence of Delilah's life and that of almost every other person around her completely overwhelmed the more subtle possibilities of her story. Her relationship with Dodo remained distressingly unexplored. The unfolding of the plot continued flat and unsurprising. And the crisis, when it came, failed to incite my sympathy given how little I cared for anyone affected by it. I finished it feeling tired out and sad. It could have easily gone so very differently. It's worth pointing out that while I can't recommend this one, it is the only misstep I've had from Raybourn, and I wholeheartedly recommend her other books, all of which are lovely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2OBZHD8MMJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778314391#wasThisHelpful","R1L2OBZHD8MMJJ","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These darling covers continue to delight me. I am such a sucker for a good silhouette, and the multicolored macarons on this one really do lend it just the right whimsical air. I could hardly wait for my copy of THE CHOCOLATE KISS to arrive once I'd finished The Chocolate Thief. It was just such a delightful surprise of a read, made that much sweeter by the knowledge that there were two more books in the series already out there just waiting for me. As feelings I get to experience in my life go, that is one of the ones I savor the most. This series does not follow the same characters, but branches out into side characters. We get glimpses of the previous ones, though, and of course the irresistible Paris setting remains. I had heard somewhat mixed opinions on this second volume. Some were not that enamored of the slight elements of magical realism, others found themselves absolutely charmed. I find when it comes to magical realism, readers really can go either way. For the most part, I tend to really enjoy it. As long as the author has an even, light hand and is careful to shore the fantastical elements up with a solid sense of place and realistic motivations and histories for her characters.Magalie Chaudron has never belonged anywhere. Wrenched back and forth by her terminally transient parents, she grew up here and there, traveling back and forth from the lavender fields of Provence to the hills up upstate New York at the whim of a mother and father who both could not leave their homes and could not be long without the other. They prided themselves on their supremely adaptable, eminently self-reliant young daughter who could not only put up with the impermanence of their family but also brought joy to their lives. But when she came of age, Magalie took matters into her own hands. Moving to Paris, she made it through university and gratefully accepted the offer of her two maiden aunts to come and live above their salon de thé on the le Saint-Louis in the middle of the Seine and work in their shop making her delicious chocolat chaud. And suddenly, in her little one-room apartment above La Maison des Sorcieres, Magalie finds home. And if she sends a few wishes for the people who drink her chocolate as she stirs and stirs the pot in her blue-tiled kitchen, well, who is she to say if they actually come true? And everything is stable. And there is no reason to believe she will be wrenched once more from this self-made home that fits her like a glove. Until Lyonnais arrives. Philippe Lyonnais, to be precise. With his world-famous pastries and his elegant shop, he invades her private island without a second thought for the struggling salon de thé down the street. Unwilling to give up her safety or her livelihood, Magalie confronts the lion in his own den, only to be rebuffed and brushed aside like the tiny speck of dust he clearly believes her to be. And so the battle begins.Can I just start by saying I love how Philippe says Magalie's name? I don't usually ""hear"" the characters' voices when I'm reading a book. I may have some small sense of the tenor or cadence with which they speak, but that's generally as far as it goes. This book was different. Philippe was always saying her name. At just the right moments. And in just the right ways. And I could hear him. And I loved him for the way he named her and valued everything that fell under that name. In contrast, Magalie never calls him by name. Not out loud. Her inner thoughts are another thing, but her tightly controlled diction made his open admissions stand out. It was a small thing, perhaps. But it was quite simply a highlight of the book for me. And that is saying something, because I loved THE CHOCOLATE KISS. I wasn't sure I would initially, but I came to care for Magalie and Philippe in a very measured, natural way as I got to know them. One of my favorite things about Laura Florand's male protagonists is the way they own their emotions. They are not ashamed of them and they are not interested in squelching them. They may have a myriad of doubts about the emotions and affections of the people around them. But they allow those people their qualms and hangups, even as they are not afraid to embrace their own. It's admirable characterization and I applaud it. Here, one of my very favorite scenes between our two leads:***""I don't feed them anything to make them fall in love with you."" She frowned deeply, seeming unsure where to put herself. Maybe usually she sat on the edge of her bed now, kicking off her shoes, curling up to examine her purchases . . . His blood surged long and slow and hot through his body at the image. ""A poor, innocent princess? Why would I do something like that to her?""""They don't look that innocent to me, but thank you for reminding me of moral considerations,"" he said politely. Really? She hadn't been sending those would-be seductresses his way? Something bitter was released in him, dissipating so fast, he had to struggle to keep his fighting form. ""It's true, it would be quite reprehensible to make anyone fall in love with you.""Her eyes flashed. He almost laughed. This was fun. He felt aroused and infuriated and so alive, he held himself still only by his years of self-discipline. He knew how to pay precise, attentive care to the smallest of movements, how to wait as long as it took for something to be perfect.She dropped her packages onto the bed, started to take off her jacket, and stopped herself. Oh, so she would usually shrug out of her jacket about now. And drop it carelessly across her bed or hang it up? No, hang it up. The room was so peacefully uncluttered. ""If I wish anything on anyone, it's usually strength and courage and clear-seeing, which they never seem to have enough of. I have no idea why that would lead them to you."" She looked as if she had bitten into something rotten in polite company and didn't know where to spit it out.Strength and courage and clear-seeing. He felt himself draw a long, deep breath, like at the gym when he had just finished a punishing set of exercises well. Or at the Meilleur Ouvrier de France trials when the last, extravagant, impossible spin of sugar held. ""Thank you,"" he said, ""for the compliment."" The extraordinary, beautiful compliment.***It was such a lovely moment, I'm honestly just as affected now, rereading it. It's hard to sum up the many reasons why I connect with these books, but I feel sure saying that in this case it was because I felt the arc of a relationship was so evenly and lovingly drawn. Because I liked them both so much. And because Magalie's journey particularly resonated. I grew up here and there, too. I know what it is like to not know how it is going to go each day in a new place. And I know how quickly the just-now familiar faces and spaces can be replaced with new ones, unfamiliar and uncertain in their newness. At the same time, folding is not an option. And as hard as she holds out, Magalie knows when something is important.""It was hard to trust in happiness, coming from another person, but . . . there was so much of it, around him.""There really was. I'm so glad I got to witness it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FILBW4AOCXNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758269412#wasThisHelpful","R2FILBW4AOCXNA","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one of your very good friends wholeheartedly recommends a book or series as one of her favorite contemporary romance series, you pay attention, yes? Which is why I didn't last long before picking up Laura Florand's THE CHOCOLATE THIEF after my friend brought it to my attention a couple of weeks ago. I don't know if I would have discovered Florand otherwise, and I am just really happy that I did because this book is delicious. That cute cover doesn't hurt it either. In fact, I am currently wallowing in reading purgatory waiting for a paperback copy of the second Amour et Chocolat novel to show up in my mailbox, because even though I could download the ebook in the blink of an eye, I just really need the cute matching covers on my shelf. This surprises none of you, I am sure. Make no mistake, though. The minute it does arrive, I am diving right in. Because this delightful little treat reads like a chocolate-drenched Anna and the French Kiss for adults. Are you telling me you want to miss that little slice of heaven? No. I didn't think so.Cade Corey has finally made it to Paris. Growing up the daughter of an American chocolate baron, she's dreamt her whole life of traveling to the city of lights and immersing herself in the world of chocolate masters. Now that she's here, she has a full-blown agenda. Track down Sylvain Marquis, make him an offer he can't refuse, and nail down a line of luxury chocolates to elevate Corey Chocolate's mainstream image. And Cade is absolutely sure she can do it. She's a savvy businesswoman who's spent her entire life surrounded by chocolate. She can have this deal in the bag by the end of the day and spend the rest of her unprecedented ""time off"" exploring Paris and soaking it all up. What she doesn't factor in is Sylvain Marquis' raging disdain for all things mundane. And Corey Chocolates are at the top of the list. The thought of putting his name on a Corey product fills him with actual physical pain. And so the battle of wills begins. Cade can't fathom giving up at this point. Not when she's come this far and invested so much of herself in this one dream. But Sylvain has traveled a long, difficult road himself. And he's not about to reduce all that hard work and mastery to a mere four-ounce bar of mediocre chocolate sold in Walmarts around the world. The divide between these two seems insurmountable. Until Cade has an idea, a dangerously game-changing idea.THE CHOCOLATE THIEF surprised me on several levels. I went in expecting cute chick lit and wound up getting something entirely different. Which is not to say it isn't cute. It is! It's just quite a bit more than that, too. In the same way that the cover is a bit deceptively light, concealing rather deeper and darker waters within. Much of it has to do with Florand's writing, which continued to catch me unawares with its expressive nuances. Each time I thought I had its number and dared to let my mind wander, the writing would reel me in again with its quiet and perceptive weight. Cade's observations on Paris, the color, the sound, and the taste of it, charmed me and reminded me why I fell in love with it as well on my first visit. The characterization, particularly of Sylvain, carefully built upon this foundation. I loved that he was such an unexpected blend of uncertainty and bravado. I thought he might be too much to begin with, too rich for my blood in a way. But Florand wisely filled him out with a history, full of longing and failed attempts with the women in his life. Placed next to Cade's innate confidence their relationship made for pleasurable reading indeed. Here is one of my very favorite interactions early on:***""I believe you still have our coat, mademoiselle,"" he mentioned as she reached for the doorknob, trying to pry that word he wanted out of her.Her flush deepened furhter, her jaw as tense as it was possible for her to hold it. Her hands trembled so much on the buttons, she couldn't get them undone.""Tenez,"" he said, troubled, his own hands lifting. He was an idiot. There was more than one way to be an idiot, and he had just proven it. He had just cut off his own nose to spite his face. ""May I help?""""Don't. You. Touch. Me."" So much anger vibrated through her voice that he dropped his hands, that fourteen-year-old teenager waking in him, the kind girls didn't want to be touched by.So he stood there as she struggled with button after button, making her slow, miserable way down the coat, everyone watching them, her cheeks deeply red now. He wondered why she didn't just destroy it--rip it off, pop the buttons, drop it on the floor, and maybe drop a few bills on it to cover the damage as she stalked out. It seemed like something an American billionaire would do.At last she got it off, to reveal the most ridiculous enormous sweatshirt. He started to smile despite himself. ""What are you wearing? Did you come to my workshop in your pajamas?"" Americans. All the money in the world and not a gram of taste.She gave him a look like a slap, thrust the coat at him, and strode out.***Passages like this are exactly why I loved THE CHOCOLATE THIEF, for the effortless blend of light and dark with which Laura Florand crafted it. The protagonists are passionate about everything they do and love. And what they do and love is chocolate. This appreciation shines through in every heady, lingering description. This is a romance, to be sure. If you like yours dipped in the finest chocolate money can buy, then I suggest you seek it out immediately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Z7TG1155UN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758269404#wasThisHelpful","R16Z7TG1155UN3","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have come to look forward to the latest Liza Palmer book with a vigorous sort of yearning. I discovered her through the hilarious and thoughtful Seeing Me Naked, and I did not look back. I've loved each of Palmer's previous four novels, but this one . . . I think this one is my favorite. It's certainly the one I had the most trouble letting go of, both when I had to stop reading to deal with some real life matter and when I finished the final satisfying page and realized it was over. And this time, as I was sitting there mourning the loss of the characters and my time with them, I started thinking about the adult contemporary authors writing today that I have these feelings for. I've read each book they've written. I've loved them all. And I am at the point where if they have a new book coming out, I buy it. End of story. And you know what? Liza Palmer and Sarah Addison Allen were the two names that stuck in my mind. For their charm, their depth, and their wonderful, wonderful consistency, I am a permanent fan. So there.Her mother named her Queen Elizabeth Wake. And that first magnificent unkindness sort of exemplifies the whole ghastly course of Queenie's life to date. Always the outcast, along with her big sister Merry Carole, Queenie got the hell out of North Star, Texas just as soon as she possibly could. With a list of regrets a mile long, she struck out for something better. And since that fateful day, it's been a long string of cities and restaurants with no real place to call home. She inherited a knack for cooking from her dissolute mother, but she always winds up on the wrong end of a customer's fool request or a hotel manager's disfavor. After her last spectacular crash and burn, Queenie is forced to pack up her things and return to North Star. Merry Carole stayed and chose to raise her son alone, despite the town's vicious gossip. And though Queenie can't fault her for it, she's determined not to get sucked back in. She'll stay just long enough to find her feet again. And she'll do it as far under the radar as she possibly can. Of course, returning home means returning to every old scandal that town and its uber-traditional inhabitants never forgave her for. It also means running into Everett Coburn again. And that may be the one thing Queenie won't survive. That is until she is offered a job cooking last meals on death row at the local prison . . .Good night nurse, I loved this book. And it started (as it often does with Palmer's novels) with the following epigraph from The Age of Innocence:""Each time you happen to me all over again.""Right there. Right there I knew this book was going to have its way with me. I was reminded of that line from The Jane Austen Book Club where Prudie cries, ""High school is never over."" I knew it would be the same for Queenie. She's so strong-willed and weary that I immediately had her back. And I was enormously gratified to see that her sister Merry Carole (and her sweet nephew Cal) did, too. In fact, possibly the most luminous thing about NOWHERE BUT HOME is the exquisitely rendered relationship between these two sisters. Scarred by their growing up years or not, they are survivors in the most visceral sense of the word. I just loved them. And every small scene in which they spoke quietly in the kitchen or awkwardly pressed through their grief at a summer social was a work of art. By the time I was 50 pages in, I'd marked so many pages I was losing track. And then there's Everett. And the last meals. As if two adult sisters struggling to stay above their grief and years of bitterness wasn't enough. Palmer also serves up an old flame worth sighing over and the wide open wound that is working on death row. As for Everett, here's one of my favorite scenes in which he makes an appearance:***""Queenie, come on. He's ridiculous,"" Everett says, motioning out to where Hudson is standing with the other men.""I like him. He's nice,"" I say.""You like him and he's nice,"" Everett repeats, slamming his beer down a bit too hard on Reed's tiled counter.""Yeah. I like him and he's nice. Is that so revolutionary?"" I ask.""Is his shirt tucked in or isn't it? Did he go to the bathroom and not quite tidy himself up after? I mean, I don't get what that look is about,"" Everett says, gesticulating wildly at Hudson and the offending plaid shirt.""What's happening over there?"" I ask.""Nothing,"" Everett says. His voice subdued. Caught.""How was that nice lady your parents were setting you up with on Sunday? Talk about ridiculous,"" I say, walking past him and out toward the backyard. Everett reaches out and stops me. He leans down and speaks softly, intimately, into my ear.""Go ahead and have your fun with Mr. I Like Him and He's Nice. I know how this ends and so does he."" Everett's eyes are locked on mine. Green, brown, and yellow pinwheels intense and focused.***So, you see. Humor and tension. In equally tangible amounts. Which leads me to the last meals. Each chapter title was a meal. Sometimes it was what Queenie herself ate that day. And sometimes it was the last meal request from a prisoner about to die. At the beginning of those chapters, I had to take a deep breath before continuing on. Palmer handles the whole thing very well, and Queenie's evolving reactions to her job and its ramifications felt entirely organic to me, suffocating in their realness. Her time at the prison forces her to learn a whole new language for letting go. And, somehow, it all ties in to her unfinished issues with her mother, with Everett, and with every grudge she ever held. This book disrupted my focus in the best way. I simply had to curl up with it and accompany Queenie on her unenviable journey. As always with a Liza Palmer story, the painful and the beautiful walk hand in hand. Everything from the relationship between the sisters to the breathless love story to the mouth-watering food is carefully orchestrated and perfectly delivered. NOWHERE BUT HOME waltzed onto my Best of 2013 list before the dust had settled. Recommended for fans of Friday Night Lights, comfort food, and top-notch storytelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNPGZB5Q1QK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062007475#wasThisHelpful","RSNPGZB5Q1QK0","A3RSRLZ271Q81S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RSRLZ271Q81S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are the ONLY metal ball roller bottle fitments that I've found that don't let the little metal ball pop out once the plastic housing around them starts to degrade from the heavier oils.

"Update 11/14/14:  Price is back down again - try to get it when it's under $35/oz for the best value.Update 9/11/2014: The price on this just doubled.  I bought it for $34/oz. inc. shipping last month.  It now lists for $62/oz.Original Review:I did a lot of research on Helichrysum before deciding which one to buy - I finally decided that the more expensive Corsican Italicum variety, while being demonstrably better at quickly healing scars and bruises than the Gymnocephalum (this one) , it wasn't so much better that it was worth the ridiculous price being asked for it.  To some extent, they all have similar properties.  The only question was, would this one work on a scar - there isn't nearly enough information available on that for the Gymnocephalum variety.So, I gambled by buying this one.  Started applying it to a large, raised, red scar that I've had on my lower neck for the last couple of years, which I truly hate, since it looks like a huge zit.  I applied the oil straight, one swipe at a time, (not even a full drop), and with only a handful of applications over 3 days, the scar was visibly less tall/wide and a lot less red.  (I'd say it went from very noticable red to irritated skin pink.  And it was reduced by about a quarter in height.)After 3 days though, i had to stop the applications to deal with a family issue out of town, and I didn't get back to it until very recently.  Now I'm using a blend on the scar, (several times daily, when I remember), and the scar is slowly continuing to fade.  The color is now only slightly darker than my normal skin tone, the scar has flattened to a slight bump. It's not really noticable any more.In addition, I'm using the oil in a Rosacea Blend that knocks the red out fast.  (Like immediately.)And a Bruise Blend that keeps them from forming (really busted my hand and arm on a ladder the other day, and the blend kept the bruises from turning black - they just got a bit yellow) and speeds the healing on older bruises (used it on my dad's bruises while I was there-they healed in half the time).Yes, it works. (And since everyone I've talked to has now hit me up for a sample, I've had to buy a second bottle of this - I don't want to get caught without it.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUF5MOV9LK5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Z9ZZTE#wasThisHelpful","R3UUF5MOV9LK5W","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is awesome oil!  Very strong - will take out a wart or skin tag in a New York minute!That being said, it's a very hot oil, you will want to apply it ONLY to the skin tag - and you can expect some tingling when you do.  (If it burns, cut the oil with carrier oil.  It takes longer to get rid of whatever it is that you are getting rid of, but there's less chance of a reaction.)  And you don't really want to splash it on yourself.  Ask me how I know.  :)I left some with my mom, (in a blend), who is using it to remove a seborrheic keratosis on her scalp. (Yes, she had it checked, by a dermatologist, it IS a keratosis and not cancer. Thank you.)  In only a couple of weeks the  growth is less than half the size it was.

"I looked all over the place for a metal topped roller ball dispenser that I could use on an amber glass bottle.  These are very well made and I love the action, BUT I had one heck of a time finding a bottle that these would fit on.  The bottles that you use need to have an ""Sb"" on the bottom - most of the amber bottles that I have do NOT have an ""Sb"".  I did have one empty essential oil bottle that worked, but I'd recommend checking to see if you have something that these will work on before purchase.  (The half ounce Mountain Rose Herbs Essential Oil bottles seem to be the right kind.)Be sure to follow the instructions diagrammed on the package for installing the top - screwing down the cap is what finally seats the dispenser onto the bottle.

"This tastes better than regular table salt.  I bought it initially to make a re-mineralizing toothpaste (working beautifully, by the way) but I like the flavor so much better than the processed table salt that I normally use for cooking that I've decided to start using it for the table as well.  Just ordered a 20 lb bag - salt never goes bad, and buying in bulk is a lot cheaper.  The Extra-Fine grain is the same size as regular table salt, and there are no problems dispensing it through a standard salt shaker.My understanding is that this type of salt is much better for you, since most of the minerals in it have not removed through over-processing and bleaching, (as is the case with the stuff you buy in the grocery stores), and it actually has a lower sodium content than processed salt, so it helps with blood pressure issues if you are watching your salt intake.Win-win!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U2XA8EAPKB3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZL255O#wasThisHelpful","R3U2XA8EAPKB3T","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love these!  They are great for mixing your own saline nasal sprays.  (Which are insanely expensive if you buy them in the stores.)  I like the amber glass as well - you can use the bottle to store and dispense a low concentration ionic silver solution, (or any light-sensitive product)  and it's much easier to see how much you have left.  The top gives a nice spray, a very fine mist, but still a significant squirt.  And the bottle comes with a little clip that prevents the top from depressing, making it possible to toss the filled bottle into a suitcase.I haven't actually had to use one of these for a nasal rinse yet, but it works great to direct a fine ionic silver mist at the eyes - great for keeping a blepharitis outbreak from getting infected or turning into a chalazion. I imagine it would also be a fabulous eye moisturizer as well, to prevent that blepharitis in the first place. (Can't wear makeup while you use this though - it does have a wide spray pattern.)The only problem I seem to be having with it comes from not being familiar enough with how the cap works - I keep pulling the whole thing off instead of just the little clear plastic dust cap.  I'll get used to it eventually, and the top just pops right back on, so it's not really much of an issue.

"Love this keyboard!  My husband has one for his iPad that folds into a case and it's much bigger and klunkier than this slim little gem.It's uber lightweight, I love the key action, which is just a bit ""clicky"" and lets you know you have actually pressed the key correctly, and if I have to use a smaller-than-normal keyboard, this is a good one to relearn typing on.  I don't use a keyboard much on the iPad yet, but I'm sure that I will need to in the future, and this one works just fine. It's wide enough to make a great prop on your lap for reading in bed.The iPad with the Anker keyboard attached fits into even a tight case with extra clearance, the prop for the iPad is sturdy and holds up well to finger use in either the vertical or the horizontal position.  (It's a bit shaky with a stylus in the vertical position, but so far, everything has been.)What is particularly nice about it is the attention to detail - there are raised rubber bumpers that protect the screen when the tablet is closed, and there are little ridges inside the groove that ""hook"" the edge of the tablet and keep it secure.  (Nicely designed!)  The wire prop springs up and clicks into place firmly with nice strong magnets, and the tablet attaches to the iPad with another set of strong magnets, so you don't really have to have everything perfectly aligned before it clicks into place.The one complaint that I have about it is the same complaint that I have about the iPad itself - it looks really slick with the brushed aluminum and all, but such a smooth surface is hard to hold on to.  Being a ""klutz extraordinaire"", I could easily foresee a disaster in my future if I wasn't really careful.  (I hopefully have gotten around that by applying a decorative textured vinyl decal to the back of the unit.  Now it's unique, it still looks cool, and I'm less likely to drop it.)And the little clear bumpers included, while necessary for stability on a desktop given the slick surface of the unit, are a little bit too tall and not sticky enough for the unit.  They shifted when I moved the unit around on the desk leaving adhesive behind on the pretty case. I replaced them with some flatter black rubber dots to keep the case from shifting around on the desk.  Worked better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SRJH900Y6MZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ4SBSM#wasThisHelpful","R2SRJH900Y6MZG","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to order two of these - The GLAZZ was so well packaged that it survived transit perfectly, but after taking it out of the box I accidentally knocked it off of the desk (before I had applied it to the iPad) and when it hit the floor, it landed on one corner edge just right and the blasted thing spider-webbed.  Yes....it really IS made of glass folks!I had ordered a cheaper film which I applied and used while I was waiting for the second GLAZZ to arrive, and that kept the dust and oils off of the screen while I was waiting for delivery of the replacement.  It did a fine job, but it smeared rather badly.When the replacement arrived, I carefully did NOT drop it onto the floor.  I removed the other film, which lifted clean without leaving any residue on the tablet.I used the hinge method to apply the GLAZZ screen protector - applying removable tape along one long side to be sure of the alignment first, flipping it back, cleaning the screen of any dust using more of the removable tape, then removing the protective film from the GLAZZ screen cover and laying the adhesive side down on the tablet.  This is a stiffer screen protector than regular films - when I flipped it over, it gently laid ITSELF down perfectly on the tablet - no air bubbles formed.  Period.There was one minute speck of dust at one edge that I missed, I was able to lift that edge easily and remove the speck without any trouble.  Again, the screen protector aligned itself perfectly with no air trapped underneath.  I've never seen such a freakishly easy application.But the real difference with this screen protector, and the reason I am happy that I got a second one after messing up the first one, is that despite being perfectly clear, the GLAZZ does NOT show fingerprints!  Once it is applied, it completely disappears onto the screen, protecting it without being visible.  Since I had used another film screen protector for several days before applying it, the differences between the two were very obvious.I will be looking for GLAZZ for my other devices now - there is just no comparison.  (I wish they made a really big cover for my induction cooktop.)Since I had to buy this twice - it gets ten stars.  It's that much better than the alternatives, and well worth the extra cost. (Although I do HIGHLY recommend that you not throw them onto the floor. Chuckle!)Update: Since I had a broken one of these, I decided to see if I could cut a smaller piece out of the unshattered area.  I had the idea of grinding it to fit and using it on my nano, which I tend to whack into brick walls as I'm passing (it's on a watch band, and I'm a klutz).I could NOT score it with a sharp Exacto knife! That bodes extremely well for the screen keeping the scratches off of the tablet, but it does mean I'm going to have to go buy another glass cutter in order to break off my little piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHFPOUARI55B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8ZJFKE#wasThisHelpful","R2RHFPOUARI55B","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a VERY sturdy screen protector film.  I particularly appreciate the clear instructions on the ""Hinge Method"" of application, which I had never used before when installing one of these, but it really does make it a lot easier to get it on straight.  During application there were several air bubbles in the center, which were slowly forced to the edges and removed using the enclosed plastic card.  The film was not damaged in the least during this, despite a significant amount of pressure.  Impressive.Only thing I didn't care for with this was that fingerprints do show in certain light conditions when the tablet is turned off, but they do not show at all when the tablet is in use, so this one gets 4+ stars.  For the price it is an excellent screen protector.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGK8CUC2MYF04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WYA852#wasThisHelpful","RGK8CUC2MYF04","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very cool!  Got the new iPad propped up in in now. I like the fact that it supports the iPad both vertically and horizontally, and that it is small enough to fit easily in the case that I use for it.It seems stable when using a stylus in the horizontal position, but feels a little shaky at the outside icons when it is the vertical orientation.

"After having a really bad tension-inducing month I decided to experiment with some Ylang Ylang to try to knock my blood pressure down to manageable level.  So I applied a small drop of this to each pulse point on the wrists and into the crook of the elbows. That was about mid-afternoon.I wandered around for the rest of the day, yawning every five minutes until bedtime, then fell asleep with a violent hypnic jerk that threw one arm towards the ceiling with so much force that it actually flipped me over.Learned three things from this....1. This is really good pure (and strong) Ylang Ylang oil that does exactly what is claimed for an essential oil.2. NEVER use essential oils uncut.  Next time I need to lower my blood pressure, I'll be cutting this with some grapeseed oil or something. My poor body thought it was dying when I finally lay down to sleep.

"I received a 100 gram sample of the Bulk Supplements Pure Stevia Extract for review.  (I have been a daily user of uncut stevioside for several  years, so all comparisons are made against that.)The price of the Bulk Supplements stevia sample on a per ounce basis is significantly better, at $4.24 per ounce for 100 grams versus $6.87/ounce for my usual supplier.  (And that is if you buy in bulk. Smaller quantities cost more.)As far as the purity goes, the Bulk Supplements sample label is listed as 90% stevia extract, my normal supply is listed as 100% pure stevia content.  The color was pure white for both samples, and the texture of the micro-fine powder was also the same.  It looks like pure stevia powder is supposed to look.People who have been using stevia that has been blended with some other sweetener like Maltodextrin (as sold on grocery store shelves) might not be familiar with how pure stevia tastes.  A full serving is about the size of a sesame seed, equivalent to a teaspoon of sugar.  And if you use pure stevia too liberally, you will definitely taste a licorice aftertaste, unless you cut the stevia with just a small amount of sugar. This effect is much less noticeable in acidic drinks such as coffee or flavored citrus waters, but very noticeable in the milk on your cereal.When I taste tested the Bulk Supplements stevia, I used exactly the same weight per drink by volume, in order to get a correct comparison. Each was sampled at 0.03 g, or about the equivalent of 3 teaspoons of sugar. (3 sesame seeds.)In coffee, I did not detect a difference in taste between the two samples.  In a citrus flavored powdered energy drink, I could not tell any difference either.The final taste test was to dip a moistened finger in the powder and taste it directly.  There I did notice a difference, with the Bulk Supplements sample coming across as significantly harsher.  It had a stronger aftertaste with more bite.Since no one is likely to eat this stuff straight, I would call it a good value.  Not the best, but definitely doable if you are on a budget and need to cut your sugar intake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P59SAOJ2CBAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSQZNF0#wasThisHelpful","R3P59SAOJ2CBAE","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given that a couple of folks got hit with knock-offs when they ordered these boards, I wanted to point out that it's always a good idea to check who the seller is at the time that you place your order.  The seller is listed next to the words ""Sold By""  under the green text that tells you how many items they have in stock.That seller will rotate depending on how many dealers are offering the item in question, and the one that is showing when you place your order is the one that will fill your order.  You can easily check that dealer by clicking on the name, to see if they have any complaints in the Seller Review section.  (Different from the product review section that shows up here.) The other sellers for the product are listed at the right.Now on to the product review....I bought 2 of these boards almost a year ago from ""Dawn's Distinction"" and they are beautiful, heavy, end grain maple cutting boards.  Solid as a rock.  One has received daily use for the entire time, the other is used infrequently upstairs in the craft room, but they both look exactly the same as the day they were purchased. I wanted to use the boards for a while before reviewing them, to see how they held up. I've never seen better cutting boards.Both of the boards were conditioned according to instructions when they arrived, and then occasionally treated with a mineral oil rub.  (Every other month or so, or when I remember to do it, for the one that gets daily use. The infrequently used one has not been treated since the initial waxing.)  Neither has been submerged - for cleaning I rinse under the tap and dry immediately, or disinfect the board with lemon and salt.There are some negatives - you do NOT want to drop one of these things.  They are extremely heavy.  And it does not do a cutting board any good to sit on a damp countertop.  (My husband added four shallow rubber bumpers to the bottoms of the boards so that they had air flow underneath to dry them. No mold problems.)I don't think these will disappoint if you are looking for a very large, chef quality board at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQT1RU1CSST1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009OWEC#wasThisHelpful","RMQT1RU1CSST1","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smells like the whiff of that soft mushy rot that developed on the carrot that you forgot in the bottom of the refrigerator bin for a month. Musky, musty and more than a little rancid.So why on earth would I give it five stars......?I have rather large bags under the eyes (genetics) and if I hold my nose and apply the ""tiniest"" drop to the soft bags and wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, they go away for the day.  Really, really!  They shrink down to nothing!  It's gentle, it feels good, and obviously the skin likes it even if the nose doesn't.  It is visibly healing the damage I did to my skin when I was young and stupid.It DOES help if you mix it in a carrier oil of some kind (I like the Dr. Adorable Aloe Vera oil) and throw in a few drops of Lemon oil or some other essential oil, to kind of cover up that smell.  (That works fine for the rest of the face, but do be careful.....you don't want to get Lemon oil near your eyes - it will sting.)But I can't argue with these results, so stinky face, here I come!(The smell does fade away after a few minutes. Chuckle!)Update:  Just a word of caution, this oil is VERY strong.  When I suggest using a tiny drop of full strength oil, I do mean VERY tiny.  If you slap a few drops of undiluted oil on the bags under your eyes the fumes will have you crying for a good twenty minutes.

The holes are small enough to deter mosquitos, and they would be great to toss in a bug-out bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13U0PNFQLLLZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C13VEY#wasThisHelpful","R13U0PNFQLLLZC","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I'll be honest ....when I first pulled this out of the package, I almost tossed it without testing it.  I could not see how the little suction cups were going to keep the water from seeping under, and on my tub, there was a raised ledge around the overflow drain that I was sure was going to interfere with the cover.Then I went back and read some of the comments, and decided to give it a try anyway....color me shocked!  It actually worked, and I got 3 extra inches of tub fill!  Made for a lovely long soak...extra hot!Couple of hints though....be sure to get IN THE TUB while you are filling it - so you don't displace too much water when you get in.  I got the fill almost all the way up to the rim....impressive, but has the potential to make a big mess.And remove the cover once in a while to let it air out and prevent mold.Spectacular product!

"My absolute favorite earbuds!  Excellent blended sound (not too much base, not too much treble, no tinniness or static), handy little Apple products remote switch with volume and forward/reverse controls on the left line, and these are SO much more comfortable than any other (much more expensive) buds I've tried.  The bud is slightly offset, making it sit comfortably in the ear without popping out as easily, and these come with several sizes of covers, including a set of ""extra small"" covers, the only thing I've found that fits in my narrow ear canal without causing pressure.  You can actually roll over on these and take a nap without shoving the thing into your ear (but you will deplete your battery if you do).I've used one set of these twice daily during 40 minute workouts for a couple of years, and they are still going strong, with no distortion.  (Which impressed me so much I decided to pick up a couple more sets for my purse and the glove box.)  I've had other buds at five times the price that only made it through a couple of months of my excercise regimen before blowing a speaker.For settled listening, I've got a set of Bose Over Ear headhones - for everything else - I love these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26G24IXOA086T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005M7AVLO#wasThisHelpful","R26G24IXOA086T","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My little fine lines and wrinkles go away when I use this oil on them.  (What more can you say?  This works better than any $80 product I've tried, has zero chemicals in it, and it leaves your face feeling fresher and healed.)  This oil is pure enough to eat.I like to mix about an ounce of this oil with about 10 drops of pure Lemon essential oil (seems to plump things up - collagen, maybe?) and a few drops of Carrot essential oil. This has become my daily moisturizer, and my face is looking a decade younger.I have always been a firm advocate for using Aloe Vera leaves, and I've successfully used the leaves to smooth wrinkles, heal burns (of course), and rapidly cure athlete's foot and I even cured a mild Shingles reaction with it in a single day.  But it is not always convenient to run outside to cut a fresh leaf before bedtime.  This IS the pure oil, with no fillers or base gels.  No other ingredients listed on the bottle.  (I have bought many a Pure Gel Aloe Vera product in stores that turned out to be ""pure gel"", but not ""pure aloe vera gel"". I truly loathe marketers.)Anyway, the oil does not work quite as well as a fresh leaf off of a plant, but it smells better, does not have to be kept alive and watered on your bathroom counter, works beautifully as a base oil for other cosmetics and moisturizers, and is much more convenient for travel.Go for it.......It will give your poor decimated plant time to regrow a few leaves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV4QMVE3PYTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IHP5V8#wasThisHelpful","R2MV4QMVE3PYTA","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very pleased with this English Lavender oil - it smells quite different from other lavender oil I bought locally.  This one is fresher and crisper, with an almost sweet fullness that the other one lacks.  (This one reminds me of my grandmother, who always smelled of Yardley's English Lavender.)  At two ounces, this is an excellent value, and although at first I thought I'd never need two full ounces of this - now I'm afraid I'll need to be buying it again fairly soon.  A drop in the hollow of the throat before bed causes me to drop off quickly and sleep solidly for several hours longer than I'd done in quite a while.  (Helps with relaxation as well as congestion, and where I live, congestion is a given.)I'm very new to the whole essential oil thing - but I'm pleasantly surprised by how effective they are for so many little daily  irritations that you just never realized were bugging you until they stop.

"These Things Are Spectacular!  Remember the good old days when you could get Vicks Inhalers in those little tubes - and nothing else did as good a job of clearing your headcold? (Haven't seen those in so long!)  A few drops of pure Eucalyptus essential oil in one of these and you will be breathing clear again, without having to resort to something as addictive and damaging as nose sprays. I read somewhere that over 80% of adults only breathe through 1 nostril at any given time.  Don't know how true that statistic is, but THIS adult has been one of the 80% for as long as I can remember.  One of these inhalers with Eucalyptus oil has opened them both up.The tubes can be refilled, but it's kind of tricky to get the little end cap out once you have it inserted firmly.  I did finally figure it out though - take a long thin skewer (like the kind you use to grill kebabs) and stick it down through the nose hole and push out the cap at the other end.  (It tends to crush the wick a bit, but that doesn't affect how they work and you can replace those easily.) Or if you are careful, you can just drip replacement drops through the nose hole at the top.Another suggestion that I found through reading comments here is that the BEST price for replacement wicks, by far, is to use roll-your-own cigarette filters as wicks.  The ""Premier Filter Tips - 200 Piece""  fit into these little end caps perfectly. (They actually fit better than the ones that come with the tubes.) You can find those here on Amazon for under $4 and free shipping. They hold plenty of oil too, so they don't have to be refilled as often.Final tip:  Once you have loaded your inhaler with oil, take a large bore needle or pin and poke a couple of holes through the filter using the four holes drilled at the base - it lets you get a better air flow through the filter and you'll get some serious vapor flow.Update:  Whoa! Peppermint oil is even better for clearing the sinuses than the Eucalyptus oil!  I now carry one around in my pocket for quick sniffs and I've never had so much energy!  (I guess getting adequate oxygen to the brain really DOES help!  Peppermint is supposed to be a kick-ass appetite suppressant as well, so it's all good!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYB1HX8HFM5BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMI904S#wasThisHelpful","RYB1HX8HFM5BY","A9DH6MLZBGUMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DH6MLZBGUMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So why should you get a Nexus phone?The main benefit, in my opinion, is the natural decoupling from the carriers. For example, the Android OS upgrade of this phone does not depend on whether the carrier or the manufacturer wants you to upgrade. It only depends on Google (and you of course). In fact, you can receive the latest patches and OS upgrade even without a SIM card as long as you have a Wifi connection.This phone will also work with the Google Fi, which is its own cellular network.This phone will work with AT&T and T-Mobile. It has the antennas to work with Verizon but It is my understanding Verizon has blocked it. This phone, as of this writing, will probably not work with Verizon. The wide spectrum of the phone's antenna will allow it to work practically everywhere in the world (you will need a working SIM card).So how is the hardware? For the most part, its hardware hits that sweet cost/benefit spot. None of the hardware is top-notch (they are a notch below) which is good enough for almost everyone. For example, the phone uses Gorilla Glass 3, which isn't as good as Gorilla Glass 4, but the difference between the two is small. The advantage is they are much cheaper than having top-of-the-line components. Hence, this is an affordable phone that will certainly meet almost everyone's needs.The only part of the hardware which I do have some complaint is the speaker. The speakers are certainly good enough for listening during a phone conversation or a youtube video. But both the volume and sound quality will not wow anyone. Overall, it is an acceptable speaker.Perhaps the best part of the hardware is its near-top-notch camera. This camera takes pictures as good as my iPhone 6. Trust me, that is a high compliment.The call reception is quite good. The battery life is much better than my iPhone 6. This phone lasts me 35+ hours with regular use. My iPhone 6, with similar use, will last me around 16-20 hours.The phone looks and feels better than the pictures. The body is high-quality polycarbonate (high grade plastic used in bulletproof glass). It certainly doesn't feel cheap.I recommend the 32GB storage option for practically everyone.Pros:1)Looks and feels better than pictures. Made of high quality polycarbonate and the phone is very thin.2)Hard to beat the value. You are getting a phone with 2nd best components available for a rock bottom price.3)Very good overall performance. It will certainly will be good enough for almost everyone. It seems even faster than my Samsung Galaxy S5, which might have been the fastest phone in 2014.4)Very decent battery life and screen.5)The Android OS on this phone is decoupled from the carriers and manufacturers. That means you can upgrade the Android OS and obtain the latest patches without ever connecting to the carrier network. You can do it through Wifi. That makes this phone ideal for Android developers.6)This phone works with the Google Fi cellular network.7)The wide antenna bandwidth allows this phone work with almost any cellular network (probably not Verizon).8)Fingerprint scanner is even faster than my iPhone 6, which itself is very fast. And I do like the position of the scanner (back) better. The finger print scanner definitely takes less than a second.Cons:1)Speaker is so-so but still very much acceptable. It won't win any hi-fi awards.2)You only get the most plain vanilla Android OS with apps provided by Google for things such as web browser, email, and calendar etc. If you are used to 3rd party widgets, apps, and enhancements provided by OEM, then they will be missing in this phone. You will, however, be able to run practically all the Android apps from the Google Play store on this phone.3)No option for higher storage than 32GB.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4V39V2M7YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01738VM3U#wasThisHelpful","R4V39V2M7YM","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply the best computer peripheral I have ever used. So much so, I don't even want to use my mouse anymore.It is about a size of a small paperback book. It has plenty of surface area. It also has an internal battery which lasts about 30 days. You charge it using the lightning cable which is provided (you can use it while charging). It can use either the bluetooth or the lightning cable for connectivity to the Mac. I did find this trackpad to be tad more responsive when connected by a lightning cable. But bluetooth responsiveness is more than adequate.To me, the magic of this trackpad is with the subtleties. It is incredibly responsive to the touch. In fact, you learn to relax your fingers a bit because that seems to work better. Unlike the previous generation, this can also track different pressures you put on. Pinch and zooming, which works on Chrome as well as Safari, is a delightful experience.From my experience, once you get used to this trackpad, the amount of effort to utilize it decreases and it will become second nature and you will wonder how you have ever used your Mac without it.Pros:1)Large.

"This is my first folding bike. I am just a casual rider (in shape).I rode this along the streets and the beaches of Southern California. Overall I was impressed.The frame had no flex and overall felt rock solid.When folded, the bike was actually larger than I expected. Do not expect a bike that will fit neatly into a suitcase unless it is very large. I could fit this bike into a trunk of my car, but not without clearing a lot of space first. Compact this bike isn't. But it is compact enough to carry within a trunk of a car.It weighs around 24 pounds, which is borderline heavy to carry.The saddle was uncomfortable. Fortunately, I replaced the saddle with top of the line gel saddle and it is now comfortable.The only ergonomic adjustment is the height of the seat post. For those who are used to riding conventional bikes which fits their size, this bike will take some adjustment. The bike isn't uncomfortable (except for the saddle), but its one-size-fits-all ergonomics will not please everyone.So what is there to like? It is fast. It is light. It is simply cool and it will definitely grab attention.It also has high-end (not the highest) components such as a shifters, gears, brakes, and tires. I had no trouble going past by slower bikes.The 10-speed is plenty and I actually prefer it over my 18 speed bike which requires far more gear changes.If you need a folding bike which fits within a truck of a car and rides like a high-end bike, then this bike will fit that bill.Pros:1)Fast, light, and unique. This is an enjoyable bike with cool factor to match.2)High-end (not highest) components (shifters, gears, chain, brakes, frames, wheels, and tires).3)It folds and fits into a trunk. That's simply cool.4)The frame is solid and I felt no flex.5)The paint job was better than expected.Cons:1)Only the seat post height is adjustable. For those who are keen on ergonomics, this bike may never fit you perfectly as you would like. Overall, I have found the ergonomics satisfactory but not quite as comfortable as my well fitting conventional bike.2)The saddle is uncomfortable. But that is quite common with OEM saddles. I highly recommend replacing the saddle with more comfortable ones.3)When folded, it was larger than I had expected. In my view, the bike was designed more for performance than for compactness.4)I would not recommend this bike for serious riders who ride hundreds of miles per week. But then again, you probably already know that. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3CAOYQTDN7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMNXEF6#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3CAOYQTDN7I","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, this is an unsatisfactory case for two main reasons.First, the cover has a very weak magnet that barely sticks to the front. For example, when held upside down, the front flap will detach from the screen.Second, the case itself does not protect the screen. There is no protrusion, as you would find in many iPad cases, that protects the screen in the event of a fall and the front flap has come off.The only thing I like about this case is its thinness and lack of bulk.Pros:1)Very thin and lacks bulk. Overall, made of good materials.Cons:1)Front flap has a very weak magnet which makes the front flap fall off too easily.2)The surrounding case does nothing to protect the screen in the event of front flap falling off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKQRY4Z3QFTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFLMUG2#wasThisHelpful","RCKQRY4Z3QFTZ","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, it would be hard to the quality of this carafe. It simply works.But there are two things about this carafe that makes it less than great.First, is the small opening which forces you to use pouring angles that are higher than it should be. In other words, it takes longer and more effort to pour the drinks than it should. Second, the thermal quality of this carafe is good only for 4 hours. If you need anything longer, then you are better off buying much more expensive Thermos brands of carafe.Pros:1)Large 2 liter capacity.2)No leaks.3)Unbeatable price for quality.Cons:1)Small mouth forces you to use more effort to pour the drinks which also takes longer to pour.2)Thermal quality isn't top notch but good enough to keep your drinks hot for 2-4 hours.

"I had the 2nd generation Kindle (2009) and most recently read all my eBooks on my 3rd generation 9.7 inch iPad (2011).I recently gave my iPad to my mother. Since I was using my iPad principally for reading eBooks, I decided to get the latest Kindle. For the most part, I was disappointed and I returned the device (I rarely return anything).The screen is about the size of a 5.5 inch smartphone. The screen is even smaller than my 2nd generation Kindle which I thought was too small. Going from 9.7 inch iPad to this Kindle for reading is like going from Cadillac Escalade to Pontiac Fiero.I think the midget screen size is fine for novels and fiction. If you read anything technical, however, then Kindle's midget screen size is really cumbersome.That's too bad because the screen, besides its size, is really ideal for reading. It responds well to touches and turning pages are quick, responsive, and intuitive. It even handles highlighting text almost as well as iPad.I do not recommend this device for those who are seeking bigger reading device.I do not recommend this device for those with 5.5 inch or larger smartphones or tablets.I recommend this device for those who would use it for reading novels and short stories with little to no illustration.Pros:1)The screen is ideal for reading text. You can read it comfortably in the dark with little to no eyestrain.2)Quick and responsive. The touch interface is intuitive. Even highlighting text is fairly fast. Page turns are also quick and almost as fast as iPad's.3)Long battery life.4)Overall easy to use.Cons:1)Screen is midget sized and no bigger than the 5.5 smartphones. If you have 5.5 inch or larger smartphone or tablet, save your money and read off of those.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2KXROBBWN1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJE3MGU#wasThisHelpful","R2N2KXROBBWN1E","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a no-frills water boiler that should meet most people's needs with some compromises.I use this at my office. I do not trust the water coming out our pantry's faucet (it has rudimentary filter). So I bring my own water to office (I have a state of the art water filtration at home) and use this boiler for my hot water needs such as coffee, tea, and even occasional ramen noodles and soup.I have a 3.2qt (about 3 liter) version that more than meets my needs as far as amount of water that needs to be stored and constantly boiled and heated.Overall, most will find this water boiler satisfactory.Pros:1)Cheaper than most.2)Works reliably and not too flimsy of a construction.3)Does NOT rust in mine. It seems the innards are coated and I do not recommend scraping the coating off.4)4 water temperatures (you will probably use all of them at some point).5)Safety dispenser (two button press required to get hot water).6)Auto shutoff so it won't become a fire hazard.Cons:1)Initially, it takes 27 minutes to boil water @ full 3 liters. That is an awful long time and way longer than most water boilers (not necessarily the same type). I have a more conventional electric kettle at home which only takes about 3 minutes to boil 1 liter of water. Please note, once water is boiled, it is purposely maintained at 4 different warm temperatures. So it will take less time to reboil it (5-10 minutes).2)When I set the water to boil (or reboil), it makes a noticeably loud water percolating buzz that is heard throughout the office for several minutes. If you are in a cubicle, I do not recommend this product as your co-workers might hate you. Noise pollution this water boiler is guilty of.3)The water is never boiled to a very high temperature. So if you need your boiled water extra streaming hot, then this water boiler will disappoint. It is plenty hot, however, for all practical needs (coffee, tea, soup, etc).4)There is no off switch. You need to unplug it.5)I highly recommend using only bottled or filtered water as all the minerals and particles will accumulate inside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAGDB2P98K7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00133WML8#wasThisHelpful","R3AAGDB2P98K7Y","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The majority of this book are quotes from famous people who eschewed religion.The list is an interesting one because the list includes many that one might think was at least somewhat religious such as Beethoven.About the first 1/3 of the book is about author's views on Christianity in particular. His central argument, in accordance with the bible, is that that to believe one's purpose is about glorifying God (Christian god) is to put oneself into a form of self-imposed slavery (god as the master). To give in to this slavery, the author argues, is to limit oneself from reaching one's true potential and to prevent oneself from seeing other versions of reality.Although I do not disagree with the author, I also think the author does make a critical mistake that many atheists tends to make. He is negative. He is anti-Christianity rather than pro-inspiration. His view fails to inspire people to feel better about themselves and the world around them, and most importantly, about the future ahead of us.The author, a former pastor, says atheism is not about dogma, and therefore, he stays away from it. But that stance also prevents him from offering an alternative to the inspirational message of Christianity (not necessarily a rational message) that many find so appealing. In my view, what he should do is to take a page out of Christianity's playbook and choose to inspire people with atheism rather than spread the ""Christianity is BS"" message.Pros:1)Well thought out book on Christianity and atheism.2)Has many good tidbits about the anti-religious beliefs of famous people.Cons:1)Majority of the book are quotes of famous people who eschewed religion (mostly Christianity).2)Too negative and fails to offer an inspirational alternative. Not everyone would find it appealing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDE48QDBBYLM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LRO7XO#wasThisHelpful","RDE48QDBBYLM0","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some books are far better off providing visualization rather than more words. This book seems to have focused on having as many words as possible to fill up a thick book. I would like to have seen more downloadable code examples, which was sufficient in quantity and quality, but still not enough to my liking.Is this book comprehensive? I think it is the most comprehensive book on SSIS I have read. Would I want to read this book from the beginning to end? No, and I am a very fast reader.On the bright side, the book is written by SSIS experts with many years of experience and its shows. They cover not only SSIS but many parts of data warehousing, SSAS, T-SQL, and even C# codes. I think this is the most authoritative book on SSIS I have read.I also think the book could have included hypothetical problem and solutions (although it implicitly provides that in the code samples).It is too bad, the book could have been just as effective with about half the words.Pros:1)Written by group of SSIS experts.2)Comprehensive coverage of SSIS and related data warehousing and SSAS concepts.3)Detailed coverage. This isn't just an overview.Cons:1)Wordy. It is as if the authors were paid by the number of words they have written.2)Lacking in specific hypotheticals and solutions.

"I have owned the original iPhone, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S5.This is the best phone I have ever owned. The next best would be the Samsung Galaxy S5.Which iPhone 6 should you buy? That depends on your needs. The iPhone 6+ has bigger screen, better battery life, and better camera (optical image stabilization). But it also comes in a bigger form factor which might be too large for many. It is worth noting that iPhone 6+ is bigger than the LG G3 (iPhone 6+ is thinner), which has the same screen size (5.5 inches) and I think LG G3 is just about the biggest phone that will fit into my pocket. To me, the iPhone 6+ is too big.The iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen which is very functionally useful. I think it could be tad bigger (about 4.8 to 5 inches). In my opinion, the 4.7 inch screen size should be satisfactory to most, especially those who are used to the 4 inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. I am used to using Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches) and I don't find the 4.7 inch screen to be too small.So what makes the iPhone 6 so special? It's the form factor (thin and light), the awesome camera, and the touch id (fingerprint sensor).First and foremost, this is a beautiful phone to see and hold. I thought iPhone 5 was beautiful, but the iPhone 6 definitely is better looking! Everyone who has seen my phone in the last 3 days wanted to buy one. The Galaxy S5 is also a thin and beautiful phone. But it is also plastic and has an ugly protruding camera in the back that makes it look like a huge wart. I didn't think I would mind it at first, but the ugliness of the huge square protruding camera really bothered me, especially because, in my view, the S5 camera picture quality was average at best.Second, the camera on the iPhone 6 is just awesome, especially compared to the Galaxy S5. I thought the Galaxy S5 would take better pictures because it is 13 megapixels. Wrong. I have had more blurry pictures with the Galaxy S5 in 4 months than I had with my iPhone 5 in 20 months. Plus, the Galaxy S5 pictures came out very grainy. They looked like they were taken with a smartphone camera. Whereas the pictures taken by the iPhone 6 looked like pictures from a dedicated digital camera. I was especially impressed with its low-light photography and surprisingly powerful flash. Even when taking pictures in low-light, the iPhone 6 camera takes wonderful pictures.Third, the Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) feature is a huge plus for me. I was initially worried that it may take too long to process my fingerprints. Wrong. It takes less than a second to identify my fingerprints. It beats punching my secret code on the screen hands down.The Samsung Galaxy S5, however, still trumps the iPhone 6 in certain areas.The first and foremost is the battery life. Although the iPhone 6 (about 24 hours with normal usage for me) lasts about 20% longer than my iPhone 5, it still can't hold a candle to my Galaxy S5 which can last over 36 hours. If a long battery life is your main need, then I would either get the S5 or get the iPhone 6 with a protective battery case.Second, the Galaxy S5 still has the superior screen. It is not only significantly bigger (5.1 inches), but it is also a full HD (1080p) screen compared to the 720p screen of the iPhone 6. Four months ago, independent tests showed that the Galaxy S5 had the best screen on a smartphone, and I believe it. Seeing them side-by-side, I have to say that I prefer the screen on the Galaxy S5 over the iPhone 6.Lastly, I think the Android platform is well on its way of trouncing Apple in both the number and the variety of apps. Android simply has stronger marketshare and Android programming skills are more widely available. This is especially true if you don't use English as your primary language. If you are looking for apps in Chinese or Spanish, for example, you are more likely to find them in Android than in the iPhone.Pros:1)Beautiful form factor. Thin and light. Even the ever-slightly protruding camera looks beautiful2)Awesome camera that takes superior pictures over Android phones such as the Galaxy S5 and Nexus 5. I was especially impressed with the low-light photography.3)Touch ID (fingerprint sensor). It is fast and easy. It makes securing your iPhone 6 very breezy and convenient. I will never use the punching passcodes again.4)Seamless integration of hardware and software that is hard to beat.5)Compatible with most car audio systems. Most Android and Windows phones are not compatible (meaning you can't play music via the USB) with car audio systems. Your Android device can, however, still play music via blutooth if your car audio system supports it. But the music quality is often sub-par.6)Internal storage is much faster than the Micro-SD cards. All iPhone storage are internal, which makes iPhone storage non-expandable but it also enables them to have faster I/O.7)Seamless integration with iTunes. I didn't think this was important until I had to sync my iTunes music with my Android phones. It was a pain.Cons:1)Very average battery life. I still can get 24 hours with normal usage (20 min talk, 20 text, facebook, emails etc.). The lack of battery life is especially apparent when compared to the Galaxy S5, which I can use for little over 36 hours with normal usage.2)Very average screen. The screen size (4.7 inches) was very acceptable. But it is only 720p. Mind you, it is still an excellent screen, but it is also very average by today's smartphone standards.3)Only 1GB of RAM. Most of the top-end Android phones have 2GB or more. The iPhone 6 is a definite laggard in this area. You would need to kill apps (double click on the round button and swipe the apps) on a regular basis to save memory.4)Not waterproof like the Samsung Galaxy S5. I took my Galaxy S5 to outdoor sports and I never had to worry about it getting wet. But I can't do the same with the iPhone 6.5)Many Non-English apps are more widely available in Android than the iPhone.6)Expensive. Android Phones with similar specs would be around $200 lower in price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAQMUDX4AL21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGUM87Y#wasThisHelpful","R3GAQMUDX4AL21","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought the Galaxy S5 would take better pictures because it is 13 megapixels. Wrong. I have had more blurry pictures with the Galaxy S5 in 4 months than I had with my iPhone 5 in 20 months. Plus, the Galaxy S5 pictures came out very grainy. They looked like they were taken with a smartphone camera. Whereas the pictures taken by the iPhone 6 looked like pictures from a dedicated digital camera. I was especially impressed with its low-light photography and surprisingly powerful flash. Even when taking pictures in low-light, the iPhone 6 camera takes wonderful pictures.Third, the Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) feature is a huge plus for me. I was initially worried that it may take too long to process my fingerprints. Wrong. It takes less than a second to identify my fingerprints. It beats punching my secret code on the screen hands down.The Samsung Galaxy S5, however, still trumps the iPhone 6 in certain areas.The first and foremost is the battery life. Although the iPhone 6 (about 24 hours with normal usage for me) lasts about 20% longer than my iPhone 5, it still can't hold a candle to my Galaxy S5 which can last over 36 hours. If a long battery life is your main need, then I would either get the S5 or get the iPhone 6 with a protective battery case.Second, the Galaxy S5 still has the superior screen. It is not only significantly bigger (5.1 inches), but it is also a full HD (1080p) screen compared to the 720p screen of the iPhone 6. Four months ago, independent tests showed that the Galaxy S5 had the best screen on a smartphone, and I believe it. Seeing them side-by-side, I have to say that I prefer the screen on the Galaxy S5 over the iPhone 6.Lastly, I think the Android platform is well on its way of trouncing Apple in both the number and the variety of apps. Android simply has stronger marketshare and Android programming skills are more widely available. This is especially true if you don't use English as your primary language. If you are looking for apps in Chinese or Spanish, for example, you are more likely to find them in Android than in the iPhone.Pros:1)Beautiful form factor. Thin and light. Even the ever-slightly protruding camera looks beautiful2)Awesome camera that takes superior pictures over Android phones such as the Galaxy S5 and Nexus 5. I was especially impressed with the low-light photography.3)Touch ID (fingerprint sensor). It is fast and easy. It makes securing your iPhone 6 very breezy and convenient. I will never use the punching passcodes again.4)Seamless integration of hardware and software that is hard to beat.5)Compatible with most car audio systems. Most Android and Windows phones are not compatible (meaning you can't play music via the USB) with car audio systems. Your Android device can, however, still play music via blutooth if your car audio system supports it. But the music quality is often sub-par.6)Internal storage is much faster than the Micro-SD cards. All iPhone storage are internal, which makes iPhone storage non-expandable but it also enables them to have faster I/O.7)Seamless integration with iTunes. I didn't think this was important until I had to sync my iTunes music with my Android phones. It was a pain.Cons:1)Very average battery life. I still can get 24 hours with normal usage (20 min talk, 20 text, facebook, emails etc.). The lack of battery life is especially apparent when compared to the Galaxy S5, which I can use for little over 36 hours with normal usage.2)Very average screen. The screen size (4.7 inches) was very acceptable. But it is only 720p. Mind you, it is still an excellent screen, but it is also very average by today's smartphone standards.3)Only 1GB of RAM. Most of the top-end Android phones have 2GB or more. The iPhone 6 is a definite laggard in this area. You would need to kill apps (double click on the round button and swipe the apps) on a regular basis to save memory.4)Not waterproof like the Samsung Galaxy S5. I took my Galaxy S5 to outdoor sports and I never had to worry about it getting wet. But I can't do the same with the iPhone 6.5)Many Non-English apps are more widely available in Android than the iPhone.6)Expensive. Android Phones with similar specs would be around $200 lower in price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3WUN057T0KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH2VLGK#wasThisHelpful","R2U3WUN057T0KT","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned the original iPhone, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S5.I have owned probably 20 phone cases and bumpers.This is definitely the best bumper I have ever owned. I have a silver iPhone 6 and I bought the gold colored bumper.The first thing I would like to say about this bumper is that it protects well. I dropped my phone about 4 feet onto a flat glass surface with this bumper on and my iPhone 6 had zero damage. Contrary to some of the reviews, this bumper has a slight protrusion both on the front and back. So it protects the phone from drops on flat surfaces on all sides, including the screen.This bumper is made of high grade materials and it shows. The polycarbonate casing does not detract from the beauty of my iPhone 6. Trust me, if you get a cheap bumper, you will get a bumper made of cheap materials that would look cheap on your iPhone. You want a bumper that would enhance the beauty of your iPhone 6 and this bumper does that.My main concern with this bumper was that it is made of two pieces and I feared they could come apart. To my pleasant surprise, the inner silicone material and the outer polycarbonate material seems to work as one. The only time I even notice they are separate parts was when I took the bumper out of my iPhone.The bumper fits my iPhone 6 like a glove. It fits so well it was actually little hard to take it out.I had no problems with the buttons. They are responsive and works flawlessly with this bumper.If you are looking for a slim high quality bumper that looks good and protects well, then I can recommend this bumper.Pros:1)Made of high quality materials that enhances the beauty of the iPhone 6. This can't be said of many cheaper bumpers.2)Fits my iPhone 6 like a glove.3)Provides reasonable protection on all sides from drops on flat surfaces.4)The two piece acts like one piece when on the iPhone 6.5)Very slim form factor.Cons:1)The protrusion on the screen side is little less than the backside. Effectively, it provides little less protection on the screen side. But it also prevents the bumper from becoming too cumbersome and ugly on the iPhone 6.2)If protection is your highest priority, then I would get a more substantial iPhone 6 cases such as the ones from Tech 21.But they come with much more bulk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NO0H6M240ZV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL6TZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R3NO0H6M240ZV8","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned the original iPhone, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S5.This is the best phone I have ever owned. The next best would be the Samsung Galaxy S5.Which iPhone 6 should you buy? That depends on your needs. The iPhone 6+ has bigger screen, better battery life, and better camera (optical image stabilization). But it also comes in a bigger form factor which might be too large for many. It is worth noting that iPhone 6+ is bigger than the LG G3 (iPhone 6+ is thinner), which has the same screen size (5.5 inches) and I think LG G3 is just about the biggest phone that will fit into my pocket. To me, the iPhone 6+ is too big.The iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen which is very functionally useful. I think it could be tad bigger (about 4.8 to 5 inches). In my opinion, the 4.7 inch screen size should be satisfactory to most, especially those who are used to the 4 inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. I am used to using Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches) and I don't find the 4.7 inch screen to be too small.So what makes the iPhone 6 so special? It's the form factor (thin and light), the awesome camera, and the touch id (fingerprint sensor).First and foremost, this is a beautiful phone to see and hold. I thought iPhone 5 was beautiful, but the iPhone 6 definitely is better looking! Everyone who has seen my phone in the last 3 days wanted to buy one. The Galaxy S5 is also a thin and beautiful phone. But it is also plastic and has an ugly protruding camera in the back that makes it look like a huge wart.

"Is it not our inevitable death that gives our life some meaning? What happens if that inevitability turns imminent?At its core, this drama is about love, forgiveness, and redemption. Don't all meaningful relationships involve all three?This is perhaps the most original drama I have ever seen. There are situations in this drama which I have never seen before because of the nature of the characters. The main character for example, played so wonderfully by Lee Yo Won who is perhaps the most talented Korean actress of her age group, has two souls. But one soul cannot reveal herself. The result is everyone, including the main character herself, rationally concludes the main character has multiple personality disorder!49 days itself has a deep meaning in Buddhism as they believe dead people's souls wander for 49 days on earth prior to going to the next life.But 49 days also has a strong metaphorical meaning. Life is short. Achieving what are seemingly easy things, such as having 3 true friends/lovers in your life, can be very difficult. ""People would never want to attend their own funeral while having the ability to see the hearts and minds of others"", says the Grim Reaper, ""because people would realize how few really loved them"".Maybe we should all live our lives as if we only have 49 days to live and strive to have least 3 people who truly loves us (outside of family) in order to prolong our lives.This drama can also be hilarious. The comedy comes out of nowhere to delight the audience with laughter. There is no slapstick comedy here but of situational comedy where only the audience understands the nuances of each other's mindset and becomes aware of how ironic the circumstances are.All the characters, even the antagonists, are highly likable at certain levels. There is no dumbed-down ""evil"" character for the sake of being evil. ""Why did you betray me?"" asks the main character to her best friend.

You simply gave things you wanted and that always made you feel superior and better than me. You thought you were just being a good friend.

"This is a phone that will delight many users looking for a medium quality phone.But it will leave those only want the most premium phones somewhat disappointed.What is not so premium about this phone? The screen, although more than adequate, is less than a premium performer.More specifically, the screen has rather mediocre color accuracy that results in images that are less than stellar to look at.To me, that is the biggest downer in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy S5.If you do want a Nexus 5-like phone but with much better screen and battery life, then you should give strong consideration to its sibling: LG G2. Nexus 5 is a water-down version of the LG G2, and the G2 specifications are almost identical except for its battery life and screen performance to the Nexus 5.As far as form factor, it is a thin phone with good camera. The body is a high-quality polycarbonate plastic. It feels very good in my hands. In my opinion, the size of this phone is perfect and I prefer its size over the slightly larger Galaxy S5.Galaxy S5 has a better screen, battery life, and larger screen size than LG G2. And LG G2 has better screen, battery life, and larger screen size than Nexus 5. This doesn't mean Nexus 5 is not a very good phone. In fact, I recommend it to those who are looking for a medium-grade phone with slight deficiencies in screen and battery performance than can be easily overlooked.Pros:1)Cheap and unlocked. You can use this phone almost anywhere where its bandwidth are supported (and that would be most places in the world). So if you travel abroad and want to use foreign SIM cards, I recommend this phone because it comes unlocked.2)Very solid all around performer. You will not feel this phone is sluggish while running any Android apps.3)Very solid polycarbonate construction with a thin frame. Bulky this phone is not.4)For me, this phone is a perfect size.5)I particularly recommend this phone for Android Developers looking for a test phone. It works great for me.Cons:1)Screen performance (color accuracy) is lacking compared to LG G2. It is a definite step below the Galaxy S5.2)Battery life, although sufficient and better than the iPhone 5, is still a definite step below the Galaxy S5. I can, however, still get around 25-30 hours of usage with normal use. That should be sufficient for most people.3)No SD Card expansion slots. So you cannot increase the storage after purchase.4)As with all recent Android phones, this phone is not compatible with my car audio which doesn't recognize this phone as a ""USB Device"". So I must use Blutooth to play music on my car stereo which has a slight but noticeably inferior audio quality.5)Not waterproof like the Galaxy S5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AKO0LR94FB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD6H0NU#wasThisHelpful","R6AKO0LR94FB1","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Worst of all, my wart was still there after 3 weeks.Now, I have a constant bandage on my arm and everyone is asking me why I always have a noticeable bandage on my forearm.I ordered the Compound W freeze-off and that works MUCH better. It is colder and needs less contact on the skin to get the wart removed.My wart has now been removed, but not because of this product.I do not recommend this product.Pros:1)None I can think ofCons:1)Clumsy to use. You will need to put a q-tip like swab upside down into a provided canister which contains a freezer.2)Not cold enough to freeze-away the warts.3)Caused a chunk of my forearm to be freeze burned.

"I have a medium/thin hair. This is the best hair gel I have ever used.It is light. It is non-greasy but it holds like much greasier maximum strength hair gels.

I can pass my fingers through my hair and still not have feel any stickiness (it may take 1-2 minutes of blow drying to reach this stage).3)No artificial looking hold.

"If made properly (meaning right amount of hot water is poured), this can be a reasonably edible breakfast.For comparison, this tastes slightly worse than Denny's, and I may even prefer this over Denny's on occasion.Don't expect miracles out of a freeze dried food. For those who complain about the taste, you are simply expecting too much. Your standards should be lowered to liking anything that doesn't make you sick. On that standard, this passes with flying colors.Okay, I became slightly bloated with gas and had to do nature's business when no one was around. But that was better than starving in the wild. Let the truth be told, I probably needed to do nature's business even if I had eaten a real breakfast.What is the downside? You need hot water, and don't forget the spoon like I did. Eating can be tough without utensils. It is an obvious fact we take for granted because no one is without a spoon in our modern society.I have eaten this twice. And I am still alive for the time being.

"What is R? If I am not mistaken, R stands for regression.This book isn't about using R for regression.The ""data science"" the authors refer to seems to involve analyzing data around basic ratios and graphs.

"If there is a herbal panacea, it would be ginseng.In oriental medicine, ginseng is widely used for variety of symptoms including increasing immunity, energy level, and boosting metabolism. It is widely prescribed to those who suffer from illness such as the flu and infections. In the ancient days, soldiers would carry precious ginseng root with them on long marches to battle. When they ran out of strength, they would eat the ginseng root which would revitalize them.Ginseng, however, is not prescribed to everyone. For those whose body temperature is considered slightly higher than normal (when people touch you, they say you feel warm/hot), then Ginseng is often not recommended. For those whose body temperature is considered slightly colder than normal (when people touch you, they say you feel cold), then Ginseng probably would help you more than most.This is the highest form of ginseng concentrate. It looks like thick gel with medium level viscosity. I take this once a day (2-3 servings per days are also considered OK), and this 240g bottle lasts about 7 weeks for me. The quality of ginseng in this bottle is considered the finest by many.Korea has been known to grow the best ginseng in the world since the ancient days. The reason is Korea is a peninsula with lot of ocean wind and moisture that flows into its mountainous geography. Those conditions are considered ideal for ginseng.If you find yourself frequently running out of energy and is highly susceptible to contagious diseases such as the common flu, then I recommend this product.So what has been the difference for me? Without taking this ginseng once a day, I cannot run 6 hours a week (one hour per day for 6 days) as I do now. Also, people say I have far better looking hair (thicker and healthier). Finally, I contracted a summer flu and I couldn't get sick because I had to make a speech in a few days. Once the symptoms showed, I began to drink this ginseng 5-6 times a day for about a week. The symptoms began to disappear immediately and all coughing and flu symptoms stopped after 5 days. I don't know of any flu medicine that could do that.Pros:1)Highest quality ginseng in a highly concentrated form.2)Highly recommended to those suffering from low energy and ""cold"" body temperatures (people say you have cold hands etc.).3)Known to boost immunity, metabolism, and longevity. Ginseng has traditionally been the most prized medicine for its healing effects.Cons:1)Expensive. It can easily amount to several dollars per day.2)Although not bad tasting, it is still an acquired taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJ250DHFMTHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CWU7BE#wasThisHelpful","RVJ250DHFMTHH","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my opinion, this is the greatest Korean drama ever. Although I haven't seen every single Korean drama (it is impossible), I have seen quite a few in my lifetime. This drama, in my view, is the best of the very best.What makes this drama special? It is about so many things we hold dear that includes love between child and parents, love between teacher and student, love of food and medicine, and love of truth and honor. Most of all, this drama is about redemption.  In my view, to live a meaningful life, one must choose to live a difficult one. Dae Jang Geum displays that in the most masterful and compelling fashion.The acting is special. It isn't just Lee Young Ae (Jang Geum), but I felt Kyun Mi Ri (Lady Choi) who plays the antagonist gave the best performance of her career. In drama such as this, the antagonist must be as formidable as the protagonist and I felt the antagonist's performance was just superb.The writing is second to none. The writers, in my opinion, were very experienced and understood the nuances of power and politics. For example, despite all her special talents and superhuman perseverance and determination, Jang Geum couldn't achieve success alone. One of her special and critical abilities were her ability to develop relationships with the right teachers and sponsors. If you want to understand politics and power, then this drama should be seen just for that reason alone.This drama has been an international hit. It isn't quite as well known in the US and Europe, but it is practically a household name in virtually every other continent.I recommend this drama especially for children. It has no sex or violence. Yet, it teaches some of the most valuable lessons in life one could learn vicariously, even for adults.Pros:1)Superb storyline that is compelling. It is about overcoming all obstacles in life by turning crisis into opportunities. It is about love and redemption. To live a meaningful life, one must choose to live a difficult one.2)Superb acting. This drama has some of the best acting Korea has to offer. Many actresses were at the peak of their abilities when this drama was shot.3)Unforgettable characters. I just will never forget them.4)Hits on all cylinders except sex and violence (there is none).5)Great for children.6)Superb portrayal of the nature of politics and power.Cons:1)Takes about 5 episodes to get going.2)Goes little overboard in terms of number of persecutions Jang Geum has to face.3)Last 4 episodes drags on the series little too long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRED99Q9ZL3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ODD1UY#wasThisHelpful","R1SRED99Q9ZL3X","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It fits that need quite nicely and I am very happy with it.The exterior is a surprisingly highly quality leather and gives it that business casual look. But the core design is a hiking shoe.

I wear US size 9 (Euro size 42) and this shoe fits my foot like a glove. Note, you would want a shoe that fits somewhat snugly because it will also expand slightly after break-in. That is especially true of a hiking shoe.Pros:1)Ideal waterproof business casual shoe. If you live in a climate that is constantly wet (rain or snow) and need a casual business shoe that will not get wet, then you have found the right shoe.2)Looks good with surprisingly high quality leather.3)Still a very capable hiking shoe when the need calls.4)Fits me exactly as expected. I wear size 9 and that size fits my foot like a glove.5)Very comfortable and ideal for mid-arched people like myself.Cons:1)The leather can be scratched against the rocks when hiking.

"This flashlight is probably my brightest flashlight. It outshines my much larger LED flashlights.LED flashlights seems to follow an exponential curve when it comes to luminosity. I have noticed that today's flashlight can easily outshine even the best LED flashlights of 4 years ago. This is one of them.I have taken this to hiking and it works wonderfully. Yes, the blinking flash feature is somewhat quirky but it can be easily overriden (just click on it two more times).What is the difference between this flashlight and the much more expensive flashlights such as Nitecore and Surefire?Mainly, Nitecores and Surefire can discharge their light in a much more concentrated manner. Think light sabres in Star Wars. They are much brighter and if you direct it at someone's face, it can temporarily blind them, which is the reason why they are often used by Law Enforcement Officers.Overall, this is a more than adequate flashlight for almost everyone and for almost any needs.Pros:1)Cheap2)Very bright (not enough to temporarily blind someone).3)Uses AA battery.Cons:1)The strobelight (flickering light) turns on way too easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSC7KXBOC3DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJESR3S#wasThisHelpful","R2DSC7KXBOC3DF","A313H6238N589","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A313H6238N589?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book made me feel a bit like that.Most of the time I keep my ""What if"" thoughts private because even my hubs who thinks I might have hung the moon will occasionally look askance at my wild meanderings so I can just imagine what someone who doesn't know me well would think.Ms Shay, I like the way you think! A time travel romance where the heroine travels so far back, the wheel isn't even invented yet.....really? And to make it from the cave guy's POV......BRILLIANT! I couldn't wait to keep turning the pages to see what happened next and I cried at the end and I think the last book that made me tear up was Old Yeller or perhaps Black Beauty when I was in first grade.I luffs Ehd, Luffs Bey! I think many authors would have just made such a situation ridiculous but for me, it was just right for the most part. Edh was simple in his thinking most of the time but he was all heart and he tried so hard to understand his mate. Heartwarming!I enjoyed this book immensely and will no doubt be covering Ms Shay Savage's back list. If they capture my attention even half as much, I would consider it money well spent indeed.Thanks for a fantastic read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0ON3N4DUWO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFV9AXY#wasThisHelpful","R2B0ON3N4DUWO4","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just recently I made the decision to start avoiding artificial sweeteners. I'm a type 2 diabetic (diagnosed 3 years ago) so I didn't want to give up the fake stuff because some of the products it's in are all I can have and aren't available with more natural sweeteners. Another thing is I have to make most of the food I eat from scratch and sometimes I get TIRED of spending so much time on food!I probably don't drink 2 sodas a month because of the sodium and artificial sweeteners. I'm so HAPPY to see this brand that doesn't even have any artificial coloring in it. It's just clear with a clean, sweet taste. There might be a bit of an aftertaste but I hardly noticed it and even though this flavor (black cherry) isn't a huge favorite, I still really enjoyed it. It's very refreshing and satisfied my desire for something sweet in the evenings. It's got a light fruity flavor and isn't overly sweet as some products with sweeteners other than sugar seem to have.I'm definitely ordering the rainbow pack. I can't wait to try the root beer with a bit of no sugar added ice cream (if I can find any without artificial sweetener in it).I highly recommend giving this a try. Maybe just a six pack to start in case you're more sensitive to any aftertaste.Thank you to the Maker/Vendor and Amazon for giving me the chance to give this a try. Definitely going on my list of diabetic must haves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29J8902MH6YGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6HI5O#wasThisHelpful","R29J8902MH6YGQ","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To keep my feet soft and nice looking, once a week I use Emjoi Micro-pedi nano to get rid of the rough stuff and then I slather my feet with Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment, then socks. I have to do this at bed time because the Eucerin - which works fabulously - is so greasy you really couldn't wear it during the day or I would think it might stain some types of shoes. The rest of the week, I had been using some Jergens after showering and that seemed to work pretty well.After using the Ahava, I like it better. I can use it whenever and not have to just save it for bed time. It makes my feet super soft and no slathering is required. A little goes a long way and it seems to soak in fast so I don't have to wait to finish getting dressed. I'm still going to have to use the Emjoi but now at least I can do my pedicure any time of day and won't have to try to remember to do it before bed.This one's a keeper for me.Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for giving me the chance to try this out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NEYX91NA955T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R2NEYX91NA955T","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cups are very like the red solo cups you see at tail gate parties or camping a lot.It says they hold 18 ounces however, that is almost to the very top of the cup with just a small margin around the rim. While you're carrying it, if it's full and you accidently squeeze the sides, it'll cascade over the top. To me, it comfortably holds around 14-16 ounces.I regularly buy these cups and use them for eating soup out of or mixing scrambled eggs, etc as well as drinking out of. I'm a T2 diabetic so I have to make a lot of my food from scratch to stay on the diabetic ""wagon"" so when it comes to dirty dishes, it's like 5 people live here instead of just my husband and I so anything that means I don't have so many dishes to wash is a very good thing.If we drink liquids out of these then I rinse and use at least once more but if I eat soup or even at time, spaghetti or whatever, then it goes into the garbage. Another added benefit is if we're in the middle of a movie, these are very easy to carry into the livingroom and eat out of them. In fact, to me it's easier than trying to balance a plate on my lap, just make sure whatever you're having isn't super hot because you'll definitely feel it through the cup.These cups are very useful for lots of different things. I feel sort of bad about using so much plastic, but I feel even worse getting stuck doing great gobs of dishes every day and I use my own market bags to save on paper/plastic at the grocery so that kind of evens things out right?No doubt I'll buy more of these in the future.Thank you Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for allowing me to give these a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMFCM3B63L5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHJMBCE#wasThisHelpful","R3BMFCM3B63L5U","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using a sonicare toothbrush for about the past 18 months or so. Around 6 weeks or maybe 2 months ago, I had my teeth cleaned. At that time, I asked the dental tech if she noticed any difference in the scale on my teeth. She consulted my chart and said ""Not too much. You tend to accumulate scale a bit faster than average"".  I was disappointed because I thought the Sonicare would help with that.I like the Sonicare well enough except it's intense and when I brush the backs of my front teeth, I have to hold the bridge of my nose because the vibration will make me want to sneeze and it's not good to sneeze with a mouthful of saliva and toothpaste. Big mess.I probably would have just continued to use my sonicare because it was costly and it does work better than a manual toothbrush but then Vine offered me this set of Spinbrushes. I've used Spinbrushes in the past and LOVED them! I like that they are battery operated so no charging. If I'm away from home and it begins to run down, I just change the batteries. If the sonicare brush quits at home then I have to finish using a manual toothbrush. I never have that happen with the Spinbrushes.I also like that they have both a round head and the rectangular section. I feel like I'm brushing a greater area so in the two minutes I take to brush, I'm covering more ""ground"" than I do with the Sonicare which has a very small, almost child sized rectangular brush area. Also, the Spinbrushes don't make me want to sneeze and are not so intense as to be uncomfortable.Since my dental hygienist didn't notice a huge difference between the Spinbrush (which was what I used before sonicare) and my sonicare, I'd rather use the Spinbrush.This set includes Arm & Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste (which we really like), two brushes and two extra heads so this will last me probably about 5-6 months before I have to buy more heads and in the past, I've had the Spinbrush base last literally a couple of years. Lots of times I just replaced them because I wanted a different color or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.If you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that's what I'll be using for a long time to come. They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom and it's always taken up with other appliances.I highly recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEEXI87JBD50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XPSWGA#wasThisHelpful","RKEEXI87JBD50","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband works hard and sweats a lot while at work. Since he works out doors, in the summer, I get him white t-shirts. I generally wait until I've got a few in the laundry and wash them using hot water and a bit of bleach to get the yellowish underarm stains out that are sometimes left on the shirt and that regular detergent won't budge. I notice that using the bleach seems to shorten the life span of the shirts eventually and after a few washes, they sometimes start developing those tiny pin holes in them. I've tried using detergent boosters in place of the bleach like Borax or Oxiclean and they just don't work as well as bleaching.I washed several of the white shirts using this Whisk deep clean and the stains definitely lightened. They didn't completely disappear but I think if I washed them again it would help and using this detergent from the get go when the stains are still very light, might have taken care of the problem completely with the added benefit that this Whisk is not hard on the material in the way bleach is.Though my husband doesn't like this scent as well as Gain detergent, he liked it well enough to keep using these Whisk pods. Also, I don't have to babysit the load like I do when I use bleach. I don't trust my washer to dispense the bleach like it should so I have to fill first, add the bleach, let the washer agitate a minute to mix and then add the clothes. Plus, no bleach scent on the clothes either.I like this enough to keep using. I still might have to bleach once in awhile (time will tell with that) but I think it will keep those ugly stains away much longer than my regular detergent and that will extend the life of the cotton tee's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BZG3089MU08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0FAXQ4#wasThisHelpful","R35BZG3089MU08","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took these as directed, starting out with one per day for a week and then going to two the second week.The first week I couldn't feel a thing. I have T2 diabetes, am going into menopause and have a thyroid that's off. All of that and my meds cause fatigue so some days I'm exhausted from the time I get up through the day. One tab of these was no match for my fatigue.The second week, I did notice a little energy but it was too little and unfortunately, there was a much bigger ""crash"" feeling as it wore off. I can't be having a crash and dealing with my already (sometimes) giant economy-sized fatigue.Bottom line: Just not working for me.

"I like this balm. My hair is fine and sometimes flyaway and I have just enough curl that I can't just leave it, I either have to curl it more or straighten with a flat iron. The balm does tame my flyaways and my hair is super straight when I finish blowing it dry and flat ironing it. To me, this compares favorably with John Frieda Frizz Ease so if you like that, this might work for you as well.I have to say, I didn't particularly like the fragrance of this product. It dissipates to a more bearable level by the time I've blown my hair dry and straightened it. I can still smell it but it's not quite so overpowering and I don't feel like it will compete with whatever perfume I have on. Someone would have to get pretty close to you to smell it once your hair is dried and styled.This seems like it leaves my hair shinier than what I get with the Frizz Ease however, I think if I was using this on a regular basis, I would probably need to use a clarifying shampoo after every 4-5 uses of the Tresemme balm because I think eventually it'll build up on hair and this doesn't make me hate the product because lots of hair products build up eventually so I wouldn't let that aspect keep me from buying.The consistency of this product is sort of like syrup and it goes along way so apply with a bit of caution until you see how much you need to get the result you want. Better to have a little to little than too much has been my experience.I am going to continue to use my Frizz Ease or Fekkai Prx oil but for times when I really want some shine then I'd use this product again.Bottom Line: Regarding price, performance and scent and the fact that it does leave my hair nice and shiny, I would give this 3.75 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R81IXLVPU44M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJLD8#wasThisHelpful","R1R81IXLVPU44M","A19SDJ2TSSL8HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19SDJ2TSSL8HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the taste of this is okay but I have a lot of reservations about everything else about it.1. The rice is sort of mushy to me and not as firm as I'm used to when I cook rice.2. Not a particularly healthy choice. In 9 ounces of food there are 44 grams of carbs and 890 mg of sodium and you can really taste the salt. For me, it's almost too salty to eat. You could cut the salt by adding a little chopped tomato or something like that but the point of a ready meal is so that you don't have to do any work to it. Just heat and eat. Maybe if I liked this a bit more, I'd be more willing to doctor it up but for me, it's like putting lipstick on a pig.3.

"Argh......... Now lets see here....... I am going to give you guys a TRUE review of this game and hopefully I do not get hate for this review. I have played many JRPGs and this games COMPLETELY matches a JRPG. If you TRULY love JRPGs then BUY this game, I guarantee that you will LOVE it. I, on the other hand love the game!!! It has VERY CREATIVE and COLORFUL graphics NOT GREAT graphics. I seen on another review that this game had horrible graphics and they compared this game to zelda, uncharted, and some other NON NON NON NON NON NON JRPGs....... This game is made to have lower quality graphics, but they look and feel better than what zelda or uncharted has to offer. I am not going to review the story or gameplay because you can just go LOOK IT UP OR WATCH VIDEOS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME!!  I give this game a solid 4/5. it is not a perfect 5 stars because I have played better JRPGs. But if you love JRPGs then BUY this game. It is a MUST have for your collection. If you are one of those (waaaaa!!! the graphics are too corny and unrealistic for me to be wasting my time playing) then you should not have bought this game and you should not have put a negative review towards this game. The hype on this game is legit. It is a WONDERFUL JRPG. But when you start comparing it to games like Skyrim, Persona, Uncharted, Zelda..... it does make this game look bad. All of those other games are DIFFERENT STYLED GAMES!!!!! They were intended to have better graphics with less color variations, while Wrath of The White Witch is intended to have lesser quality graphics but with extreme variation in colors. Comparing this game to Uncharted is like comparing Mortal Kombat X to Mario Party....... TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLED GAMES!!!!!!

And whatever other cards you want in the extra deck.Eleventh of all Black Rose Dragon, Stardust Dragon, Armades, Keeper Of Boundaries, and Mist Wurm are pricey cards. BUT Black Rose Dragon is getting a reprint as a TIN PROMO in a few months.....so it will go from 20 dollars to a 2 dollar card. :D Stardust Dragon was a 20 dollar card but it got a reprint as a promo and is around 2 to 3 dollars........ but The Black Rose Dragon reprint will be coming in October. But you DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT TO WIN. It just helps you win.Twelfth of all if you want to use a level 7 Synchro instead of Black Rose Dragon then you can use a card called Scrap Archfiend. It has 2700 attack but it has no ability. But you can destroy almost any monster in the game with it. :D Scrap Archfiend is only like 1 or 2 dollars. It is better at times than Black Rose Dragon is. Armades, Keeper Of Boundaries is a 20 dollar card. And it WILL MOST LIKELY get a reprint in the yugioh MEGA-TINS. The tins are coming out on August 29, 2014 THIS YEAR!!!!!.Thirteenth of all is that the mega tins MIGHT reprint number 101 silent honors ark, dracossack, number 11 big eye, and exciton knight. The four cards I just mentioned are 30 dollars or higher.Fifteenth of all DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY DECK. IT IS NO GOOD AND YOU WILL NEVER WIN ANY TOURNAMENT WITH IT........ JUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER GUYS I PROMISE IT WILL BE WORTH YOUR TIME!!!!!!THANKS FOR READING THIS REALLY LONG REVIEW, BUT IF YOU DID READ IT, YOU LEARNED SOME VALUABLE THINGS.

I am a hardcore DBZ fan and I waited so long to play this, just to see:Bad Graphics (I know graphics don't mean everything, but this is the time for PS4s/XB1s/PS3/360s, it needs at least good graphics)Bad Gameplay (The story is terrible and yes I know, they had to change it but I do not like it. They can't write a story worth looking at)Bad Fighting Mechanics (All you do is press the Triangle (on the PS3) button and... You just hit three times and you teleport to where they are at.)Looks like play doughNot funBoring and blandOverall, please do not buy this game, I promise you it will be a total waste of money. If you would like to get a truly fun game, go and check out Dragon Ball: Raging Blast or Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2. I have both of these games and they are fantastic. :)This game should not be worth the price it is at, if I was to sell my copy I'd sell it for around 10. Overall, my rating on this poor excuse for a Dragon Ball/Z/GT game an ultimate 1-10.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDYVN3PT8QKIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNGQTFI#wasThisHelpful","RDYVN3PT8QKIU","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hello! I just started playing Pokemon (TCG and Video Games) again after the ending of HeartGold and SoulSilver and kept on trying to find reviews on decks that would be good or not. So I decided to go and try them out myself just to be for sure. Please note that I like playing out fast combos and dealing massive damage but if you aren't that type of player, then you might want to try decks out yourself until you find one that you'll like. I only tried theme decks from Next Destinies and now to make sure they are all safe to use (because of the list, it says you must only play with cards from Next Destinies and up) so you do not worry if the deck is not able to be used competitively or not. I have found that this is the best theme deck for my liking since you are able to search the dragons you need (mainly Garchomp) with Gabite's Ability ""Dragon Call"". It's a pretty nice Ability to have and get the deck combo pieces going ASAP. I used this against people at my locals who play competitively and have topped, especially because of Gabite and Milotic being able to do so many searches and end the game pretty fast. This deck only come with one Milotic and two Feebas so I'd suggest three Feebas and 2 Milotic, I added those in for the upcoming tournament (this Saturday) and it has done even better. Also, for the cheap price of Emolga (full art from Legendary Treasures) you can get even more cards onto the Bench (well Basic Pokemon that is) but you are, for sure, then able to evolve ASAP without hoping for a top deck. Happy battling trainers!! :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99FCCY5QK4VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UB46BA#wasThisHelpful","R99FCCY5QK4VK","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My God... I don't even know where to start. Well, this card is way too powerful, people always quit when someone plays it. The card is just so beyond out there that it truly ruins the game at some points. I play Lightsworns and I have won 2 tournaments at my locals and there were Spellbook, Chaos Dragon, Chaos Agent, Blackwing, Junky Synchro, Exodia and Constellar players for the last two times (the first time there was also Battlin' Boxers) and I beat all of the decks 2-0 except for Exodia in which he beat me his first turn via Exodia pieces in hand. Then I got to choose who goes first, I obviously did, I set a Anti-Spell Fragrance (I had it sided) and Sixth Sense in my S/T zone and set a Ryko in my Monster Zone. Then it was his turn and I used Anti Spell Fragrance and he set a full backrow and ended his turn, the next turn he had all Spells set except for a Legacy of Yata-Garasu and I had chained Sixth Sense. I milled 5 Lightsworns and Special Summoned Wulf (which made exactly four in grave) due to it's eff from when milled played my two JD in my hand, and summoned Lyla but did not use effect and won game in that one turn and proceeded to Dragon Rulers in which I beat 2-0.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWGFD8WA7K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQUA9O6#wasThisHelpful","R1HWGFD8WA7K9","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The game isn't THAT bad. I decided to use a couple of bucks just too see if this was nearly as bad as people are saying and it isn't, they are honestly being Dragon Ball (canon) fanboys. I actually loved GT and they might not know it but Akira actually helped with GT. lol I guess they were basically calling his ideas lame, uninspired, cheap, and that SSJ4 was a let down. I am 17 and have always loved Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT and I swear that either they are kids posting this or they literally know nothing of Akira Toriyama's work... This generation of kids is.. Weird.. What with the whole ""graphics mean everything and all"" I know I am young too but I still enjoy my GBA and PS2.... :P Anyways, the game is fun, it has pretty good graphics for a GBA game, but it does have some glitches though. Not to worry, the glitches don't ruin gameplay, it makes it funny, cool and better actually. xD Also, if you want my honest opinion on what the best Dragon Ball game is for GBA, it is Supersonic Warriors hands down!!

"I have been buying UltraPro sleeves for a while but they got old and wrinkled on the top really fast. So I thought to myself, why waste5 bucks on those lousy card sleeves when I could try out new ones? Well, I wanted Orange card sleeves because it's my favorite color. So, I bought these and happily waited, when they came in I was happy with them because they didn't have that mat finish on the back which gets really annoying. I put them on my cards and for the past two weeks they still look and feel brand-new!! No wrinkles on the top, it has extra space on the top so cards don't fall out (which UltraPro doesn't have.. -_-) and I am actually a pretty rough shuffler. The front is nice and crystal clear still and my cards still look awesome! So all in all, these are WAY better sleeves than those retarded UltraPro ones!!

"My little brother was looking for a great tin in Walmart, I showed him the Prophecy Destroyer tin and he was wondering which tin to get, Hanzo or Destroyer. I told him how bad the Hanzo tin was and he didn't think I was correct on my info and so he called our friend Mike. My friend Mike has gotten the Hanzo tin twice and both tins were very bad. Hanzo itself isn't all that great and it should not have had it's own tin. Many people agree with me on that one! So he went and got the Destroyer tin (oh and by the way, this just happened about an hour ago) then he seen the promos and was satisfied with them, then he went and opened up a Photon Shockwave booster and what do you know, he pulled a Secret Rare Rescue Rabbit. That right there already made his money back with that ONE card. Then he opened the Galactic Overlord booster and pulled an Inzektor Exa-Stag, not worth much but it's still a nice Ultra Rare to get! Then he got a Super Rare Dark Diviner which is actually really good! Then the other boosters he got the rares and commons but they were all useful and not crappy like the Hanzo tin.

"Okay, I have to admit... These are the best packs I have got in a very long time!! I would first like to say that I did in fact quit Pokemon for a while (since 2011, when Black and White came out for DS) because Yu-Gi-Oh! got my attention again and Cardfight!! Vanguard totally destroyed my love for Yu-Gi-Oh! and so I went on to it and I still play and collect Vanguard cards. Anyways, I seen Pokemon X and Pokemon Y on youtube (the video game commercials) and it got my hype in Pokemon back up so I decided to give it another shot. Once I decided to get back into Pokemon (I am now 17, my birthday is on Valentine's Day just so you know how long I had quit oh and no, Pokemon is not for kids only -_-), well back to what I was saying, when I got that Pokemon-Hype-Trainer-Feel I decided to look up some of the best boosters and their card lists on youtube and Bulbapedia (The Pokemon Encyclopedia) so I found out that Pokemon Black and White: Boundaries Crossed was a sweet booster and decided to get one. I went to Walmart and as usual, their so-called great deals on all things was a complete sorry lie, the booster packs AS ALWAYS...... $4.99, I completely wondered why the heck I was even their and remembered that there was my faithful Amazon and it's epic sellers like ABCTOY4ME, CardRush, Toynk Toys etc. and decided to get on here and buy 3 Pokemon boosters for $9.40 which is a totally freaking awesome deal because I would have only got two if I were at Walmart. They came in fast, were properly packaged and the sweet foil cards I got were: Gliscor, Golduck (which is so hard to get, geez!!), Raticate and... WHITE KYUREM BABY!!!! WOO!!!!

Movie) and I also found one that was already opened and a booster pack was stolen but was still able to buy it cheaper than the 9.99 it was originally worth and the thief must have not a good pack because they left two of the cards from the booster. Well anyways, I first opened up the one that was not ripped from the thief and pulled some pretty freaking awesome cards!! Then it came to the last pack of the first box and sure enough, it was The Duelist Genesis and I pulled ""The Selection"", not a bad card for back in the day and yes, I did pull better cards in fact they were two Supers and an Ultra. Then I went on to the second box and hoped for some better pulls and sure enough... I GOT WAY BETTER PULLS!! The first booster pack (since there was only four) was The Duelist Genesis and I did not expect to pull a Red Dragon Archfiend and I did, I was really happy and honestly did not expect to see another good card in any of the other boosters and then.. It happened again! I got a Super Rare Cyber Shadow Gardna (from a different booster) and then went on to the third and pulled a Rare and so I was really happy but I had one more booster pack and I honest to God did not even expect to pull another freaking awesome card and sure enough, I pulled an Ultimate Rare Neos Alius. Anyways, that booster pack The Duelist Genesis (TDGS) was so awesome because I was looking for a Red Dragon archfiend in mint condition in a booster pack and then I just got it! I am just really happy with the pulls and I recommend that you guys buy this booster pack!! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKKFE2F3JFHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F13T0G#wasThisHelpful","R1TKKFE2F3JFHS","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought mine from mongkok who was selling them really cheap and I was very happy with the order, they came in fast, packaged very well and non of the cards were damaged. I pulled some sweet cards and I am happy I bought from that seller and I would buy from him in a heartbeat, I would advise for you all to buy from him if you ever get the chance because he sells them the cheapest and they come in in a neat and nice package. If some of you do not know what Cardfight!! Vanguard is then please look it up on Wikipedia or go on youtube.com and search ""CARDFIGHTVanguard"" and you can then watch the anime on there.

"Hello everyone!! I am a 16 year old and I have ALWAYS been a Sony fan, my friend got this same exact controller off amazon, usually all the items on amazon are real and no bootlegs but I have something bad to tell all of you... If you EVER try buying this all I have to say is... IT IS FAKE. The controller is junk, it skips, Start button does not always work, barely holds charge and the MOST noticeable is the ""P3"" symbol instead of the ""PS3"" Home button. It also is made with sharp edges which is not supposed to be made like, Sony always takes the time to round off those sharp edges for better, and less annoying gaming. So if you do not believe me, fine, whatever, go and buy the piece off junk FAKE PS3 Controller and experience it for yourself.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKJI23F206L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UI9BT8#wasThisHelpful","RZKJI23F206L0","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyblade Metal Fusion Battle Tops - Lightning L-Drago 100HF (BB-43)I bought this Beyblade last year and I don't remember writing a review, well all I have to say is that this Beyblade is really fun and great for an attack type. I have had sop many Beyblades during the time I was collecting them and Lightning L-Drago easily topples it's evolution Beyblade, Meteo L-Drago and took on some of my 4D Beyblades and won. Now I was really surprised because not only was it high in attack but was also high in stamina which is something you obviously can't see in an attack type Beyblade!! Well overall this is one of the best Beyblades to get, left spin, high attack power, good stamina, and does not recoil nearly as much as the Storm Fusion Wheel. I would recommend this to all who have wanted this Beyblade or is searching for a great attack type!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNO7K8EMBXQ33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I86BT0#wasThisHelpful","RNO7K8EMBXQ33","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game was a gift for me a couple months ago and I was so happy to receive this because I haven't played a Dragon Ball Z game in years. I happily put it in my xbox 360 SLIM and then nearly cried and I literally took the game out and broke it in half and bought me Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2. Here is the horrible thing(s) about the game:1) The gameplay is horrible, not only is the gamestyle bad and is barely anything like it shows on the case, it is the same repetitive fight seen over and over and over again. Throw, kick, punch, land on the ground, throw, kick, punch land on the ground and you can keep doing this until you defeat your opponent which is really retarded. Overall, the story mode and fighting= COMPLETE WASTE OF ANYONE'S TIME UNLESS THEY HAVE NEVER PLAYED DBZ BEFORE!!2) You do not get many characters that are fun to play with, you can't even get a SS3 Goku, and all of us true DBZ fans would love to see SS3 Goku and instead you get SS1 OR 2 Goku and everyone else is flat-out boring or weak. The fighting would be great if there was different cutscenes and no corney business during them points of the game. If you all want a real DBZ game, I would recommend DBZ: Budokai 3, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Raging Blast 1 and Raging Blast 2 and last but not least Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit.3) The multiplayer mode is OKAY I guess... But yet again, there is still that retarded same seen, the same throw, the same kick, the same punch and the same ground landing. It's boring to just sit there and not be able to defeat your opponent until it is over about 10-15 minutes later and you have barely any health at all. Us real fans actually want to be able to FIGHT not sit there and watch that same scene for about 5 minutes until you lose or something like a miracle happens.4) The graphics are good, I could give it that and you can make your own character so go on and get it if you want to make a fake Dragon Ball AF (Alternate Future or April Fools as some of you THINK you know) character (my personal favorite from the AF team is SS5 Goku).5) Here is where it gets to the true part of the game and seeing where it all leads off: The story literally makes no sense because none of that really happened (some parts did but most of it is COMPLETE GARBAGE) so the game really shouldn't have been made. There is not that many fighting aspects and you don't even get that many combos.----------- BOTTOM LINE----------- DO NOT GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO DOES NOT LIKE STICKING TRUE TO DBZ AND GT. THE GAMEPLAY IS AWFUL AND THE FIGHTING IS REALLY BAD SO DON'T BELIEVE THOSE PICTURES AND IF YOU GET IT THEN ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I WARNED YOU!!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W63K2NXJMKTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O6G8C6#wasThisHelpful","R2W63K2NXJMKTX","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Beyblade is not worth getting if you are planning to go to a tournament, for one, it is too heavy so you have to have a String Launcher, and also, it's Mode Change everyone says that is good, is not good at all. The first time you get it you'll be happy and everything but when you start to use it for tough battles, it will not have much stamina. The Mode Change it has can make it have good, or bad or balanced out stamina, so you would be guessing what will happen in the next battle (in other words, it is too risky in a battle against a Beyblade like Big Bang Pegasus F:D). I personally own Big Bang Pegasus F:D and I have brought it to a tournament quit a few times myself, I like Big Bang Pegasus more because it's attack is more likely to not recoil nearly as much as Diablo Nemesis and also it has really great stamina for an attack type which is very rare to see in an attack type Beyblade. Big Bang Pegasus also has a Mode Change, it has four Mode Changes, the first is when you take the PC Frame and turn it until it stops on a bump and it shows on the side a comet and that is the Attack Mode then move it back and wait for it to go on a bump again and it will be in it's Stamina Mode/Defense Mode. Now with the Core and Fusion Wheel take Big Bang Pegasus apart and then switch the parts to a left or right until the same as above mentioned about the PC Frame happens, yes, those are in fact Big Bang Pegasus's ""Wings Of Victory"". I prefer that you all get Twisted Tempo/Basalt Horogium instead of Diablo Nemesis X:D.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GPOQ3PBPXAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00670VHW2#wasThisHelpful","R12GPOQ3PBPXAB","A1KG9IOJZRD9L6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KG9IOJZRD9L6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is pretty cool.  You write notes on it like you would write on a chalk board, and then when you're done, you hit a button and it erases.  There is no way to save your notes on the device.  There is an app, but it's currently only available for Apple products.  Since I have mostly Android products, that doesn't work for me. :(  I guess I can take pictures with my phone though.This actually reminds me of a toy I had when I was a kid.  There was a black wax thing in back, and a plastic sheet in front.  You wrote with a stylus on the plastic, and it would stick to the wax where the stylus touched, and you can see what you wrote.  You erased it by pulling up the plastic.  On this, you write with a stylus, and you erase it by hitting the button.This does not leave a mark just by resting your hand on it.  You have to use something a little sharper, but not sharp enough to scratch.  The stylus is perfect, and you can use your fingernails too.  Turns out a cat's claw will do it too.There is no way to just erase part of the picture - it's all or nothing.  The board will make a mark all the way to the edges.  You can use the stylus as a kickstand, but you can't use it as a stylus at the same time.  (Well, duh. :) )  There is an app to help you save your notes, but it's only available at the Apple appstore.  Hopefully there will be an android version soon.  There are magnets on the back, so you can attach it to your fridge.  It's kind of hard to detach the stylus when it's attached to the fridge, but it's easier to write on when it's on a horizontal surface anyway.This is $27.97 as of this writing.  That's a little pricey for what's really a glorified whiteboard.  But it's a really cool toy.  If it was a little cheaper and if the app was available for Android, I would probably give this 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKFAYOCQG6GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HWCEFY#wasThisHelpful","R1LKFAYOCQG6GC","A35X2JJI49OBZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X2JJI49OBZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ow.  I'm assuming these work really well because I'm really sore right now, and I couldn't even do the recommended number of reps.But I will!You can do two kinds of push ups with these - wobbly ones or rotating ones.  With the rounded bottom, you have to use extra muscles to stabilize your arms as you move.  (Do not rotate these while using the rounded bottoms!)  With the rotating bottom, you get more range of motion action.And with minimal muscle tone, it's going to take a while to work up to these.  If you can't do more than a couple of regular push ups anyway,  these will certainly help strengthen you, but it's going to take a while before you're bouncing up and down like they do in the commercials.  My husband, who actually CAN do about 20 push ups in a row without falling over, had to work harder to use these.  I could do 3, and that was the ""girl"" way or ""bent leg"" version.  But, darn it, I'm going to be able to do 8 before Christmas!The hand grips are comfortable, and the rotating mechanism works smoothly.  There is an exercise guide included that has pictures and explains how to do different types of push ups.  The people in the pictures have much better muscle tone than I do.  It is very easy to get the rounded bottoms on and off.If you ACTUALLY use this, you will get an amazing workout.  Not only does this work your arms and shoulders, but it gets your core as well.  Think planking with movement.  You get a slightly different workout depending on how you hold your hands (vertical or horizontal) and whether you're rotating or wobbling.  This is waaaayyyy harder than a regular push up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182H4ABL8AVQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146N7FA4#wasThisHelpful","R182H4ABL8AVQQ","A35X2JJI49OBZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X2JJI49OBZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a Viewmaster when I was a kid in the 70s.  Every vacation, we would get a set of reels.  I remember when they came out with 3D ones - the static images were offset so that it looked like the images were 3D.  Totally cool.This blows that little toy away.  Yes, you have to have a rather large smartphone to make this work - mine is a Galaxy Note 4.  It fits perfectly if you take it out of its case, which is something I forgot and then couldn't figure out why it was so darn hard to get out of the Viewmaster.  Oh yeah - duh.You have to download an app to make this work.  It seems to me that I couldn't find all of the apps on the Amazon appstore, but I found them on Google Play.  I also received 3 packets with Destinations, Space, and Wildlife.  These are add on ""games"".  The VM comes with a preview reel that lets you play with it out of the box (once the app is downloaded), but I was actually having so much fun playing with the full versions that I didn't really care about the preview reel.  The reels are not needed, but you do need the apps.  You can look at the reels and see a cute little 3D hologram thing - cool, but not worth the price of admission.  The apps, on the other hand, are really neat.  With this up to your face (phone in, turned on, and running the app), you can look around and see things from all angles.  There is a button on the side (kind of like the lever you used to push to advance to the next picture) that will let you select things.I am of an age where I can't focus terribly closely any more, and even though my phone was literally inches from my eyes, I was able to see the images clearly without glasses.  This is good because there is nothing on the VM to let you adjust the view.  I guess you can wear glasses with this as long as they aren't too bulky.If you go out to YouTube and type in ""Google Cardboard Videos"", it will bring up several free videos that you can use this with.  This is basically a glorified Google Cardboard device, so you can certainly view those.  In fact, there's (at least) one video that will show you how it works.  As of this writing, this is priced at $30, so it's in-between the prices of the actual cardboard devices (mostly $10-$20) and the higher end phone VR things (mostly $30-$45).  While this won't hold up to repeatedly dropping it off the roof of your house, it will withstand slight drops (i.e. from experience - off the sofa), and it will hold up to crushing and water better than cardboard will.There is no head strap - you have to hold it to your face.  I prefer this, but I can see where some people might get annoyed.  If you are using the VM games, you have to have your hand on the device anyway to select planets or animals or whatever.  If you are watching a movie, holding it to your face would get old.This should fit phones in the 5-6"" screen range.  It will fit the larger iPhones (with the included adapter) and the Galaxy S4-S6 and Galaxy Notes 4 & 5.  The list on the back of the box includes Moto X (2014), Droid Turbo, LG G3 & G4, HTC One, and Nexus 5 & 6.You do have to have your phone on and running the app for this to work.  That means it burns through the battery.  You cannot have your phone plugged in to anything (headphones or charger) when it's inside the VM.  My phone (Galaxy Note 4) got a little warm after about half an hour.Since I am apparently a 6 year old at heart, I think this is one of the coolest toys I've ever played with.  (The fact that I had an old style one growing up might play into that. :) )  This would be a great gift for someone in the 6-12 year old range.  Someone in the 12-15 year old range would probably like it too, but they would roll their eyes at getting such a ""baby"" gift.

"We have several kitties, and some of them are kind of huge.  This is not a large cat tree, but it still will hold 3 cats.  Our Maine Coon (who is small for an MC - he's 14 lbs) loves the little house on top.This is pretty cute, but it's not as easy to clean as it should be considering cats like to hork up hairballs unexpectedly.  The screws that hold the ""trunks"" in place are open to the air, so they can get goop inside.  I'm not entirely sure how easy this is to clean - I'm used to carpet and this is kind of like velour.  It feels great now though.  I'm not sure how it's going to feel after cleaning vomit off of it a few times.This seems to be pretty sturdy.  The kitties have explored it quite thoroughly and haven't knocked it down yet.This is fairly easy to put together.  I did it by myself in about half an hour.  The top two bits (the house & stand) went together very easily.  getting the main (bottom) trunk attached to the two floors was a little harder.  It would have been easier with another person holding the pieces together while I screwed the bits together.  But I made it, darn it!  The instructions were easy to follow.This is good!  It's probably best if you have smaller cats, but since big cats like little boxes, it works OK for big cats as well.Though to be perfectly honest, the kitties were absolutely delighted with the box it came in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQ2FJTRFIH9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY2701I#wasThisHelpful","R2SQ2FJTRFIH9T","A35X2JJI49OBZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X2JJI49OBZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is brilliant!  Spaghetti in 14 minutes instead of... Well, I'm not sure how long it takes to boil enough water, but it's that plus 9 minutes.  Which I'm pretty sure is longer than 14.  The instructions said that this is good for microwaves up to 900 watts.  My microwave is 1100 watts, so I had to use this on power 8.  I used whole wheat spaghetti, and it took 14.5 minutes to cook it to just past al dente.  That was for 2 servings.You can cook up to 4 servings of spaghetti in this.  A serving is 2 ounces of dry pasta.  If you're using spaghetti, there is a circle in the bottom of this to show you how much spaghetti is in a serving.  There are also little hatch marks in the back to tell you how much water to put in.  Then nuke it for a while.  When you're done, there's a lip around the container to hold and keep you from scalding yourself on the steam.  There's a colander built in, so you just tilt it over the sink to drain the water.  Add your favorite sauce and too much Parmesan cheese, and you're good!Super easy!  And as of this writing, this is all of $15.

"I did not have the problems with the lid staying on that other reviewers had.  There are grooves in the bottom that hold the filter, and it turns out that the filter has to be oriented correctly, otherwise the lid won't close at all.  I'm not sure about the counter that tells you when to change the filter.  I don't know how it knows how often I change the water.  It also doesn't know that I live in Arizona, where the water is so hard that it's almost crunchy.

"I will start with the good parts.  I like the style of the watch. It is heavy and the band it thick leather with stitching. It looks good.Now the bad:They put numbers on the face that are too small to read. There is a needle pointer to indicate the date but it would be hard to tell if it was pointed at the 4 or between the 4 and 6 to indicate 5.Others have already indicated that this does not live up to the title of Pro Divers watch.  I echo this here because it cannot be said enough that this is not waterproof and does not have a screw down crown. It says water resistant to 100M on the back but I don't believe it.The instructions for the watch are general for many, many Invicta watches.  You are expected to select the watch based on the functions it has to find the page that explains how to set it.  For the price, it can have its own instructions.There is the crown and two buttons.  The top button advances the day of the month the lower button advances the 24 hour dial. Both these buttons function whether the crown is in our out so you will need to make sure you don't press it accidentally.Lastly I will say that the price is ridiculous. It is listed as a $900.00 watch and sold at 90% off making it a $90 watch.  I can honestly say I would buy a Casio or Timex for $25 and be much happier with my purchase.In summary, for a nearly $100 watch you can do much better with a little bit of shopping. This is a good looking watch but has little else going for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOTIDH697LKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y1LY#wasThisHelpful","RYOTIDH697LKR","A35X2JJI49OBZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X2JJI49OBZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very curious about this product - it seemed like a brilliant idea, but how does it taste?  Is it worth the money?  Is it convenient?As long as you have a K-cup machine, this is very convenient.  I don't have access to one at work, so this only works for me at home.As far as taste goes, this is very Top Ramen-y.  I think it tastes good, but that's probably because of all the salt.  There are 750mg of sodium in one cup.  There are also 4g of protein, so this isn't completely horrible for you.  But that's about a third of the maximum amount of sodium you should have in a day, and actually, if you have high blood pressure, it's about half the sodium you should have.  And because of all the salt, my mouth was still hungry.  My stomach was fine, but I wanted more food.As to value - at the time of this writing, 20 servings is $38.06, which makes it close to $2.00 each.  A 6-pack is $14.79, which is closer to $2.50.  There is a 16 count that's going for $26.08, which is $1.64 each.I actually used 8.5 ounces of water instead of the recommended 8.  I think next time I'll use 9 or 10 ounces just to dilute the salt a little.  It tasted just fine with a little extra water.  I'm sure a little more won't ruin it.So - as an occasional snack, this is OK.  It is tasty, but not really healthy.  I'm not sure about the value.  It's cheaper on Amazon than at the grocery store, but I don't know if it's cheap enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRRPG9E99YQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OV10ZK#wasThisHelpful","RXRRPG9E99YQK","A35X2JJI49OBZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X2JJI49OBZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Used this as per the advice of a professional landscaper to enable my Hibiscus to bloom without dropping buds.  If your Hibiscus has large buds and they fall off you need a regular pesticide.

I tried this and after the second spraying 1 week apart, all my Hybiscus started blooming again, Hallelujah!

"I have mixed feelings on this sound system because it deserves two different kinds of rating.First of all I want to say this: in all fairness, some people rate this lower than they should because they are using it for a home theater system.  That's nonsense.  The fact is, this is a sound system for a computer  or videogame set up.  As such, it is one of, if not THE best on the market.  That has caused some people to use it for their home theater, which is understandable and doable for a cheap way out, but you should not expect the ultra highs and lows of a real home theater sound system.  I have an expensive home theater system in my living room, but I don't even think about comparing this to that quality of sound.  It's not fair, this entire system – amplifier and speakers – is only 350 bucks; come on now!  Twice that wouldn't buy one of the subwoofers for my system, or the amplifier by itself.  For the money you can't beat this sound system.When it comes to the sound this speaker system produces, it is absolutely phenomenal.  I mean, I'm hearing background noises, echoes,  reverberation in castles and dungeons, and deeper base in explosions than I ever heard before in games, and I thought I had a  decent sound system before.  Modded Skyrim sounds amazing, like you are right there, and other games have an appreciable realistic sound.  The high-end over 15,000 Hz is a bit weak, so Logitech should make some improvements in the tweeters in the next rendition.  Otherwise, the speakers are of a very good design and weight, and I like that all five satellites are the same.The AC 3 sound circuitry has good separation, and I highly recommend people use the optical cable.  If you don't have one, get one, it's worth it.  BTW, Logitech should include one, but they don't.  I thought that was a bit cheap on their part.  The speaker wire gauge is OK, but a bit thin, so you might want to replace that.  It was smart of them to include longer cables for the rear.  I'm only using their cables for the front three, but my rear speakers are farther away so I use a thicker gauge.  Logitech did well by letting it be a standard connector on both ends, rather than RCA plugs, so you can easily swap it out.What about system design?Part of it is good, like the separate unit for adjusting sound for each speaker and the nice, long attachment cable so you can locate it anywhere.  Part of it is downright stupid.Logitech, you screwed up by not putting an exterior heatsink on the amplifier.  You had one on the previous version of this sound system and should've kept it.  The amplifier is inside the sub woofer, and it gets hot, real hot, even when you're NOT playing music or games.  There's no reason for that, it should back down.  Heat is the worst enemy of electronic circuits, and that means the heat inside the subwoofer box builds up because there's no ventilation.  None can be added without screwing up the sound qualities of the sub.  The ducted port does not count because heat cannot escape from it.  Whoever suggested this in the design committee should be moved to the mailroom.  I use my computer for work and play, thus I have to shut the sound system off during the day because the stupid thing gets so hot.  For this price, I know Logitech is not using the high-quality Japanese capacitors that can take more heat, which means the amp will most likely have a short life span if used a lot.Conclusion: if you want a great sound system for computer or videogame set up, you cannot do any better.  You can also turn the sub woofer on its face and cook eggs on the back plate.  Nevertheless, my games sound fantastic, and that's what I bought this for.For sound I give this system five stars.For design I give it three starsIt only deserves four stars at best.I'm giving it five stars to offset the unfair people who are down-rating it it as a home theater system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJ8IISTBJAMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M18O60#wasThisHelpful","RNJ8IISTBJAMO","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son is in the U.S. Army.  Like many soldiers he tried a handful of different pairs of boots over the years.  Five years ago he got these, and he wares them over 90% of the time.  He says they are the best and that includes every kind of action you can put them through.A while back he got me a pair for my birthday, and I have to agree.  I've worn out dozens of work boots over the decades, and I have never come across a boot like this.  I wish I knew about them sooner.  I heartily recommend them for ANY work requiring boots.I won't rehash the specs; here are some personal observations.  They're very well-built, super comfortable, easy to get on and off, well aerated, protective of your ankles, have good traction even on wet grass, have self-cleaning soles, have a short break-in time, leather doesn't crack and cleans up easy, and they even look good.  What more could you ask for?  The quality of this boot shows years of improvements.  If you are comparing it to Rocky's Lightweight Commercial Military Boot, this one is better.Looks: got the sage green – looks great with camo pants, but my son has the desert tan/coyote brown, and it looks good too.Size and comfort adviceFor instant fit, get your correct SHOE size, not larger or smaller.  I read a lot of posts here on Amazon to figure out the size and got different answers, with some people saying to get a half size larger or tad wider, but others  saying to get the correct size.  Correct is correct, but . . .Here's what I've learned to do with boots and work shoes over the past four decades.  I always get a half size larger and add an insole.  Not one of those big thick ones, just a thin to medium thickness one.  This makes the S2V as comfortable as the best tennis shoe and allows for future shrinkage over the years.  The ankle protection still works and so does the self drying feature.  Besides, 99.999% of  ware time does not involve getting them water soaked.  Even if you do, you're going to take your boots off, dump them, ring out your socks, and put them back on anyway if you have the time and a brain.  These boots are quick on and off.Only conThis really isn't a negative about the boot itself, but for the money, the standard S2V should come with a composite toe, or the two should be the same price.  I realize that the steel toed boots are not usually authorized, but composite is acceptable.I enjoy wearing these boots because I can trust them and they're very comfortable, and they remind me of my son when I put them on.Final comments:They do not squeek as a few guys said.Outdoor Equipped did a great job in fulfilling this order through Amazon.

"Everyone needs RFID protection.  By Oct 2015 all credit card companies are switching to RFID chips for all cards and all merchants are installing readers to prevent hacking and avoid liability charges.  Expiring cards will be replaced with chips.  Forbes has a good article on it.  The problem is that we consumers are vulnerable to getting our cards scanned.These protectors are great looking (I got the sports cars) and work well. With both copper and aluminum protection we are safe.  The result is that the sleeves are a bit thick but should still fit.  You might have to get a sharp scissors and trim off an edge.  I would also have preferred a bit shinier surface, it has a slight haze from certain angles, but it will be durable.  The lifetime guarantee indicates that.I also ordered an RFID wallet, but I still use these.  Why?  because the flip open wallet has limited compartments, and I put multiple things in these, i.e. car insurance and registration, etc.  I end up with extra protection, but so what.  When I slide out my credit card and see the supercar under it, it looks impressive.I already recommend these to people to help protect them from ID theft.

"These LED strips look great!  In fact, the blue one looks kind of ethereal and provides a black light effect.  I know it doesn't say it's black light, but it makes blacklight sensitive things light up, especially yellow.Personally, I believe these are overpriced by about five dollars (paying $15).  Nevertheless, this is my second set. I'm getting it because I like it so much that I want to be able to replace it with the same kind of light should the original ever die out, or my tube light die out.Some people are saying that these are bright.  No they are not, unless you are looking at the LED, which you are not supposed to do.  Hide the strip.  It also depends on what you compare it to.  I have one of these strips running across the top of my case (concealed) illuminating my blue EVGA spaghetti power cables and PSU.  Looks phenomenal.  On the bottom of my case I have one of the typical blue 12 inch long plastic tube lights the people use to light  cases (also concealed).  The tube light is easily twice as bright.The comments about the double-sided tape are correct; don't trust it to work unless you are simply placing the strip on the bottom of your case.  I used dabs of silicone rubber cement to supplement the tape, positioning the strip across the top exactly where I wanted it, with scotch tape to hold it until it dried,then removed the tape.Notice: These use the standard Molex cable, like fans, NOT  the SATA cable.  I recommend buying a converter connector rather than running an entire different Molex, unless you already have it run and have an open connector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMOUL5TMME4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ7BNZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1IMOUL5TMME4G","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I highly recommend this water purifier, using the Berkey black filters with the PF2 filters. I did extensive research, and watched dozens of YouTube videos, which I advise anyone seriously considering this unit to do.  I almost switched to the ProPur.  It looks good on paper, but found it deficient in too many ways -- much slower, more expensive filters that do not last as long, and trouble with filtering out chlorine as one YouTuber clearly demonstrated.  Two Berkey filters will last you 6,000 gal of water.  Four Berkey filters will last you 12,000 gal of water.  That's huge.  Figure out how long that is in years for your consumption.

"I highly recommend this water purifier, using the Berkey black filters with the PF2 filters. I did extensive research, and watched dozens of YouTube videos, which I advise anyone seriously considering this unit to do.  I almost switched to the ProPur.  It looks good on paper, but found it deficient in too many ways -- much slower, more expensive filters that do not last as long, and trouble with filtering out chlorine as one YouTuber clearly demonstrated.  Two Berkey filters will last you 6,000 gal of water.  Four Berkey filters will last you 12,000 gal of water.  That's huge.  Figure out how long that is in years for your consumption.

"I have had 6 HDMI cables and this is the best.  Two nice thick ones from my provider, neither of which worked right.  One from Samsung for Blu Ray which is very much like this one.  Two more from the TV purchase - thin but at least they worked.This cable is very  thick and designed well, although it could seat a tad tighter, it is OK.  Gold connectors- everything about it is first class.You will like it. Some HDMI professional reviews say you don't need an HDMI 2.0 cable, but they are full of baloney.  I get better reception on my 4k Samsung f9000 tv with this than on anything but the Samsung BlyRay cable, and it IS noticeable.  The thick cables from Verizon had screen tearing, that's why I ordered a second one.  It was faulty as well but not as bad.

"I am not affiliated with Samsung or CNET.[Side Note:  I believe Samsung should provide free 2014 One connect boxes to F9000 owners because of the H265 codec, Google's superior VP9 codec, and HDMI 2.0 as a gesture of good faith toward early adopters.]This review will help you get the most out of your HU8550.  I won't waste your time listing all the specs.I am posting here because some people badmouthed and down rated the Samsung F9000 because they did not know how to use it.  I do not want the same thing to happen to this excellent TV.  I have last year's top-of-the-line F9000 4K model which is virtually the exact same TV as this, released only 5 months earlier.  Only the Smart Hub software and HDMI ports changed.I cannot believe how absolutely amazing the picture is.  It's colors explode, it's blacks are black, it's whites are white, flesh tones are real, and all of it is super sharp.  With newscasts or interviews, people look like they're sitting right in front of you.  It's almost scarey. Aerial shots and night shots of cities will blow you away. You cannot ask for a better picture.  And that's not just my opinion, read all of the professional reviews.  Every single one of them love this TV.NOTICE: Do not worry about 4K content not being available.  This TV upscales. It has to because the screen is made of 3840 X 2160 pixels. Go to [....] and check the US news section. I quote it in the comments section.  The upscaling of Samsung's Quadmatic Picture Engine works wonders, especially with anything in HD (1080P).  It also works fine with SD material but not as well because upscaling works with the material it starts with.  That's what it scales up.  I can honestly tell you that I do not want a sharper picture than this.  You can see every facial feature including eyelashes.  Blu Rays and 4K YouTube's will make you cry.  Pause the picture anywhere, even get close to it, and be amazed.Any person giving this TV anything less than five stars reveals their own foolishness for not setting it up, or they got a weird factory defect.  You have to set it up(calibrate it for your room).  If you are a newbie to electronics you have three options.1.  Learn how to set it up and you'll love it.  It is very easy.(I will help you in this post).2.  If you're too lazy, don't buy a piece of high-quality electronic equipment like this.  You don't deserve it.3.  Pay someone to calibrate it for you.  Actually that's a waste of money because in 20 minutes you can easily do it yourself with this post.  You can make this TV look anyway you want it to look.  Which is why comparisons in stores are superfluous unless you make all settings equal between the TVs. Out of the box the picture looks disappointing , that's Samsung's fault, although most manufacturers do the same thing for the retail store lighting.  When I first turned on this TV it looked like a soap opera or documentary.  I knew this was not right.Because I researched the F9000 (same internals as Hu8550) I knew what to do.  The first thing to do is go to the System menu, scroll to the Eco-Solution Submenu, and turn OFF the accursed eco-saving feature and eco-sensor.CNET has evaluators that are among the best in the industry.  A professional named Katzmaier uses $30,000 worth of equipment to calibrate these TVs.  Don't know if I can post links here, so search for CNET's HDTV picture settings forum forUN65f9000 or HU8550-a bit early for this as of this date.  (The 55 inch versions take the same calibrations.)However, there's one problem with their settings.  They calibrate their TVs in a dark room.  Therefore their brightness levels are way too low.  They acknowledge this, but it is a necessary starting point and equalizer for the different models.  No problem, use Samsung's default settings for Movie and set Backlight to their setting(12).  It worked great with gamma at +1.  The first thing you want to do is set it to Movie mode, which is what CNET uses.  Play with other modes later.---------------------The settings I'm about to list are based on Katzmaier's from CNET(get them and print them out) with some tweaks of my own made by going between his and the Samsung defaults.  Do that, that's safe.  If you set your TV to these, you will love the picture.  If not, tweak it for yourself somewhere between his settings and the defaults.It is very easy, so don't freak out.  If you can turn your volume control up and down you can change your settings.  The settings have a combined effect, so do not just do one area.HOW TO SET A FANTASTIC PICTURE AND REMOVE MOTION BLURR/Judder:Picture menu - Use all Samsung's defaults for Movie mode with a slight color tweakmode: Movie - the most important change.backlight: 12 - CNET's setting of 7 is way too low unless you are in a really dark room.  We use lamps at my house.  Backlight is the main brightness controlcontrast: 95 -  pretty standard for most modesbrightness: 45 - leave this alonesharpness: 20 - CNET setting of 0 Is WAY too low, especially for a 4K TVcolor: 52 0r 53 - a slight tweak over 50 that will give you more of a richer plasma TV qualitytint: 50/50 - leave this aloneI discovered the real trick for getting the correct lighting level for your room is to work with gamma and backlight, not brightness.  Samsung's default is 45 for all modes, and it's right.Advanced Settings Click it for the submenudynamic contrast: offflesh tone: zeroRGB only mode: offcolor space: custom - there is a submenu for this below.White balance: SEE BELOW.  Click it to get into it.10 P white balance: - you don't need to mess with this.Gamma: +1 --this is an important setting and affects the entire picture, not just contrast.Expert pattern: offmotion lighting: offblack enhancer: offColor Space SubmenuI recommend keeping everything at default rather than using the ones from CNET.  However, I do not like the cold (bluer)picture of LEDs as compared to plasma or my old Pioneer elite 98 which had the best picture ever in its day and even for today except for sharpness.  Therefore I change the blue setting to this:blue: red 2, green 2, blue 45. Not drastic changes over 0, 0, 50 but it's warmer and prettier.Leave yellow at the default, or change the yellow setting to have less blue than the CNET settingyellow: red 50, green 50, blue 6  (Katzmaier had blue at 14, that's too much)WHITE BALANCE - use all of the Katzmaier's settings: 25, 24, 22, 23, 24, 26EDIT:  Thanks to James Goss who says:For the 8550, the white balance numbers range from -25 to +25, with 0 being the defaults. So your figures equate to 0, -1, -3, -2, -1, +1.Explanation -- Goss is saying that the default for the 8550 is zero (0), whereas my F9000 has a default of 25. That means you either leave it at zero where I had 25, or go plus/minus whatever digits are equivalent, i.e. -1 for 24, +1 for 26, or whatever.  The total range is 25 changes in either direction, but you won't need that full range.  It's NOT complicated.Picture Option Submenu -color tone: warm 2 - important, this also gets rid of the cold blue LED effectdigital clean view: offMPEG noise filter: offfilm mode: auto oneauto motion plus: custom.  Make sure you change it to custom, click it.Smart LED: highAuto Motion Plus Submenu.  Numerous sources recommend these to remove motion blur.blur reduction: 10judder reduction: 0  yes, zeroLED clear motion: - not much visible difference either way.  Leave it on if you increased backlight to the default.System Menu.  As already mentioned go to the eco-solution submenu and shut off energy-saving and eco-sensors.  They will knock your picture into dismal oblivion at will.Sound menu:  For a TV, the sound can be good, but the default sound is horribly muddy as are all of the choices except Clear Voice.  The high frequencies are weak, and you should never expect good bass from any TV.  Go into the Sound menu and set to Clear Voice if you sometimes watch without your stereo system.---------------------------GREAT INTERFACE FEATURES:This TV works great with Smart Hub and smart phones, tablets, or Blu Ray, especially for Samsung products.  Other Android and Apple products should be compatible, but I can't speak for them.  I am a Samsung Galaxy XX fan myself.You can wirelessly stream from TV to Phone or tablet with the Samsung Smart View app, and your phone functions as a remote.  It works!  However, get the app for your phone manufacturer.  Don't expect Samsung's app to work on a different phone.You can wirelessly stream from Phone/tablet to TV by setting your TV Source to Mirror, and your device to Mirror in your settings >connections, and allow the connection.  You do not need to register the TV and agree to Samsung's invasion of privacy policy.  If you go through the YouTube app on the TV it even asks you if you want to mirror.  Search for some YouTubes to see how to set these up.  It's too long to include here.You can also wirelessly view pics, video.etc, from your phone on the TV by enabling the DLNA device connection on your phone and going into Smart Hub Picture/video section (up top, far right, go to the bottom and select all files, and enable the connection.  It's easy.You can also use a hardwire HDMI connection for any of the above but why bother.______________________Complaint Section1.  Samsung - Stop defeating your own purpose with the horrible original settings.  I want a free 2014 One connect box and it needs VP9 not just H265.2.  People do not want the ridiculous hand controls that only work half the time at best, or the worthless voice controls the get activated by the TV program you're watching.  Thanks for the great picture though, stick with what matters.3.  Your privacy policy stinks.  I want to be able to interface my devices without doing your lousy Samsung All Share/ now Samsung Link that makes me agree to privacy policies that promise you NO privacy, and sit a Samsung representative in your living room every time you watch the TV.  NO Thanks.NOTICE *** 2 WAY WIRELESS STREAMING:In all fairness to Samsung, the Smart View App in the Android Play store does let you wirelessly stream content from the TV to your device without registering with Samsung Link.  That's great.EDIT:  Samsung changed the Smart View App so do not update it if you have the old one.  It is now useless.They are using Watch-on.  Although I don't like all the extra junk it does, you can still stream live TV.  Unfortunately they foolishly did not include a top tab to easily activate streaming.  !?!  You have to dig into settings on your tablet or phone, and activate the TV you want to stream from.  Streaming to my Galaxy Tab S had about a six second delay, which is OK since it is using Wi-Fi, but it still choked up a lot, pausing for no reason and then picking up despite a good Wi-Fi connection on both the TV and the tablet.  So Watch-On, still needs some more work.______________Why you should get this TV1.  Best picture of any TV on the market from the largest TV manufacturer on the market.  I sometimes pause the program just to look at it.2.  It is future proof.  Because it is 4K, the screen is capable of outstanding resolution for a long time to come.  There's another great benefit - the Evolution kit.  HOWEVER, this TV write up by Samsung and thus Amazon is unclear.It comes with the built in evolution Kit but NOT the One connect box.  To get that, you have to get the HU9000 model which costs more money, and has a useless curved screen.  However, the write up infers One-connect future upgrades.  This TV is One Connect READY according to Samsung.  My guess is that they will upgrade this unit and all 4K units with one, One-connect for all, but see below.3.  It really looks elegant.___________________What about this new 2014 8550 compared to last years 4K F9000?If you can save a pile of money, then hurry and get the F 9000 before they sell out.  Amazon's price and service are both good and you save around $500.  The picture, CPU, memory, everything will be the same as the F9000 which is only 5 months older, and clear motion rate is the same.  Its true.  HDTVvs.com has a comparison and the main difference is the smart hub software.  You can save $500.00 and get a 4K blu-Ray with the diff.EDIT AFTER PRICE DROP:  On the other hand, if the prices are the same, the decision is tougher, but you should probably go with the newer model even though it is almost the same.Back on the other hand, F9000 has two advantages.  The One-connect box is a separate unit that houses the CPU, memory, main board, firmware, and smart TV software.  This is better than the evolution kit in the HU8550. A true One connect box is still on the H9000, but it costs more.The One Connect box that separates from the screen itself is better because you get new connection ports, less heat build up for a longer lasting screen, and you have less cable clutter.  If you know anything about computers or electronics, you know that the CPU, memory, and motherboard generate the most heat and eventually cause the units to fail.  Mine is a few feet under the screen, you can touch it and feel the heat, although it is more of a high warm than hot.The One-connect box is a genius idea that Samsung should employ for all of its TVs, and so should every other manufacturer of high-end TVs.  The 8550 is ""One connect ready"" for future updates but for now its evolution kit is on the TV.  So it is not really a big deal either way.The second reason: The 8550 base is nowhere near as stable or as cool looking as the arch base on the F9000.Although the 8550 model does do 4 screens, this is not with 4 channels, but 4 different inputs.  Which isn't really needed.  Updates to Smart hub are superfluous compared to the F9000.Bottom line: Both TVs are spectacular and as soon as you get new one connect boxes, they will be the same.  Be sure to set it up right and anyone you show this TV to will pick up  their jaw off the floor. You will love the picture and the features.  You will also save big time over the HU9000 with its gimmick curved screen.Hope this helps you enjoy your TVBlessings","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQGWYDLWEBYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID2HJJM#wasThisHelpful","R3QQGWYDLWEBYL","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Best picture of any TV on the market.  It really is beautiful.2.  It is future proof.  Because it is 4K, the screen is capable of outstanding resolution for a long time to come.  There's another great benefit - the One-connect box.  It houses the CPU, memory, mainboard, firmware, and smart TV software.

The base is nowhere near as stable as the arch base on the F 9000.Note: Amazon does not clearly list this, in fact they use the term One-connect in the description which is wrong.  They need to change thatAccording to my studies, the 2014 8550 has no advantage over the F 9000 except the codec H265.  Yes, it has HDMI 2.0, but IF that FPS difference becomes a useful, relevant factor in the future, I will buy a new One -connect box.  It's smart hub software is slightly different, but who cares?  It can show four screens on the TV, but so what, these are not different channels, they are different inputs.  I didn't buy a 65 inch screen to watch it one quarter size!  This might account for .05% of someone's viewing time.  Not sure if it has the same pop-up camera.The codec will not really be that relevant until 2015 or later.  Sure Netflix is going to have ONE 4K program in 2014, but if you do your research (read the comments to this post) they will not really be sending you true 4K because the bandwidth is too high.On the other hand, if you're just talking picture, you've got the same absolutely fantastic picture on a quality set by a primo manufacturer, so you won't go wrong with it, and you will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8LJ8QJNAYG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV51DYS#wasThisHelpful","R1G8LJ8QJNAYG6","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the great look of this case and don't mind some of the downsides because I get multiple cases - light, medium and heavy protection.  Don't kid yourself, this case is light protection only.  But people are saying it is so awesome, and that is not the case.It was rushed to market and the designers forgot to add a hole for one of the microphones.  Not that much of a biggie, if you're careful and have a high speed drill, you can drill your own, but also not real bright.  Daaah.  [PS do not over squeeze the case in a vise if you drill your own.  I didn't - just sayin . . .]It does not have dust covers for ports.  What? Why not?It has hard rubber on the ends, which could be OK, because it is a compromise between shock absorption and shock transmittal (like plastic), but its all so thin.  It's not as good as other cases.Some people are complaining about it not fitting right or keeping its form.  Not my problem, but I hope it does not develop.Forget the screen protector, get a good glass or flex glass one of your own.For light protection, it IS better than the Otterbox commuter, and I like that about it.  However, it is far inferior to the Trident Cyclops in workmanship and materials.  The Cyclops is a mid to heavy range protection case with military spec 810 F,  which the UAG looks like it should have but doesn't!  Urban Armor needs to go back to the drawing board and give us a real quality case, and this is not it.  I am disappointed.  (I am not affiliated with Trident, I just like their case.  It makes sense.)Best conclusion, wait to get this until the price drops to about half, that's really all it is worth and that's the truth.  Get it for looks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FZOD8WCEKRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8JEWT8#wasThisHelpful","R17FZOD8WCEKRQ","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not affiliated with Trident in any way.The Trident Cyclops case is probably THE BEST case anyone can get for this phone if you want great protection and good looks that do not make your phone super bulky.  That's a win-win-win.  Why?I buy 3 types of cases:  cheap, thin, TPU cases for formal wear or with tight clothing.  A mid-level  protection case  and a heavy-duty protection case.  The Cyclops is perfect, because it sits right between mid-level and heavy-duty for protection, yet is sized like a mid-level case.It lies between the heavy-duty Kraken (which I'm also getting) and the lightweight Aegis, which I am not ordering.  The Cyclops has military 810 F certification which is good for 26 drops at 4 feet on concrete!  Check it out on Trident's webpage.  It's protection is far better than the Commuter and its copycats, which are thin.  My wife and son have them, so I know.  Watch some YouTube's.  Trident hits a unique protection niche here.  I want good protection for my expensive Galaxy Note 3.  I love it.Not only are the corners and back protected, but there's a good-sized faceplate to protect against face down drops.Major openings are protected with dust covers, and the push buttons are soft enough to work right.Unlike Ballistic, another great case, it has rubber side grips which make the phone easy to handle, not slippery.  Their protection philosophy, like Trident's is superior - soft case covered by the hard plastic for better dissipation of shock, and easy placement/ removal from pockets.  But you don't want the plastic where you grip the phone.The Cyclops is in a league of its own.  After using it for a while now, I am still very pleased with it.Hot Tip:It doesn't matter what quality company you choose, OtterBox, Griffin, Ballistic, whatever, the built in screen protectors do not have perfect contact with the screen, and they do not feel as good during every day usage as a separate cover.  All of them make a slight rainbow effect on the screen when viewed at an angle.  My personal practice is to carefully remove it and buy a better made screen cover from Amazon, either tempered glass (my choice - it's like having no cover but with maximum protection), or flex glass, or whatever you want. If you use the phone in a super dusty environment, you may want to keep the screen cover, but otherwise the case fits tight enough to keep dust out.  Just keep your pocket clean.The ultra heavy-duty cases are good to have when needed, but are bulky and overkill for most people.  They are also good for certain circumstances like sports, yard work, etc.  The Cyclopes military 810 F protection is great for all day every day.Hey! Watch the pricing.  Amazon, what is going on here?We're supposed to save money here.  As of this writing, people can get the case cheaper by buying directly from Trident.  This case is not supposed to cost $50.  It's retail cost is $39.95, from Trident, not 69.95 or 59.00.  Be honest.  Anyway, we should be able to get it for less than retail here, not more, otherwise why do we need you?  Most likely, this is the fault of one of the the third-party companies selling it and trying to overcharge people who don't do their homework.OK, Amazon has corrected the pricing, but a bit more care in choosing third party companies is in order here.I hope you don't delete this because your customers expect you to be responsible.Bottom line, don't let incorrect pricing mess you up, get this fantastic case in the color of your choice, you will love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYTH2LFFZGKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVBJWY4#wasThisHelpful","RHYTH2LFFZGKR","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this case along with a Cimo S, and a few other slim cases.  This one is better built with a little more rubber to it and more front edging To protect from facedown drops.  It does not add bulk or weight.Beware, The blue color does not look like the picture.  It is a darker, Royal blue, mat finish but still looks good.

"NOTE:  Samsung gets 0 stars, the phone gets 5 stars, even 6.The Note 3 is awesome, but customers should be upset over the SIMM lock on it, and NOT get this N9000 model.  The N9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go.This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel. If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked.I still say 99.9% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked.  However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere.  Do not think ""unlocked"" means you have magical usage.  There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one!  I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.Get the scoop.  Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site. This is where the big boys and girls hang, for programming, not dumb questions.Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire.In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general.Search down the page to the thread ""SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3.""  This thread has over 1300 posts.  Yes this is a big problem.Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045, and pages 117 and 18.This N9000 phone is the international or European version. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it.  We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 for your carrier.  Notice the different last digit.Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone.  The black version does say 'International"" in the title and so should the white one.Now, down to business.First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.1.  The beautiful  5.7"" Super Amoled HD display has a ""Wow!""  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.2.  The CPU in the US versions is the quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  The international version uses the Samsung Exynos 5 processor. It also has another quad core processors making it octa core, but it is still not quite as fast as the Snapdragon.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. There are 2 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.  (I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user).  This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES.  (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice) All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2939UO7RPC0VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F33OE06#wasThisHelpful","R2939UO7RPC0VH","A3TFJE04LTJDLI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TFJE04LTJDLI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A handful of other cases all look pretty much alike, The Fintie case is superior because it provides dust covers for the ear phone jack and charger.I was hoping this was a heavy duty case because of the pics, but I should have known better for the price.  On the other hand, it is finely machined and very comparable to the Otterbox Commuter level of protection, not the Defender heavy duty case.  So if that is what you want, for the price, you would lose out not to get it.The colors in the pics are over saturated and they should fix that.  The blue is a bit lighter.  For this price I am going to get a black one too and mix the pieces.It has good front bevel protection for the glass.  The kickstand is OK, not great because it could be sturdier and wider for this long phone, but it works.The best way to use this case:Using the holster as a kickstand will only work if you take the hard plastic part off the rubber part of the hybrid case.

"G Note users know that they need something that will work with the S-Pen or forget it.  I tried my old-reliable Skinomi, but the soft, self-repair protectors don't work with the S-Pen.  Money wasted.Spigen is a good company.  I tried this hard-type protector and it works. If you press hard, the S-pen will slightly mark it, but it disappears in a few hours.  (97% of my S-Pen usage does not mark it)The anti smudge works nicely, and after 2 months, there is not a scratch on it, so it is fairly hard.This screen protector does have a slight haze to it outdoors so it is a 50 50 trade off between hyper glare and haze outside.  Indoors it is crystal clear and you cannot tell it is there.  A friend has an anti-glare protector and it looks terrible indoors.  Why pay this much for the best looking resolution and Super Amoled color and mess it up with an anti-glare protector?  That's stupid.I have concluded that I would like to try the protector that is only antismudge with no outdoor antiglare, but I am not spending more money when this is fine for 99% of my usage.Phone store people have assured me that you do still need some protection even with Gorilla glass.

"I just knew this would come in handy! 2 months later after I purchased this, I'm writing this review. I finally had a day where my car wouldn't start, I was in a hurry to get somewhere and I was about to panic; I remembered I had kept this in my trunk, so I got it out and IT WORKED PERFECTLY! It was easy and fast! I seriously saved so much time and effort.No need to call AAA or beg someone to jump start your car, hope you/they have cables with them, having to have you/them pull up next to the car, having to connect the + and - in the correct order to your vehicle and theirs, and all the greater hassles involved without this! You're solo and it's not a problem! Just put the + and -. Every car should DEFINITELY have this, even if you don't think you'll need it, it's a one of the greatest inventions ever and you can easily help out other people too.When you connect the cables, the red/green LED should alternate flashing - this is normal - when you connect the + and - on to your car battery, wait for it to turn solid green; that's when it lets you know that it's ready to start your car; after the engine starts, it will beep and you'll want to remove the cables within 30 seconds.Better to be safe than sorry! I had so many situations before where I wish I had this; I'm glad I made the purchase and now I have less worries! If your phone needs extra juice or other devices needing power via USB, or you just simply need a flashlight, this also becomes a life saver; even if you never have car problems, it's just nice to own!If I had to criticize one thing, it would be nice if there were longer cables, especially if you can't find a safe place to set the battery on.I have NO regrets that I purchased this. This was a no brainer investment. I'm so happy I own this, if anyone needs their car started, I can amaze people with this magic little box and seem like I'm a manly man mechanic -- even though I'm not. This is an essential tool to keep in your car.Perfect GIFT for anyone who owns a car. I love this thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4LEISJG113M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2GT9L4#wasThisHelpful","R1W4LEISJG113M","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 3D projector, so I've been addicted to looking for some worthy 3D movies and games. Silent Hill Downpour is one of those must-have 3D games, and definitely must be experienced on a big 3D screen!The game sometimes has those sudden jump scares, but for the most part, it is calm and suspenseful that builds up to it. The puzzles are interesting and the possessed world is fascinating.This is a game that can DEFINITELY use a stragedy guide! Some things are just ridiculous, like knowning have to pick up a hook and using that to pull down a ladder.There's a part early in the game where a regular room turns into this possesed world and you have to run away; this part alone is extemely intense and exciting - the 3D depth in this moment is incredible and so thrillng! I totally loved that part. That moment in that game totally put a smile on my face... I really felt like I was experiencing all of it.There is also this one side mission where you can hear a missing girl crying in the basement, but the bar/caged door is locked; when you go upstairs and return, the door is shockingly opened on its own and you hear the crying stop; when you go near the chair and grab the gun, the shadow of the missing possesed girl appears - MY GOD, that was absolutely scary! I hated being in that basement.The 3D and surround sound definitely makes this an immersive scary experience.The 3D in this game really makes use of the depth, especially in hallways. It's not so much the gimmicky pop-up in your face 3D, but as if you're looking through the window.I wish more games made use of the amazing depth 3D that this game does.I highly recommend getting a 3D setup and play this in 3D. 3D rules!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OL61J2XUQL4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O6HDHA#wasThisHelpful","R3OL61J2XUQL4L","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the original starcraft and was totally addicated to it. Starcraft 2 is just as fun with better graphics... if you are willing to go through the massive hassle to ""install"" the game.However, my rating is for the ridiculous DOWNLOADING REQUIRED to play the game. Is Blizzard forcing people to DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE game all over again, despite the contents on the disc?! This single 8GB Dual Layer Disc that you get in the box is essentially USELESS.One would think when you're buying a PHYSICAL DISC, you could start playing the game right away - saving bandwidth/time to install the game; as opposed to buying a DIGITAL CONTENT where you have to download the whole thing.Blizzard now REQUIRES you to DOWNLOAD an entire whopping 15 GB file to start playing the game.I played Starcraft 2 when it first came out, but years later today, I decided I wanted to play it again and reinstall the game on a new computer...I can not believe the installation/update is going to take FOREVER having to download this ridiculous 15 GB file/practically the ENTIRE GAME. What is the point of having the DISC now? It is worthless.No wonder the game is so cheap now... you are basically buying a CD-KEY and an INSTALLER software without the actual game contents.Seriously, what is this mess/deal Blizzard is trying to pull? The Update Patch is an enormous 15 GB! (imitates Doc Brown 15 jiggawatts!!!! I mean, 15 gigabytes!!!!!) If I was on 4G network with unlimited bandwidth, I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem, but come on now... Definitely won't be buying any Blizzard games; I don't care if they're selling for a $1.Having to download DOUBLE the amount of the worthless 8GB Dual Layer Disc, where it's essentially just a download launcher, is absolutely ridiculous bait & switch tactic Blizzard is trying to pull here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KGIXYMJJLDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZKA0J6#wasThisHelpful","R7KGIXYMJJLDH","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've known Kinivo from previously owning their bluetooth speakers; I needed a bluetooth adapter for my PC, since it didn't have it.First thing I did was install the latest drivers from the website (it was pretty large at over 100MB!) - during installation, it asked to connect the device in order to proceed with the installation. After connecting the dongle, it proceeded with the installation and it successfully finished. I got the bluetooth configuration show up on my taskbar. I searched for my speakers and it connected perfectly.Finally, I get really great sound without dealing with any wires to my surround sound speakers from my PC.I'm on Windows 8.1.

"I finally had a chance to watch Life of Pi in 3D. This film is definitely a must-see experience in 3D.Be warned, the aspect ratio will change twice during the film on certain scenes - THIS IS NORMAL. Although if you're not forewarned, you will find it odd and annoying when it changes, not knowing the story behind it. The director purposely wanted to play/change the aspect ratio (CinemaScope) during the film (it has nothing to do with IMAX conversion) - you will get black bars; the director did this so that the fishes go out into the black borders, making it seem like they're popping out of the screen. This film was meant to be seen in 3D.Visually, the 3D and cinematography is impressive. But it doesn't just end there.I've been collecting 3D films lately, and I haven't had a film that made me jump yet UNTIL THIS ONE. The scene where the tiger first lashes out in the boat literally made me jump; surround sound also helps! Very intense.The flying fishes was also an exciting 3D scene.This is a film that makes you think on deeper levels. It does involve religion and faith, but I love how the film brings that full circle and importance in the movie regardless what religion or non-religious you are.Are you a realist rational thinker or a believer? I love how this film challenges and questions those ideas.The actors are excellent, both young and older Pi. I really felt for the characters. Even the CG tiger is so lovable... Richard Parker.It's an excellent must-see touching film, an unforgettable 3D experience that goes beyond just superficial 3D. The 3D completely enhances the film.For me, Avatar is just to show off 3D with the most generic cliche storyline. Life of Pi uses 3D to enhance a deep philosophical touching story. The film Gravity has impressive 3D, but the story just isn't there for that either. Life of Pi is the complete package 3D/storyline.If you want a film open to many discussions, this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CW0FG2DO4XUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB0Z88S#wasThisHelpful","R1CW0FG2DO4XUU","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a two-in-one device; I really like the portable steam feature; it's great for easy cleaning of sink mildew or other gunk that needs to wiped with less effort.The manual stated it includes a cup to pour water into the pod, but I didn't receive one.The product photos are also misleading: there is NO MEDIUM mode button - instead, it is a ON/OFF button there, with LO and HIGH buttons on the sides.There is no TRIGGER to squirt the steam only when you want it; once you select the LO or HIGH button, steam will continuously come out until you hit the OFF button. High mode does put out a lot of angry steam, so you want to be careful. You must place it horizontally when setting it down, using the portable handheld.I never had a steam mop/cleaner, so this is a nice addition to my arsenal to keep places even more OCD clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R94HMUV4IFYM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LS47SA#wasThisHelpful","R94HMUV4IFYM4","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, I'm actually a Canon guy... I own a 5D Mark III, 6D, T4i, but when you're traveling and want to actually ENJOY your vacation, the last thing you want is having to carry tons of baggage with you...I took my DSLR camera, but most of the time, it was just left in the hotel and I just ended up relying on the Sony RX100 III for stills AND video (I also had a Sony HDR-PJ650 with me, but the RX actually is quite impressive for video too). I even also had a NEX with me, but even that felt like a hassle to carry with me.  Trust me, the best camera is the one you will always be taking with you and using the most. (I always carry my smartphone too, but features on it just don't cut it)Don't be fooled by the body size; you get DSLR quality on a compact size. I know some people just judge by the body and want a DSLR just because it LOOKS professional. For example, the Sony DSCH300 may look like it has an impressive body/zoom to a layman, but that is a CHEAP camera that takes horrible pictures... Yes, don't judge a book by its cover certainly applies here.Mega pixels mean nothing. Do not buy a camera just going by that too. The sensor size is what is more important. The RX100 has a 1"" sensor, much bigger than tiny cellphone sensors (even if some claim their latest cellphone has 300 Megalpixel or something ridiculous, it really doesn't matter) or point and shoot.I also owned the first RX100. The RX100 III (Mark III... Version 3... whatever you want to call it.. the third one) is definitely a worthy upgrade!I'm glad I skipped Version II because honestly, who needs a hotshoe since the whole point of owning this is to be compact and not having to carry extra accessories! No need for the OLED viewfinder either since this already has it built in... that accessory alone costs half the cost of this camera!I like how the ""Zeiss"" logo on the corner of the camera is actually embedded, whereas the first version was just a cheap sticker.The official Sony case for the RX100 III is the LCJ-RXF. The old first RX100 case is LCJ-RXC.Pros:- Compact size- Tiltable screen for ""selfies"" is a must have these days... perfect for dates and friends... very difficult to do with DSLRs. It has default built-in selfie self-timer countdown, but you can disable it too.- Pop-up OLED Viewfinder (This is an amazing useful feature; this accessory alone costs more than half of this camera if you were to buy it separately on the older model); this is perfect for those super bright blinding sun when you have trouble seeing the LCD viewfinder; it's also perfect for stealth shooting too, so people around can't see exactly what you're focusing on.- Being discreet without people knowing you are actually getting really great photos (DSLR just screams so much attention and are banned in some places)- Neutral Density Filter (this was not available on the older models - turn this on and you can achieve shallow depth of field during daytime outdoors)- 24mm Wider Lens at 1.8! and 2.8F... great for low light shooting. Great significant upgrade from the first version!- The bounceable flash is centered now, as opposed to being on the left side for the RX100, since that is where the OLED viewfinder is now.- Charge through micro USB (just like cellphones... so many portable powerbanks are available!)- Lens retract/open much quickly than the first one.- I love the NFC/WIFI - it's such an useful feature! Easily transfer pictures to my smartphone and I can share right away while on location! Very very cool and convenient.Cons:- When you push down the OLED viewfinder, it automatically turns the camera off; this is not always a convenience, so they should have added an option for this. (they added this option on the new IV model)- For high angle shots, I wish it could tilt more degrees- It's annoying when there are some restrictions ""This is not available in this mode"" message- Needs a built-in sensor cleaning (My first RX100 ended up with one minor dust inside, didn't even take it near dusty areas!, and there is no way for me to remove it unless I take everything apart... very frustrating!)- If you're looking for lots of zoom, this is not for you. Unfortunately, you can't have everything.... if you want extreme zoom but inferior image quality, then there are other alternatives.I also looked at the Canon G7, which is a competition to Sony's RX100 series, but I prefer the OLED Viewfinder over touchscreen, better video, and smoother ring (loud clicky on the Canon), high-angle tilt (although I wish it could tilt more), bounceable flash, etc. If you're trying to decide between the first RX100 or the RX100 III, it's easily worth the upgrade.If you're going on any trips, this is definitely just one camera to have with you. The convenience and stealth shooting (people thinking you're just shooting with a cheap point-and-shoot, but you're actually getting stunning results) is well worth it than having to carry expensive lenses/DSLR with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10F4AXQO1PFD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7O2DJU#wasThisHelpful","R10F4AXQO1PFD3","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:27 MinsWow, this is very very fascinating (and a little frightening) when you see this in action/results.All the instructions are conveniently written on the bag. Vacuum out the air through the suction hole and watch magic happen. I will add a video.This is a must have when going on a vacation to save A LOT of space for your luggage!You get two large bags and a travel size. The travel size one does not have the vacuum suction hole; it's made so that you essentially fold the bag manually and try to let the air out of the bottom slits (make sure it's not stuck or bent/blocking underneath because I had issues at first with no air releasing out of there)The manual folding/push air out method definitely takes way more effort -- and you will NOT achieve the compression that a vacuum is capable of. You need to keep that in mind because on your trip back, you probably wouldn't have access to a vacuum for the large size bags... you can do the same method folding and pressing all the access air out, just like the small travel bag... maybe do some practice tests at home before the trip.. or on your way back, you could hassle the hotel housekeeping, or where ever you're staying at, to borrow a vacuum... haha...Pros:- Magic! Lots of compression and save so much space!Cons:- Not having access to a vacuum will require way more effort/no full compression. I would love it if Ziploc could provide some simple cheap travel manual air sucking pump, even if that would take a little longer than a vacuum, as long as if it can provide full compression. If a compression like this could be achieved without a vacuum, that would be double black magic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RS4KVJAIF56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCMUDYW#wasThisHelpful","R33RS4KVJAIF56","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to totally agree with the other critical review... these earbuds are NOT ""one-size fits all""... what were they thinking? I don't see how they can even advertise it as being comfortble because it's EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE in my ear. I'm seriously shocked.Like the other review mentioned, it does not fit in my ear unless I hold it against my ear further more into my ear canal to get better optimal sound (including bass), but even then, the sound is still unimpressive - I can assure you, there is NO clarity at all.I am so disappointed in this. I guess I couldn't expect much from the price, but I honestly expected more from Panasonic.Honestly, forget these and get the Soundpeats Qy7 V4.1 Bluetooth Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo Sports Bluetooth Earbuds Headphones (Black/green) instead.... that one has WAY BETTER DESIGN (flat cable, no tangling, easy to store/carry!), WAY BETTER SOUND QUALITY, and it's even BLUETOOTH. Funny, it's also available in the same green color! The QY7 also is a real earcanal phones, so they go deep in your earcanal, thus isolates outside noise.Cons:- Very uncomfortable, poorly designed earbuds; does not fit properly; NO adjustments.- Disappointing sound quality - no clarity!Of course I'd prefer Panasonic than some unknown Chinese company like Soundpeats, but this just shows brand names aren't everything.... No doubt in my mind, the Soundpeats QY7 kills these earphones in every department... you'll thank me later.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCD4GE6S1KUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXO8176#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCD4GE6S1KUI","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I also tried the Soundpeats Q2 model and this QY7 is night/day miles improvement! The sound is way more clearer and satisfying (the Q2 sounds quite muffeled).I was quite impressed just looking at the design of this, the colors are nice with the flat cable, as opposed to to the thicker cables on the Q2.Although this should be obvious to most, these are ear canal earphones... they're supposed to go deep into your ear canal/not simply rest in your ear like the cheap iPod earphones. (Make sure you have clean ears and no wax build up, or you may end up pushing them deeper in and possibly affect your hearing)Pros:- Unbeatable value. Easily a steal for its price.- Perfect for working out with or for main casual listening.- Good satisfying sound. Way better/clearer than the Q2 model- Nice design, doesn't tangle, can hang/rest behind your neck, love how compact/easy to carry.- Comes with case and charging cable too.- Bluetooth!- the controls on the side/main function actually controls the volume first, and holding it will skip tracks (some other headphones/speakers switch this function!)Cons:- If I had to mention a con, I would say it's a little difficult to open the micro USB charging cover... But I figured it out... you need to stick your nail on the side and flick. If you don't have nails or larger fingers, you may have more trouble.I highly recommend these for the price. You can't go wrong with these. What more could you ask for? It's bluetooth, great sound, portable, very well designed. I own many headphones/earphones already costing hundreds, but this has become one of my favorites for its size and convenience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZ5T2HXVVQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZ5T2HXVVQM","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was fortunate enough to try this Q2 and QY7 models. The QY7 is FAR SUPERIOR to the Q2 model.The audio quality is night and day miles better. The Q2 sounds too muffled to me and I was disappointed. There is more clarity and depth with the QY7 model.Also, with the QY7 model, pressing the + - button's main function on the side controls the VOLUME (as it should!); and to skip/back tracks, you would need to HOLD the buttons.However, with this Q2 mode, the default function of the + - buttons skips tracks instead, and for controlling volume, you would have to do the opposite by holding.  Personally, I don't skip tracks that often, so I prefer it's main function (pressing just once) to control the volume.The straps on this Q2 is shorter and thicker that it actually wraps right on my head that it feels like it acts as a head support; with the QY7, it is a thin flat cable. While the Q2 ends up being more discreet for me (it hides under my hair, wheras the QY7 straps can clearly be see hanging behind my back), with full confidence, the QY7 blows the Q2 away.Overall, I easily recommend getting the QY7 model! They're both made by Soundpeats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15PBX7LD79VU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWZ1JN6#wasThisHelpful","R15PBX7LD79VU6","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, there seems to be TWO versions of the X8 - one packaging already has the propellers attached and comes in a longer rectangular box; there's another X8 in a square shape box where you must attach the propellers yourself.- There's also TWO totally different type of battery connectors for the X8: one version has a round shaped end, whereas another version has a ""T"" shape end - you need to be careful which spare battery to buy depending on what unit you get. (the one I received was T shaped connector)- The manual wasn't very helpful because it's written in Chinese-English. I was so confused on how to connect the propellers when I first received it. After inserting the propellers, you need to insert the plastic holders with the tiny rod - You basically twist it clockwise to lock and it snaps in place; when you twist it counter-clockwise with your fingers, it should unlock and then you have to nudge the rod out to remove.When you consider price, it seems pretty hard to beat... it looks similar to the DJI Phantom design... However, it is what it is...I first got the Syma x5, loved it and got addicted to flying... (it really is an addicting hobby!) But I wanted to step up to the next level - while still staying on budget - especially since I wanted it to be able to lift a Mobius camera.It is able to lift a Mobius; I even lifted a Contour Roam (that thing is heavy!) and Sony Actioncam, but for a limited amount of time... it seems to struggle now to even lift a Mobius for me, so I ended up removing the legs completely; this way, the legs won't get in the footage, as well as being able to lift/fly better because added weight makes it struggle/stress the motors. Of course I have to launch and land grabbing it with my own hands. (Oh how I wish I could own a DJI Inspire where the landing gear would rise - so envious and cool!)The built-in camera is obviously junk, so I just unscrewed part of the camera while still using the mount/tilt and strapped a Mobius on there. Your footage will most likely suffer from the inevitable dreaded ""JELLO"" CMOS effect - I even did the custom cheap DIY anti-vibration damper using two credit cards and zip ties, which helped a little, but it still won't eliminate completely. I HATE that Jello curse.....If you are a beginner, don't even think about starting out with this... start with the x5 because you will definitely crash a lot (you can play it indoors too... the X8 is much louder). The x5, being small, can handle quite of bit of crashes. Even when you feel you've mastered the controls indoors, when you fly this thing outside and wind comes into play, it is a whole new ball game... it will get even more difficult fighting against the wind. It can get REALLY SCARY because it will drag the drone than how you exactly want the drone to move. I understand you have to dance with the wind/flow, but it just feels like there's some drift going on. Higher end drones seems to be able to handle flying near beach wind speeds just fine.  The X8 will drag a lot against the wind.The X8 has a ""HEADLESS MODE"" where it will eliminate worrying about the orientation having it face forward all the time; this is a nice feature, but if you don't set it up right in the beginning or RESET (dragging both controls to far left) then you will have a major disaster. Make sure you test it low flying near the ground first before you start changing directions/rotating while in headless mode. I just don't trust the reliability in Headless mode at all, since it does not use GPS to know its orientation.I can't imagine flying this thing out FAR - it's just way too risky. The only way I would fly pretty high is if it had a GPS/back to home/safety feature/FPV.When considering those premium features and better ACTUAL HD cameras, GIMBAL stabilization, First Person View monitor, etc. You realize you are really getting what you pay for with those drones that cost hundreds more. Moreover, I believe the X8 is actually more challenging to operate than those premium drones that practically makes it dumb-proof for anyone to fly with the built-in GPS/view etc. The X8 is like driving a manual transmission, while the premium ones are like driving automatic cars with training wheels.While I was super excited when I first got this, flying a ""full-size"" quadcopter/drone, whatever you want to call it, it's very exciting, but I soon realized for serious flying high/reliability/aerial photography, you get what you pay for.I am definitely going to invest on a Yuneec Typhoon Q500+ 4K or DJI Phantom Professional series. I am worried, though, with drones becoming so prevalent, there will be strict laws coming our way... I mean, already, police seems to be cracking down even wanting to just fly it at the park.I give the Syma X8 a 3.5/5 stars.Pros:- Full size (people have mounted GoPros on it)- Spare propellers included- Headless mode (but with cons too)- Competitive pricingCons:- Seems to have multiple X8 versions - why didn't they just have one standard battery, etc? adds more confusion.- The charger included in mine was a European plug, so you must attach an Euro-US plug adapter.- Not the easiest to operate - Don't even think about flying this thing way high up.- No premium features- Headless mode feels unreliable, scary.- Junk camera","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7VU1TKLAVSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4YON8K#wasThisHelpful","RY7VU1TKLAVSN","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you first get it, pressing the power button once will not keep the unit on; the manual states you must activate/register the device via online or by phone (enter email address/serial address) - I'm not sure how the device would know that it registered unless it connects via satellite or whatever, so I don't think it's really necessary... it seems like you just need to know the ""secret method"" to ""activate"" the device, which is not explained in the manual; therefore, after registering, it just gave additional ""secret instructions"" on how to get the device to work, which is by holding onto the power button (it must be unplugged from charger) until it gets to COUNT 5 and that's when you must release the power button (if you go over count 5 and release, it won't activate) then it'll make a successful beep (ta-dah sound), and now it will stay on after pressing the power button. (By the way, Tria needs to fix the video tutorial that shows up after registration because the video is linked to YouTube, but it's set to private and is unviewable)This product is definitely NOT for everyone. There are MANY restrictions that you must be aware of before trying or purchasing.Reading the manual properly for a device like this should obviously be required and would help... using the device is much simpler than going through the manual.There is one reviewer complaining about using it on their tattoo... it clearly states you can't use it on areas with tattoos! Also, NOT for moles, freckles, dark brown areas.If you have dark skin tone, I'm sorry, but you're out of luck! It sounds a bit racist, but it says if you're African, Indian, Pacific Islander... dark skin tones, you're just out of luck...Not only skintone that you must worry about, but it works only on natural brown or black hair - NOT for white, grey, blonde, or red hair.This is also NOT for using on men's beard/jaw as it is too dense. It is also NOT for genitals, even if you're a forest down there, or near eyes!This is NOT for under 18 years of age (not tested on children). NOT for pregnant women.There is a ""sensor skin"" on the bottom of the base, which you put over your skin, and if it believes your skin is a safe color to treat, it will ""unlock"" and you may begin using it.There is only one button on the device to worry about. Holding turns it OFF. If you press the power button while it's on, it will cycle through different levels/intensity (up to 5) of the laser. Many state it can end up feeling like ""rubber band snapping against the skin"", which sounds frightening, but I tried level 5, and to me, it had more of a burning sensation; others describe as tingling, itching, warm... it definitely burns at its highest, but tolerable. I don't recommend jumping to level 5 immediately. Gradually increase. You can't expect not feeling anything... I mean it's LASER and trying to kill your hair follicles, so that, ideally, it won't permanently grow there. No pain no gain! I'm sure it's less pain for most people than getting a wax. Obviously, lower the setting means, more treatment time will be required.When using the device, the cooling fan will go off and on -- this is NORMAL. When charging, if you want it to go to QUIET mode, where it charges without the cooling fan, you just HOLD the power button - but it will take longer to charge.It recommends treating every 2 weeks for up to 3 months. You will NOT get immediate results... your hairs aren't going to fall out right away. This is not an instant removal device. Patience is required.These are rough recommendations for treatments:Upper lip - 25 pulses (2-3 minutes)Underarms - 100 pulses per side (4-5 minutes)Bikini line - 200 pulses (8-10 minutes)Upper leg - 600 pulses (25-30 minutes)Knee - 600 pulses (25-30 minutes)Pros:- Do it at the comfort of your home- Very easy to operate- Pretty cool features- FDA approvedCons:- Expensive (although some believe it to be a lot cheaper than going to a treatment center)- Many limitations/skin tone/area/etc. (although understandably)- Small surface area","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DIA609OBLGJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWZ1H8O#wasThisHelpful","R3DIA609OBLGJ9","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I guess it is appropriately named ""Dream House"", the interior design are mostly what you would expect from a ""rich mansion"" or 5-star hotel rooms -- mostly are influnced by Victorian European style. If you actually google ""Victorian interior design"" you get pretty similar results of what you would see in this book.Personally, I would have found it to be more interesting if there was a BEFORE/AFTER picture... I mean, that's part of the fun... seeing the comparison than seeing just the end results. However, this is more of a simple clean portfolio of the interior designer.I got this book because I mainly have interest in interior photography, but I do have some interest in interior design as it seems like it can be a fun hobby for me. Although I would probably never be able to afford homes like these, I could steal ideas from it; no matter how small the room is, the fun thing about interior designing is how you can manipulate it by furniture, mirrors, and color scheme to make it feel larger or nicer than it is.Although I like the Victorian style, it still feels like confined luxury hotel rooms to me. Yes, art is subjective and it's all on the eye of the beholder. I think my dremhouse will be more modern ""futuristic"" style (whatever that means), which this book does not have. I think it would be more exciting if there was a book filled with futuristic concept interior design ideas.Some useless opinion of mine:pg 108 New York couple living in Paris... I feel like it's Aladdin's palace... seems heavy and overkill, definitely not for me, but I guess the clients are happy.pg. 175 Cosmopolitan Cool that one seemed to be the most refreshing to me, maybe because I just got tired of looking at brown/red/yellow colors... but it's simple... I've actually stayed at a hotel that looks very similar to that.If you're into classic old Victorian style designs and would like some inspiration in that (and feel some envy), this book is for you. If you're expecting more, you may be disappointed.3 stars means it's okay.

"My AC Adapter that came with my ASUS Laptop is so huge, it's not very convenient to carry it together. I was really excited to get this because this is so compact, I can easily carry it with my laptop. I like how the plugs fold in/out and it's not always sticking out.This is a great secondary adapter to have, but I have been using it as my primary charger for my ASUS laptop because of the convenient size/not having to carry my original brick size charger.I would have given 5 stars if it had an adapter to be able to charge my Acer Tablet, but none of them would fit it. I hope they provide more options than the ones that are included in this. All the adapters are stuck on a rubber piece, which is a simple nice way to keep it organized than having all the pieces everywhere.Also, I would have liked it if the tips had the manufacture name on it (ie; ASUS, Sony, Toshiba) instead of just generic ""FSP"" on it... I mean, you could refer to the guide or just trial and error seeing if each one fits properly, but having the actual brand names on it would have made things a bit faster.Overall, if your original charger is a major brick size, you'll be happy just for the size!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APTIN12K365K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHKV6OM#wasThisHelpful","R2APTIN12K365K","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am quite a car phone mount freak... I own so many of them and tried several different styles (phone/tablet mounts/gooseneck mounts/magnetic, etc). This Belkin looks better than most clamp mounts out there, but I don't believe it to be the best.What I look for in a good car mount:- aesthetics; if I'm going to be mounting it somewhere and need to always see it out in the open, I don't want it to look ugly!- how well it holds the device- how easy it is to mount and remove the device (one handed operation is a major plus!)- how versatile/rotation/angles it can achieveIn the end, I just got tired of the old ""clamp"" method (what this Belkin is) and just decided to go all cradle-free magnetic instead; I love how it gives a floating/clean look and easy removable (I constantly need to remove my phone/tablets from the mount). Again, right behind aesthetics, easy removable is very important to me. However, of course, there is also a trade-off with magnetic mounts where you would have to sacrifice sticking the other magnetic side on your phone/tablet (I wish manufactures would just add that feature it in, so that you can easily mount it anywhere on magnetic surfaces)Although most of my mounts are magnetic now, I still use the popular iOttie Easy One Touch 2 Car Mount Holder for my Galaxy Note phone; that's one of the nicest clamp type holders out there. (I love the extension arm and one handed mounting)I was first surprised by the price tag of this Belkin mount and wondered why it costs so much. After I received it though, some material does feel quite high quality compared to most mounts out there.Pros:- It has a nice easy twist securing for the suction cup (with lock and unlock easily identifiable as well).- The clamp pull-out is like metallic and feels solidCons:- The rubber sides on the clamp seems to pop out way too easily; this part is very poorly designed; it's annoying that it won't stay flush, especially when you mount/remove a device.- I don't like how there is some restrictions in the rotation; you can tilt down several degrees (when it's face up) but it won't allow more degrees tilting up because the ballhead hits the restricted neck; I need more flexibility.- Despite the ballhead being stiff, there is no real locking/screw adjustments to really secure that position.- No one handed removableI wish the large circular part of this Belkin was magnetic and without the clamps, or perhaps be able to have both options.Aesthetically, it is pleasing for a clamp style mount and the metallic clamp that pulls out makes it feel like high quality. However, functionality, I still prefer the iOttie Easy One Touch and magnetic mounts more. Considering I've gone through many mounts, I'm a lot harsher rating this; I feel this product is a 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U3JAHHEQQX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLY9VC#wasThisHelpful","R16U3JAHHEQQX0","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I think of memory foam, I imagined VERY VERY SOFT and fluffy like marshmallow... (not that I would sleep on that)I was really excited to try this out... presentation was nice... so far so good, but when I laid on it, I was surprised how STIFF it felt! I thought I was going to get that ""sinking down"" cloud feel... but I wasn't getting it... I'm not surprised by one of the reviews writing how it felt like a rock... I mean, it did feel rock solid...  it's pretty SOLID support; I understand that is also a preference compared to some than fluffy softness.I also have SHREDDED memory foam pillow and that one is very fluffy; if you're looking for that then shredded is the way to go. HOWEVER, if you're looking for/prefer a solid/firm head/neck support, then this is what you'd want to try.I've had this for several weeks now, and it feels like it's a little softer than when I first received it. I guess like most things, there is a break-in period and it gets better the more times you sleep on it.Sometimes, I like the very fluffy pillow feel, and other times I'd like a harder/solid support for my head. I like having different options/feel. It actually wasn't big as I thought it would be; I wish it was bigger, especially the width.Overall, it's good but expect it to be firm support than being fluffy/no support feel; it all depends on your mood/preference.

"While this may be obvious to some, keep in mind, this is a ""IP5"" rated Splashproof speaker - it is NOT waterproof where you can SUBMERGE in a swimming pool, so don't do that.I was surprised by how good these speakers sound for its size. Sound quality is definitely the main purpose of speakers, and it definitely does not disappoint; I would say it is the highlight of the SE90 Splashproof speaker. It really is impressive when you consider the size/wireless - technology has come a long way (and prices! wow). It has a good balance and soothing bass (not just those garbled overblown muffled lows); you won't be disappointed with the sound quality - as long as you know it's limitations - obviously it only has 2 drivers, but surround sound is definitely there. I've listened to all kinds of music; rock, rap/hip-hop, classical, retro, oldies, techno, pop... it all sounds good. Great for personal listening at a desk or a group of people.Pros:- Impressive sound for its size; you won't be disappointed; soothing bass/good balance/surround sound, despite having just two drivers. Quite satisfying.- Splashproof/Rugged; easy to carry; nice colors- Tripod screw on the bottom is a nice, unique touch; you can also get those gorillapods, screw this speaker on, and hang it on a tree or something (of course position/location of the speaker can make a BIG difference in sound experience!)- Micro USB to charge- Bargain PriceCons:- You have to HOLD to turn volume on/off - if you just press it once then it skips tracks instead; I would have preferred opposite because I would adjust volume more frequently than skipping tracks. It's odd because it has a - + sign, where the main function should be to control volume first, not a a secondary where you have to hold; it would make more sense if it at least had a >>> <<< sign instead to know its main function is skipping tracks.- Buttons requires somewhat a hard push, especially when having to hold on to it.- Must HOLD the POWER button for awhile to turn on- NFC did not work for me (I believe the sensor is supposed to be located on the top left of the speaker where there's a Z)) symbol but I tried putting two of my NFC enabled phone/tablet on it and it did nothing (NFC works with my other devices)- The back micro USB/Aux cover pops out way too easily; I would have preferred a much more secure locking mechanism considering this is supposed to be an ""outdoor"" rugged speaker.- Buttons itself could have used a more distinct color/black highlight to see its function; it blends too much orange that you have to look closely; I think that would have looked better too.If you're looking for a portable bluetooth speaker with satisfying sound, you can't go wrong with this - splashproof is a bonus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QIZU4U434L7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7N0MK0#wasThisHelpful","R2QIZU4U434L7U","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3M recently added a video on youtube showing how to apply this on, which can be very helpful. Although, I would recommend putting this on the window glass first as opposed to laying it on a table for it to be much cleaner.The time and effort you first begin to clean your window first will result in much smoother process and less bubbles; if you get lots of bubbles no matter how hard you squeegee it, you probably didn't do a good job cleaning your windows.A lot of people seem to recommend spraying with mix of Johnson's baby shampoo/water for easier placement/squeegee effort.Trim the film 1"" larger than the glass size. Start from the CENTER and you want to squeegee it OUTWARDS by pushing - not pulling.It's more forgiving than applying on a screen protector on your phone... You can actually reapply it if you get bubbles.You will need some patience, but it's a fun DIY project and you'll be happy and proud once you accomplish it. The kit comes with cutting and essential tools.Living in California and the harsh sun, I'm glad I was able to try this.

"I own tons of these portable power bank chargers ranging from all sizes/designs... I mean, you can never have too much power on-the-go...Anker and Ravpower is commonly known in the market. I've never heard of TSST, but this company uses Samsung's SDI Polymer, which are high quality battery cells and slim form - and a good reason why they're advertising that part.The design of this reminds me of an Apple product. Actually, it feels like I'm caring a spare phone/iPhone or something instead of a charger. Aesthetically, it is pleasing than most power banks out there. There is a digital display to show how much charge there is left by pressing on the button on the right. When you're charging the power bank itself, it will automatically show the charging display.I would have been impressed if this had at least a 10,000mah with this form factor/slimness. This one is only 5000mah (which I feel is bare minimum these days, especially with more demanding tablets); it's thin, but it's a bit long. I own a 5000mah that is much smaller size.Pros:- Looks nice; seems like an Apple design/iPhone- Displays charging amount- two USB ports (1.0A and 2.4A)- ThinCons:- although it's thin, it's long like a phone size (would have been impressed with this size if it was 10,000mah)- only one cable is included- No flash light/extrasIf this was my first power bank, I probably would have given it a 5 stars, but considering I own many of these, I give it a 4.With 5000mah, which would give my Galaxy phone a full charge and little bit more to spare; My phone had about 10% charge left and I was able tor recharge it to 100% in about 2 and half hours with 25% left on the power bank. The display capacity was accurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMNCQ0LP2GCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN9C178#wasThisHelpful","R2XMNCQ0LP2GCC","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is pretty expensive for a nail clipper, especially when it doesn't snip that wide for toe nails, etc... it's not very versatile and more for specific use - mainly feels like it's for ""fine-tuning"" finger nails with occasional minimal tiny cuts; not for cutting long nails at all.It feels like I'm using a stapler; the snaps are sharp but feels very rough. The opening is not that wide.This is a small size. I believe the price is more due to it being a brand name. Overall, I think it's just okay.

"At first I got confused with this company with Mpow (I have their bluetooth receiver) - this is IPOW.I own so many mounts for my car, I thought I didn't need one anymore... yet this ended up replacing one of my main mounts and I'm happily always using it.Magnetic mounts are nothing new and there's many versions of them out now; however, this one includes a nice bendable long arm! I've been starting to replace all of my ""claw/clamp"" type mounts with magnetic mounts because it's so much more convenient to remove it easily and attach (although there is also a trade-off where you do have to stick the opposite end magnets on your devices)The arm is not flimsy at all and is quite durable - it even holds my Nexus 7 tablet!I like that the magnet part is clean/blank and does not have any ugly manufacture name on it; the magnet is the same as Teslan's magnet holder.For those that are paranoid about magnets, it is safe as they do not affect cellphone/memory/sim card.I'm actually not using it on a windshield; I bought one of those cup holders and attached this; now I have way better reach and flexibility to reach my device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VR7QE8Q0NT7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNPXUPS#wasThisHelpful","R1VR7QE8Q0NT7K","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update: down to 3 stars from 4.After using it more, I realized it doesn't help that much. If the sunshade was longer/bigger, it would probably actually create a shade, but I find that in most situations, I still get sun coming from above or in front and this sunshade hardly blocks it; covering with your hands still does a better job...I got this for my Garmin 7"" NUVI 2757. As another review mentioned, the stock photo definitely shows it being used for the 5"", having it cleanly fit on the OUTER edge of the GPS; however, the one they actually ship goes OVER the frame/border of the GPS and just slightly over the screen. It's a bit misleading. If you look closely at the stock photo, you can also see the words 'GPS' written on the top of the sunshade too - however, the actual product is blank.I guess it's good or bad depending on how you look at it... I mean, the border part of the GPS doesn't really matter anyway... it's just if you're very picky like me and wanting a perfect fit; having it slightly cover the edge of the screen might be bothersome for some people, but it's quite negligible.I uploaded some pictures to see how it looks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE1LS8V4Y8HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI4CZJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1NE1LS8V4Y8HR","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the poor reviews before purchasing and decided to try it for myself anyway; I had my expectations low and wasn't even sure if it would fit over my car pedals...It doesn't come with any instructions, so you just have to figure it out yourself. These pedal covers go over your existing pedals. You screw it in so that the clips (which do not come assembled) grip the back of your pedals.The gas pedal covered fine, but it seems everyone will have issues with the brake pedal to fit because it's just too small!This is definitely NOT an universal design. I ended up clipping just the top part (since that was the only way for the brakes) and just duck taped the bottom part right on the pedal; it hasn't effected the performance, as far as I know for now...I do like the feel of the gas pedal having the cover on; it feels like I don't need to press on the gas as hard to gain speed right away.It's too bad they didn't design the brake pedal to be bigger to actually fit. If some company makes a cover with heavy duty metal and universal design/larger brake cover, I would love that.I couldn't find any pictures of these, let alone being on actual pedals, so I'll be the first to share; you can see the real colors too. You get what you pay for (perhaps maybe still overpriced).I'll see how long it holds up and update my review if things change.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QP2POHQXAR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKWTKOU#wasThisHelpful","R20QP2POHQXAR4","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this is getting some harsh rating by everyone... 1 star and saying it tastes like plastic is pretty harsh...This review is for the Fav Reds, not the original flavor packaging, which they also offer in this new minis.The Fav Reds contains 4 flavors: strawberry, fruit punch, cherry, watermelonThe fruit punch really taste like fruit punch to me. I'm not a fan of watermelon and cherry, but I can distinguish the flavors.However, the colors are what's really hard to distinguish for me; I keep thinking the lighter pink one is strawberry (the packaging even looks like the lighter pink is strawberry), but it's watermelon! the slighter darker pink one is strawberry.The dark red one is fruit punch. I wish the colors were more obvious to distinguish.It's funny how majority of people love the pink one the best (strawberry) and the yellow one doesn't get any love. Haha.I always love getting/eating the pink one too. It's nice that they're unwrapped, but I feel the regular size is much better to chew and really taste the flavors... these mini size really feel like you're losing out the full satisfaction. Even the strawberry pink one, I don't get that satisfaction that I get with the full size one.I wish they would make the original size starburst in a bag like this without having to unwrap - that will sell!I added some pictures; no, I did not feed my cat starburst or eat the penny - it's there for size comparison.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B2HJ036NVTZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT29ZFY#wasThisHelpful","R2B2HJ036NVTZX","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The advertising ""romantic intimate motion in vehicle"" part is hilarious; well, make sure your partner is slender and you have the emergency/side brake up....Not just that silly statement alone, but reading the manual, you'll clearly see that this is a Chinese product.The idea of having an inflatable bed in the car just seemed so cool, especially on long road trips. I just had to try this out.It comes with an air pump (no, that's not what it's used for...), the inflatable bed, two inflatable pillows, and a bag. I was pleasantly surprised how fast everything inflated easily.It's definitely nicer than just sleeping on a narrow car seat itself. Add a comfortable blanket and a really nice soft neck pillow (I know these include pillows, but it could use more comfort), and you'll have a better sleeping experience.Some of the cons, though - not entirely the fault of the product - but due to the design of how cars are made, you have to keep in mind, you'll still be scrunching to sleep due to the limited length wise (unless you leave your doors open, which would be unsafe and impractical); I know if I could extend my legs, I would be more comfortable on this airbed. You'll most likely will have to move your driver/passenger seat really forward for this to fit too.The cloth could be more softer; if you lay down too fast on it, you may give yourself an easy friction burn. I would cover it with a blanket/sheet.Pros:- 12v Air pump included (not as loud as I was expecting) - easy to inflate and quickly!- It is more comfortable than sleeping on the car seat itself (however, you'll still most likely be scrunching up because the limitation of the car seat)- Versatility; the ""leg"" support that fits to keep the bed up inflates separately, so you can use still use this bed on a flat surface; you can also inflate the leg part and flip the whole thing over and it turns into a mini couch too.- Deflates easily and store away- Pretty cool to have/show off.Cons:- You will most likely have to adjust the driver/passenger seats really forward for this to fit properly (which means having one person drive while another person sleeping in the back with this not ideal)- Be careful of getting friction burn due to the cloth material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5GSBKTHAU1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8EJA5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5GSBKTHAU1A","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I wish I had these sooner! I'm amazed how dark my room is now after putting these on. Perfect for sleeping in and using my projector during daytime!

Now I don't have to hide and be in the dark during Halloween :P)I received the CHOCOLATE color one. Depending on the color, you'll probably receive different results.I personally probably wouldn't choose this color myself, but it looks pretty stylish... it feels more like a theater room for me now. It definitely looks like chocolate color!I would get an even extra longer length, so that it will eliminate even that tiny light leak if you're picky - that is if you want total darkness.I'm very impressed with this and highly recommend these curtains for blocking out sunlight, especially the chocolate color.Now, I shall go back for more blood...

"I never knew this film even existed. I bought this not knowing anything about it...If you're looking for a thought-provoking film with dialogue ""Which came first? Chicken or the egg? Snake that eats its own tail...""), not mindless action, with some impressive performances, from Leonardo DiCaprio... I mean, look alike (no, he's actually not in it, sorry), haha... this is for you. It makes Inception feel so simple, elementary thinking.If you are just expecting explosions and major action type film like Looper, or have low attention span, this is DEFINITELY NOT for you.First 50 minutes is heavy dialogue and major build up before they do any kind of time traveling or where you see it start to go somewhere - if you don't have the patience for that, again, this film is NOT for you.Half the movie, you'll be thinking to yourself, why are we just listening to these two characters talk in the bar?? Why aren't they going after the Fizzle Bomber?! I was starting to doubt, how did this film received such high praise... I will tell you, the story/buildup in the beginning is worth the investment for the major shock value towards the ending. I don't mean to over-hype it, but I love endings that just really blows you away, like the movie Se7en.When people say it's ""mindblowing"", yeah... it's just crazy how someone could come up with a story like this. This film involves a paradox, so it may end up hurting your brain thinking about it too much. I have not seen many movies this complex and insane.The movie plot is simply described as a time traveling agent going after a terrorist bomber to prevent it before happening... However, this makes people, or at least, it made me think it was going to be more action-type film like Minority Report -- it's NOT.  (I'm surprised by the ""Editorial Review"" on this Amazon page - it should be revised because there's an unnecessary information that gives WAY too much away there.)It should be confusing when you first watch it. This is a film that actually gets better with a second viewing.Ethan Hawke is an awesome actor. I'm a fan of him even more now after watching this film. I've never heard of Sarah Snook before, but she gives a versatile performance as well.Predestination may not be a high budget film/marketing like Looper, which may be the reason why it was so low-key, and it somewhat has an indie feel, I consider it a classic and quite powerful.If you want a film that leaves you with lots of discussion and enjoy analyzing, this film is for you. I watched a few days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it/discussing it.This film is actually quite depressing when you really think about it.Somewhat similar films (although these are more higher budget/involve more action):- Looper- Interstellar- Minority Report- Edge of Tomorrow- Oblivion- Shutter Island- Fight Club- Sixth Sense","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMXT8NZJ1XZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4AOPG#wasThisHelpful","RTMXT8NZJ1XZN","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this B40 / A118 model dashcam is a ""generic"" Chinese product rebranded many times under different vendors (Spy Tec, Auto-Vox).  However, the B40 dashcam has grown to be a well deserved popular dashcam. The B40 model I purchased was under the name 'Blueskysea' (that is what it displays when the camera first turns on); it's actually pretty funny the sound it makes when you first turn it on - it's a major exact rip off of Sony's Cybershot camera when it first turns on (sound and display can be disabled).It came in a very generic white box that says ""Car DVR"" on it; I mean that can be anything!Previously, I've been using a Sony Actioncam and Contour Roam as a dashcam; however, I later realized I needed a REAL dashcam... Biggest reasons are:1) After awhile, it becomes cumbersome having to press record button manually and I often forget to turn it off; a real dashcam should just do its own thing when you start the engine and off (automatically start recording when power is fed to it and stop when an external power source is no longer going to it.)2) Loop recording; previously, I had to remove/delete clips manually, or when the card became full, I obviously would no longer be able to record. With Loop recording feature, when the card becomes full, it will overwrite the older files. Dashcam cameras also records in increments, so if you have a certain accident, you'll just have a 3 or 5 minute clip of that moment instead of 1 large 2 hour file and having to find that moment; this makes sharing and uploading more convenient.3) Timestamp on the video; this is important in proving an exact moment/event (again, a feature not possible with actioncams). I really like the clean timestamp display on this B40 camera - it's large without being obtrusive and clean/professional looking. I have seen dashcams where it has some ugly font colors as the timestamp.4) Video quality. I've compared the quality of Sony Actioncam, Contour, and the B40... These dashcam/B40 camera seems to automatically put a major sharpness filter to the video; it does work to its advantage for dashcam footage, as I'm able to read license plate numbers a lot clearly (granted there's a good light source and you're right behind the car) a lot clearly. Night time is not the best, but acceptable and I still find it to be better than the Sony or Contour. I am actually impressed and prefer the sharpness filter when it comes to car footage than the Sony Actioncam/Contour.I don't believe the B40 is actual 170 degrees; the Sony and Contour shows way more field of view and they're rated at 170 degree FOV. The B40 is wide, but it's not extreme fisheye.What also interested me about the B40 camera was the form factor; it actually looks the best out of all the other dashcams I've seen, even more expensive ones and name brands; I love how discreet it is and one really can't tell unless they look closely as it hides perfectly in the shaded area of the windshield. Unfortunately, if you plan on placing this anywhere else out in the open, it wouldn't look as clean, especially with the visible tape.It's fantastic being be able to tilt and adjust the angle of the camera to get the best angle - the monitor is also very helpful! I also ordered the Mobius camera, which is also small, but I could not mount the Mobius and set the camera angle the way I wanted; not to mention there is no screen so it takes more trial and error to get the right angle.The B40 is very easy to setup - the Mobius camera is a lot more complicated and definitely not as user-friendly for a beginner (you really need to read the manual for that one and understand how the LED colors mean)Pros:- Love the Form Factor - Looks very cool and professional - very discreet/stealth - Perfect to mount it on the shaded part of the windshield- You can adjust the camera angle! Many other dashcams require no angle adjustments or require large mounts.- Display monitor- Nice, clean, professional looking timestamp- Auto start/end- Loop recording- Supports 64GB microSD- Easy set-up.- Audio recording is not bad- Price (Amazing value for the price)Cons:- Night time is not the best (however, most cameras don't perform well in low light; it is still better than the Sony/Contour)- Battery does not last long without external power source- Adhesive should be clear or black.- A polarizing filter would be nice - it will reflect your windshield.One thing to be aware is B40 dashcam also comes as a Capacitor Edition where there is no battery, which is suppose to be more ideal for those living in hot/extreme climates; I got the battery version and I live in hot California weather, so I'm hoping this camera will last me. The nice thing about the battery version is that it doesn't shut down immediately and it actually keeps recording/delay even when the power source is disconnected/engine turned off.I'm very happy I decided to get a real dashcam and not have to use my Sony Actioncam/Contour; I can really just drive and forget about it. It's so discreet it looks seamless along with the rearview mirror. I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M8CIW7YK4C4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ0GKVS#wasThisHelpful","R3M8CIW7YK4C4S","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first learned about magnetic mounting from owning a Mountek nGroove product and thereafter, I've seen many magnetic mounts come out.As with all of them, the magnetic mounts, as opposed to those regular claw gripping ones are the convenience of removal and attachment, as well as aesthetics since there won't be any ugly frames gripping your device and it looks like it is floating.The only con/trade-off is having to permanently stick these opposite magnets on your device unless you're using a case cover or if your phone even has space/able to close having the plates inserted internally without physically sticking it on.Well, I took the convenience route and sacrificed just permanently sticking the magnet on a lot of my devices/tablets (I'm not really happy with that), since I own quite of these magnetic mounts. I don't regret my decision to replace my old mounts with this magnetic as it looks better (well, when it's mounted... not the plates attached to my devices now) and it's just so nice to be able to remove/attach easily with some minor force. It's great when you constantly need to attach/remove, such as getting out of the car and taking the device with you.This mount holds up my Nexus 7 and my 7"" Garmin GPS nicely. I just stuck the suction cup on my dashboard and it's staying nicely; I'll see how long it will hold because my other mount's suction cup would sometimes come off when I'm parked with excessive heat.I would like to see these plates be able to stick on in a non permanent way.I've come to known the brand name Arkon now, as they seem to make every single kind of mounts out there!

"First of all, I USED TO BE in one of those crowds that argued what's the point of standalone GPS units when we have smartphones now with much superior processors along with detailed Google Maps/other apps like Waze available... I do use my 10"" and 7"" tablets with my phone as a hotspot. Some may think 7"" screen is overkill, but these days, just like smartphones, bigger display is just becoming the norm now.I was sure standalone GPS units would be obsolete by now... However, I'll tell you why I still decided to buy this Garmin and find it superior than Magellan, Tom Tom, and other brands out there.What sold me the most and what I'm impressed with:- With the Garmin, it actually tells you SPECIFICALLY which recognizable building for an upcoming turn (ie: ""Turn right after you pass McDonald's"") - Very cool!- The ""PhotoReal Junction"" feature where it split screens and shows a DETAILED still image similar to the sign/surrounding, not just a generic one like other GPS units may have, of the actual exit - THIS IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL and impressive. This feature really sold me the most where I have not seen with any other GPS units.- Lane assist; I like that it tells you which exact lane to stay on and the split view again makes it very helpful.- Speed limit display / warns when nearby school zones- I like that it displays the upcoming street name on the top.- It keeps a log of where you've driven and stopped, which is kind of scary, but can be useful (you can disable it if you go under Settings - Device - and uncheck Travel History).If you go to Settings - Map & Vehicle - Map Layers - and check Trip Log - it will highlight the roads you've driven before on the map.- Interestingly, the Garmin unit itself takes power via micro USB (more common/standard now) from the bottom; however, with the cradle mount attachment on the back that connects via Garmin's proprietary pins, the power connection takes the older mini USB cable from the side.Con:- It needs a screen calibration feature; I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, but the reason I can't give it 5 stars is because when especially using the keyboard where the buttons are really close to each other, it is off and can be really frustrating (My Mio GPS has a calibration feature, so I don't have this problem regardless being the same inferior resistive screen) if you need to press/type fast. I have this issue quite often, and I have to be VERY careful using the tip of my finger or adjust slightly off than I would like to type/press the keys or else it ends up registering the wrong key. Of course, most older GPS units, including this model, has a resistive touch screen, inferior to smartphone's capacitive screen, so it's not as responsive. There is no pinch zooming or rotating. Screen also is not as vivid/clear compared to the Magellan.- After awhile, Garmin's myTrends feature kicks in, where I noticed without even inputting/starting navigation, it will know your previous route/saved locations and it will automatically display an estimated time and the name of that location on the top, as opposed to the upcoming street names it usually displays (which I would rather see!). What's annoying is there is no way to simply CANCEL this when it predicts the trend/place it thinks you're about to head to, besides disabling the entire myTrends/Travel history/log. Why they couldn't simply add a cancel feature or at least prompt you to ask if that is where you're actually heading to (app like Waze even prompts if I'm heading home first/allowing me to cancel!), I just can't understand. I'm sure they were thinking this myTrends feature would be a convenience, but I don't want it to be displaying ""Home"" and ETA the entire route even if I may or may not be heading towards my home. I don't want to lose my history log either, so disabling the myTrends feature isn't really a workaround... please fix this, Garmin.- 1 hour battery life does not seem impressive; however, I hardwired it directly to my car, so it will turn on when turning on the engine and display that it will turn off when external power is removed.- I'm surprised it does not have a QUICK 2D/3D camera switch - Please add that on an update, Garmin! - it is so cumbersome having to go to settings and map just to change that! I would also love a quick way to switch to North Up/etc/Quick sky view, etc. More camera angles! Garmin should utilize the split screen feature more - I would love to be able to show 2D and 3D views simultaneously when you're just cruising (and also be able to adjust camera height for both individually)I did find, though, that you can press somewhere off the map and you can press one of the icons on the top left corner and it will show a higher view facing North Up; I use this feature when I'm in 3D mode and need to quickly get a better view of the surroundings.- They should add a fast forward/speed up for simulation mode - who wants to sit through all that?! Other GPS simulation have that feature.- Direction/Calculations not as smart/good as Google.- Would like a ring/beep sound to indicate when to turn/manuver.I also own the 7"" Magellan RoadMate Commercial Truck GPS Navigator 9270T-LM, which has the same 800x480 resolution, but the display looks much better and clearer on the Magellan. Also, there's more detailed road names display even when you're in a higher view. Despite those pros on the Magellan, I find the Garmin superior on interface, speed, and everything else.I found that on long road trips, it's much better to have a standalone GPS since- it will not eat up your phone mobile data or battery, not be distracted from other apps/calls taking over the screen- better reliability/GPS signal- with the Garmin, the detailed lane assist/display/voice really comes in handy and find it superior than what phone app navigation or other GPS offers.I've used GPS units from Magellan, Tom Tom, Mio/iGo8/Primo (I really like how fast Mio GPS operates and iGo has many features I like that I wish Garmin would include too), Sygic, and I'm still impressed with what Garmin has. Ideally, it would be nice to have one unit that is capable of having everything, but they all have their pros/cons.I purchased the 2757 model, which lacks voice recognition, Bluetooth and traffic; however, I don't need them because for real-time traffic, I still rely on Waze. I still also like relying on Google Maps to get a better view of the wide surroundings (so much more clear and easy to see detail and faster than sluggish GPS units). However, when it comes to actually inputting navigation, I will be using this Garmin.I also downloaded the latest free map and software updates, which can take awhile, but you have to be patient. You can also download more custom 3D vehicles like something ridiculous like Star War's X-Wing.If you're looking for a good standalone GPS unit, even if you already have a smartphone, I would consider the Garmin over other brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQVCJS2GJRV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0I6A#wasThisHelpful","RTQVCJS2GJRV7","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While my network does not have the latest AC router running right now, I still see the benefits of this wireless adapter card, as it is backwards compatible with all previous bands, including N. Possibly because of the 3 antennas, I am getting stronger, consistent bars with this now.If you are thinking about streaming HD content, especially higher than 1080p video, then you need this or else you will have lots of inconvenient stuttering experience.I prefer having this built into my system than going the USB route for better stability, as well as freeing up USB connections.The added heatsink is nice touch; however, it kind of sticks out so it may or may not interfere with some plugs/wires below if your PCI-e x1 slot is near below.I've become familiar with and trust the TP-Link name now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHT9V6P7Z0U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQEX7AQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GHT9V6P7Z0U4","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I am a huge 1987 original Robocop fan. Back in the day, all we had was a totally inaccurate red visor Kenner Robocop...28 years later and we FINALLY get a GOOD Robocop figure. Is it PERFECT? No. But it's definitely the best one out there.When I saw the pre-release photos of this figure, it looked so unbelievably movie accurate, I just had to have it... The figure was frustratingly delayed for months than the expected release date, but the figure is finally available.The prototype looked like it used all diecast parts, but the final release is NOT all diecast. The side arms are partially diecast, but it is still mostly plastic. However, there is still a good amount of weight to the figure.I feel sorry for those that own the previous Hot Toy's 2012 version of Robocop (MMS10) - that bobblehead looking, horrible proportion Robocop looks so laughable in comparison; even if that figure were selling really cheap, I would never buy that one. It just looks so BAD! I can't believe how bad that one looks. However, Hot Toys really took it seriously this time and to another level. It's about time we get a good Robocop figure!I uploaded some photos of my figure; It looks incredibly dead-on accurate. Manufactures from all these years could NEVER get Peter Weller's jawline right in their figures, but Hot Toys finally got it right with this one.However, I still feel Hot Toys made Robocop too silver. Almost all Robocop figures being made by everyone makes Robocop too silver. Robocop is NOT completely silver and it's not because of the lighting in the film. Robocop has a purplish/blue shade to him. However, with some blue lighting setup, you can kind of get by it.The holster can be opened and pulled out. It comes with a detailed plastic Auto-9 gun (to make him hold it) and a less detailed diecast gun (this one would go in the holster)The sound effects are good, but the ""Drop the gun you are under arrest"" and ""Thank you for your cooperation, good night"" still has the background noise/TV sound from the film.I almost thought about buying Enterbay's Robocop, but after watching and hearing many reviews from others, Hot Toys is more accurate and better value. Why would anyone want to be reminded of that horrible Robocop 3 and want junk Jetpack accessory?!Pros:- Most accurate Robocop figure out there today.- Range of the sound effect remote is quite impressive - does not even have to be pointing at the figure.- ArticulationsCons:- Having to remove the back plate and toggling the on-switch - VERY inconvenient, especially when it's already in a display case.- Battery for the remote is included; however, battery for the Robocop is NOT included. It requires two N size LR-1 battery.- Wish they stepped it up even more and added some purple shade to it - being really knit-picky - it is too silver.- At this price, quality control should be perfect - mine had some minor scratches and being extremely picky, it bugged me a lot...If you're a Robocop fan, a movie figure collector, this is the best Robocop figure out there.Looking forward for the battle damaged version with the helmet off expected to be released later this year (although I wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed again) resembling so much of Peter Weller. That one looks incredible!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333J6STEQCEUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D419K1W#wasThisHelpful","R333J6STEQCEUL","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- No assembly required. Just unstrap and unfold.- Easy to set up. It won't tangle.- Nylon straps and plastic material makes easier to carry/prevent injury/kid friendly.

"We all typically hear differently and have different taste in what is ""good sound"" (more bass, less bass, more treble.. etc); it's especially difficult when it comes to earbuds that go into your ear canal because if one doesn't have it inserted properly, they would assume the sound is awful/lack bass or whatnot - these are supposed to go deep into your ear canal; it will sound different if you insert a larger/smaller plugs into your ear. The deeper it goes into your ear canal, the deeper sound experience you will have, obviously. If you don't like that, then these aren't for you.If this was a Sony or some other major brand, I'm sure more people will flock to this item without hesitation... However, not everything that cost a lot equals better amazing sound; one would think you get what you pay for looking at this earphone, but in this case, I feel the price is an amazing value. Most things are manufactured in China anyway even if it has a major brand name slapped on it.The packaging is like very similar to what I have seen when I bought an Anker power bank and whatnot - they must all use similar packaging companies or design. From reading the manual, you can clearly tell it is a Chinese company product.- You get two extra smaller size ear hooks- You get two extra ear plugs- You get a dual micro USB-USB cable- micro-USB cable (for connecting right/ear phones together)I have many earphones/headphones that cost way more than this -- and lack bluetooth --where these sound just as good, if not, better than those. Bass is there, but again, since these are designed to go into your ear canal, depending on the sizes of your ear/plugs and your hearing, a lot of people will have different experiences - ultimately, you would need to try it yourself. Personally, I'm happy with the sound - and it's especially impressive when considering the price.I used this with my Android phone as well as a Sony Playstation Vita portable gaming system.All the controls are on the right earphone - Hold onto the power button and you will see red/blue lights flashing to indicate sync mode. You should see ""S530"" on your bluetooth capable device.Pros:- Great for exercising/moving around.- Price - Quite impressive for sound and bluetooth- You can skip track/rewind control volume up/down- I like that some of the ear plug insert is differently color coded so it's easier to match.Cons:- You must connect with a micro-USB to the left earphone to listen to both - it would be amazing and great if both were completely wireless! When I first got them, I had no idea you had to connect to the left earphone via micro USB. Bummer.- Earhooks could be more flexible/better fit for smaller earsOverall, I believe you get more than what you pay for here at an amazing value - heck... even the dual micro-USB charging cable/micro USB cable extras alone are nice to have and some places charges a lot for those!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAX6ZJILRCLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8SSKZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1LAX6ZJILRCLU","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Wow, I can see the world in high definition!""Have you seen that cheesy infomercial? Seeing the world in high definition... like what does that even mean?? huh?? It totally made me laugh, but when I went driving with this on, it reminded me of that commercial... like it kind of felt ""HD"" to me... I mean, things felt like it was magnified and definitely clearer and easy to see.I'm not sure if all polarized lenses act the same way, but it completely blacks out the screen when looking at my tablet/smartphone from an angle. Polarization is definitely there. However, there was no issue with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S tablet; I believe because the screen is AMOLED.I was hoping to always use this while driving, but I can't see my navigation screen (tablet), so it's a bit of a bummer for me.- Made from polycarbonate and nylon.- The tips are rubbery/snake-like.- Stylish looking/large lens- Won't fall off even looking down/move around and still have comfort.- Glasses do not fold completely compact.

"I was surprised how nice the quality of the keyboard press/feedback feel was. It has a good slight amount of mushy feel to it when you type on it; cheap keyboards to me just has a horrible clicky feel to it.I also like the amount of tilt it provides.This keyboard is nothing fancy; it has no backlighting or special features other than being bluetooth and allowing you to connect to another input via USB.

"I was really excited to try this out and was expecting some major accuracy, considering it's marketed as a ""fine point"".However, in practicality, it's more like pseudo-fine point... as in, it's actually more of this huge clear DISC-SHAPE TIP that has to be on the surface. I really wish they could have made an actual thin soft tip without needing that annoying disc, as it really gets in the way for me - regardless it being transparent.If the disc part comes off, then it will become completely useless too! You need to be careful not to drop/hit something and realize it not being attached later on. The disc came off on my mine once, but I was able to snap it back on. It's a good thing it has a cap for the tip. When you're using it, you can screw the cap on the back of the stylus.I have a Samsung Galaxy phone, and maybe I've been spoiled by the S-Pen, but the S-Pen is far superior than this as there is no annoying clear disc involved; it's just a real natural writing experiencing - the plastic tip ""fine point"" on the S-Pen makes more sense to me.Again, an actual fine point pen/pencil we use on regular paper is, obviously, VERY different when it comes to a digital world; it doesn't work the same. In the digital world, you can be using a very fat soft stylus tip, but depending on the software/app, you can adjust accordingly depending the digital thickness you select. The advantage of a small tip on a stylus is so it can be easier to SEE (not actual writing because that's all dependent  on the app/virtual world) when you want to write more precisely. With that being said, I find the disc to be bothersome when I'm writing.I can't agree with the high ratings.Pros:- Seems solid.- Clip- Cap; can also be screwed on the back of the stylusCons:- The whole clear disc-shape tip design. Why? Is it really necessary? It gets in the way. Awkward. I hate it.- If you lose the clear-disc on the tip, the stylus will become useless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMBJP5K3WUU9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","RMBJP5K3WUU9X","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why there's so many complaining about how to use this... it's not difficult at all and I'm not even a handy guy. You can remove it quickly and quietly with this -- but it does require some strength when pulling the lever up.To use this, the longer lever (top one) needs to be ALL THE WAY UP and you sit this device right on the wine, while you squeeze it with the shorter lever -- to grip the wine securely (the shorter lever is simply for gripping the bottle); you then push the long lever all the way down for the screw to go in; then pull the lever back up (this is where it will require some strength) -- and make sure you still squeeze/grip the lower lever on the bottle while putting the lever up.Once the lever is back up, you can release the grip/lower lever and the cork should pop right out. The cork will still be stuck on the screw once you remove it, so all you have to do at this point is push it down and pull the lever up again and it should just fall/drop right out of the screw.If you're still confused, just look up ""rabbit lever wine opener"" or something similar on YouTube and you'll get the idea.It does require a little more effort than an electric wine opener, but you also don't need to worry about charging or loud electric motor sounds, and you can remove it at your own pace (if you're quick, it's a lot faster than using electric wine openers). Personally, I like this way better than using the popular Oster Electric Wine Bottle Opener; I hate that one because I always end up having pieces of the cork drop and it's just loud. With this Rabbit Lever, I can consistently open wines without any pieces of cork falling, which is VERY IMPORTANT.However, if you want zero effort/no strength at all and don't mind going electric, I recommend the Skybar FPSKBW8216 Electric Wine Opener - this one kills the Oster and it's much nicer.Pros:- Fun to use.- Unique. Looks somewhat fancy.- No cork pieces that will end up falling- No need to charge/no annoying motor sounds (the Oster is super loud and annoying!)/can be faster (just push down/pop out/after you're done, releasing the lever just makes the cork drop right out of the screw versus having to wait for the motor screw to release on electric wine openers.- Extra screw includedCons:- Somewhat bulky/case storage- When pulling the lever back up, it does require some strength/gripping/squeezing securely (if you want ZERO effort/strength, then I'd go with the Skybar)I was worried reading some reviews early on how this may be difficult to use, but after receiving it and using it myself on multiple wines, I personally love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PG16BMI5ILD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQI3Q1I#wasThisHelpful","R20PG16BMI5ILD","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to frequently open lots of wine (not that I'm the one drinking all of them) and I've been using the well-known Oster Electric Wine Opener before receiving this one. This SKYBAR kills the Oster in every way! Build quality/looks and functions!I ended up dreading using the cheap Oster one as it was very difficult to keep the cork going down perfectly straight without it jamming awkwardly to the side -- and most often, also have pieces of the cork fall! That's the worst! I absolutely hated that! It was just always hit or miss with the Oster...With this Skybar, it was literally a breath of fresh air! Just on my first try, it was such a pleasure and major difference. It's just always accurate and smooth!First of all, the motor sound is less loud and annoying than the Oster and the speed that it rotates down has a more relaxing, comfortable ideal pacing that it's SO MUCH easier to keep the screw to go straight down -- not to mention the translucent BASE allows you to see the cork ACTUALLY moving up into the screw so effortlessly; I love that! It's so cool and fantastic!The method works the same way as the Oster where you put the screw on the cork and press down on the bottom button until it goes all the way, except it's just REALLY nice you can actually see the cork rise up. Once the cork is removed, you can press the top button for the cork to come out.Pros:- Translucent window allows you to see the cork actually moving up! VERY COOL!- Quieter than the Oster- Nice comfortable rotation speed - (The Oster tries to dig in the screw too fast)- No loose pieces of the cork falling! YAY (I hate the Oster ending up leaving loose pieces because I can't see what's going on, plus it's more difficult to keep it straight due to the way of the Oster's motor's rotation speed)- Sleek stainless steel body and lookAlthough the charging base and design may seem similar to the Oster, the Skybar kills the Oster in every way - It is an easily noticeable premium, upgraded, luxury version.Yes, it is more expensive than the Oster but you DEFINITELY really get what you pay for! Not only the obvious superior build quality with its stainless steel body, but the way it functions is just night and day - no loose pieces of the cork falling and great visual/fun to see the cork actually being removed with its translucent window!I highly recommend this. I've used the Oster one enough times to know right away how much I appreciate this one way more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK5KPX8JMWYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUFSSSU#wasThisHelpful","R1VK5KPX8JMWYA","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:04 MinsOk, I'm really surprised the main selling point for this safe is the fingerprint scanner, yet the instruction manual included in this one has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING written about that feature!!I mean, the manual itself is a generic one that tries to cover different models including the ones with a dial (which this model does not even have). Luckily, I searched the internet and found one explaining for a different safe/model... (I mean if they have it explained for a different biometric model, why didn't they update/include a manual for this safe?)To program your fingerprint(s):------------you need to press the ""P"" (program) buttonand then enter the 5-digit FACTORY code (located on the back of your manual)The sensor should be blinkingMake sure you peel the cover on the scanner and then swipe your finger in a downward direction overWhen you get multiple successful reads (you must do it several times) then the green light will flash three timesTo delete a user fingerprint, press the ""P"" button, enter 5 digit facory code, and then press ""C"" (CLEAR). You can program 2 fingerprints.------------* There is a factory 5-digit code located on the back of the included manual - THIS CODE CANNOT BE CHANGED OR DELETED - what you get is what you get!* You can program/add 2 additional user codes* You get 2 physical keys, which is ONLY for double-security to prevent the safe from opening even if you enter the correct key code; before I received and saw there was a keyhole to this safe, I thought the keys were another way to open the safe/override the keypad, but that's NOT what it does. Therefore, I just leave the key turned to unlock side.* Replacing batteries is really easy - it just slides out located behind the keypad (this can also be a con!). It takes 4 AAA batteries.* The sound of the buttons remind me of a microwave sounds - it can be turned off if you wish (The manual says to press 0, P, and 1 to turn off the sound and 0, P, 2 to turn it on -- after several tries I was able to turn it on/off once, but I can't seem to consistently do that right away; I'm wondering if entering the factory code prior to pressing those buttons are required or not... I wish it can be more consistent or the manual to be more clear about that)* If you enter an incorrect code 3 times in a row then it will enter DELAY mode and you'll be locked out for 2 minutes.Pros- Fingerprint scanner makes accessing/unlocking very fast and convenient (your mileage may vary depending on your fingers/sweat/etc); I thought it would be a gimmicky feature, but I really LOVE having this! It's very high-tech and cool. It totally beats having to turn the dial on my other safe - having the fingerprint scanner makes storing and removing things frequently possible.- Cool blue keypad lights; I feel like a secret agent along with the fingerprint scanner. (Red led to indicate access denial and green for granted)- Sound can be activated/deactivated- This one does come with built-in LED lights inside the door, so it lights up the inside when you open it (you can program the duration to 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or completely off) - both the LED lights on the keypad and inside makes accessing this safe possible even at night/in the dark! There's no way I can open my other safe with the dial unless the room is lit.- 4 AAA batteries easily removable (manual says they're not included, but there were already 4 of them in mine) -- however, this can also be a con!Cons:- Mine came with a huge dent on the back (I actually noticed my other SentrySafe with the dial also had a dent too); I'm surprised something that feels/look this solid can have a large dent like it got crushed by some massive hit. It seems other reviews share the same issue whether from during shipping or from the manufacture.- If someone was around and wanted to mess with you, they could remove the battery compartment and you would be locked out of your own safe!- Of course with anything digital, there is a greater risk if it fails (although I totally love the convenience of keypad/scanner than having to turn the dial clockwise/counter clockwise) I thought the included physical keys were for override, but again, it is just for extra locking.- This safe should be called Medium size, but the company refers it as X-Large. They refer to their actual large size as 2X-Large.I also own and reviewed the SentrySafe SFW205CWB Water-Resistant Combination Safe, 2X-Large; that one is a dial only and weighs a TON! I wouldn't worry about that one being walked away by anyone.This safe being ""X-Large"" size is a bit more manageable and a more ideal size; two adults can definitely pick it up and walk away with it. I suppose a heavy lifter can lift this alone, but it is heavy.I definitely prefer this X-Large size and fingerprint scanner/keypad a lot more than the combination dial; they both have their advantages/disadvantages, but for fast convenience and cool factor, this safe wins.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXJB2LHNBRE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZUBJZI#wasThisHelpful","R2TXJB2LHNBRE7","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update: I just had a long road trip with this and I love it even more seeing how really effective this device is on a long trip/highway. I got Ka alert miles away and I always saw state trooper somewhere. When it was night time, I could barely see other cars on the road and I see Ka goes off for a long time - I later see flashing lights and see a truck get pulled over.I bought this because it seemed to be the best bang for your buck; I didn't want to settle for something cheap like the Cobra or generic - I mean... you get what you pay for.I originally wanted the Escort Passport 9500ix (and may eventually upgrade in the future), which is also highly rated, but I also can't justify paying twice as much for it right now, especially when it comes to detecting the same bands, this radar does it equally well. When the price is right, I will upgrade and well... the price for the RX65 was just right, so I jumped on it. The RX65 and 9500ix have been around for years! It's not like the iPhone where it gets replaced every year, so it's not a bad investment unless all police start using lasers.Beltronics's parent company is actually ESCORT - the smartcord/power plug can actually be interchangeable, which is nice when I plan on upgrading. (unlike the 9500ix, the power plug on the RX65 is located on the right side)If you're new to radar detectors,  there are different frequency bands that police use for their radar known as X, K, Ka, and laser. Many have said to just disable X band because it is no longer being used.If you get hit with a laser, it will be too late to slow down. Sometimes, when the sun is pointed directly at the radar, you may end up with a false laser warning.A lot of super markets automated sensor doors use K band frequency, so you will get LOTS of false alerts when you drive by; trust me, if you're in the city and around stores, you will get lots of K band warnings; you can either disable it completely, or you'll have to press the mute button on the device whenever you hear it. If you know that will be too much of a hassle for you, the extra premium to get a radar detector, such as the ESCORT 9500ix with it's AutoLearn memory capability may be more beneficial to you. The RX does NOT have that ability or GPS. You do not want to disable Ka - that is what you really want to keep on eye on or be listening to.By default when the radar starts up, you'll get like a R2D2 sound of all alert sounds; if you find this annoying, you can disable it which is what I did.Some people who are new to radar detectors have a misconception of thinking these will detect every police out there. This is not a police detector - it's a radar detector; if the police doesn't have their radar turned on, it's not going to let you know anything. Also, just because you have a radar detector doesn't mean you become invincible and start being a speed racer. It's just another device to help you become more cautious of your surroundings and be more alert. Your eyes are always the best look out. One day, I also saw a police, on a bike on the side street, pointing a radar gun at cars pointed at my direction, but my detector didn't tell me anything; I believe he was using laser. There is no guarantee. There are other times where I hear Ka band goes off and I do see a police nearby.I hardwired mine and mounted it right under my rearview mirror for a really clean look - I love it way more now; I'd hate to have an ugly cord dangling and making it obvious when I'm driving.Pros:- Looks nice, clean look (I have the Red display; my car interior gauge/radio is mostly blue, but the blue display costs a lot more!)- Large mute button for easy access- Different alarm/tone for different radar detection (I hear the K band beep so many times, it has annoyed me... it is so refreshing to hear a different chirping alert when Ka gets detected!)- You can switch to dark mode with minimal display- Ability to disable bands- Sensitive/Good range.- Best bang for your buckCons:- No learning feature, so you will have to ignore the false alerts every time you drive the same route or disable completely; going through the menu is a bit cumbersome.- No GPS for speed traps, etc (which is fine, since I use other Apps)- The buttons do feel cheap plastic and the device itself is very light (I guess that's a good thing); it would scratch easily if you don't take good care of it.Like any radar, if it saves you one ticket then it pays for itself.

So Unlike Dr. Dre's flashy ""bling"" looking headphones and overly exaggerated bass/super high treble, we have House of Marley Liberate headphones that is stylish in a completely different nature: ""natural"" (wooden fabric) with a mature calm look that would still be able to grab attention.Overall, the sound is pleasing and pretty balanced, especially impressive considering it's wireless; however, in a confined way... if that makes any sense; the earcups are rather on the smaller side - it's a little claustrophobic feeling for me; I don't think my head is that big and it's pretty tight. Personally, I feel a bit further away from the music, more of a DIRECT studio recording sound - not a concert feeling with major separation that I've been spoiled by my other headphones like the Sennheiser 595/600, but that is to be expected considering the price/style. Just don't expect major separation in the vocals and instrumentals and breathing space. With that being said, you still get the luxury of being wireless and travel friendly collapsible design.Right side of the headphones have the volume up/down and skip track/back and pause/play and power button... I'm sure some will argue it's not hard to memorize the location of the buttons, but honestly, when I'm zoned into a music, it's a bit difficult for me to QUICKLY realize which button does which again... I want to turn the volume, but usually forget if it's the skip track button instead, especially since they're pretty close together to one another; it would have been nicer if the buttons had a different texture feel or have only the volume controls on the left side of the headphones or make it a scroll wheel.The manual states you can seek/rewind music (not skipping track) by holding on to the button, but it did not work for me; I tried it on a iPod Touch and Android phone!Pros:- Bluetooth - no wires! (aux input also available)- Collapsible; excellent for travel- Music Control/Volume buttons on the right side of the headphone- Very mature stylish- Good sound considering it's totally wireless/bluetooth - in a confined way.Cons:- Headphones cannot be adjusted inward/outward for better comfort (fixed)- Seeking the music did not work by holding on the buttno; it only completely skipped/back a track (tried on iPod Touch and Android phone)- Lots of buttons on the right side of the earphones (would have liked the buttons to be more separated/obvious/different texture)- Somewhat small earcups; these won't cover your entire ear/have a major concert feeling.If you're really picky with sound and that's your main priority then these aren't for you; if you need wireless bluetooth, you like the wood/fabric style look, need something for travel, don't need massive earcups to cover your entire ear, then give these a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZIDKKB8LH29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL6P5U2#wasThisHelpful","R2XZIDKKB8LH29","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't really do Yoga, but just having this set makes me want to start doing it. I mean, I can use the towel/mat for other sports and working out as well as it absorbs sweat, doesn't slide around, and prevents odor bacteria growth.This combo set includes the mat towel that measures 27x70"" long and a face/body towel that measures 12x32"".The towel states it's 80% polyester and 20% polyamide.There are anti-skid dots on one side of the mat, so it won't slide around.I like the thought of knowing how this towel has an ""antimicrobial technology"" to prevent the growth of odor causing bacteria.This set of blue colors just really feel like ""workout"" and going to the gym to me.Maybe a small string included to tie it around would have been nice.

"I like that the keyboard has a very slight mushy key press feedback to it; I've used really cheap keyboards before where it's just clicky and well... feels cheap.However, I was a bit disappointed with the slippery plastic feel of the keys; maybe I have high expectations, but I was kind of expecting the keys itself to be a little more higher quality like on the Apple laptop, or at least I wish the keyboard buttons would have been the same aluminum texture/feel as the back of the keyboard.It does not have to be clipped for the keyboard to work. After all, it is a bluetooth keyboard. On the side of the keyboard, there is a micro-USB port for charging, on/off switch, and pairing button. In fact, a bonus for me was how the keyboard even works with Android tablets - the volume, media keys too! I can even put a Nexus 7 2nd generation tablet on the stand in landscape too (of course, it's not made for it, so tilting at different degree of angles will not work)There is one flap, after you remove the sticky tape, where you slide your iPad and it magnetically attaches. The stand hinge allows you to tilt to various angles like a laptop.Pros:- Has a slight mushy key press feedback- Various multi-angle degree- Acts as a cover (of course, it will not protect the back side of your iPad)- Keyboard shortcuts work with Android too/it can also make a Nexus 7 2nd generation sit on the stand (not various angles)Cons:- Keys feel a bit plasticky/slippery for my taste; I wish it had a more solid feel to it/aluminum like the back casing.I really like the innovative design/casing/keyboard combo. I hate having bulky cases/carrying keyboard, but this case solves both problems.Logitech, please make the same design/keyboard for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S too; I would buy it in a heartbeat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2EIUWJ6IIMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP2PNPM#wasThisHelpful","RN2EIUWJ6IIMM","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit disappointed mine arrived with the plastic hook to lock the lever was completely chipped off on one side. Everything else seems to be heavy duty and durable, yet that part being cheap plastic, it should have been metal or something; it wouldn't be so fragile during heavy transportation bumps or whatnot.  Thankfully, regardless having the hook or not, the table is still able to securely lock.There are two levers on each side of the legs, when you pull the lever on one side, the legs can be folded out - you then have to push the lever ALL THE WAY DOWN, it will require some bit of strength and force, flat right underneath the table to lock securely and completely.The table is REALLY tall, which is good or bad depending on what you're expecting; for permanent use, it's nice to be able to put a cabinet or storage box underneath the table.I uploaded a picture of the table with a SAMSUNG UN55H6350 HDTV on it so you get a better idea of the size.Pros:- Heavy duty, nice build- Easy storage- Very tall- Surface feels niceCons:- The plastic hook on one side arrived broken.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIMZE5JT74PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YZX1H6#wasThisHelpful","R1VIMZE5JT74PT","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a perfect time for me to review this because my old wipers totally needed to be replaced (I haven't replaced them for years, but I was finally reaching danger point... I could barely see in the rain/streaking...never clear... it was so dangerous!),  So yeah, I was really excited to try this out...I have never replaced wipers before, so I had to look up many videos on youtube (lol)... but honestly, it was still very confusing because not everyone has the same type of hook, and the explanations were lacking or had horrible camera angles.I'm sure it should only take a few minutes to swap it out, but it took me a little longer. The difficult part for me was trying to figure out how to remove it. Installing it was a lot simpler just by snapping it in and then lock.The driver side should usually be larger than the passenger side; my car for the driver side takes this 26"" and my passenger side takes 19"" blades. I was so happy to be able to get both sizes. If your enter your vehicle on Amazon, it should let you know if it works for your car or not.I wish the instructions had some wording on it for more clear directions - it's just pictures and arrows... it's not so obvious for a beginner. The instruction actually shows for different types of wiper hooks, which I was overwhelmed by before I realized they weren't relevant to me.The part where it says ""Bosch"", you need to pinch, which was a bit difficult for me, and flip open; after you slide it in, you will lock it back.These wipers look a lot more ""tough""/thicker than your average/stock wipers. It may be a minor pet peeve for some people, but when you're inside the car, you will notice the wipers more in your view, since they are thicker.On the driver side, it wipes everything clean. Of course, on the passenger side, since it's shorter, it will leave some areas in the corner, but that's to be expected and it's fine.I will update my review if I encounter any problems. I'm proud of myself for being able to install this on my own and happy with the look and performance of these wipers... I see the forecast is going to rain this week - bring it on!!Pros:- Looks tough/thick wipers (not puny looking like the stock wipers)- Wipes cleanCons:- Instructions could be more detailed with written text - not just ambiguous arrows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYMM28Y194WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ4LS#wasThisHelpful","RZYMM28Y194WH","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sabre is really the only brand to trust when it comes to pepper sprays. Law Enforcement also use it and is a trusted brand.If these go on your skin or clothing indirectly, it will be contaminated and you will feel a burning feeling. (one time, I had one in my pocket and it triggered by accident, so I actually know from experience...). If these go directly into the eyes, I can't imagine how painful it would be. Many people claim being pepper sprayed is far worse than being tazered.I own several pepper sprays from Sabre and the canister for this is on the larger size, which is nice.This is advertised as a Dog Spray, but it can be just as effective on humans.Unlike the ""SABRE RED Stop Strap Pepper Spray"", the flip cover does not ""lock/snap"" - it's a spring-flap cover, so you just slide your thumb so it's ready for immediate use; with the other peppers sprays, one would have to flick to expose the nozzle or whatnot.I'm not sure if it's intended for the clip to be adjusted, but with some force, I was able to slightly adjust the positioning of the clip because the way it came made holding the canister a bit awkward for me.This is great to carry and gives you a peace of mind when going jogging/hiking for some protection.The one I received states it expires 01/2019!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24R2BS2T9Z5YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU6J68Q#wasThisHelpful","R24R2BS2T9Z5YI","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is seriously REALLY loud!! If you don't wake up from this, you must be in a coma...I covered the speakers to test it first and even then it hurt my ears so much... when my hands uncovered it, it was just insane. The piercing noise is really painful... this can be a torture device... I thought releasing the metal contact immediately would stop the alarm, but it did not... I had to press the switch to OFF.You have to unscrew the bottom battery cover to insert a 9v battery.I think this can actually come in handy besides doors... you could maybe carry it with you or keep it in your car  when you need attention, just press against the metal switch (having the switch to on) and you will definitely get people's attention.This is the perfect accessory to have when you go traveling and end up having to stay in somewhat shady motels or even nice looking hotels - definitely gives extra comfort!! I will definitely have this with me.I think it would be great if they add deluxe version with a wireless remote to stop the alarm in cases of false alarms, so you don't have to get out of bed and turn the switch off.Pros:- SUPER loud / piercing painful noise... definitely will drive anyone nuts/scare them.- Prevents door from opening all the way- Gives you extra comfort safety- Low battery indicatorCons:- 9v battery not included","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AHX8NKOWVSPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M30SQGA#wasThisHelpful","R1AHX8NKOWVSPA","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using compression socks and the KT Tape, I can say if you need ankle/leg support, it's a better investment and results having compression socks. For other areas on your body, this may be an alternative to whatever other method you're using or the only option.This version is uncut, so you need to use scissors. I was previously offered the pre-cut version and I find that one more convenient; these things stretch, so it's not necessary to cut it really long. The Uncut version may seem like it gives you more flexibility and freedom, but you need to also factor in the stretch/strength amount.The YouTube tutorial videos the company offers is definitely worth checking out and gives you a better idea of how these tapes are used.Depending on the area, you'll need assistance from another person to attach it on you or require multiple attachment of these; it's nice to have different color so it's easier to distinguish the anchor points.Ultimately, this is something you have to try yourself if it's right for you or not.

"I'm a guy and my friends laughed at me for owning a pepper spray (I've personally bought the 1/2 oz SABRE RED Pepper Spray - Police Strength and the 0.75 oz SABRE Pepper Spray - Advanced 3-In-1 Police Strength) and having it attached to my key chain; they think pepper sprays are only for girls to carry... silly! If they were to have this sprayed in them, they would not be laughing... (not that I did that... that would be improper use 0=) I know they would be crying and vomiting.I don't care if you're Bruce Lee or Hulk or feel invincible... protection is protection. You never know.It's better to be safe than sorry. Fortunately, I never had a situation where I had to use this.However, I can share with you that these things are no joke, and I have a funny story to share with the one I had on my key chain...I would actually carry a bunch of my keys and the Sabre attached in my back pocket; that Sabre requires to twist the trigger towards the open end to expose the spray... well, one day, I seem to have been moving around more than usual and somehow it twist/turned on its own and it sprayed/leaked in my pants!!I didn't realize it until I felt a irritating burn on my butt... and that wasn't the end of it. When I removed my contact lens and put them back in that day, it burned so much... somehow a small amount of it must have still been on my fingers, even when I have washed my hands. What was supposed to be something to protect myself ended up giving me pain and backfiring... friendly fire...Anyway, that was my slight painful experience and that wasn't even directly or even actually being sprayed in the eyes...Speaking of butt....Johnny Knoxville and the bright folks from the show ""JACKASS"" experimented pepper spraying themselves (Sabre brand) and being tazered; not only him, but everyone else who have actually experienced both being pepper sprayed and tazered state how being pepper sprayed is way more painful than anything.There is no twisting/turning with this one; the top cover snaps when it is completely closed; when you feel like you need to use it, you can unsnap it up and lift it up slightly so you can slide your thumb on to the trigger, or just raise the lid cover completely.There are two really tiny small windows on the side where if it shows green then it's ready to fire. If you remove the bottom ball-joint strap out of the spray then the window turns red and it will not fire; I believe this is a safety feature they added in case someone ends up snapping this off your hands/strap, then they won't be able to use it on you.You probably don't want the ball joint too loose that it would easily end up snapping off. I received mine being really tight so it was difficult to remove/put it back in. There is a standard screw showing a minus sign, turning it counterclockwise to loosen, and plus sign to turn clockwise to tighten the ball-joint hole; you need to adjust it to whatever is comfortable - you don't want it too loose or too tight. It would be better to be tighter than loose since if it comes off the ball joint then the spray will become totally useless. I think for easier adjustments, the whole balljoint/screw design could be improved to something else.I like the look of the grip - it looks more ""professional"" and law enforcement-like than just the canister by itself.The flip up lid and triggering system feels like a safety feature they put on triggering a demolition or bomb.Law Enforcement use Sabre Brand. I would not trust generic pepper sprays. This is more expensive than the other sprays Sabre offers. If you don't want that accidental twist happening, a better grip/look, and trigger disabling from being taken away from your wrist/balljoint, then the extra cost might be better for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAA9NRA7KQMYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O3TLTM#wasThisHelpful","RAA9NRA7KQMYL","ABIVKBMSIPEDY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABIVKBMSIPEDY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The printer is a bit on the larger size, considering it does not have a scanner or anything else; however, it's not too heavy to transport.You need to first remove all the orange plastic pieces and tape.The instructions are all mostly pictures, so it may be a bit confusing sometimes. And then the LCD is pretty tiny and you have to wait for it to scroll some instructions/text so that can be a bit annoying.I own several printers, but inserting the ink for this one was a bit different than I'm used to. You insert each ink one at a time and then press OK, and then the machine moves a slot each time for you to be able to insert the ink next to it.There are 4 inks: BLACK, YELLOW, CYAN, MAGENTA (uses PGI-2200)When you first set it up, it takes 7 minutes for ink cleaning and 3 minutes for paper alignment testing.It's easiest to set up the wireless printing using USB cable and connecting it to a computer - unfortunately, you will need to have a printer cable (not included) for this.You have to adjust/extend the cartridge to A4 for putting in a standard paper. When you do this, the trays will stick out of the printer - for some reason, I thought the tray was suppose to go all the way in... Maybe I'm stupid but I'm like what's going on?!?! But then you basically pull out the output tray that ends up covering the top. I think it would have been nicer, considering the size of this things, for the paper trays to be completely flush inside even for those standard paper size.I like how fast it prints - it feels like laser. The printer itself doesn't cost much, but of course the inks are what will add up. Definitely ALWAYS use OEM Canon brand inks - NEVER USE THIRD PARTY (unless you don't care about the printer head breaking in the long run); I've learned my lesson the hard way before and never again do I trust third party inks.

"As a former political appointee SES for the Bush (43) administration and subsequently a contractor in Iraq for 14 months, the author has a unique, bird's eye perspective of everything that went so horribly wrong after we invaded Iraq in 2003.  The current book is his testimony as to just how many more problems we created for the world and just how few problems we solved with our decision to ""engage"" (as Jeb Bush would say!).The author describes the reconstruction project in Iraq as being filled with conflicting priorities, dysfunctional agencies, corruption, laziness, simple-mindedness and a general misunderstanding of what the mission was as well as confusion about sundry aspects of Iraqi culture.  This goes for all parties involved, be they military leaders, military advisors, State department personnel or contractors.  There is plenty of blame to go around in how things turned-out in spite of our magnanimous intentions towards the people of Iraq.Even the most naive amongst us are well aware that war profiteering has been a big business since 9/11.  It has been widely documented how companies such as Halliburton, Blackwater and others have ""gamed the system"" to rake in $$.  Their methods range from price gouging, exaggerating their services and sometimes falsifying reports on the services that they were supposed to deliver.  None of this is new.  What is new, according to Michael O'Brien is that it's even worse than that.  Even when contractors TRY to do their jobs & have a positive impact, they are frequently ignored and shunned by the military types while at the same time they are told to ""keep quiet"" by their parent company.  The author concedes that, in spite of his desire to have a positive impact on the reconstruction of Iraq, in the end he was used as a pawn by his organization to turn a buck.  This is a truly sobering indictment of our efforts which ended up resulting in mass chaos.With a background as an Army officer and a graduate of West Point, O'Brien points of the flaws of Rumsfeld's invasion plan.  Rumsfeld daydreamed of a ""lighter, more mobile"" military force.  As such, we invaded Iraq with too few troops.  Rumsfeld believed that our superior technology could bridge the gap.  He was right about that ~ sort of.  While technology can be used to win battles & wipe out bad guys, technology has very limited capabilities when it comes to occupying territory.  As the author alludes to, this was the Achilles heel of our ambitions:  we simply didn't have the manpower to achieve the objective.The author also discusses how the Bush (43) administration reverse engineered the intelligence community to cherry pick what they wanted to hear about the possible presence of WMDs in Iraq whilst ignoring everything they didn't want to hear.  The politics involved in the planning of the invasion were reprehensible.  The discussion the author presents is compelling in its breadth of just how costly it was to us as a country in Dubya's decision to surround himself with sycophants.On the downside, the author tends to paint with a wide brush which leads to over-generalizations.  On page 42 he writes ""Today's soldiers, most of them good and decent people, are bought and paid for.  The majority of those in the service today - other than true combat forces who really want to serve their country - are there because it's the closest alternative to being unemployed.""  I could not disagree more with this statement.  First off, combat jobs are not the only hazardous occupations in the military.  It takes courage to be a submariner as all of your eggs are in one basket if something goes wrong.  Working on the deck of an aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.Furthermore, this is a slap-in-the-face to people who joined the military since 9/11.  People who joined the Army & Marines, in particular, deserve better than this as it was obvious that someone who joined either of these services had a high probability of being deployed to the Middle East if they signed-up post-9/11.  Beyond that, in this day & age there are no longer ""front lines"" so to speak as there were in WWII.  A cook or a truck mechanic can easily be deployed to a forward operating base (FOB) with not much in the way of protection from the bad guys.The author also misses the mark when it comes to remarks about political leanings.  On page 326 he writes ""Liberals will never like a Republican president, no matter how good a job he does.""  Are there liberals who will never like a Republican president?  Goodness, gracious, yes!  Likewise, there are conservatives who will never like a Democratic president, regardless of how well he or she performs.  This comes out as a wash.The point is this:  I would like to think there are enough free thinking liberals & conservatives to maintain an objectivity that is altogether lacking today inside the beltway.  The whole notion of ""Republicans are always right, Democrats are always wrong"" (or vice versa) is precisely why we're in the political pickle we find ourselves in today.  For myself, I am a liberal and yet my all-time favorite president is Teddy Roosevelt ~ a Republican (gasp!).  I call 'em like I see 'em.  There are other liberals out there like myself, and I'm certain there are conservatives who are like that as well.  While pacificists and Neocons will never find common ground, it doesn't mean that the rest of us can't.Lastly, the author reveals himself to ascribe to the birther conspiracy, which downgrades his credibility.  The Whitehouse released President Obama's birth certificate, they have corroborated his birth in Hawaii with several witnesses AND investigators produced a newspaper from the day he was born which announced Obama's birth.  So, did someone way back in the early 1960s plant a fake story JUST in case Obama might grow up to be President?  Really?  As humans, we often disregard evidence that runs contrary to what we already believe.  Unfortunately, the author has succumbed to this tendency.All of that said, this is a remarkable book written from the perspective of what is ""behind the curtain"" of our decision to invade as well as the subsequent egregious decisions we made (such as Paul Bremer's directive to disband the Iraqi army ~ way to go Paul!).  Sun Tzu warned that nothing drains a state's treasury faster than a siege.  In an unconventional way, our occupation of Iraq has been precisely that:  an unorthodox siege.  In Star Trek terminology we violated the Prime Directive by trying to mold the Iraqi people into our own image.  The results have been nothing short of disastrous.For further reading / viewing on our missteps & adventures in the Middle East I would recommend Rage Company: A Marine's Baptism By Fire,  W.and The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014.

"Cougar locker room fantasy!Cassandra is a beautiful 38 year old fitness instructor who has been hired on as the conditioning coach for the football team of a small college. She inspires the team not only with pep talks, but she has a ""built in advantage"" over other coaches in that the players are all mesmerized by her and they want to ingratiate themselves to her good graces. As coaching jobs go, this makes her job relatively easy!After winning a championship, Cassandra finds herself in the locker room to congratulate the team. While there was nothing insidious about her original intentions, one thing leads to another, and that leads to several other things. After all, a bunch of buffed up naked jocks + a smokin' hot middle aged woman all together in a locker room can be quite an erotic combination!!One of the ""keys"" to erotica is to have a story that is believable & happens naturally rather than a tale that is obviously contrived or far fetched. On this point, the current short story ""nails"" this aspect. It's altogether conceivable that a coach (even a female coach) would be in or near a team's locker room after a big win. One could see how things could quickly get out of hand when the football players notice their gorgeous conditioning coach in their midst. It's also more than plausible that a woman who is pushing 40 would be flattered to garner so much attention from dozens of young studs.As you may have guessed, Cassandra ends up getting ""crazy"" with the team. She also gets a mini-bukkake, which I admit is my #1 turn-on. The author, Tori Westwood, does a great job of taking the reader ""inside the locker room"" where both a Cougar as well as the football players engage in taking more than a few bites of ""forbidden fruit."" My one criticism is that the details of the bukkake could have been a little more specific. Oh, well.If multiple man / 1 woman fantasies are your gig, then this short story is a must to add to your collection! It's always more arousing when erotica is written by women, and we get a bird's eye view of an erotic encounter fom a woman's point-of-view.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JAWGYC9JBEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RIIWRI#wasThisHelpful","R7JAWGYC9JBEW","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ana is a beautiful young Iraqi born American who has had a rough life.  Born in Iraq, her father was unjustly executed by the regime of Saddam Hussein.  After she & her mother fled to the United States, Ana wanted to be a force for good and honor her late father.  As a result, she ended up joining the Marines and ascended to becoming a Marine scout sniper.  In a twist-of-fate, she found herself back in her homeland, this time as an invader.Inadvertently, her actions lead to the death of an Iraqi boy.  It is a PR disaster for the Marine corps and she is court martialed for committing a war crime & dereliction of duty.  She is found guilty, sentenced to 5yrs in a military prison and dishonorably discharged from the Marines.  After getting out, she finds few options for work that match her skill set.  About the only occupation that ""fits"" is becoming a  mercenary working for a Mexican drug cartel.Such is the backdrop of Ana's story.  It is both compelling and heart wrenching as she finds herself wrestling with guilt & the ghost of the boy haunts her constantly.  While this is a story of fiction, it is nonetheless a metaphor of how the actions of the United States warped the Middle East into an unrecognizable shape.  NOT ONLY did our good intentions backfire, but they backfired in the worst possible way.  The agony & anguish caused ever since the opening salvo of Rumsfeld's ""shock & awe"" have been immeasurable for the Iraqi people.  {I always cringe whenever I hear Jeb Bush try to defend his brother as both Jeb & Dubya are totally oblivious to this point}If you're looking for an unconventional ghost story, this just may fill the bill.  It is not the type of ghost story that you tell around a campfire:  it's a totally different animal.  It is, rather, a story about guilt & remorse and how we as a country cannot undo what we have done.  Somehow, good intentions, $$ and resources were not nearly enough for us to save the people of Iraq.  Ana is but a pawn in the bigger picture, but her story is emblematic of what a morass that post-invasion Iraq has become.  It is also symbolic of the guilt that lives with us as a nation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17O1PVZ2VC2LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DUBDT4#wasThisHelpful","R17O1PVZ2VC2LJ","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is an exciting time to be alive.  Just in the past 15 years, exoplanets have been discovered to exist.  While it was always assumed they were out there in other star systems, it is only recently that their existence was confirmed.  At first, astronomers could only detect super huge planet (like Jupiter or several times the size of Jupiter).  In the last decade or so, refined techniques have allowed astronomers to locate much smaller / rocky planets.  In short, planets that are Earth-like.  Recently, they found one that most closely resembles Earth of all the planets found thus far:  a mere 1,400 light years away from us.  Future generations will look back on us in a similar way in which we look in retrospect on Galileo's exuberance at discovering the moons of Jupiter.The present novel entertains the idea of how exploring an Earth-like exoplanet might look.  The author is creative in his vision of the future, and one could even say that his inferences are plausible.  In the story, a group of astronauts are sent to study an exoplanet that has 2 dominant species:  the Hyanka and the Threck.  Both species are intellient:  they use verbal language, use tools and have a societal structure.  Neither, however, is technologically advanced.  Instead of making contact with the species, the explorers study the planet and all of its species from orbit.The main character is a beautiful young (well, so long as you don't count her transit time in suspended animation!) woman named Minerva (Minnie for short).  She has an inquisitive mind but she has some personality idiosyncrasies which other crew members find perterbing.  She is also most likely the smartest in the group.  Her name is fitting as Minerva is the Latin counterpart to the Greek goddess of wisdom (Athena).As one might get, things go kahooey for our astronaut friends & they need to jettison themselves to the surface of the planet in escape pods to get away from their doomed space station (hence the title of the book).  While the pods are supposed to all land at a predetermined rally point, the technology does not work as planned.  The pods end up scattered, and one of them ends up on an entirely different continent altogether.  Uh oh!As such, the astronauts find themselves in the cosmic sense like zoologists who are trapped on a massive wild game preserve.  Suddenly, their study of the planet takes a back seat to basic survival & trying to regroup with their friends.  Along the way they have to cope with alien religions, alien culture, alien caste systems, alien racism and general alien nuances in 1st contact proceedings.One of the most fascinating parts of the story is how the iPhone finds its next incarnation.  The astronauts have an artificial eye (which they call their 'fone') which they use to look up data and observe their surroundings.  They can zoom-in like a camera lens and they can view their surroundings using thermal & infra-red features.  They can also use their fone to ""text"" another astronaut, sort of like an artifical form of telepathy.  Lastly, the fone is also used to record events and it monitors the health status of its owner.For people who are interested in the future of space travel, this book is a must see.  Traveling to an exoplanet will not happen in our lifetimes, but this book could be a glimpse of the far future, just as Jules Verne's books were a glimpse into the 20th century.  People who enjoy this book may also wish to peruse Mariner Valley.  MV envisions the colonization of a planet far closer to home:  Mars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RCWJFLGNAHR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940757231#wasThisHelpful","R3RCWJFLGNAHR9","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a general rule, the reality show genre is not my gig.  This Blu Ray  disc would easily qualify as an exception to that rule.  It is about 2 brothers who set off to circumnavigate China on motorcycles.  It isn't any kind of a race, nor are there any contrived tasks for them to perform.  Rather, it is simply about 2 brothers who embark on a 65 day odyssey to explore regions of China that few people from the west have ever seen.  The journey includes drive-bys of China's borders with North Korea, Pakistan & Nepal.For myself, I have been to Shanghai, which is both the starting point & the ending point of their journey.  Westerners who go to China typically hit the hot spots such as the Forbidden City, Tibet and the Great Wall.  While the latter 2 are explored by the brothers, they also travel to far more remote places in the country.  As it turns out, China has an amazingly diverse topography that most people (including myself) are not aware of.  They go from parts of the Gobi desert to high altitude mountainous regions to forested parts & scenic riverways.  All along the journey we experience the pitfalls such as culture shock / red tape, motorcycle wipeouts, vehicle breakdowns and foul weather.For anyone who has a passing interest in China as a country or in the myriad locations therein, this disc is highly recommended.  People who enjoy TOUGH RIDES may also be inclined to peruse Sihpromatum: I Grew My Boobs in China (Volume 1) and Why China Will Never Rule the World: Travels in the Two Chinas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBDTXSYRRJPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH0513Q#wasThisHelpful","R2OBDTXSYRRJPX","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Welcome to the 1950s:  the utopia of the Republican party.  It was back when ""standard"" social mores were accepted, before the mass marketing of porn, and back when homosexuality was treated with electro-shock therapy.  Ah, yes, those were the days.  In the 1960s, the genie got out of the bottle in the form of the sexual revolution.  Ever since then, Conservatives have tried desperately to put the genie back in the bottle ~ to no avail.When I 1st hear about this series, I assumed it would be a biographical docudrama of Alfred Kinsey.  Kinsey's pioneering research on sex related topics occured during the same time period;  he founded the Kinsey Institute @ the university of Indiana.  Instead. the main character is a fellow named Bill Masters (Mike Sheen) who seems to be based on Kinsey to some degree.People who assume this series is thrown together as an excuse for lots of nudity are sure to be surprised by the depth of issues that the show delves into, such as cancer, women's health issues, the demonization of homosexuality, problems with efforts to conceive a child and the tragedy of infant mortality.  To be sure, there is a good amount of naked bodies (THANK YOU Lizzy Caplan!) but there are also entire episodes w/out any nudity whatsoever.  On the whole, the SPARTACUS series actually had a lot more scintillating scenes than MASTERS OF SEX.The acting is impeccable.  Mike Sheen delivers a fine performance as a ""mad scientist"" type of OB/GYN who is both eccentric & stoic.  Bill Masters has a gorgeous wife, and yet he has little else but apathy for her physically.  He is obsessed with studying sex, and yet he is disinterested in having intercourse with his beautiful bride.  That's odd.  Lizzy Caplan is wonderful as his trusted assistant, Virginia.  Lizzy has an all-American girl-next-door beauty & she's built like a cheerleader, which makes her PERFECT for this part!If you are looking for a series that is daring and has both beauty & brains, then this is a series that is worth looking into!  If you want to see the 1950s as depicted in LEAVE IT TO BEAVER then it's best to leave this series alone as you're not gonna like what you see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5D62YCQMKAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI4EGQA#wasThisHelpful","R1B5D62YCQMKAA","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Napoleon  once said ""Amateurs talk strategy.  Professionals talk logistics.""  Alexander of Macedon once said that if he ever lost a battle, the 1st people he would execute would be his logisticians.  Typically, logistics officers are not household names as they're not deemed as ""sexy"" as combat officers on the front lines.  Nevertheless, to win wars, the loggies (as they're called) always play a very important role.The current book is the story of a supply officer named Howard Peckham, who was a 2 star general during World War II.  As the biggest conflict the world has ever seen (by far & away!), the logistics of moving armies and ships around was staggering.  Ultimately, superior logistics was one of the main factors which secured a victory for the allies in the war over the empires of Germany & Japan.This is the biography of the general who was tasked with the logistics of delivering fuel & lubricants to front line combat divisions during the war.  It is a remarkable ""behind the scenes"" view of the moving parts which contributed to allied forces landing victories on the battlefield and at sea.  By definition, loggies are an under appreciated lot;  anyone who peruses general Peckham's story is sure to have their opinion of logistics officers upgraded.The book is written by general Peckham's daughter, Jean.  In her position as the daughter of a military VIP, Jean describes how her family rubbed shoulders with such notable personages as George Patton, Omar Bradley, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Leslie Groves and Secretary of War Henry Stimson (among others).  One gets a fascinating & intimate view of the lives of famous flag officers & their families during the crisis of an entire world at war.The reader also gets a glimpse of postwar Europe from ground level as Jean traveled with her father in the latter's efforts at reconstruction & stabilization of western Europe after the defeat of the Nazis.  One of the most notable contributions of her father was the organization and establishment of 10 cemeteries across Europe which would serve as the final resting place of some 60,000 fallen soldiers, Marines & sailors.  The recovery of American war dead and many times their disinterment from local cemeteries and reinterment in military cemeteries was an arduous task taken up by the capable hands of general Peckham.This book is highly recommended for people who have an interest in WWII, especially people who are in the field of military logistics.  Furthermore, people with a basic curiosity in the history of the United States will benefit from general Peckham's story as well.  Loggies of the world are bound to find a great many things to like in his tale!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXNAE0JUUMXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966585550#wasThisHelpful","R3MXNAE0JUUMXN","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of SHOWTIME's The Tudors will be encouraged to pick up this series as quickly as possible as it is a prequel of sorts to it.  White Queen goes back a generation to the War of the Roses and tells the tale of the rise of Henry VII (although he's not the main character in this story).  It details just how complicated and convoluted British history is with all of the twists & turns, shifting alliances and betrayals.The ensemble cast is impeccable with Max Irons as a jolly fellow who does his best to be a good & just king (Edward IV) who marries a commoner.  Rebecca Ferguson is stunning as Elizabeth, the commoner who becomes queen of England.  Tudors alumni James Frain once more dons his medieval garb and portrays Warrick, the sinister brother of Edward.Like The Tudors, this series has a genuine didactic feature;  I learned a lot from both series about an epoch in British history that I knew precious little about.  Both series are uncensored & uninhibited and do a fabulous job of taking the viewer back to the Middle Ages.  For lovers of history (like myself) this is a can't miss.

"In his 1st leading role since stepping down as the governator, this movie was nevertheless released with little fanfare and did not do much @ the box office.  As such, I really was not expecting much, but figured it was a great price for an action flick.  Truth be told, I was surprised by how entertaining I found this film to be.Arnie plays Ray Owens, a cop who saw a lot of ""action"" when he served on a narcotics task force for the LAPD.  After a violent career, Ray decided he wanted to settle down and finish out his law enforcement days as the sheriff of a remote town in Arizona, right next to the Mexican border.  About his biggest police duty is to write out a parking ticket in this small town.His plan for an easy twilight of his working days is working great until the leader of a Mexican drug cartel (played by Eduardo Noriega) gets away from the FBI.  The cartel leader is similar to the real-life El Chapo who escaped from a Mexican prison by riding a motorcyle through a custom built tunnel underneath his prison.  Instead of a motorcycle, this guy drives a souped-up Corvette to get away.  As he is a race car driver as well as a kingpin, the ""fun begins"" when he gets behind the wheel.  He chooses to cross the border in Ray's small town, and the cavalry is too far away to help poor Ray & his deputies deal with thugs hired by the cartel.Such is the outline of the plot.  It's the first time I have seen Forrest Whitaker in awhile and was good to see him again.  Jamie Alexander portrays the loveliest deputy I've seen in quite some time!  The Arnie of today is not the intimidating presence of Arnie of the 80s, nor does he claim to be.  In fact, Arnie wears a long sleeve shirt throughout the entire film and does not take off his shirt a single time.  Hence, people who are wondering how buffed up he  is these days are apt to be disappointed.  While Arnie in his prime would have made mincemeat of the villain in this film, the thug is more than a challenge for his persona of the aging Sheriff.All in all, a fun movie.  Not a ""can't miss"" but it's way better than I thought it would be and well worth the price of admission.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273JYCMJMQ6ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLF9FOK#wasThisHelpful","R273JYCMJMQ6ZZ","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With his friend Scarlett at his side, Pax is dying of a rare disease.  He is in his final days and there seems to be no hope for recovery when these mysterious beings from another dimension (known as the 'astral plane') take pity on him and decide to save him.  Scarlett interferes with their efforts and finds herself roped-into the same astral powers that are granted to Pax.  From there, the law of unintended consequences kicks in and seemingly everything goes awry.Scarlett & Pax can sense these worm like entities of negative energy which are cloaked to ""normal"" folk.  They then begin dueling with the negative energy creatures, with varied results.  As such, this story is something akin to a science fiction version of the invisible war between the Seraphim & Cherubim vs. Satan's demons which the Catholics believe is going on all around us.  To complicate matters, there are subplots galore about the true intentions of the astral beings.This is a very strange story.  That does not mean it is bad, but it for sure is quite far fetched.  People who are fans of unconventional sci-fi may take an interest in this story.

"This is certainly the best Disney movie of the past 10yrs & is one of the best Disney movies of all time.  It puts an unexpected twist on a tale that we were all told as children about the wicked Maleficent who shows up uninvited and places a curse on the innocent royal baby, Aurora.  We all know the story:  only love's true kiss will be able to awaken the young lady.  Is such a thing even possible anymore?

"Erwin Schroedinger was one of the most landmark physicists of the 20th century.  If you have ever used a microwave oven, GPS, a CD / DVD player, computer or cell phone, then you can thank Schroedinger, Heisenberg, von Neumann, Turing and so many others.  That these are not household names is a sad reflection on the state of our educational system (thank you anti-science Right Wingers!).The current book offers two essays written by Schroedinger.  The 1st is on the enormous debt that modern day scientists owe to the ancient Greeks.  Way back then, philosophers and physicists were one-in-the-same.  Naturally, Schroedinger pays homage to one of the 1st atomists, Democritus.  In fact, it was Democritus who coined the term atom (literally, the Greek word means ""unsplittable"").  Coincidentally, in a more recent book, Leon Lederman sings the praises of Democritus in The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question? and shows the nexus between his system of thought and that of experimental physicists in the present age.  While it is something of an encomium on the Greeks, Schroedinger also discusses possible disadvantages of being indoctrinated into the scientific paradigm as devised by the pre-Socratics.In the second essay, Schroedinger lists his thoughts on the haunting fear of a deterministic universe that so many philosophers of science have feared for the past few centuries.  Is free will just an illusion?  Or do we have control over our own fates?  Do independent spheres of science have any intrinsic value if they are not used towards a more comprehensive view of nature?  This is the introspective study that the great scientist engages in.This book is a must-have for all fans of the Austrian physicist.  For those who are curious about his life & times I would recommend the biography Schrödinger: Life and Thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLHY1Y7YSF6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521575508#wasThisHelpful","RSLHY1Y7YSF6J","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anne Frank was a precocious teenager who was going through puberty.  Her body was changing and she had her 1st boyfriend.  She dreamed of becoming a journalist one day.  She was remarkably well read for her age.  She was just like any other teenage girl, with one tragic exception:  as a Jewish girl during World War II, she had to live in hiding (in what she called the ""Secret Annexe"") from the Nazis.Along with her family and friends, Anne dealt with the threat of being discovered as well as food shortages and the general boredom which coincides with being cooped up for years.  Indirectly, while the Nazis cut her life short (eventually, the Secret Annexe was found out), they could not stop her from being a journalist.  She documented WWII from ground level in her place of hiding.  Her diary lists many major events during the war such as the fall of Mussolini, D-Day and much more.In the midst of the historical events is a young lady with an inquisitive mind.  She wrote ""It's an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary,  not only because I have never done so before, but because it seems to me that neither I - nor for that matter anyone else - will be interested in the unbosomings of a thirteen year old schoolgirl.""  (Page 2)  She could not have been more wrong.  Little did she know that her diary would become one of the most important books ever written.Anne's story is tragic in 2 aspects.  First is the obvious:  this book is the memoir of a girl who didn't make it to the end of the war.  Secondly, she & her family came SO close to being able to return to normalcy.  D-Day raised the hopes of the clan, but the Franks (with the exception of her father, Otto) were among the last Jews to die in concentration camp.If there are any bigots out there who read this book, if Anne's story does not reverse their bigotry then nothing will.  The reason we have the DELTA FORCE, Navy SEALs and the rest is to ensure that there will never again be any people who suffer from persecution.  The motto of the Green Berets is ""To free the oppressed.""Obviously, it is an unattainable goal, but it is a noble one.  Sadly, as I write this review there are Anne Franks living in fear across the Middle East in ISIS controlled territories.  100 years from now there will be Anne Franks living in other crises in different parts of the globe.  Best we can do is not to forget Anne, and not forget them.

She begins to wonder about this boyfriend who had up to that point been the perfect match for her.Surprisingly, over time, she finds herself becoming aroused by the idea of being a bukkake girl.  Just as people don't go to see concert pianists play ""Chopsticks,"" so too do people not attend bukkakes for plain Janes.  Shooters are only interested in bukkakes that feature pretty girls.  The fact that she would have that kind of power over a room full of men is something that she finds intoxicating.The problem, of course, is that she has a high profile and cannot afford  a tabloid scandal.  It will have to be, so to speak, a ""confidential bukkake.""  But how does she go about that?The erotic thing about this story is that it's a fully developed character who finds herself entranced by the notion of doing  a bukkake girl.  Aurora is NOT doing it for $$.  In fact, her net worth is more than all of the shooters combined!  Rather, she is doing it for HER own sake.  It will be HER confidential bukkake.While short stories such as Bukkake Girl, Cover Me: A Blonde Bukkake Fantasy and COLLEGE DORM BUKKAKE: Piper Gets Painted are all well & good, they are like fast food.  By contrast, the present fantasy is like a full course meal at a 5 star restaurant.  We get to actually KNOW the bukkake girl as opposed to her being a cut-out character.On top of that, Cara Addison does the best job of describing what a real bukkake would be like.  Bukkakes are erotica's counterpart to sharks engaged in a feeding-frenzy, and Cara is able to capture that aspect wonderfully.This is a ground-breaking book and is highly recommended for anyone who is intrigued by the genres of extreme erotica and / or bukkakes.  The rhythm of the book actually mimics a bukkake with its slow crescendo to sexual tension and ultimate release.  Even more than being about experiencing a bukkake, this book is all about relishing life, being alive.....and walking on the wild side!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZLA62VR0DFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MQURGI#wasThisHelpful","RRZLA62VR0DFV","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Elliot Burns was a soldier who fought in World War I.  After his return from the Great War he suffered from shell shock (what is commonly referred to these days as PTSD).  He was restless and spent some time aimlessly wandering about the country.  To his misfortune, one of the places he visited was Atlanta, GA.While in Georgia he was roped into a hare brained robbery which netted < $6.  He, the ringleader and another accomplice were quickly apprehended.  In spite of his military service + the fact that he had no prior criminal history, Burns was sentenced to 6-10 yrs on the infamous Georgia chain gang.Burns eventually escaped to Chicago where he married and became a successful businessman.  His fortunes turned when his spiteful, jealous & vindictive wife reported his whereabouts to the Georgia department of corrections.  Illinois was reluctant to extradite him as he was a model citizen in Chicago.  Ultimately, a deal was reached:  he would serve 90 days on the chain gang & then be set free.Georgia was embarrassed that a Yankee had escaped its penal system, so they pulled a classic bait & switch.  The feigned ignorance to the agreed upon 90 days chain gang duty.  In his attempts to have his parole granted, Burns ran into delay after delay.  He resolved to escape from the chain gang again ~ and he succeeded.None of the above is ""spoiler material"" as it's all spelled-out in the foreward to the book.  The ""meat"" of the story is the horrific details that he discloses about the medieval corporal punishment inflicted on the malefactors of the chain gang.  From the start, Burns never got a fair shake as he was an outsider to the state of Georgia as well as a Yankee.  The present book was written after his second escape while he was still on-the-run.As such, the most remarkable part of his tale, the denouement, is omitted from the pages of this book.  Eventually he was discovered once again while in hiding in New Jersey.  Once more, Georgia requested extradition.  This time, something unprecedented happened: the state of New Jersey declined Georgia's request and set Burns free.  Burns still wanted to square matters with Georgia and finally had his sentence commuted to time already served in 1945.  This allowed him to roam freely throughout the country without fear of being extradited back to GA.  Again, none of the above is in the storyline of the book as it happened > the novel was written.In our ""enlightened"" period, we face two ends of the spectrum to be avoided when it comes to incarceration.  The first is making prisons a ""Club Med"" experience, and the second is to not succumbing to crafting prisons / penal codes that are designed to wreck a man or woman's soul.  Also, unusually lengthy sentences should be avoided for minor transgressions.  As Marcus Tullius Cicero said, ""The punishment should fit the crime.""Here is a story of the need for justice being usurped by a motive for vengeance by the Georgia corrections agency.  It is a ""red flag"" case of what should be avoided.  Before reading this book, I was unaware that Georgia didn't even HAVE a regular prison until 1938 (its last men's prison having closed in 1874).  In the interim, the chain gang was the sole punitive option used to mete out justice.  In fact, this very book may well have had a hand in the state of Georgia reforming its justice system and building the new prison!This is an enjoyable read, a quick read and it has a very quick pace.  The reader is able to ""dive right into"" the turmoil that the veteran soldier found himself in after making a single ill advised decision.  Nietzsche once wrote:  ""Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.""  Here is the epitome of what can happen when there is overreach on the side of the criminal justice system and the authority figures who prefer sadism to just sentences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WWRMSLFT6YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0820319430#wasThisHelpful","R35WWRMSLFT6YC","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"e most people, I am aware of the Jewish insurrection which transpired in the first century CE.  It ended with the Romans, under the emperor Vespasian, put Jerusalem under siege.  The city burned and ultimately many Jews who survived the siege ended up trying to hold out @ Masada (albeit unsuccessfully).  While these episodes are familiar with most people who are acquainted with Roman and / or Jewish history, the present book is a ""deep dive"" into these events.  The retaliation of the Romans is told in an exquisite 1st person detail.  As such, the events are brought to life once more after lying dormant on the pages of history books for the past 2,000 yrs.The central figure in the book is a Jewish priest / Rabbi by the name of Jacob.  Jacob holds a seething hatred for the Romans, but finds himself powerless to resist them.  He miraculously survives the destruction of Jerusalem and ends up wandering around the Roman controlled colonies, all the while having strange visions of a Messiah.  His life is a Shakespearian tragedy squared with the continual losses he must deal with.Along the way, Jacob interacts with historical figures such as the Jewish historian Josephus, the emperor Titus and Tiberius Julius Alexander.  Jacob finds himself endlessly searching for meaning in a world that has fallen apart.  From his visions, he begins to wonder if the time might be right for a new religion to emerge, one that will ultimately undercut the hegemony of the Roman empire.Such is the framework of the current story.  As a disclaimer, it should be noted that this book is not geared towards  ardent Christians who wish to augment or increase their faith.  Rather, the target audience would be people like myself who have an intellectual curiosity about comparative religion and / or the Roman empire.  For people who are believers, this is the type of book that will showcase how your religious / historical sausage is made.LOGOS does for the origin of Christianity what The Prophet's Scribe does for the birth of Islam.  Both books are remarkable in their approach to their respective religions, and both take the readers back to ground-zero of the rise of Christianity & Islam.  Man, the storytelling animal, has for so long aggrandized the lives of what Hegel would call  ""World historic individuals.""  Such is the making of myth.  Such is the birth of religions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZWP4TENYZ8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938846265#wasThisHelpful","R3OZWP4TENYZ8B","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Books such as No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden by Owen, Mark, Maurer, Kevin (2012) Hardcover, American Sniper [Movie Tie-in Edition]: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History, SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper and Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 by Luttrell, Marcus (2007) Hardcover all detail the personal  experiences, adventures & missions of the individual Navy SEALs who authored them.  The present work is a bit different.  Instead of focusing on an individual SEAL or SEAL Team, it offers 1st hand accounts of Navy Surface Warfare groups of the past 75 or so years.The story begins with the Underwater Demolition Teams & Frogmen of World War II.  The book does a ""deep dive"" (pun intended!) into their gallant contributions to the ability of Marines & soldiers to establish beach-heads @ Normandy and islands during the Pacific island hopping campaign.  They would clear out booby-traps and detonate underwater mines (among other missions).In the early 1960s, under the administration of John F. Kennedy,  the UDT / Frogmen teams made the transition to SEALs who could also engage in combat missions that were inland as well as underwater sorties.  I was surprised that then Chief of Naval Operations, the legendary WWII admiral Arleigh Burke, had a HUGE hand in championing the cause of Naval Special Operations.  Burke had always been known as a ""Destroyer man"" (which is why he has an entire Destroyer class named after him!) so this was unexpected.  Interesting.The book proceeds to cover SEAL missions through Vietnam & up to their present day anti-terrorism missions.  The ""untold stories"" include missions that went off flawlessly as well as other missions that didn't go so well at all.  It does have a refreshing honesty about the latter category.A common thread between this book and other Special Forces books is simply this:  all too often the greatest enemy of a SEAL / Green Beret / Delta Force Commando or Marine Recon type is not his adversary on the battlefield.  Rather, the biggest threat he faces comes from either faulty military intelligence or members of the Pentagon Brass who have no clue what they're doing.  Sadly, those 2 factors can get an elite operative killed faster than anything else!This is a thrilling read for people who have either a fascination for Special Forces (like me) or a general interest in the SF community.  It is filled with exciting stories as well as sobering tales of what happens when things don't go like clockwork on an SF mission.  All in all, a very worthwhile endeavor into the secret lives of perhaps the most admired and respected fighting force on planet Earth:  the United States Navy SEALs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCXCL25WNUHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336606#wasThisHelpful","R3BCXCL25WNUHC","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bucky is an I.T. specialist from New York who finds himself moving up the corporate ladder.  From the Big Apple, he is to relocate to London with a hefty promotion.  The world is his oyster and his life is coming into focus.....or so he thinks.  Unfortunately, things don't always work out the way we plan them to.  As Heisenberg would say, there's always a certain amount of uncertainty in play.Bucky accidentally finds himself in the milieu of prostitution as he finds himself an I.T. worker for a cathouse.  He does a great job and even comes up with a SMARTPHONE app which allows the patrons to order everything on the salacious menu with a push of a button.  Still, poor Bucky does not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation he's gotten himself into.Everyone is aware of prostitutes who have fallen on hard times;  the streetwalkers who are addicted to drugs and who are beaten by their pimps.  There are also those who are sold into sex trafficking, as depicted in the ""TAKEN"" movie series.On the other hand, there are women who work for High Society escort firms of their own volition.  Frequently, they have college degrees ~ sometimes advanced degrees.  At the high end, there are women who only have 1-2 clients who are millionaires or billionaires.  These women have birthday wishlists in which they ask for a Ferrari, a $500,000 diamond necklace and a weekend @ the Hamptons.  Oh, and by the way ~ they're apt to get all 3 from their Sugar Daddy clientele.Such is the gap of the ambiguous profession of prostitution.  Bucky believes that he is involved in the more ""legitimate"" latter type.  Little does he know that there is a nexus between the two ends of the courtesan spectrum that he's unaware of.The downside of being in a capitalistic society is that we tend to place too much focus on a person's net worth & believe there is a nexus between it & the individual's worth as a person.  Like the rest of us, Bucky finds himself guilty of this.  There are subtle allusions in the story to Hinduism, which is a religion that emphasizes how one should ""play one's role"" in life and not move up or down the socio-economic ladder.  This way, of course, the poor will always be under-the-thumb of the rich.Americans & the British, of course, frequently practice the teachings of Hinduism without practicing the religion itself.  In the story, Bucky finds that there are a great many rich people who are like Mitt Romney:  arrogant, elitist and born without an operational soul.  On the other hand, he finds a great many ""everyday"" people who are erudite, profound and capable of unbounded kindess.Such is the backdrop of this novel.  At times it is humorous and other times it is somber.  Occasionally it is erotic and it is always intriguing.  If you're unsure whether a book about an I.T. professional can be fun  & engaging, give this one a try.  Bucky will be pleased if you do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DH8LV05ODAEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990962105#wasThisHelpful","R3DH8LV05ODAEH","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the summer of 1947, SOMETHING happened @ Roswell, New Mexico.  On that, all parties agree.  What the ""something"" was is a matter for debate to this day.  The official government story is that a weather balloon crash landed.  Government cospiracy theorists, however, are convinced that an alien spacecraft crash landed.  Subsequently, so the story goes, the alien lifeforms and spacecraft was taken to the infamous AREA 51.Like [[ASIN:ASIN INDEPENDENCE DAY]], the current novel delves into the mythology surrounding Roswell & AREA 51.  Come to find out, a super secret sector of the government has, in fact, taken aliens and alien hardware to the remote outpost in the Mojave desert.  This sector is known as the SAINT MARY'S PROJECT.  For the past 6 decades they have done genetic experiments, splicing together human & alien DNA and they have also attempted to reverse-engineer the alien technology.  Of course, the military has also been searching for vulnerabilities in the alien technology that could be exploited should an interstellar conflict ensue.Such is the backdrop of the storyline.  William is a medically retired F.B.I. agent turned Private Detective.  He begins getting anonymous clues as to the truth behind the super secret SAINT MARY'S PROJECT.  Unsure of what to do, he summons the assistance his former partner, Arthur, who is still with the F.B.I.  Arthur has access to files that are closed-off to the general public.  As a sidenote, Arthur also possesses a sense of humor unbecoming a J. Edgar Hoover G-Man.The end result is a science fiction book that reads like a spy novel.  There are some wild twists & turns as William & Arthur try to ""drill down"" past the veneer of government cover stories & get to the truth.In governmentese, the protection of classified material is known as ""containment.""  That is to say, only those with the proper security clearance AND the need-to-know are allowed access to the information.  This tale revolves around the most difficult information to conceal:  a multi-generational conspiracy that holds the most incredible secret ever found in the 4.6 billion history of planet Earth.  If that sort of thing grabs your attention, then this book is highly recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZEOO8HNC0L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990737101#wasThisHelpful","R1SZEOO8HNC0L8","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the not so distant future, there is a 2nd civil war in the United States.  Instead of being a war between the states, this one is between the genders:  it's man vs. woman.  The outcome of the conflict is a utopia for militant feminists: a world where the women control the urban sectors while the men are banished to the countryside (known as the Outlands).Women compensate for not being able to match men's physical strength by invoking technology to their advantage;  they have it & the men who are left do not.  The females have mechanized suits that women can wear to enhance their strength & agility and the women who become members of the so-called mech units are revered by all.The main character in the story, Annabelle, is a 16 year old girl who is coerced to being a member of the mechs against her will.  As such, she ends up in something akin to a Roman gladiatorial school (what the Romans called a Ludis).  The school is a science fiction version of a Ludis where young Annabelle is trained in martial arts and other forms of hand-to-hand combat.Where Annabelle differs from the other young girls is her lack of animosity for men.  She has been exposed to precious few men in her life and she has a curiosity for them that is not shared by the other mech trainees.  She finds it a bit repugnant that the world she lives in is trying to eradicate men altogether.  In fact, women are artificially inseminated and there is genetic manipulation that arranges the X/Y chromosomes in such a way as to only have female babies.  Meanwhile, men who are captured by the female provinces are used as cannon fodder for training mechs.  The extinction of male homo sapiens is on the horizon.This is a tale with a fresh new vision of a future that is both creative and disturbing.  People who enjoy this book may also wish to read Gladiatrix, which is about female Roman gladiators training in their Ludis as well as ""on-the-job-training"" in the arena.  There are some similarities in the stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WK7M5HG5U5JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988996804#wasThisHelpful","R1WK7M5HG5U5JY","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The present book is the sequel to Sihpromatum: I Grew My Boobs in China (Volume 1) which detailed the journey of a Canadian family to Hong Kong, into China and then into Mongolia.  Volume 2 picks up with the family in Russia and follows them back into western China, Tibet and finally Nepal.  While it is helpful to have read Volume 1, it is not absolutely necessary as Volume 2 could be read as a stand-alone book.Our travelers consist of the mother, her son Ammon and her two teenage daughters, Breanne and Savannah (the author of the work).  Both volumes share the anguish of being so very far away from Vancouver and at the same time the truly wonderful opportunity the family has to travel the world.  In the present book the family visits somber Russian WWII memorials, long forgotten Chinese cities that were wiped out by Kublai Khan, the sacred Buddhist oasis of Tibet and they finish up by viewing a sunrise over Mount Everest.The above is an outline of the book, but the best thing about the book is the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland [illustrated] feel to the book as a naive young Canadian lass discovers that the world is a much bigger place and is a great deal more grandiose than she ever imagined.Some reviewers have complained that too much time is spent in the book focusing on the travails that hikers face.  For myself, these topics ""bring home"" the many sacrifices the family has made to embark on this epic journey.  As Clint Eastwood would say, Savannah tells it like it is:  the good, the bad & the ugly.  This Canadian band is made up of humans, just like you & I;  Savannah does not shy away from pointing out both the positive traits as well as the shortcomings of all the members of the group ~ including herself.  I find this honesty to be refreshing.There is another angle that is worth bringing up as well:  this is not a wealthy family.  They travel on a shoestring budget and can rarely afford the 'luxury' of a real-live hotel room that has a shower.  They endure through some rather squalid living conditions, and tensions within the family can flare up from time to time.  Again, this goes back to what I said:  it's an honest account of their trip and it's not sugarcoated.In that respect, it  is much more interesting than an account would be of, say, Paris Hilton traveling across the globe while being cocooned inside a bubble of servants and bodyguards.  This is a tale of normal people making a worldwide trek.  As such, they cherish their experiences much more than a Paris Hilton type ever would.So, if you're looking for an enjoyable read that is both raw & visceral as well as being beautiful and enlightening, then I would urge you to take Savannah's hand and let her lead you across the wonders of what Carl Sagan called the pale blue dot.  Someday we, too, will pass into history;  it would be prudent to see what our beloved planet has to offer before we reach that juncture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12G40FV8D88Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501052144#wasThisHelpful","R12G40FV8D88Q8","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not too many comedies are able to make me burst out laughing.  This one did.  It pokes fun at everything that had to do with living in the old west and it does so in what many would call a distasteful manner (so what?).  It's truly the funniest film I've seen @ least since Wolf Of Wall Street [HD]Liam Neeson does a caricature of his usual ""tough guy"" personas as he plays a gunfighter who wears a black hat (literally & figuratively!).  Charlize Theron is the sexiest cowgirl since Madeline Stowe & Andi McDowell starred in Bad Girls.  Seth Mcfarline injects a heavy dose of goofiness into the flick, and Neal Patrick Harris is terrific as the pompous ""sophisticated"" cowboy.One of the most surprising things about the film is that the cinematography of the southwest United States is downright stunning.  One would not expect to see great cinematography in  a film such as this, but Mcfarline wanted it to have the ""feel"" of  a real live western ~ with the slapstick comedic portions thrown in just for fun.If you liked Blazing Saddles then you're bound to enjoy this flick as it's cut from the same cloth.  It's obvious that the thespians had a good time filming the movie & that's always a plus.

"In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue.  That's the story all of us as schoolchildren were taught as the discovery of America insofar as Europe was concerned.  This is not entirely accurate on a couple of different points.  First, Columbus 1st landed somewhere in the Bahamas;  a short time later the continent was discovered by an Italian named Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the continent was named).Secondly, nearly 500 yrs < Columbus there was a Viking by the name of Leif Ericson who is said to have landed in what is modern day Newfoundland, Canada.  Our knowledge of who he was and the routes he took are fragmentary at best.  It is widely believed that he stopped over in Greenland on his way across the north Atlantic.  Some people have even questioned as to whether a person named Leif Ericson ever existed @ all.  However, in the last 30yrs or so, archeologists have disinterred relics in Newfoundland that scholars have called ""undeniably Nordic in origin.""Such is the backdrop of the current novel.  It is a specious attempt to piece together the travels of Leif and his men (and women!) who made the voyage west > 1,000 yrs ago.  When most of us think of Vikings, we think of a brutal lot with a lust for battle.  Conversely, the breed of Vikings depicted in this story are much more interested in exploring than they are in raping & pillaging villages.The center of the story are (fictional) scrolls that were found that belonged to a fellow by the name of Eric Thorson.  Eric, in turn, was Leif Ericson's right-hand-man.  It offers a plausible account of how things COULD have happened, especially with the interactions the Vikings had with the natives of what is modern day Canada.The author was a helicopter pilot in the Navy for many yrs and he creatively integrates his familiarity with helicopter detachments into the fabric of the storyline.  It is true that the military is called upon from time-to-time to help out with scientific research projects.People who are interested in reading another book about how scientific expeditions are conducted would do well to check out Shadow World.  Also, readers who would like to read another historical fiction novel that invokes the Vikings (and also takes place right around the same time period as the present book) would be admonished to peruse Hawk Quest.This is a compelling novel that does a fine job of taking the reader back to the age of the Vikings & the time of global exploration.  In addition to Leif, there are other characters in the book who actually lived and the author is able to breathe life into their story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCOQZDE87JU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478700866#wasThisHelpful","ROCOQZDE87JU7","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was raised in a conservative environment, the name Carl Sagan was demonized in my younger years.  Just as his pupil, Neil DeGrasse Tyson is eschewed by religious groups today, so too was Sagan despised back in the 1980s.  So, what was Sagan's crime?  What is Tyson's crime?  Both are one-in-the-same:  a yearning to bring science out of its esoteric domain and make it more accessible to the general public.  In short, they wanted to make science (gasp!) mainstream.Sagan wrote his book for all people to gain a sense of awe of the universe that surrounds us.  This review, on the other hand, is geared towards people who have a genuine interest in science.  Sagan has had a profound influence on my life and he coerced me to ""grow up"" from the simple minded religious paradigm I was told to adhere to as a child and instead look at the world through the rational paradigm of science and logic.  For that, I am indebted to the late Cornell professor of astronomy.One of the pressing questions that many might have is this:  if they have seen or if they even own (as I do) the 1980s PBS series COSMOS on DVD, is it still worthwhile to read the book?  The answer is.....YES!!  To be sure, there is much overlap between the PBS series & the paperback, but there is also stuff in the book that is not in the series (and vice versa).Since the 1980s, there are some updates that Sagan would make were he to write the book today.  First off, exoplanets were a scientific hypothetical 30yrs ago;  nobody knew for sure if they existed.  Starting in the mid 1990s, exoplanets were realized as being a scientific fact.  First, astronomers could only locate very large exoplanets (some of which are several times the size of Jupiter).  Over time, they have refined their techniques and have found much smaller exoplanets ~ some of which could possibly even harbor life.  The discovery of exoplanets has led to the fastest growing field in the realm of astronomy today.Clearly, even to we laymen, exoplanets should not be a surprise.  It is only religious types who have wanted to think of our solar system as ""unique.""  For people who are alive right now, just think about this:  future generations will look back @ this time in which we located exoplanets in the same manner that we look back upon Galileo and his jubilation at finding the moons of Jupiter.  Sagan muses about the possibility of exoplanets in the book;  oh, if only he could be around today to share in the process of their discovery!Sagan also expresses how he would like to send a probe to the moon of Saturn known as Titan as well as sending a rover to Mars.  Both of these dreams have been realized since his death in the early 90s.  Recently, the Cassini spacecraft released  a probe named after one of Sagan's heroes:  Van Huygens.  It safely touched down on Titan and we have pictures & data from one of only 4 rocky worlds in our solar system which have an atmosphere (Venus, Earth & Mars are the other 3).  We have also sent the CURIOSITY rover to Mars & it has taught us much.When it comes to the notion of extra terrestrial intelligence, we don't know anything more about the topic than we did back in the 1980s.  That is, with the exception of the fact that we have located expolanets that are the correct size that reside in the so-called ""Goldilox Zone"" of their respective yellow suns.  One correction that does need to be taken is with the Drake equation which Sagan summoned with the efficacy of figuring how how much life there could statistically be in the Milky Way.  The Drake equation did not factor in plate tectonics, which is critical for the evolution of life on Earth.None of this is meant as a criticism of Sagan.  To the contrary, Sagan relished advancements in science and embraced refinements to the scientific paradigm.  Unlike the religious types who have always loathed him (and always will), Sagan prided himself on being an open-minded scientist.  If only the rest of us could attempt to be more like the late Carl Sagan, the world would be a much, much better place.The very fact that there are myriad more people who are scientifically literate today than back in the 1970s is a testament to the pioneering efforts of Carl Sagan.  His colleagues such as Stephen Weinberg, Freeman Dyson, Stephen Hawking, Stephen J. Gould, Richard Dawkins, Harold Morowitz and others have all followed his lead in writing books on science that are written for the layman.  That fact alone makes Carl Sagan one of the most notable scientists of the past few hundred years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH78EZRU4DE5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345539435#wasThisHelpful","RH78EZRU4DE5H","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara Malakul Lane has the leading role in this film as a coy young musician named Anna.  Sara has an exotic & yet innocent beauty, which makes her PERFECT for this part.  She is incessantly molested by her stepfather and one day accidentally kills him in self defense (this is hardly spoiler material as it happens in the opening moments of the story).  As a result she is sent to prison;  a grave injustice.Like Pepper in Orange Is the New Black: Season 1, Anna wants to keep a low profile, be left alone, do her time quietly and get out.  Unfortunately, also like Pepper, her stunning beauty makes her the ""center of attention"" in a prison where none of the other women can really compete with her lovely visage.Such is the backdrop of the story.  Sara has an exquisite body and is not shy about showing it off.  It has a higher ratio of nudity than a lot of WBB movies, and in my book that's a very good thing!  This is what also gears it towards being a more ""mainstream"" softcore women's prison flick than what ORANGE is.If you're a fan of the WBB genre, then this 1 should be @ the top of your list.  It is erotic, sexy, disturbing and alluring all in one.  If you're not in love with Anna by the end of the film, then you must not be anything like me!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NLWJ0REIEPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRZPRB4#wasThisHelpful","R33NLWJ0REIEPN","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of Orestes is known less to the general public than is the stories of the Trojan War that appear in Iliad and The Odyssey of Homer (Bantam Classics).  Recent film features such as Troy and Helen of Troy have omitted the character of Orestes altogether for the sake of simplicity.Aeschylus' trilogy is about the culmination of the curse of the house of Atreus, which is the the most dysfunctional family in Greek mythology.  The founder of the house was a fellow by the name of Tantalus.  One day, Tantalus invited over Zeus, Apollo and Demeter for dinner.  Before they arrived, he murdered his son, Pelops, and offered his entrails as the repast.  Basically, he wanted to ""get one over"" on the gods.Demeter was the only one who was fooled as this happened around the time that Persephone was abducted to the underworld & the goddess was thus distracted.  She immediately knew something was kahooey when she bit into the meat.  She felt so bad that she brought Pelops back to life.  As she had bitten into his shoulder, she gave him a prosthetic one as recompense.Zeus was not amused.  The earth opened up underneath Tantalus and he fell down into Tartarus.  There, he was up to his neck in water and had gorgeous branches of fruit all around him.  However, each time he reached for the fruit, it receded JUST out of his reach.  And, each time he tried to take a drink, the water would always be just beyond his dry & vapid lips.  Such was his punishment:  to forever suffer the pangs of hunger & thirst whilst having fruits & water just out of his grasp.  If you're scoring @ home, you know that this is from whence we get the term ""tantalize.""Such was the beginning of the curse of the house of Atreus.  Through the generations, the family encountered infantcide, matricide, cannibalism, incest, adultery and just about everything you'd like to jettison from a ""normal"" household.  Of course, it's not as though the family always ""set out"" to commit despicable acts.Before leaving for Troy, Agamemnon is faced with a dillema:  he can either abandon the expedition and send the Greeks home, OR he must sacrifice his young daughter, Iphigenia, to the gods.  Doing the latter will cause Artemis to unlock the winds.  Doing nothing will equate to the 1st option as the fleet is restless and about to give up on the idea of sailing to Troy.  Agamemnon, with a heavy heart, chooses to make the sacrifice.Ultimately, this is one of the many facets of the story that compel his wife, Clytemnestra, to take vengeance upon her husband.  This much is covered in Helen of Troy.  However, the story does not end there.  Agamemnon & Clytemnestra also have a son:  Orestes.Orestes, then, is faced with a conundrum of his own:  if he murders his mother to avenge his father, then he will be haunted by the furies.  If he does not avenge his father, then his mother will never face punishment for her crime.  What would YOU do?  That's a tough one!!Such is the backdrop of The Oresteian Trilogy: Agamemnon; The Choephori; The Eumenides (Penguin Classics).  The 1st play recounts Agamemon's return to Troy & his subsequent murder.  The 2nd play is about Orestes & his sister, Electra, plotting revenge against their mother and uncle (Aegisthus).  The 3rd and final play is the tale of poor Orestes being chased by the furies and Apollo acting as his ""defense counsel"" at what the Greeks believed to be the first trial by judge & jury.  This is a rather important feature, given that the current judicial structure of the United States is loosely based upon the blueprint of the Greeks, which they in turn traced back to Orestes!So, for people who want to know the more complete story of the Trojan war, this book is a must.  People who are curious about the end of ""clan justice"" and the beginning of a ""civilized"" judicial system will also be inclined to read their Aeschylus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BJNQW3A5S26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140440674#wasThisHelpful","R9BJNQW3A5S26","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mitch & Mark are 2 Canadians who were childhood chums who became lifelong friends.  While Mark eventually ended up in Japan & Mitch stayed in Canada, the buddies kept in touch over the yrs.  Unfortunately, Mark's e-mails & phone calls have ceased and nobody knows where he is.  Mitch decides to take it upon himself to go on a 1 man search & rescue mission (the former is obligatory, the latter if necessary).This book reminded me of Heart of Darkness (Dover Thrift Editions).  Instead of following the Congo, Mitch retraces Mark's steps via browsing the history of Mark's computer and finding clues such as the GPS on Mark's IPAD.  Instead of descending into the depths of the African jungle, Mitch follows the trail from Canada to Japan to the Phillipines.  It is there he finds a ""human jungle"" filled with shady characters and an environment where human trafficking is the norm.Unlike Conrad's novel, this is a book that is as much about an existential mid-life crisis as anything else, and it's something that both Mitch & Mark are enduring separately.  Being a middle aged male myself, there are times in which I want to have an ""escape hatch"" out of my life, one that would jettison me to an alternative life that has more glitz & glamour than my own.  Thus, I read this book @ the perfect time as I'm fully able to relate to what both of the characters are experiencing.When I was in the Navy, I visited both Japan & the Phillipines.  The novel brings back unpleasant memories of Filipino children who are always in the clutches of an everpresent state of poverty.  I was also reminded me of how readily available prostitutes are in PI, and how they're always seeking out westerners.  People who have seen Dangerous Beauty will recognize the sad state of affairs when women's career opportunties are severely restricted:  the ""oldest profession"" becomes the lesser of 2 or 3 evils.  There are salacious elements in the story, but they remind me more of Leaving Las Vegas than they do stories of erotica.  More than anything, the book has a tone of a sort of languid sadness in it.This is a book that will be most relatable to men who are between 40-55.  If a guy reads it in his 20s, he will be apt to re-read it later in life when he ""gets it.""  One of the antidotes of having a mid-life crisis is surrounding oneself with 20-something women, and this is not something men will relate to until they're past their prime.  So, if you're a middle aged man up for the challenge of a search for an old buddy stuck somewhere up the Congo.....er.....somewhere in the Phillipines, then this is just the novel for you!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5SSFNL4GNYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497419964#wasThisHelpful","R1R5SSFNL4GNYT","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Piper Chapman (portrayed by the lovely Taylor Schilling) is your typical girl next door.  She's built like a cheerleder, she's engaging, she's relatable, she's friendly, she's intelligent and (most of all) she's normal.  All of these attributes serve in her favor in the regular world.  Unfortunately, all of the above traits count against her in her new environment:  a federal prison.Piper is (rightfully) convicted of being a drug mule and is given a light, 15 month sentence.  (While 15 months would seem an eternity for most of us in the ""real"" world, it's pretty modest compared to most prison sentences in state & federal prisons).  This is the story of how she adapts (or tries to?) to her new domain.  It's a place where the Corrections Officers frequently tend to be far more corrupt than the inmates.  And, of course, when it comes to the inmates, there's no shortage of colorful characters!People who are expecting this to resemble one of those cheesy softcore porn women-behind-bars movies will likely be disappointed.  There is sporadic nudity, but not nearly as much as I was expecting.  Of course, given the unconventional women who are in this series, it's best that there is not an overwhelming amount of skin.  Let's just say that the lot of them are not to be confused with HOOTERS girls.  For those who are curious, Taylor Schilling is topless briefly  in the pilot episode as well as the final episode of Season 1.One would think that a series about women-behind-bars would get dull.  After all, every day is Groundhog Day, right?  Well, not so much.  Each episode offers the ""backstory"" on one of the female inmates.  Some of the storylines are so far fetched & unrealistic that I can't help but believe that they were inspired by true events.  You just can't make this stuff up!  What I do know is that the author of the book (on which the series is based) did serve time in a federal pen.If you're considering buying this series, I would encourage you to do so.  However, just be aware that it's a very raw & gritty series that is occasionally disturbing.  It's totally uncensored & they take full advantage of that.  So, with that in mind, if you're in the mood to fade to orange, put on your jumpsuit to join Piper & the girls!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTYVRE3V10DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HW3EXCE#wasThisHelpful","R3BTYVRE3V10DK","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Within our beloved ""home sweet home"" solar system, there are 4 rocky planets / planetoids which have an atmosphere:  Venus, Earth, Mars & the moon of Saturn known as Titan.  Venus is far too hellish to terraform.  Earth doesn't need to be terraformed (at least not yet;  this could change if we continue to slowly ruin our biosphere).  That leaves Mars & Titan in play for terraforming.Recently, the Cassini probe touched down on Titan;  it's the furthest object away from the Earth that any artificial object has ever physically encountered. With a methane atmosphere, Titan does not presently support any forms of life (that we know of?).  However, that could change if we tinkered with the chemistry of the planet.  The present tale skips ahead a couple centuries and gives us a glimpse at efforts to do precisely that.Given its methane atmosphere, Titan is highly combustible.  As such, in the storyline, all fuel centered / electricity centered means of propulsion are outlawed on the moon.  A solution to transportation is found via Titan's low gravity:  people can actually fly around with bird suits.  This is quite an innovative vision, and it's even plausible!Most science fiction stories offer us alien technology, alien physiology and alien politics.  While the present book delivers on all 3, it also adds something that is far more important.  Yup, that's right:  in the proud tradition of Douglas Adams, the novel gives us a totally alien sense of humor with one particularly colorful alien named Ranyk.For people who are curious about the future of human exploration of space, this book is a ""must have.""  People who enjoy this book may also want to check out Mariner Valley, which is a sci-fi book that focuses on the colonization of Mars.  Both books are worthwhile for those who have an interest in expanding the human dominion over our small corner of the Milky Way galaxy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SFHPT9ZB6J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615955355#wasThisHelpful","R27SFHPT9ZB6J9","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Sam Niel and Hugh Grant are accomplished thespians, the main ""draw"" of the present film is Elle MacPherson taking a crack @ acting.  I will admit, this was the primary reason I picked up this DVD.  In short, I certainly was not disappointed!!  First off, Elle looks absolutely magnificent in the nude, and that's a good thing as she's naked through much of the film.  This, of course, is not surprising given her background as a world famous Supermodel.  What IS surprising is that she has a natural screen presence that I was not anticipating.  Way to go, Elle!!!The story takes place in Australia around 1911 and centers around a woman named Estella (played by Tara Fitzgerald).  Going to Australia is somewhat like Alice going down the rabbit hole.  In this case, Estella is exposed to a wonderland of erotica.  In mythological stories about sirens, it is men (usually sailors) who are seduced by sirens.  {And, of course, this usually leads to their doom.}  In this case,  it is a woman who falls into a trance under their gaze.  Estella experiences a sexual awakening and partakes in every sort of debauchery;  voyeurism, exhibitioninism, group sex, lesbian sex, BDSM ~ she is introduced to all of it!!In spite of how ""wild"" the film souns, it maintains its surreal tone, like a pleasant dream.  That, of course, seems to be the whole point.  A very enjoyable piece of filmmaking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FXJQDZLFQQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0788815717#wasThisHelpful","R28FXJQDZLFQQG","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For myself, I have never trusted stock brokers & Wall Street goobers any more than I would lawyers or politicians.  This film crystalizes why that is the case.  I had never heard of Jordan Belfort < watching this film, and I hope he's not made into a mythical anti-hero due to this film.On the acting side, Leo is convincing as a fellow who thinks far to highly of himself (for his own good as well as the rest of the world).  However, the show stopper is Margot Robbie who plays the trophy wife who finally(!) sees beyond the glitz & glamour and begins to think for herself.  Margot is certainly beautiful & she reminds me a lot of Alice Eve.Ultimately, this movie is a cross between Wall Street, National Lampoon's Animal House and Bachelor Party [Blu-ray].  It is comically entertaining in a way that I wasn't expecting it to be ~ albeit in a stomach-churning sort of way.Presently, there is a contingent of Americans who are puzzled as to why a narcissistic, arrogant snake oil salesman from Wall Street was steamrolled in the 2012 presidential election.  The present story encapsulates the impetus for why so many people had such a distaste for Mitt Romney (myself included) which led to his rebuke on election night.  Belfort's disdain for ""common folk"" reminded me an awful lot of the Mittster's infamous 47% comment.Whether you want to pick up this DVD or not, there are two main takeaways, at least that I found.  One:  in the words of  C.S. Lewis, it is better to choose loss over shameful gain.  Two:  a junkie wearing an Armani suit is still a junkie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QLZJVN6E5FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKGTO#wasThisHelpful","R38QLZJVN6E5FL","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Major Mike Harris is a Green Beret who is the leader of an elite group known as the Desert Lions.  He, himself, has the nickname of being the ""Black Lion"" and he is quickly becoming a legend throughout the Special Forces community.  He & his team are hot on the trail of Al Qieda operatives who are attempting to stage an even more spectacular attack than they did on 9/11/2001.Such is the backdrop of the novel.  It is an exciting book and a panoramic tale that will take the reader all around the world;  Japan, Australia, South America, and various locations throughout Europe & the Middle East.  It showcases the skills  & operational capacity of Special Forces to engage hostiles and eliminate them with malicious intent.  That said, there are a few covert missions in the book that would seem to be more in the realm of sorties run by the CIA than the Army Green Berets.  However, that is just my opinion.Lastly, the book would have you believe that Special Forces units are entirely made up of officers as there is nary a reference to any of them being enlisted (at least that I can recall?).  This, too, is erroneous.  SF are unique in that rank actually means LESS in the field than elsewhere in the armed forces.  In fact, not only are most SF types enlisted, but they can actually LEAD missions if they have expertise in a specific area that the mission needs.I have just a few criticisms of the book.  First, the narrative of the tale could use a little refining. In particular, the author has an affinity of the word ""powerful"" and tends to over-use it.  This is a bit irritating and also makes the word lose some of its value in describing that the writer is trying to describe.  Also, some of the technology in the book is a bit over-the-top and pushes the envelope on plausibility.  LThat said, this is a book that is highly recommended for people who enjoy Special Forces adventures.  One of the strongest points of the book is the character development of Major Harris.  One of the ""knocks"" on Special Forces types (EVEN by people within the Special Forces community!) is that they can tend to be a bit arrogant & full of themselves.  While some  SF types are certainly guilty of this, Major Harris is not.  He is down-to-earth and does not develop a misanthropic attitude towards the rest of the world.  In fact, he's the kind of likeable Green Beret whom you'd love to have over for Thanksgiving Dinner!All in all, this is a great SF adventure and is highly recommended for fans of the genre.  As the Green Berets themselves would say, the ultimate goal of combat is to ""free the oppressed!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IJOD2DAXPOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989301710#wasThisHelpful","R20IJOD2DAXPOC","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Spring of 1979, there were two teams on an inevitable, collision course ~ perhaps more-so than any other two teams in the history of the NCAA tournament.  The two teams were from the border states of Michigan & Indiana and both featured a superstar on their roster.  For the Michigan State Spartans, it was Lansing's own Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson.  For the Indiana State Sycamores, it was Larry Bird.The two players would have many things in common, as well as some notable differences.  Larry was more of a pure scorer, while Magic was more of a ""catalyst"" for his team's offense.  Both players would move on & have remarkable NBA careers where they would continue their rivalry from the national championship game.  Both would even become NBA head coaches;  Larry was highly successful with the Indiana Pacers, while Magic's short stint with the Lakers was disastrous.Personality wise, they could not be more different.  Magic was gregarious and loved having a mic in front of his face.  Larry, meanwhile, was diffident towards the media & preferred for the team as a whole to get the attention after victories rather than he personally.  Magic always had a smile on his face, while Larry was known for his stoic expressions.Such is the backdrop of the present book, which gives the reader a ""behind the scenes"" narrative of the 1979 college basketball season which culminated in perhaps the single most important basketball game ever played.  It still holds the record for the highest ratings, and it elevated the game of college basketball to unseen heights.  It also indirectly rejuvenated the NBA, which at this time was very unpopular.  All of it happened due to  a showdown in the national championship game between 2 of the best players who ever played the game.Seth Davis does an excellent job of giving us a historical background, not only of the players, but also both schools and everything that went on with both players being recruited to the respective schools.  {In Bird's case, he got to Indiana State after taking a detour to the university of Indiana}.  Davis has no shortage of anecdotes and funny stories to share with basketball junkies, and even non-basketball junkies are bound to enjoy this book.If you are a fan of Michigan State or Indiana State, then this book is for you.  If you're a fan of the Bird Man or the Magic Man (or both?) then this book is for you.  If you have even a passing interest in the game of basketball & the historical context of the '79 championship game, then this book is for you.

"In The Art of War, Sun Tzu writes the following:Therefore I say:  'Know the enemy and know yourself;  in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning & losing are equal.If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.'  (P 84)This, of course, is why the United States spends billions on military intelligence each yr.  If we can learn the strengths and weaknesses as well as the tendencies of our enemies, then we put the odds in our favor to prevail in any conflict we enter into.That said, few things put military forces into jeopardy like faulty intelligence.  ""Guessing wrong"" on the motivations / objectives of your adversary can be much more lethal than having a cautious uncertainty on such matters.As is typically the case, Special Forces units are more at the mercy of bad intel than are more conventional units.  After all, Special Ops are @ the pointy end of the spear.  When things go wrong for these elite units behind enemy lines, they go REALLY wrong REALLY fast.Such is the story of Zero Six Bravo: The Explosive True Story of How 60 Special Forces Survived Against an Iraqi Army of 100,000;  a British Special Forces outfit finds itself deep in enemy territory with a mission that is based in intel that is wildly off the mark.  They end up being chased across the Iraqi desert by an army division that they were told was docile & ready to surrender.When people think of Special Ops units, they tend to think of them as being hard-nosed & focused soley on the mission-at-hand.  For the most part, they are.  However, what is eye-opening about this book is that it takes you inside a Special Ops unit & it shows that even top-shelf warriors can have colorful personalities.  The vehicle's machine gunner, nick-named ""Dude,"" is particularly memorable as his mannerisms recall to mind Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Righteous dude!!This is certainly one of the most exciting books I have ever read.  Indeed, the last 100 pages tell the story @ a frenetic pace.  Admirers of SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper, Zero Dark Thirty, Lone Survivor, Tears Of The Sun and Bravo Two Zero will all feel right at home with this novel.  Indeed, the story of BRAVO TWO ZERO is actually referenced in the tale.This is a story of a unit that was let down by military intelligence & thus had no idea what they were getting into.  However, they did know themselves;  they trained together, were familiar with their weapons & equipment and this is what ultimately kept the mission from being a total-loss.  People who have a great respect for Special Ops units will have an even greater respect for them after reading this book.  For people who are unfamiliar with the dangerous, austere world of elite soldiers, this book is sure to be a real shock-to-the-senses!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WA42WBN6QNK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651379#wasThisHelpful","R2WA42WBN6QNK4","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At some point in the future, the United States  has a 2nd civil war.  Instead of being between north & south, this time it's man vs. woman.  Ultimately, it ends in an uneasy truce;  sort of like the end of the Korean war.  As such, there are still minor scrimmages & incursions over the borderlands that divide the genders.The women of this dystopia somewhat resemble the Amazon women from Greek mythology.  Like the Amazons, they are trained for combat have a tendency to really, REALLY dislike men.  According to legend, the Amazons would have their childbearing aged women couple with men from a neighboring tribe once a yr.  The female babies would be kept, while the male babies would be returned to the men's tribe to be raised.  As for future women, they have cut men out of the equation of reproduction altogether.  Women are artificially inseminated, and the male DNA chromosomes have been omitted to preclude the chance of more male babies being produced.  This is done, of course, with the efficacy of ultimately bringing the male homo sapien to extinction.In order to compensate for having less physical strength than their male counterparts, the women have relied on their guile to built mechanical contraptions that give the user superhuman strength & agility as well as an array of rather nasty weapons to engage male soldiers on the battlefield.  They are also much more adept at fighting as a team than the male soldiers whom they square off against.Such is the backdrop of the current tale.  2 characters living in this future (George & Annabelle) have a chance meeting and both are discontent with the status quo.  As was the case in the Middle Ages, the alliance of church  & state makes political considerations ever more convoluted ~ nevermind the fact that the genders no longer ""play nice.""  Indeed, this is a grim depiction of 2 societies that barely function in the broadest sense of the term.  Geo & Anna can see that the current path is a dead end for society, but can they do anything to alter the societal path?This book is recommended for people who enjoy science fiction  novels and visions of a dystopian future.  More specifically,  the target audience would be readers who appreciate a sci fi tale that is set in the not-too-distant future.  This is not a book about space travel or jaw-dropping technology.  Rather, it centers on the consequences of what happens when men & women fail to ""get along.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0XCCWQ3T0IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988996839#wasThisHelpful","R2N0XCCWQ3T0IB","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seeing this movie in the wake of the bizarre (and to date unknown) fate of Malaysia flight MH370 was quite haunting.  The story centers around a psychotherapist (Clare, played by Anne Hathaway) who is summoned for the thankless task of trying to help the survivors of a plane crash cope with their trauma and depression.  From the get-go, something seems to be kahooey regarding the survivors.This film demonstrates Hathaway's range as an actress.  Clare is the antipode to the feisty character of Catwoman whom she portrays in The Dark Knight.  Clare is demure, coy, ultra sensitive and diffident.  Hathaway delivers a fine performance, which is particularly significant in the present film as she is in basically 100% of the movie.  Physically, Anne Hathaway is nothing short of captivating;  I could never tire of staring at her gorgeous face!  Of course, I am a guy, so that's to be expected.People who enjoy movies such as Ghost, The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series) and Somewhere in Time will be sure to find the present DVD to be an entertaining gem.  Also, fans of THE TWILIGHT ZONE will not be disappointed, either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361OU2EVILCQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P3SA9O#wasThisHelpful","R361OU2EVILCQA","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure:  as a native Michigander, I've never liked Detroit.  Ever.  I've tried to avoid the area to the best of my ability, and I've only traveled there when I had a specific reason to drive inside the city limits (usually for a sporting event).  The city is an eyesore with run down buildings, decrepit homes, squatters & homeless persons.  There are parts of Detroit that look like they're in the process of being demolished.  There are other parts that ARE in the process of being demolished.  Nor am I the only person who has noticed the sad state of this once proud city;  CNN's Anthony Bourdain did one of his PARTS UNKNOWN shows in Detroit and he said ""The only other city I've ever seen that was this devastated was Cherynobl ~ and I'm NOT trying to be funny!""All of that said, whether people such as myself like it or not, Detroit is not only the biggest city in the mitten state, but also the most important.  Back in the 1960s, my parents moved to MI due to the booming job market.  These days, of course, the words ""Michigan"" and ""booming job market"" spoken in the same sentence looks like a punchline in search of a joke.  Back in the 60s, however, this was not so.  The economy was driven (pun intended) by the automobile industry.  The center of the auto industry, of course, was Detroit.  Hence, indirectly, it is because of MOTOWN that I ended up being a Michigander in the 1st place.The present book is a look at the history of Detroit as told through the eyes of a woman who grew up in the motor city.  She gives us an overview of how pleasant Detroit used to be prior to the riots in the 1960s.  She also offers an in-depth view of how the city started a death spiral that coincided with the end of the muscle car era in the early 70s.Mary McMahon also gives the reader a nice backstory on how her ancestors immigrated to the United States from Ireland and Germany & happened to end up southeast Michigan.  The book obviously entailed a great deal of research, and the story of her great grandparents is analogous to a great many immigrants of the 19th century.The crux of the book, however, covers her personal biography as well as the decline of Detroit from the early 70s onward.  She is refreshingly frank in not trying to paint the city as being a paradise on earth ~ at least not today.  She shares her nostalgia for the Detroit she grew up in and frequently contrasts that image with what a dirty city it has become.These days, Detroit has the ignominious distinction of being the largest city to ever apply for bankruptcy protection as it's > $18 billion in debt.  The population base has been shrinking for yrs, which has subsequently shrunk the tax base.  This, of course, has exacerbated the problem.  If you call 911 in the Detroit area today, you can expect to wait an hour or more before emergency services arrive.  It's bad.  I mean, it's REALLY bad.Still, the author holds out hope that there are better days ahead for MOTOWN.  For myself, I am not so optimistic.  Of course, as she is a native of the city & I am not, her opinion carries more weight than my own.  It is for that reason that this book is worth a read by people everywhere ~ but especially midwesterners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGJ6V87UDEND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148005318X#wasThisHelpful","RQGJ6V87UDEND","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie considers the question that guys like myself have always asked.  What would happen if a socially awkward nice guy who is a Joe Nobody is approached by a ""high end"" gorgeous woman?  Will the stress of trying to hold onto her devour him?  Will his lack of confidence be his undoing?  Will the universe self-destruct due to this outrage?  These and all the corollary questions are addressed in the current film.To make matters worse for the poor chap, the woman's ex is a sauve fighter pilot jock who wants her back.  Typically, this is not good news for average Joe types.  The best thing our average Joe has going for him is that he's a nice guy.  Unfortunately, as nice guys have found through the ages, this is not something he's normally able to use as a ""trump card.""Alice Eve has ""got the goods"" and easily portrays the sort of dreamgirl that we mere mortals spend our nights dreaming about.  She's also a fine actress and there is no gray matter as to why her career is taking off as she's quickly becoming a rising star.  I'm thinking that she'll be a household name within the next 5yrs or so.The people who have given this movie negative reviews have dismissed it as an unrealistic juvenile fantasy.  Fair enough, but.....what did they expect, exactly?  It's the unconventional situation of the supermodel caliber woman going after an average Joe which is precisely what gives the film its funniest moments.On a deeper level, the story is something of a satire on how we have our preconceived conventions, perceptions and expectations.  Sometimes that can sabotage our relationships with each other.  There are times when it's best just to let well enough alone & not over analyze things;  we humans have a tendency to make things more complicated than they need to be in all aspects of our lives.In any case, in the 4.3 billion year history there have been approximately 3 instances of a nice guy taking on a ""Biff"" and winning the girl of his dreams.  This film depicts one of those times.  So......if you pass on this flick, good luck in tracking down the other 2!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTREG61SM8GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFZ3XU#wasThisHelpful","R2OTREG61SM8GL","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people know of the many conflicts between Venice & the Ottoman empire as being the impetus for blowing up the Parthenon in 1687.  What is lost is the fact that these two vast empires struggled against each other for centuries.  Here is a book of historical fiction that provides a snapshot of the ongoing war over a century before the Parthenon exploded.A central character is a historical architect named Andrea Palladio.  He is commissioned by the Doge of Venice to build a new church with the efficacy of appeasing an angry god and thereby healing the city of the plague.  The main character of the book is his maid, a young woman named Feyra;  half Venetian, half Ottoman, she is caught between 2 worlds and must ultimately choose sides.As all good historical fiction does, this book views actual events through the lens of a fictional subplot.  The author weaves sundry historical anectdotes into her tale and by doing so transports the reader back to the Constantinople & Venice of the 16th century.  As I've always been infatuated with Venice, the book was truly a pleasure to read.Readers who enjoy this book may also be interested in the following works:  The Drowning Guard: A Novel of the Ottoman Empire, Dangerous Beauty [HD], The Merchant Of Venice, The Plague, Death in Venice (Dover Thrift Editions) and Venice: History of the Floating City.For people who have an interest in a largely unknown epoch of history, the present book makes for a fascinating read.

"The plot of this film is similar to the ""A movie"" plot of Demi Moore's STRIPTEASE.  A stripper (Josie Hunter) wants to get custody of her daughter, but the deck is stacked against her due to her occupation as an exotic dancer.  Unlike the bigger budget STRIPTEASE, this flick is WAY hotter and (believe it or not!) a better movie!Josie Hunter is exquisite.  Like Micah Ashley, she can walk around with her blonde hair casually combed and she's still(!) drop-dead gorgeous.  If you like lots of nudity in your B movie flicks, then you cannot go wrong w/this one.  It is NOT a ""teaser"" flick as every babe in the movie strips down @ one time or another and there's not a homely woman in the bunch!  If nothing else, this flick is not short on eye candy.One of the most remarkable things about the film is that it actually has a lawyer & a strip club owners who are good(!) guys.  Whoa!!  I didn't think that was possible, but they pulled it off!!  Usually,  lawyers & strip club owners are slimy & sleazy, but that's actually not the case here.  The lawyer is actually a ""knight in shining armor"" type of guy;  the same type of fellow that I've tried to be myself for damsels-in-distress.If you're not aroused 30 seconds into watching this movie, then you may as well stop watching as the rest of the movie is more of the same.  However, if you're not aroused, then I have to question what your intentions were in buying a movie like this.  Again, while the women may not be going up for an Academy Award for best actress, that's really not the ""point"" here.  It's an enjoyable movie and it's not short on beautiful naked women.  Who could ask for anything more????","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19K7U4B73GUB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GX1XI#wasThisHelpful","R19K7U4B73GUB7","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the prime of her beauty, Meryl Streep gives the best performance of her career in the film that put her on the map.  The story takes place shortly > WWII, but the ""meat"" of the story lies in flashbacks to the holocaust.  As a survivor of the holocaust, Sophie (portrayed by Streep) is haunted by a continual sense of failure and betrayal.  This is altogether unfair, given that she had no control over her situation in the concentration camp, but it is poignant nonetheless.One of the most disturbing parts of the movie is where it shows the children of Nazi officers running around, laughing & playing and doing what children do.  That in itself is not surprising, but it's the fact that they do these things right in the shadow of the death camp that creates a a shocking juxtaposition.Most people who have heard of this film are well aware of what Sophie's ""choice"" entails.  However, for those who may not be familiar with this film (after all, it did come out back in the 80s), I will not create a spoiler alert.  However, I will say this:  when the scene comes in which Sophie is forced to make the most horrific choice imaginable for a mother, IF you don't feel as though someone is slowly ripping out your spleen, then it may well be that you're not really human after all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBI6MS1BK250/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K3M1VI#wasThisHelpful","R2BBI6MS1BK250","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the outset, I concede that there is a conflict-of-interest in my writing a review of this book as Corrine is a friend of mine.  She obviously has her enemies as there are some haters here on Amazon.com.All of that said, the haters ignore the photos of Corrine from the time of her son's death.  Her boyfriend, Brandon, beat up both she & her late son Dominick and the police photos confirm this.  She was obviously pummeled as the images are graphic.  As to why she didn't call 9-1-1, Brandon smashed her cell phone.  He also threatened to kill both she  & her son if she tried to leave the house.  Effectively, he held her hostage for the 4 days in question.This is a case where an overzealous public has a bloodlust for revenge that trumps the wish for justice.  Brandon got life in prison, which is what she deserved.  In Corrine's case, the prosecuting attorney(!) at her trial recommended that she be paroled out at the earliest possible time.  The state of Michigan wanted to ""make an example"" of Corrine in the interest of political expediency.One of the unique things about this book is the depth of honesty that it exhibits for an autobiography.  Corrine does not portray herself as a perfect person.  To the contrary, she is open about her drug use and getting involved with ""bad boy"" types (of which Brandon was the worst).For myself, I categorically reject the book's fixation on religion as a tool to understand the world around us.  In the book, a pastor says ""Don't blame God for what happened.  Blame the devil.""  Such a ""reach"" for an explanation of the horrific circumstances of Dominick Calhoun's murder are irrelevant & superfluous.  I have a much better idea:  how about we blame Brandon instead?To be sure, this book covers a touchy issue.  Those who believe Corrine is guilty-as-charged will most likely be undeterred by her testimony of what happened.  I get that.  Perhaps one thing we can all agree on is that the book points out a bigger issue, which is the problem of domestic violence in this country.  Hopefully we can find common ground in the notion that no child deserves what Dominick endured & no woman deserves what Brandon put her through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SSNWT0XT5YI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625091036#wasThisHelpful","R1SSNWT0XT5YI0","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 313CE, the emperor Constantine signed the Edict of Milan, which legalized the practice of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.  Inside of a century, the Christians turned-the-tables on their Pagan tormentors and began to relish the opportunity to persecute anyone who didn't believe as they did.  102 years > the Edict of Milan, the Christians committed one of their most ignominious sins of all time:  they murdered Hypatia of Alexandria.This is not exactly a ""spoiler alert"" as most people who would be inclined to read this novel would be familiar with Hypatia.  For those who are not, Hypatia was a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, literary critic and teacher.  She was what I would call the last ""curator"" of the library of Alexandria (before it was burned to the ground by a Christian mob, that is).The present book focuses on her life, picking up @ the moment-in-time that the library was vanquished by an act of madness.  Non-Christian texts were viewed as a threat and therefore needed to be burned.  In doing so, the followers of Christ massacred a great many people & also set the world back 1,000 yrs.  It would not be until the Italian Renaissance that the denizens of the globe would re-discover what had been lost in the fire @ Alexandria.The book is told from multiple points of view.  Some of the characters, like Hypatia, are historical, while others are fictional.  The book delves into an in-depth inquiry into who Hypatia could have been (the primary sources on her life tend to be sketchy).  It is said that Hypatia had the form of Aphrodite & the spirit of Plato, and both of these traits shine through the pages of this novel.For a reference on the convoluted rigmarole of the politics of the late Roman empire (made all the more recondite given the fact that the empire was split in half), I would recommend The Roman Emperors: A Biographical Guide to the Rulers of Imperial Rome 318 B.C. - A.D. 476.  For those who want to know more about Hypatia, I would recommend Cosmos, Hypatia of Alexandria (Revealing Antiquity), Agora and Anita's Legacy.Of all of the vile acts committed by humans during what Hegel called the ""slaughter bench of history,"" the murder of Hypatia is one of the most iconic & perhaps symbolic.  It was, in fact, a way in which the world ""chose"" to plummet into the Dark Ages less than a century > her death.  You burn down the greatest intellectual reservoir in the world & you kill one of the greatest human beings who ever lived and.....well.....that's what happens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZ3X79QQOFIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975925598#wasThisHelpful","RPZ3X79QQOFIC","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those tacky 80s flicks that is high on fun, high on gratuitous nudity, low on plot and marginal on acting.  In other words, it's the type of  ""B"" movie that I get nostalgic about as they just don't make ""fun"" movies like this anymore!!A young woman (Michelle Bauer) inherits a drive-in movie theater from her late grandfather.  This was the period in time that drive-ins were systemically going out of business as they had gone out of style.  That's something that would have been unheard of back in the 50s, but, it is sadly the progession of things.  {I'm not even sure whether there are any drive ins still around these days;  I remember seeing them as a kid but have not seen any in a few decades}So, the lass tries to drum up business for the drive in < the property goes into foreclosure.  But how?  Her plan is to lure customers by having the ticket holders and concession stand workers wear bikinis.  BRILLIANT!!  Works for me every time!!As you may expect, the film is saturated with topless women frolicking about, having fun & living life to the fullest.  Michelle Bauer is gorgeous and there are quite a few other attractive women in the film as well.  People who criticize the plotline of flicks like this seem to miss the point.  I mean, if you're looking for a deep & meaningful movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST, then go see SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Movies like this are not meant to make you think and they're always going to be lacking in depth.

"There is no shortage of diet books.  Fad diets, counter-intuitive diets, diets that revolve around obscure foods that few of us have access to ~ on & on.  There are myriad self-annointed ""experts"" in the field of nutrition.  However, what do the real experts have to say?  The ones who have degrees in biology & related scientific fields ~ what do THEY have to say?Such is the angle that the author takes in the present book.  Bailor does an exhaustive amount of research and he invokes studies and comments from people who work at some of the most top notch universities in the world (such as Harvard university, the university of Wisconsin & Michigan State University, among others).  Somewhat surprisingly, there is a consensus among the (real) experts and it is this:  the mainstream has it all wrong when it comes to having a healthy diet.It may come as a shock to many that the ""food pyramid"" we're all taught as kids is a bunch of bunk.  Then again, I suppose this should not come as as surprise when we live in a Capitalistic society gone berzerk.  It's one where corporations coerce the FDA to deliver what they (the corporations) want to hear in the interest of keeping profit margins high.  Alas, we live in a country where companies dictate to us what the rules are & the government only goes along for the ride.If you're curious about what people with a background in science have to say about solving the obesity problem in the United States, then this book is for you.

"When a fireball streaks over Chicago and continues over Lake Michigan, 3 middle-schoolers are quite puzzled, just like everyone else.  Unlike everyone else, they have the fortune (misfortune?) of becoming aware of the nature of the fireball:  a disabled alien spacecraft!Such is the premise of THE SHIFTER'S TRAIL.  The leader of the 3 youths is a precocious girl named Andromeda (and yes, she's named after the galaxy that serves as our cosmological next-door-neighbor).  She is great @ math & science, but nothing could prepare her for a face-to-face meeting with extra-terrestrials.One nice thing about the story is that it pays homage to myriad landmark scientists & mathematicians.  The names of Erwin Schroedinger, Max Planck, Madam Curie, Sir Isaac Newton & James Clark Maxwell are all alluded to within the storyline.  That's a nice touch!While the story is mainly geared towards young adults, this is a book that can easily be enjoyed by people of virtually any age demographic.  It's a science fiction adventure story that invokes principles of time-dilation in Einstein's theory of Relativity as well as many other facets of physics that come into play in space travel & the exploration of planets.So, if you're looking for a science fiction thriller that takes place in the midwest as opposed to some far-off planet, this is just the book for you.

"As a kid, my favorite movie was Superman: The Movie (1978).  Naturally, that is the flick that MAN OF STEEL is going to be compared to ~ 35yrs later!  Wow, has it really been that long?As such, let's take a look at the actors.  Unlike SUPERMAN 1978, MAN OF STEEL is a star-studded venture.  Outside of Marlon Brando & Gene Hackman, most of the cast of SUPERMAN were relative unknowns.  MAN OF STEEL, on the other hand, features Russel Crowe as Jor-el, Kevin Costner & the lovely Diane Lane as the Kents and Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White.The current superhero reboot departs from the old Krypton mythology, where the red giant sun of Krypton causes the planet to explode.  Instead of its sun, it's the Kryptonians' messing with the planet's ecology that is screwing everything up (an obvious allusion to the threat of global warming here on earth).  As intelligent & sophisticated as the Kryptonians are, they have something in common with we earthlings:  a high council that bears an uncanny resemblence to our very own do-nothing congress!  Jor-el struggles to get them to ""see the light"" but his oratorical reasoning is all in vain.  Crowe does a great job of relaying a sense of frustration in a dignified manner.Costner & Lane are a perfect fit as a midwestern couple that accidentally become a part of the greatest adoption story ever told.  Also in a departure from the typical Superman mythology, they are not elderly but middle aged;  young enough to be Clark's parents rather than his grandparents.Fishburne's Perry White has more depth than the usual depiction of White as the archetypal ornery & demanding boss.  This Perry White has a paternal interest in his employees and genuinely cares about their well being.  That's new territory in a character that's mostly known more for yelling & screaming than anything else.And then, of course, we have Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  My, oh my, oh my ~ Amy Adams!!  Listen:  I actually liked Margot Kidder as Lois way-back-when, but Amy Adams is a HUGE upgrade!!  She is beautiful yet feisty, feminine yet proactive and no-nonsense.  I dare say that they could make a movie about Lois Lane & subtract Superman out of the equation altogether.  So long as Amy Adams portrayed Lois, it would fly!!  {pun intended}Finally, Henry Cavill nailed the part of Kal-el / Clark Kent.  He has a very impressive physique ~ much more buffed up than the late Christopher Reeve was in the original.  This is a very introspective story of the superhero;  a superhero who struggles & is actually pained by his attempts to gain control of his powers.  Cavill plays the shy / strong-silent type who is condemned to being a loner very well.If you're looking for a re-imagined telling of the story of Superman, then this movie is for you!  If you don't think you'll like another reboot of the Superman mythology, then I would admonish you to give this 1 a try anyway.  It's worth getting on Blu Ray for the tremendous sound quality & eye candy special effects.  That said, it's the acting & the ""different direction"" that this Superman movie takes that separates it from its predecessors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9FUNEEB8JSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUPK8#wasThisHelpful","R3F9FUNEEB8JSD","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young man uses a house owned by his father as his ""haven"" for throwing wild parties.  Unfortunately, the father (played via a cameo of Don Johnson) decides to sell the property.  This causes the dude to think up a grandiose final farewell party.  But.....what to do?  The idea he hatches is bold & brilliant:  throw an orgy with his closest friends!This COULD have ranked as one of the all time great party movies.  The plot of the film consists of talking his friends into the idea (some of the babes have serious reservations) and then making all due preparations.  The most comical part of the flick is where he scopes out a local swinger hot-spot to learn the ropes.  There aren't any scenes that will leave you rolling, but there are a few that might cause you to chuckle.The movie builds up to the climactic orgy scene (pun intended).  I mean, an unrated movie called A GOOD OLD FASHIONED ORGY should be saturated with nudity.  Right?  Unfortunately, as I feared, the orgy scene is a G-Rated cop out.  Only one of the actresses on the cover takes her shirt off (and you'd better have your pause button ready!).  If nudity isn't a big deal to you, then by all means pick up this DVD.  However, IF it isn't an issue with you, then why would you watch a movie like this in the 1st place?","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274XIDFB2I54I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TK23EW#wasThisHelpful","R274XIDFB2I54I","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the opening credits, it is evident what the producers of NEWSROOM are trying to do.  It opens with black & white footage of pioneering TV journalists such as Edward R. Murrow & Walter Cronkite, and then transitions to the control room of a modern day control room of a fictional cable news station (ACN).  It is obvious that the ""thrust"" of the show is to showcase a nexus between the giants of TV's early days with the current crop of journalists on ACN.The approach of this series is unique.  Michigan's own Jeff Daniels portrays a ""Rockstar"" T.V. anchor who has seen his popularity wane in a day of changing demographics.  ACN tackles real-world events such as the BP oil spill in the gulf and the 2012 Republican campaign.  Problem is, the people involved with the network find that the best ratings come with tabloid news as opposed to ""important"" news.  Is there a way to find a balance?Many viewers might be shocked at how the show takes the gloves off to go after far Rightwing Tea Party whackjobs such as Rick Santorum, Michelle Bachmann & Sarah Palin.  In this regard, the show is right on the $$ in demonstrating the hypocrisy and utter cluelessness of those who believe the Tea Party is the best thing since sliced bread.  Republicans may not like it, but that does nothing to discount the veracity of the criticims levied against the Tea Baggers.People who are intrigued by behind-the-scenes topics as well as the ludicrous positions of the Tea Party are likely to enjoy An Atheist in the FOXhole: A Liberal's Eight-Year Odyssey Inside the Heart of the Right-Wing Media.  I found a lot of parallels between the two.

"As a Michigander myself, I've always been proud of Grand Rapids' own Gillian Anderson.  Everyone knows her best as Scully from the ""X Files"" but she has shown that she has quite a range as an actress.  This time, she is an investigator flown in from London to investigate a string of murders in Belfast, Ireland.  As always, Gillian does the ""sexy professor"" gig amazingly well!The series also stars Jamie Dornan as a man with a double-life.  By day, he is a family man with a wife & 2 kids and a career as a shrink.  By night, he has a hunger to strangle women to death.  Dornan is convincing as the intelligent, cunning & meticulous whackjob.  As a sidenote, I just hope this project doesn't have an adverse affect on his real-world social life!All things Irish must have 3 components:  a somber tone, a great deal of passion (think William Butler Yeats here) and a fiery Irish redhead.  THE FALL delivers on all 3 facets, with Niamh McGrady delivering the ""goods"" on the Irish redhead facet of the production.  She portrays a compassionate Belfast police officer who feels guilt for not being able to protect 1 of the eventual victims.  As a Thespian she is, in short, dazzling!  I'd like to see more projects of her's in the future.This is a high drama, kind of like the C.S.I. shows, only with a great deal more character depth & development.  THE FALL is dark & subtle.  If you're looking for lots of action & car chases, then this will certainly NOT satiate your appetite for that stuff.  On the other hand, if you're into cerebral crime dramas, then this should be right up your alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH97HZ0LPZSN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5IKN4#wasThisHelpful","RH97HZ0LPZSN9","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joe Muto is a midwestern guy who grew up with dreams of moving to the Big Apple & establishing a career.  Unfortunately, his only ""shot"" of getting his proverbial foot in the door is to become an employee of FOX News.  As a Liberal, this is quite a complex and convoluted direction to take.Such is the story told within these pages.  Muto finds himself getting by on a meager salary whilst working for the ""evil empire"" that is Rupert Murdoch's prized network.  He ends up rubbing shoulders with the likes of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and Karl Rove.  Not exactly ""natural surroundings"" for someone of the leftist mindset!Muto gives short intermittent chapters that take us through his last day @ FOX News;  the day he was identified as the (gasp!) mole who leaked unauthorized footage of Newt Gingrich getting his hair done & Mitt Romney discussing horses with Sean Hannity.  {Gosh, those FOX News buggers sure are touchy, eh?}  The chapters in between are flashbacks to his first days on the job & detail his meteoric rise to becoming an assistant for the bombastic Bill O'Reilly's radio show.The book is told with a sense of humor unbecoming a Notre Dame grad, and that was refreshing.  Not surprisingly, Muto describes his fiery Irish boss as being every bit as bellicose in person as he appears to be on TV.  Somewhat surprisingly, he describes Ann Coulter as being very friendly so long as she's not in ""attack dog"" mode.  Least surprisingly of all, he characterizes Sarah Palin as being even more(!) clueless than people give her credit for.  Of course, this should not come as a shock to anyone who has watched Game Change.For myself, the most curious part of the book is the revealation that there are actual human beings(!) with personalities(!) who work in the control rooms & behind the scenes @ FOX.  I never gave the matter much thought, but I always pictured the FOX building as being full of stodgy, overdressed & humorless Right Wing drones who cared for nothing save the company line.  Interesting.The title of the book is a bit of a misnomer as Joe doesn't really delve into atheism.  That he is an atheist is nothing more than a sidenote as he doesn't compare this aspect of his outlook with the hardcore Religious Right.  For those who are expecting a book of this type (as I was), that's not the case.  I get it:  A LIBERAL IN THE FOXhole doesn't have quite the same ring to it ~ for obvious reasons.If you're a Left Wing type who relishes anything that pokes fun at the pompous pundits on the Right, then you're sure to enjoy this book.  Much of it, in fact, reminded me of The Newsroom: The Complete First Season as it peeks into what goes on behind-the-scenes in the making of news shows.  As for Joe, here's to hoping that you find a career where you can feel good about yourself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ2W23LCO2Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953957#wasThisHelpful","RRJ2W23LCO2Q9","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alongside The Tudors: The Complete Series, this is one of the most well done & ambitious series ever produced by  a premium movie channel.  Unlike Henry the VIII, however, there are far more missing details to the life of Spartacus.  We really don't have any idea of what went on within the Thracian's camp as we don't have any 1st hand accounts.  Everything we know, we only know from the Roman point-of-view.This is both good & bad.  While we don't know the names of the gladiators & other Roman slaves who fought with Spartacus, I can't help but think that this series is an excellent REPRESENTATION of the types of discussions that must have transpired inside of Spartacus' inner-circle.  The series brings these long-dead heroes to life, and that is precisely the point.Liberties are taken with the one Gauis Julius Caesar, but that is all well & good as he's one of the few historical figures in the series (aside from Spartacus himself) who is a household name.  Meanwhile, the depictions of Crassus & Pompey are historically accurate, at least in the broad historical sense.  Marcus Crassus DID resort to decimating his own men, and Crassus & Pompey did team-up to defeat the gladiator army.  {As a sidenote, the 3 men together would go on to form what would become known as the ""First Triumverate"" which was a sort of bridge between the Roman Republic & the age of the Caesars}The acting in the series is terrific, with two alumni from the movie ""300"" included.  Both genders are bound to be entranced as the series is filled to top with buffed up gladiators & gorgeous women.  Of the latter, Gwendoline Taylor debuts in this season as Sibyl.  I must say, I was absolutely mesmerized by this New Zealand beauty!!  I can't wait to see her in more projects.The SPARTACUS series invokes everything that the time period was famous (or infamous?) for:  gladiatorial games, Roman baths, orgies, torture / crucifixion and the Romans trying to impose their will on the rest of the world.  As such, the series does not pull any punches when it comes to violence, blood, gore & nudity (in fact, virtually every single actress in the series strips-down @ one time or other!).  People who want their history watered down into a ""G Rated"" version should look elsewhere.This is a spectacular series, one that belongs up there with other Roman epics such as Ben Hur (1959), Gladiator and I, Claudius (35th Anniversary Edition).  People who want to learn more about the Roman empire would be inclined to also pick up Rome Power & Glory: The Rise.In the present age, the motto of the United States Army GREEN BERETS is ""To free the oppressed.""  Spartacus would have smiled upon such a motto.  That we still have brave soldiers today who wish to eradicate slavery and human hardship is a testament to the human will to resist tyranny.  It is also a testament to Spartacus himself:  a man who went on to become much more legendary than the 2 Legates who ultimately defeated him.  In that sense, every time we humans are able to successfully right a wrong, SPARTACUS LIVES!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I49OSX9GJC2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B52F278#wasThisHelpful","R3I49OSX9GJC2L","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the heels of the spectacular movie GRAVITY, here is another disaster-in-outer-space story (of sorts).  This time, the tale takes place hundreds of yrs in the future.  Mankind has not traversed beyond the solar system, but space travel has become commonplace and there are myriad colonies in the asteroid belt between Mars & Jupiter.A physicist named Dave works aboard an old military installation nicknamed ""the alley.""  It had an important role in a previous conflict, but has since mostly fallen into disuse.  Nevertheless, it is a gigantic space station ~ big enough to run large scale physics experiments within its bowels.  Unfortunately for Dave & his friends, it's also large enough to support physics experiments that go kahooey.There is an intriguing idea of the book which is at least thought provoking:  what if tinkering with advanced experimental physics machinery could somehow unlock latent clairvoyant abilities which lay deep within at least some of us?  What if a select % of us always had mental powers but just didn't realize it?  Of course, on the downside, people who do not possess these innate abilities tend to resemble the zombies from The Walking Dead: Season 2 Trailer [HD].  Of course, when mental sickness spreads with exponential rapidity, a large space station can quickly morph into an insane asylum in outer space.  Yikes!!This is an intriguing bit of science fiction.  It brings to mind something like a psychic powers version of Altered States (1980).  Similar to AS, enduring myths & symbols suddenly make more sense once we become enlightened.If you're looking for a science fiction novel that is off the beaten path, one that is not afrait to tinker with ESP, then this book is worth a look.  It does an exceptional job of combining the sci-fi genre with the isolation of outer space to conjure up the eerie desolation of a good horror movie.

"This is a delightful overview of myriad women through the ages who were sometimes literal princesses & other times only figurative ones.  It is well researched & brings to light a great many women whom I had previously never heard of.The book covers a great many different sorts of princesses.  Some, such as Khutulun & Lakshmibai were tomboyish princesses who had a penchant for military endeavors.  On the other extreme were girly-girl princesses such as Elisabeth of Austria.  Still others, such as Stephanie of England, Charlotte of Prussia and Gloria of Thurn, were party-hardy princesses.  One princess, Caraboo, was in fact an imposter who projected herself as someone of royal heritage.  Oh, the horror!  The horror!Contrary to the subtitle of the book, not all of the women depicted in this book were necessarily femme fatales with ill intentions, and not all of them were ""behaving badly.""  For me, the 2 most fascinating figures were the Aztec princess, Malinche and the American Indian princess, Sarah Winnemucca.  It can be argued that both women had the best interests of their people in mind (the Aztecs & American Indians) but ended up being vilified by both the their own people and the white man.For myself, the most stunning omission from the book would be Marie Antoinette.  When someone mentions ""Princesses behaving badly,"" the 1st two names that come to my mind are Marie Antoinette and Ann Romney.  The author can be forgiven omitting the latter, but it seems that the Austrian princess belongs @ the top of this list!!  Just my opinion.All in all, this is a well researched book & is told with wit and an endearing sense of humor.  People who read this book may also be interested in other women's studies such as Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity, Gladiatrix, Women in Ancient Greece and Hypatia of Alexandria (Revealing Antiquity).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZBIO9TJXD7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746443#wasThisHelpful","R2FZBIO9TJXD7T","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2yrs after his graduation from Michigan State University, the football program still desperately misses the services of one ""Captain Kirk"" Cousins.  His is a rags-to-riches football story of an unregarded / unheralded 2 star QB who became arguably the greatest and most revered MSU QB in school history.  In his terse NFL career, he has proven himself with the most potential for stardom in the pro game of any MSU QB since Earl Morall!Here is his autobiography which tell of his humble beginnings up through to the NFL draft & his 1st minicamp.  Anyone who is a fan of movies like Friday Night Lights and The Blind Side will find a lot to love in his tale.  Beyond being  a QB, Captain Kirk proved himself as a great leader, with the best example coming in his final game as a Spartan when he led his team back from a 16-0 hole @ 1/2 time to beat the mighty university of Georgia Bulldogs.The best part of the book for me was his relating how a defensive lineman on the team named Justin Kershaw took him under his wing & inspired the author to strive to do his very best.  Being an MSU season ticket holder, I knew who Kershaw was, but I never realized his impact on the team in the locker room.I must concede that I categorically reject all of the religious inferences made in the book.  I long ago abandoned religion in favor of logic & have never turned back.  The author's assumption that his life story is part of some divine cosmic plan is groundless.  He also overlooks the myriad fallacies, contradictions and omissions that exist in the Holy Bibble.In short, there was no ""cosmic plan"" behind the people on 9/11 who had to make the horrifying choice between being burned alive & leaping to their deaths (over 20 people chose the latter).  Nor was there a cosmic plan behind hundreds of thousands of heretics being tortured and burned @ the stake by the likes of Justinian, the Spainish Inquisition, Queen Mary & so many more.  Nor was there a divine agenda behind the holocaust.  Life is what it is, for better or for worse.While religion can offer comfort to life's travails, it is ultimately a counterfeit comfort.  This is what Karl Marx meant when he said ""Religion is the opium of the people.""  It makes you feel good, but it simply isn't true.Nevertheless, I cannot give this intimate self-portrait anything other than 5 stars.  The impetus for the book was the famous speech he gave @ the Big 10 pre-season conference just < his senior yr.  The video of his speech went viral on YOUTUBE and has since been used by other schools (and even entire conferences!) to use as a freshman orientation tool for their student athletes.  It was referred to time & again during telecasts of MSU football games that season, including the OUTBACK Bowl vs. UGA.Of course, for we MSU fans, it only reinforced what we already knew:  we had an outstanding player who was also a class-act as a person.  So many times in sports, you either get a class act whose talent rates between mediocre & bench-warmer, OR you get an all-world prospect who is an arrogant jerk.  It's rare to find someone who is both a good guy and a good player.  In Captain Kirk Cousins, we Michigan State fans were able to enjoy the presence of a man who possessed both attributes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5198IQMBIQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310739047#wasThisHelpful","R3J5198IQMBIQ8","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Larry Cartford was a Lutheran pastor who tried to demonstrate an unconventional premise.  He believed that the language of theology could be expressed via the actions of Christians, thereby providing a ""proof"" of God's influence on the world.  Ultimately, he was forced to abandon this paradigm as he found out first hand just how vindictive, narcissistic, petty and irrational that religious zealots can be.  This ultimately drove him away from religion altogether, where he found a peace he never knew with atheism.His stories of the infighting within his congregation reminded me of the Baptist church where I was indoctrinated as a Christian while growing up in Michigan.  After I graduated from high school, consternation within the church was the impetus to spawn a brand new church as pragmatic and theological issues could not be reconciled.  I have not given any thought to this in decades, but it is curious that it would appear that this sort of thing goes on  a lot more than I would have guessed.As a former pastor, Cartford is in a unique position to discern the ""mind control"" strategies of religions across the world.  When I was a boy, I once received in Sunday School a paper with a sketch of Jesus that said ""David is glad Jesus loves him.""  I thought to myself ""Wait a second.  When did I ever admit to either of these things being true?""  Point is, the church wanted submission 1st and everything else would fall into place later.  It's for this reason that religions want to prey on the minds of the most vulnerable persons:  young children who don't know any better.Looking back, this to me is a bit terrifying to think about.  The author shares my concerns of religions that sponser a rejection of reason & close mindedness and extols people who want to question the veracity of the bible / sacred teachings.My criticisms of the book are few & minor.  The biggest shortcoming is not in the content but, rather, the fact that the book could summon the services of an editor / proofreader.Content wise, there are a few places where the former pastor tends to misunderstand Islam.  On page 90 he writes:  ""The tribal god of the Muslims dominates a large portion of today's world....In some countries this god has an aversion to female flesh.  Women cannot be seen without their bodies covered.""This is not exactly true.  Yes, in most Islamic countries, women must wear veils / headscarves or even a burka.  This is true.  However, the impetus of this practice goes back to a rather amusing story regarding one of Mohammed's wives, Aisha.  {For those who would seek to learn the story as well as understand what the Muslims believe & why they believe it, I would recommend The Prophet's Scribe.This is an excellent book for people who have been religious all of their lives but are beginning to have their doubts about the truth of what they believe.  Another similar book like the present one is Hope after Faith: An Ex-Pastor's Journey from Belief to Atheism.  While the present book is a terse nuts & bolts look at the factors that compelled the author to leave the ministry for atheism, HOPE AFTER FAITH is much more of an autobiographical look at the journey.In any case, many people who have ""crossed over"" from religion to skepticism / atheism will find the tenets of both books to be quite familiar.  For myself, I tend to pull my hair out these days when people say stuff like ""Don't worry:  everything happens for a reason.""  The implication is that an omnipotent being is in charge of everything.  I reject that notion whole-heartedly and see religion itself as a rejection of life for it follows the confused narrative of ""IF we cannot live forever, then we should not live @ all.""  Such is  a paradigm of life that I left long ago & have no intentions of ever going back to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q794I4KE6YZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450085830#wasThisHelpful","R3Q794I4KE6YZ7","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an entertaining story about the post-war environment of the far future.  Following an intergalactic war, the galaxy is in shambles as myriad planets try to rebuild from the rubble of the conflict.  While there was a definitive ""winner"" in the struggle, it becomes unclear as to what has been gained as chaos & confusion abounds.  What's worse is that the triumphant force is unable to transform the conquered beings into their own image.As such, the story has a great many allusions to what has transpired in the Middle East over the last decade.  Sure, the United States ""won"" the wars in Afghanistan & Iraq, but what precisely does that mean if we're unable to shape the future of those two countries?  The same holds true in this tale, only on a much broader scale.  The story also deals with other all-too-common issues of war such as PTSD,  Machiavellian  tactics and the human (and in this case, alien) costs of warfare.The book also zeros in on a another  phenomenon:  the necessity (as well as sometimes the nuisance) of private security firms.  While their involvement is supposed to simplify things, they can frequently make things much more complicated.  One of the factors that led to the fall of the Roman empire was the fact that they outsourced their defense to mercenary armies that eventually turned on them.So, if you're interested in science fiction as well as how some things seemingly never change (from ancient battles to battles fought in the far future) then this book is worth a look.

"This is a pictorial history of the football program of Michigan State University.  It includes some of the oldest pictures, dating back to the Michigan Agricultural College (MAC) teams coached by MSU's 1st coach, Henry Keep.  The book extends through the MAC becoming Michigan State College (MSC) and ultimately MSU.  It leaves off with the inaugural season of John L. Smith.The book showcases the great players, coaches & personalities that were involved with the football program over the yrs.  It includes the story of President John Hannah, who moved heaven & earth to get MSU into the Big 10 > the university of Chicago pulled the plug on its football program in 1939 & ultimately departed the conference.Perhaps most importantly for MSU fans, Grinczel's work covers the Golden Age of Michigan State football, which went from 1950-1971.  These were the eras of Biggie Munn, Duffy Daughtery as coaches & Jack Breslin as the Athletic Director.  Of course, no book of this type would be complete without pix from the heralded 1966 ""Game of the century"" against Notre Dame.The most unfortunate thing about the book is the timing.  In other words, where it leaves off.  The book ends with the 1st year of John L Smith's disastrous coaching tenure in East Lansing.  Smith was arguably the single worst hire in program history.  Sure, Denny Stoltz & Bobby Williams were in over their heads, but it's always an unknown quantity when you promote someone to the position.  Muddy Waters was a terrible hire, but at least he was an MSU alumni who coached under Duffy.JLS, on the other hand, was a complete outside-the-box (and I would argue outside-common-sense) hire who had no business walking the sidelines @ Spartan Stadium.  During his tenure, it struck me as funny that a team that called themselves the Spartans would install a wimpy, finesse passing offense instead of playing the physical football it was always known for.  {Arch rival Michigan didn't learn from MSU's gaffe & they repeated the same mistake when they hired Rich Rodriguez}Smith's failure was a double-whammy for MSU.  When A.D. Merritt Norvell & MSU Prez Peter McPherson drove Nick Saban out of town, it set the program back 10yrs.  After firing Bobby Williams, hiring JLS was a slap-in-the-face to season ticket holders.  Meanwhile, Saban has since won 3 National Championships @ LSU & 'Bama.It would've been much better had the book left off with the victory over Georgia in the OUTBACK Bowl 2yrs ago.

"This is a rather unconventional book in the realm of religious apologetics.  The author critiques BOTH fundamentalist Christianity as well as Darwinian evolution.  Beth Houston believes in microevolution (evolution within the species), but not macroevolution (intra-species evolution).  As a Deist, she also rejects the Bible as literal fact.  In doing so, the author sets up her encampment just outside the range of artillery of intellectual atheists such as Christopher Hitchens & Richard Dawkins.  Their primary targets, after all, are fundamentalists who reject Darwinian evolution outright.I have no quarrel with her criticisms of the inaccuracies, inconsistencies, logical fallacies and contradictions which can be found within the Holy Bible.  Similar attacks on the Bible may be found in Religulous, FROM PASTOR TO ATHEIST: A Non-god Way of Life and Hope after Faith: An Ex-Pastor's Journey from Belief to Atheism (as well as myriad other books & DVDs).Houston attacks the Conservative movement, claiming that it perpetuates intolerance, misogyny, elitism, tax breaks for the rich / big corporations, pollution, theocracy  and (last but not least)  pseudo-science.  On all of these points, I wholly concur.  I cringe at the notion of the utopia dreamed of by little minds such as Mitt Romney & Paul Ryan, where 1% of the population possesses 99% of society's wealth, property & assets.  I am also SO sick of the much-repeated mantra of the Republican Party: ""If ONLY we could screw the poor a little more than we have, and coddle the rich a little more than we have, then everything else will work itself out!""The problem with the author's chapters in which she goes after the injustices & hypocrisy of the Right wingers lies not with her polemics.  Rather, the problem I had was finding a nexus between her arguments as justification for the existence of a Creator.  In my mind, she resembled a trapeze artist who was hurling from one suspended bar to another 50 feet in the air.The biggest issue with this book, however, is her critique of Darwinian evolution.  She states that there is no evidence for macroevolution.  I would not concur with this.  There appears to be quite a bit of evidence that birds descended from dinosaurs.  It's also a fact that paleontology has only been a serious discipline for the past 200yrs or so.  We've learned quite a bit about our past during that time.  That we don't know EVERYTHING should not be construed as evidence of a Creator.Beyond that, there are contradictions on the impetus of life that the author has put forth.  On page 274, she writes: ""God is good in being consistent;  God is consistent because he is good.  Therefore, miracles, in the sense of transgressions of natural law are preposterous (i.e.:  impossible).""OK, fine.  However, on page 289 she writes:  ""The Creator not only creates;  the Creator perpetually creates, meaning perpetually creates newness.  Addition is creation itself.""Well, which is it?  For her paradigm to ""work,"" it would seem to be that the latter must be the case.  Per Houston, she has no problem with the biological ""explosion"" of the Cambrian Period.  However, per her paradigm, there does not exist a nexus between the Cambrian Period & the 1st humans (who came much later).  That means that God ""created"" the pre-Cambrian organisms, then ""created"" the organisms of the Cambrian period, then ""created"" the dinosaurs and eventually ""created"" humans sometime > the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs hit the Yucatan peninsula.  For myself, I find such assertions dogmatic & very messy (to say the least).  And, as the impetus for life must lie in the supernatural realm (in Houston's view), then the Creator most certainly DID transgress the laws of physics each time He / She let new creatures escape from his cosmic laboratory.On the other hand, if you ask a scientist where the laws of physics came from, he would point back to the Planck epoch, which is 10^(-43) seconds > the Big Bang (or call it what you will).  It was in this instant that the laws of physics & chemistry (as we know & love them) came into being.  After all, astronomers believe Max Planck created the universe (that was a joke!).  Seriously:  if you were to ask a cosmologist ""Gee, what came before the Planck epoch, exactly?"" then the answer rendered by any astute cosmologist would be as follows:  ""I dunno.""  One can project a Creator beyond the Planck epoch if one wants to.  However, there's precisely as much evidence for a Creator as there is for a pink polka-dotted unicorn.Here we see the dichotomy between Creationists (be they fundamentalists, Deists or whatever) and scientists.  For Creationists, there always must be something that happened outside the realm of the laws of physics for us to be here.  For the scientist, a lot of highly improbable things happened since the Planck epoch which led to our being here (collectively called the ""Anthropic Principle"" as coined by Brandon Carter).Houston invokes the ""big numbers"" argument to argue in favor of the former.  While I used to buy into such arguments, I no longer do.  Here is a thought experiment to understand why my view has changed.Let's say that I were to get in my vehicle & drive from my home state of Michigan to the great state of Texas.  Somewhere in Oklahoma, I run into a rainstorm.  Now, so far, this story is unremarkable.  It's hardly the stuff you would see as a ""headline story"" on CNN, and ONLY those people who believe that everything is a miracle would describe my encounter with a storm as a miracle.Now, think of this.  Pick a random raindrop that collides with my windshield.  After the fact, let's work out the odds of that INDIVIDUAL raindrop dropping at JUST the right time to hit my windshield.  The odds would be astronomical.  Now, let's measure the odds of my hitting another random raindrop  a few miles later.  Now, let's calculate the odds of BOTH of those raindrops falling on my windshield.  Then, let's say there is a delay because of an accident that lasts 30 minutes.  After starting back up, we calculate the odds of a 3rd random raindrop hitting my windshield 13 minutes & 32 seconds later.  What are the odds that I would leave MI & collide will all three of these random raindrops in OK?  We must be up to one in a quadrillion by now!  And so on.The upshot is this:  our beloved earth has been around for 4 & 1/2 billion yrs.  Stuff happens.  Our universe has been around for nearly 14 billion yrs.  Stuff happens, even highly improbable stuff.  Of course, the Creationist is free to counter that it's simply impossible for me to encounter a rainstorm in Oklahoma ~ that would take care of all of the details in one swoop.This is a thoughtful book, to be sure, but it fell short of converting me to being a Deist.  Even if Houston is right and this mysterious / Deistic Creator exists, then what we're left with is something that resembles the ""Prime Mover"" of Aristotle or the God of Einstein.  That is to say, an impersonal deity that started the universe & got things rolling......but has been surfing in Tahiti ever since then.  For all I know, the entity exists & is the cause of all things......but I doubt it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZ9II4O8CFRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971919097#wasThisHelpful","RAZ9II4O8CFRH","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pair of docu-dramas which re-enact two stellar incidents in the history of Rome.  Coincidentally, both occurred during the reign of Titus (son of Vespasian).The first depicts the final day of the doomed city of Pompeii.  Using archeological data as well as the writings of Pliny the younger,  the makers of the DVD walk us through the individual lives of some of the denizens of the city who perished on that fateful day.  To be sure, some conjecture is involved, but the conjecture is based upon the best-available evidence.  Historical figures who are otherwise long-since-forgotten are brought back to life to ""tell"" us about their last day on the planet (nearly 2,000 yrs in the past).The second docu-drama recounts the inaugural games of the Flavian Ampitheater (nicknamed the Colosseum as it was built on the spot where there was a statue from Nero's Golden House < the Romans razed it).  We get an inside glimpse into the construction of the massive structure as well as the very 1st combatants to perform there from the memoirs of a gladiator who was involved in the building project and was also a man who fought on that first day.  He earned his freedom that day, symbolized by a wooden sword (known as a Rudis) that he received from the emperor Titus.There are also historical accounts from Roman historians who were there.  As the viewer will see, not everything went according to plans that day!This is a must-see DVD for people who have an interest in the life & times of average Romans during the days of Pax Romana.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XP30HOF259TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006OBPZY#wasThisHelpful","R1XP30HOF259TP","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sophia is a lawyer from Rio de Janeiro who is residing in London while on  extended business.  She is a beautiful brunette, captivating, mysterious, strong-willed, intelligent, alluring and (above all else) a survivor.  She is an advocate for abused women & children and she lives a life that's not exactly bereft of danger.While in England, her life weaves in & out of the lives of two men:  Ethan & Alistair.  Both men are nearly clones.  They're both handsome, well dressed,  ultra wealthy, neurotic, domineering, controling, prone to jealousy and used to buying whatever it is in life that they want ~ including companionship.The book is overflowing with references to fine wines, fancy cars, high fashion clothing, ornate jewelry, expensive watches and 5 star accommodations.  The incessant references to the above will leave a lot of readers with a sense of awe and saying to themselves ""ooooh"" and ""aaaaah.""  That is fine, and it's certainly what was intended.For myself, however, I found the litany of ritzy things to get annoying after awhile.  It seemed to me that the characters in the story were incapable of appreciating the simple things in life, like a sunset over a body of water.  Unless something cost a zillion $$, in their eyes it was useless.  Other readers will be apt to get a different impression, but for me the characters seemed to care for little else beyond $$.Sophia is certainly the most relatable in the book, and the love she has for her daughter is touching.  For me, the best scenes in the entire novel were the interactions between Sophia & her offspring.  During these episodes, I thought to myself ""Finally, something human that is not dependent on wealth & capital!""The biggest downside to the book, in my mind, was the characterizations of Ethan & Alistair.  I found both to be unremarkable little boys trapped in the bodies of grown men.  They both reminded me of Mitt Romney:  arrogant, uber rich, pretentious, misanthropic and without so much as a clue about what this thing called being alive is all about.The demographics who will find this book appealing would be of the following 3 camps:1:  People who enjoy Romance novels that have uninhibited sex scenes2:  People who are infatuated with what goes on in high society circles3:  People who are interested in the BDSM lifestyleFor people such as myself, this story is simply too highbrow & hoity toity to be enjoyable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305KV2IE37KZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480236292#wasThisHelpful","R305KV2IE37KZH","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up in a conservative home, I was always taught that sex / erotica were things that men alone liked.  We were not supposed to like them, but we did anyway.  Women disliked them.  Everything was all about suppressing my inhibitions & desires to have some naughty fun.Thankfully, as a (nowadays) very liberal adult male, it's good to see that these precepts have by & large been napalmed in the 21st century.  The present book is a refreshing taste of feminine erotica which erases these false ""rules"" entirely.Elizabeth Woodham has written a scintillating set of short stories for eros minded men & women.  My favorite one was the story about the candy store;  it makes sex & chocolate go together as naturally as peanut butter & jelly!  The author has a creative writing style with myriad original erotic images & metaphors.  Some of the passages are downright poet.  {This latter point is only fitting, given that she is from the land of poets: England}My least favorite story was the one about Tarot card reading.  This has less to do with the sexual parts of the tale than it has to do with the fact that astrology is a major intellectual turn-off for me as I've never given a 2nd thought as to the veracity of fortune tellers.All in all, for people who have a real zest for life, this is a book that will be found to have something to offer almost everyone in the aforesaid demographic.  To lust, to life and to feminine erotica!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HI9MMTZWOJLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQOP4PE#wasThisHelpful","R3HI9MMTZWOJLE","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NORTH & SOUTH is, arguably, one of the finest made-for-TV miniseries ever made.  Its scope is exceptional & it is divided into 3 sections.  Book I is about the antebellum south & the industrial north in the final decades that lead up to the civil war.  Book II details the war itself, from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender of the south @ Appomattox courthouse.  Book III centers around the postwar reconstruction of the ravaged south.Book IThe story begins in 1842, when a southerner named Orry Main (portrayed by the late Patrick Swayze) and a Yankee named George Hazard (James Read) become fast friends @ West Point.  While their views on slavery are different, they maintain a tight bond and serve together in battle during the war against Mexico. Most importantly, both men are likable and they're men who possess integrity & honor.  The final scene of Book I is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever viewed.  Orry travels south from Pennsylvania to serve with the confederacy, leaving his friend George behind.  His journey is symbolic as well as literal.The cast of the production is impeccable, and it was my 1st introduction to a young Patrick Swayze.  I still recall my initial reaction to him back in the mid-80s:  ""Wow, a guy who looks like he just stepped out of the pages of GQ who has charisma & bona-fide acting skills!""  In watching N & S via the box set, it didn't take me long to recall to mind why I had a huge crush on Genie Francis way-back-when.  She epitomizes the sweet southern belle.  It appears Jonathan Frakes & I share the same taste in women as he ended up marrying her after meeting her on the set of N & S!The soundtrack, courtesy of Bill Conti, is top notch & memorable.  The wardrobe is elaborate & elegant, as it should be for a story such as this.  The actresses get to show off the ostentatious dresses that American women wore in the 19th century.  Obviously pragmatism wasn't on the minds of women back then!Book IIThe second book covers the civil war itself.  Remarkably, the Hazard & Main families remain woven together even in the midst of the war.  Aside from the thrust of the story, we observe unfortunate issues which plague this country in conflicts as recent as the wars in Afghanistan & Iraq:  soldiers who suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome, the horrific wounds suffered in battle, conterfeit parts being sent to the war machine, and good old-fashioned war profiteering.  No matter how much the technology & mechanisms of war change, these things always tend to stay the same.On the upside, it is heartwarming to see how Orry & George both married women who mirror each other.  Their wives are both kind hearted, beautiful and good Samaritan types.  They are similar in spirit just as Orry & George are similar in how they're both men of noble character.Book IIIUnfortunately, I found Book III to be rather half-baked.  For starters, it disinters some holes in the plot as opposed to being a continuation of Book II.  Also, there were some cast changes between Book I & Book II and they were seamless.  In fact, plugging in Parker Stevenson as Billy Hazard was a genuine upgrade!  As for the cast changes in Book III, these were (in my opinion) a significant downgrade.Most importantly, the storyline of Book III meanders a bit & paints with too wide a brush.  In fact, one could call Book III ""East & West"" as it delves into postwar issues such as pioneers / western expansion and the Indian wars.  To be sure, these were pivotal topics in this country's history, but it's for that reason that they deserve to have their own movies & books made/written about them.Nevertheless, the aspects of Part III which did detail the south were on the $$.  Part III portrayed how white southerners tried to keep black people in bondage (even though they were no longer slaves) as well as the latter's attempts to break out of lives of servitude.  It also focuses on the rise of the abysmal intolerant cult known as the Ku Klux Klan.All in all, this box set is a can't miss for civil war enthusiasts.  For persons who have even a passing curiosity about the history of this country, N & S is highly recommended.  The war-between-the-states was the single darkest chapter in the history of the United States.  It was also perhaps the single most important chapter;  its effects are still being felt to the present day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CFZXTAWI13Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EXWGIS#wasThisHelpful","R39CFZXTAWI13Z","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Savannah Grace is a lovely young Canadian lass who pieced together Sihpromatum from the journals of her travels to Hong Kong, China & Mongolia.  Her journey was something that ""just happened"" when her mother had the outlandish idea of traveling the world.  And, with that, mom, Savannah, her sister Bree & her brother Ammon hopped on an airplane to Hong Kong to begin their odyssey.Having been to Hong Kong & China myself while I was in the Navy, this book was of particular interest to me.  I got to see a great deal of Hong Kong over several visits, but only saw the interior of Shanghai when it came to mainland China.  Savannah & company went all through the country & saw a great deal more of Chinese locales & culture than I had a chance to see.  Still, her observations of just how many modern day conveniences that are missing in China (conveniences that we westerners take for granted) caused me to reminisce about my brief sojourn in Shanghai.One thing that this book is NOT would be a story of a relative of, say, Mitt Romney or Paris Hilton.  I would imagine such a book being a shallow comparison of the amenities & buffet tables of 5 Star hotels across the globe.  Readers who seek a book such as that may as well look elsewhere as that's not what this book is about.Rather, to say that the family ""roughs"" it would be quite an understatement.  What is fascinating is that the family is run-of-the-mill Middle Class in stature;  they are no where near wealthy.  They frequently live on just a couple of bucks a day & their location (which changes daily) dictates where they eat & sleep.  As such, the book is filled with both adventures & misadventures, including the family being stranded out in the middle of the Gobi desert ~ one of the most desolate places on the planet.Due to the fact that the family is unafraid of getting ""down & dirty,"" the reader is given an unvarnished look at the locales, landscapes & denizens of China & Mongolia.  To that end, if there were ever such a thing as a teenage girl version of the historian Herodotus, this book would exemplify it in the incarnation of the author.  The awe & wonder in which Savannah details to us the Great Wall of China, various Buddist monastaries and the austere beauty of Mongolia brings to mind the way Herodotus marveled @ the Great Pyramids in The Histories, Revised (Penguin Classics).So, if you're looking for a sincere book centered on an unexpected detour that a young woman & her family  chose to undertake, then this is a book that is well worth reading.  It is gritty, charming & downright comical in places.  So, give this book a read & fall under Savannah's spell!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4FWBV9HWGEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1479236659#wasThisHelpful","R1V4FWBV9HWGEK","A35YWA2V4QHOJ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay...I know the rules, authors shouldn't review other authors, but seriously...I read waaaay more than I write. Sometimes, you just have to. In this case, I've been a rabid fan of the Violet series since the first volume. I like this character so much I named a character in my books after her, so yeah, huge fan.And here we are, at the end of the series. I confess, my greedy hands were itching for this to come out, but at the same time, I dreaded it because I knew it was going to be the end of the series. I just couldn't bear not having more of it. Still, as soon as that pretty golden fingerprint showed up on my Kindle, I was all over it.What a satisfying and truly emotional conclusion! I can't say much because it would be total spoiler territory and I don't want the author to hate me, but the way it ended was really the only proper way for it to end. This volume opens up into incredible character dialog and action. They are genuine and totally alive on the page. Absolutely beautiful.And I very much enjoyed the development of the two characters we were introduced to in the previous volume into fully realized and vibrant members of Team Violet.

"I got this because I've got a big book event coming up and I needed to make 750 magnet cards for the book to go into bags. Pricing all over the net, this lot was the best deal. Not just in price, but also in shipping. Magnets are heavy! I got them right one time, but the box was a little worse for wear and ripped up. That's not entirely unexpected given that it looks relatively small yet it horrendously heavy. Heavy is a good thing when it comes to magents for cards.Like others have said on other lots, putting your cards on the magnet takes practice to get right, but once you do, working with these was a breeze. They came on sheets that snapped apart easily and with smooth edges, and the backing paper came right off. The magnets are the good, thick kind and the adhesive is super strong.Out of the lot, I did have a couple of sheets that seemed to be cut slightly wrong, making one side of the sheet (and three cards on those) slightly smaller.But out of two thousand cards, that's not bad at all.

"Don't believe all the hype. Like every other ""new/old"" thing out there that is rediscovered to be the best thing ever, argan oil has been purported to be able to do many miraculous things. I don't believe that and didn't base my purchase on that type of hype. What I did buy it for is for what it is supposed to do..and for that, this particular brand is absolute tops!Argan oil, which is simply the oil of the nut of the argan tree, is a lot like olive oil in many ways and the less high quality argan oils are more like olive oil than the higher quality ones. Where the differences are at between a good high quality argan and a lesser argan is in the very things that make argan superior to olive for the skin and hair.Cold pressed organic oil like this has a more delicate scent, greater absorbability, is a little thinner and works for a whole lot longer. If you've had an experience with argan oil where you looked at yourself and thought you would have done better to just rub cooking oil on yourself then you likely got some that was heated when pressed or came from inferior fruits.This particular Argan oil is just that...pure Argan oil with nothing in it. No fragrance. No additives. Nada. So it has a light, slightly nutty smell that I find heavenly.Where this oil really shows its benefits is in aging skin or very dry skin. It takes about 6 drops to moisturize my entire lower leg. Face...2 drops. Hair treatment..2 drops. Whole body, about 1 dropper full. It soaks in very fast and leaves a very slight sheen on the skin that isn't an oily one, but rather a glowy one. It lasts beyond a day. Even after a day, including showering, you can skip it if you're in a hurry and not get dry skin.I use it every day on my legs and arms. Every few days I do the whole body. Once a week I use it on my face after a facial and in my hair once a week to keep it sleek. If you're a teen with unruly skin prone to acne and oily hair then I would test it first to be sure it is okay with your skin and hair. For everyone else, it is a delight and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3FLGMKKG8DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADNUBKI#wasThisHelpful","R2T3FLGMKKG8DZ","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm in my mid 40s...okay, 46...and I've been stepping up my game so I don't look it. This means a bit more maintenance but also making smarter choices on how the skin is treated. It needs things but it starts to need different things as it ages in order to look good and keep that glow.My travels took me to Turkey where I experienced real Turkish baths. It was awesome, yes, but it's also a bit strange for a westerner. The two little pot bellied men that did the washing...yes, men...in one of the baths used a glove like this and the weirdest thing happened. Your skin just comes off. At first I freaked but they said it was okay. The ladies used Moroccan soap on us first and then afterward, other ladies rubbed us down with argan oil.I was still a little bit weirded out by the time I left after the first Turkish bath but then I saw my skin when I went outside. It was glowing and soft and like a brand new baby except shinier. Amazing. I went to more of them but never had that same level of exfoliation because it was just maintaining it rather than starting from scratch.It turns out that this glove does a type of exfoliation we just don't do often in the west and that was all the semi-detached and dying skin cells still stuck to other live skin. Gross.Anyway, in my quest to recreate that skin, I've gone through a bunch of products and several less than satisfactory gloves. This is the best glove of them all. Hands down.For best results use ELMA&SANA® Moroccan Black Soap eucalyptus-9oz(250gr) this before hand and let your skin steam in the shower so it will release easier when you use the glove. Afterwards, use ELMA&SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml) to add more glow and give the skin something good to drink in. The instructions are included. Follow it and you'll should have remarkable results.Caveat: If you are a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good. It means you were doing a good job even before. You'll still see some though. You're not gross. It's supposed to happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1424EAWZIWWEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VSN3ME#wasThisHelpful","R1424EAWZIWWEL","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately I've been taking greater care of my skin. I'm 46 and don't look it and don't intend to, so that means more maintenance. During my travels I went to Turkey and there had real Turkish baths. Out of all the things I did there the glow and softness of my skin after those is the thing I remember most, so I decided to figure out how that happened and begin replicating it if possible. And no, I do not work for these people nor have I received anything for this review. I just really like their stuff.So, my search began.In the end, I did find exactly the right things to do it and it does, in fact, still make the skin glow like I rolled in shimmer powder and soft like the proverbial baby bottom. One key element is true Moroccan black soap. And this is the real thing.For best possible results, combine using this with Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt, or with a similar product. Then finish it off with ELMA&SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml) or another argan oil of your choice.But what is this Moroccan soap stuff, you might ask? The bottom line is that it is a combination of olive oils and solid olive pastes combined in a special way to create a cleansing and moisturing hard gel. Most include essential oils of one sort or another to create their own signature scent or whatnot, but mostly what you want is one with minimal additives. This version has a light helping of Eucalyptus Oil in it, which is very nice and complements the naturally nutty smell of it.To use this, you need only a smidgeon. I take a blob about the size of a coin and then divide it in half and press one half into each palm and then rub it in. That is enough for a whole body if you're body is fairly regular sized. Turn the shower off while you do that and let it soak in while you condition your hair or something.Rinse it off and then use the glove to exfoliate, rinse and get out. While you're skin is still warm, rub in argan oil and you're done. It works and it works well.I don't necessarily recommend this for teens who still have unruly skin that secretes too much oil unless they are cautious and test it first. It is an oil based soap and while it moisturizes well, I can't attest to what it will do to very oily or acne prone skin.For anyone outside that, very highly recommended for moisturizing, cleansing and overall experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TH3O8QXSF08U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AO5D0E#wasThisHelpful","R1TH3O8QXSF08U","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this and another product, Fake Bake Fair Lotion, 6-Ounce, intending to try both and see which one worked best but I liked the Nature's Gate so well I've put off trying the other one.I have fair...as in so white it is like a dead fish belly...skin. I only need this for my legs so I can wear skirts and shorts without being scary. I have the naturally fair undertones of pink and blue. I *can* tan, but after spending the 80s as brown as a walnut, I do try to avoid naturally tanning now.This lotion isn't meant to make you brown, only to add some natural looking sun inspired color. If you are looking for more than that, then you'll be best served with one of the more aggressive products.This looks just like regular lotion in the bottle and smells like a pretty standard lotion too. You simply rub it in like regular lotion and then wait until it is fully soaked in. Dress like normal and within 24 hours you'll see a hint of color.In reality, you'll want to put regular lotion on your hands first so the skin on your hands won't soak up this lotion. Then when you put on the Glow lotion, be more careful than you otherwise would to get a pretty even coat but go lightly over the knees and ankles, since those areas tend to soak up more lotion in general and therefore, will get darker. Then sit around for about 20 minutes just to be sure you're all absorbed and dress. I like to do this after work so I can just wear my loungewear and not risk nice clothing, though I have seen no proof that it comes off on clothes at all.Right after application, wash your hands vigorously and thoroughly and use a washcloth or something rough.As to results, I noticed a light tan by the next morning after first usage. That's about 16 hours of time. I used it again that night and it was darker the next day. I did that again for 2 more days and on the 5th day I woke to the dreaded color ORANGE.That wore off after a couple of days and I was back to glow.The lesson is that you won't need to use this for many days to get the max it will give to a very fair skinned person. More after that point is not better.Trial and error has shown me that I need to apply it every third day after I reach peak in order to mostly maintain the color. After a couple of weeks I'll go two days in a row to get the color back up to peak, and then back to every third day.Given how fast it works, this bottle will last a long time.Highly recommended for people who will not naturally tan, either because they want to preserve their skin or because they burn and who embrace their fairness but want enough color to blend in with the world. Not recommended for people with very yellow undertones in their skin because they will likely turn orange faster. Not recommended for people who are super fair but want to get a fake dark tan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M32XRX5JV2CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GLJ6PA#wasThisHelpful","R3M32XRX5JV2CF","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past 20 years or more, I've been getting my hands moisturized and when dunked in hot wax to make it absorb more. It's a great way to overcome the many damaging things we do to the skin of our hands. BUT, over the last few years I've become increasingly sensitive to the wax and now I really can't use it at all. Not to mention that it isn't very environmentally friendly to just keep tossing wads of petroleum derived wax in the trash every week.Mitts were recommended to me and I spent a good amount of time researching them. They have some that are more meant for longer heat therapy, such as with arthritis, but I wanted something that I could keep very clean since I would be using it with lotion.I selected these and they did arrive quickly and well packed. There was no instruction packet with it, which I found odd, but they are pretty self explanatory. There are three heat settings as well as an off setting and that is pretty much it.The lowest setting was more than enough for me. I just globbed on a bunch of lotion, put my hands in baggies and then stuck them in the mitts for 15 minutes. When I'm done I rub in the remaining lotion or wipe it off and voila, very soft and smooth hands.The mitts are NOT big enough to do most feet, but they weren't meant to, I don't think. Those are usually foot shaped. If I could ask for anything, it would be that the pockets were large enough for that.Highly recommended as a better, and far less messy, replacement for the hot wax moisturing treatment for hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLE6OFWQ9RD10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BY2RJ0#wasThisHelpful","RLE6OFWQ9RD10","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my review for this authors other book, Retro Makeup: Techniques for Applying the Vintage Look, I went into some detail as to why I went this direction as a 46 year old woman. Unlike many faithful retro-lovers, I wasn't looking to duplicate styles. Instead I wanted to try to find a new look for myself that didn't just include trying to look unobtrusive in order to disguise flegling lines or other effects of aging.One's hair helps define their face. Bottom line. You can put on a perfectly neat Mad Men face, but if your hair doesn't reflect that intention, you'll just look strange. So, for me, this book was a necessity.I read it cover to cover and discovered a great many things about hair that I simply didn't know before. Things that make you say, Huh. I also discovered that my astonishing array of expensive hair goos were entirely wrong. And finally, I discovered that these styles are surprisingly easy to pull off, even for a total amateur, if you have patience.Since I wasn't looking for a completely authentic retro style but rather an impression or accent to a specific clean look, I needed to combine some styles and enhance or dampen some elements to fit in and look good without being obvious. Again, just one practice session and I had a winner.The results of this hair and makeup were surprising and involved many enounters while shopping that were pleasant or embarrassing or both. I loved it.The book is organized so that it isn't just a linear progression of a style and then how to do it, it gives opening chapters that show the tools and how to use them in the context of the book. It also gives a good illustration of things like a basic set and what it means to be on or off angle, etc. Super informative while entertaining. Again, just from a brief reading I was able to pull off one of the more complicated styles with minimal tools (though you will need the right ones) and a bit of patience.Highly recommended for any age. Very customizable for those trying to define or redefine their own personal style. Also nice for anyone who wants to really go authentically retro and look perfectly done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8YGXEN6IMO93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981663915#wasThisHelpful","R8YGXEN6IMO93","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm no spring chicken. The freedom to be retro passed me by when my age might have made it more appropriate, but there were no internet sellers of ""anything and everything"" in the 80s. Full disclosure: I'm 46.But I'm not dead yet! And for those in their 40s or whatever age that might be in the same boat I was, read on.At some point in life you start to fix your hair and face in the morning with a sort of resigned outlook. For me, it was doing things as unobtrusively as possible so that age wasn't enhanced. But doing it to actually look worthy of a second look, well, that was in the past, I figured. I had my day in the sun, so to speak. But I wasn't at all happy with it. I decided to start exploring my options and find what might work for me.Enter this book and the hair book (Vintage Hairstyling: Retro Styles with Step-by-Step Techniques)by the same author as well as a few well respected retro clothing lines. I've always liked the retro look but it is often used with a heavy hand that simply wouldn't look right on a woman in her mid-40s. At the same time, watch any old movie and note how elegant a woman in her 40s can appear...sometimes even better than the younger ones. Somehow I needed to find that middle ground.I got this book and the matching hair one and read it cover to cover. I went through my make up cabinet (and who doesn't have buckets of the stuff) and tossed out things that didn't make the grade and went shopping.With a little trial and error and just two practice runs, I was able to come up with a face I couldn't believe was me. And it didn't look like I walked out of the past or didn't belong in my skin or anything.This book does go into great and pictoral detail on how to get the faces of many eras and styles, yes. But it also shows you the hows and whys and ""what fors"" of doing things certain ways. That gives the reader remarkable freedom to customize for exactly the right look for their age and personal style.I loved this book so much that I bought another copy of it and the hair book to give as a gift to someone else. That alone should tell you how high my recommendation is for this book.Now, to the results. What happened that makes me so sure this worked? I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed a lot of attention in my youth but that tapered away as time went on and I had simply forgotten what that was like. I got reminded.My first test in public, while shopping, resulted in some surprising and occasionally embarrassing encounters. The woman who said, much too loudly, from another line that I was so pretty and asked what ethnicity I was was a little embarassing but the random males who kept wanting to lift things for me was nice, if strange.Am I saying that this book will magically make you attract random strangers who will want to lift your gallons of milk for you? No, but it does happen. If you have a pretty good base in your features and are willing to take the time, you can remake yourself so that all that you have that is good is shown to best effect and in a way that speaks ""classic"" beauty.For women like me who have reached that point where they aren't quite sure what to do with their faces now that they've reached that in between time where they aren't old but have to be careful of fledgling lines and make-up, then this is an excellent tool. Combine with the hair book and you'll have a whole new look to rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7J0WZRZT8NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981663923#wasThisHelpful","RN7J0WZRZT8NV","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book. It was one of those suggestions that scroll across when you buy something related in your kindle and I didn't read the reviews first. I should have then I wouldn't be struggling to write this review. And I am struggling here because I love Indie fiction and don't want to dampen anyone's fire to write but I really do feel like this is a bad book.Another review expressed some of what I found at length but I also found those significant flaws to be show stoppers and I have to express my own views.Facts are Facts: In fiction the world can be played with in creative ways but there are Rubicons that shouldn't be crossed except in very special circumstances.-In genetics, (and I hit another author on this pretty hard so it is a problem other Indie authors share), there are rules and the rules are almost immutable. If you tweak X you will get Y...you will not get Z, A, B or D. You will always get Y when you tweak X and only X. If you remove something, there will be consequences. Extras are not good. And so on and so forth. Too many people who are potential readers are well versed in genetics nowadays to try to pull fast ones with the 'knowns' of the science.-Antibiotics don't cause inherited immune system flatlining. Period. While I understand what the author was perhaps trying to say, the way she expressed it was contrary to science. It is common for people to say things that imply our use of antibacterials and antibiotics are making us weak, that isn't quite the same as saying people are being born without immune systems from one too many Z-Pacs being prescribed to their parents. A little research is needed before writing.-Leaders are not defined by a single rung on the ladder that is our DNA. Even if the tendency toward behavior associated with leadership potential could be ever linked to any DNA, it would probably be a cluster and it would be a tendency and not an ID card defining the person. Most often, great leaders have offspring which are troubled and far less talented in the leadership arena. If it were genetic, then version 2.0 should inherit it at least 50% of the time. And defining a cluster that does anything is very, very difficult because of the quadrillions of possible combinations that can be made if our entire DNA strand is taken into account.-Exposure as a way to build immunity via heridity? Listen, if they can find and do all that they are purported to be doing with DNA then they can tell who has an immune system or not at birth rather than wasting resources for 8 years and then letting them suffer in absolute agony getting disease after disease. That's just stupid.Aside from the fact problem, there is the writing style. It is simplistic to the point of madness and makes many of the characters seem like they are reading description cards from some text based game from the 1980s. The characters are also not consistent within themselves, becoming something different at the drop of the hat. I actually thought perhaps the author had mixed up the personalities of Neklema and Kim for a bit it was so drastic.And let's not forget the logic. There is none. The motivations for the various actions make no sense no matter how much suspension of disbelief the reader engages in. It's just wasteful and stupid and no one would do it. Why on earth would anyone invest like whole groups of people did in terms of time, resources and their own lives when they knew it was stupid to do so, had no purpose and wasn't a cause they believed in. They wouldn't.I hate giving bad reviews. I really, truly do. But the author in this case simply needs to pull the book entirely. Pull it, do a good bit of research and then re-write it. There are core elements that can be re-used in a new version.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2R3FSL7OBSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BECGAAC#wasThisHelpful","R2D2R3FSL7OBSK","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I review the story I must address the editing remarked on in other reviews. Perhaps the author has already done some of it and reloaded the edited version because I didn't see the same error rate that some others reported. What it does look like is that there was some discontinuity in the format from the original to the Kindle processing. It took away a half star from my review.Hickory is our main character and is just a youngster really. He goes to school, hangs out with his friends and such a person is of limited interest to us adult readers as a general rule. So what made Hickory such fun to read? His world and the way he lives in it, of course!In the world Hickory lives in, a long distant future version of our own, things are not at all what most of us hope the future world of our descendants will be like. Instead of glittering cities in the sky with a perfect natural world below (or whatever we might wish for) the world is a primitive place, devoid of technology and actively seeking *not* to learn what we once took for granted. The only link they really have from the city of Porta to the long past is a single half burned journal written by a man who angrily blamed technology for the straits he found himself in at the end of the world.Awesome.Hickory, however, is just like his father in some ways. Intensely curious, not nearly respectful enough of the rules against digging for the past and with a thirst to connect with the world around him no matter how strange. This can only lead to trouble...or maybe just change...or maybe troubling changes. Actually, it is all three.I really enjoyed this book and was entranced by the world the author constructed so painstakingly for us. In some ways it reminded me of the first Harry Potter books, before each volume became a way to churn out another 50 million bucks, when it was a charming tale full of dark and light elements and almost like a long tale spun for the longest bedtime story in history. It has that same flavor, so to speak, and that same knack for inserting surprising new elements that pop up and tweak the story just so.I'm loathe to delve too deeply in many of the elements I liked best because it gives away some of those tweaks and it would diminish the pleasure of future readers. So I'll touch on those elements lightly. Mystical elements do appear in the story such as ghosts, even more in the next book, but not in a way that I could entirely be sure were mystical. Technology advanced enough from a viewer's perspective is often labeled magic and I wasn't sure we weren't being led down this road. I won't reveal that, but I will say that the ghost added a wonderful element to the story that is only enhanced further in the next book and leads to some interesting revelations.Hickory and his interactions with those around him are not quite those of a typical younger teen so we adults reading it aren't completely alienated but we are at times somewhat distant from the adult actions that might be more approachable to us. It is a refreshing point of view however and will bring more than one smile to parents of teens while reading.I've read the follow on and yes, while I do think it is not perfectly edited, it is a great story and well worth the reading. It's got huge potential as far as the world building and characters go and I hope the author will continue the series and expand it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19114JDQF9XMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XN4OXO#wasThisHelpful","R19114JDQF9XMY","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If one threw an infinity of slips of paper, each slip with one interesting concept to write about on it and then picked out a few and decided to write about those random picks, I doubt they could have come up with a more unlikely set of circumstances than this one. That said, this combo works together in such a way that I simply couldn't stop reading until the very end and I wanted more. Lucky for me the sequels were out already so I could have more.Chris and Livvy are new partners in a special detective squad that investigates with a free hand the crimes associated with neural enhancement and artificially increased longevity. Chris is an old hand at this, having spent 75 years in the business using his own legally enhanced longevity to stay young. Livvy, a fresh faced newbie to the team with extralegal enhancements and more than a half century of life under her belt, isn't the partner he would have chosen for himself. Add a dog with a few neural tweaks of his own and you have a fascinating crime fighting trio.The story revolves around the particular problems of having a legal system that governs the use of enhancing longevity. There are rules and the rules are both unbendable and entirely necessary. But when the laws put limits on what could easily provide true immortality, there will be lawbreakers. This is what Chris, Livvy and now Louie, fight each day. In this case, the crime is particularly heinous and the stakes high.This story is a non-stop ride yet it does it without skipping the depth it needs or by glossing over the details of this world the author created. It is simply well done and it resonates with the reader in two ways: as a reader rooting for the protagonist and as a reader who might be equally tempted by the chance at immortality. It's a nice balance and thoroughly enjoyable.Oh, and Louie the dog is totally adorably written. I love a well crafted canine character.Recommended for those who like general science fiction, near future dystopic/utopic fiction or fast paced adventure mysteries with a twist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJ5VD0WY3N1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077SJ8A6#wasThisHelpful","R2MJ5VD0WY3N1W","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeing the end of the Wooliverse looming from the point of Hugh Howey's pen (or keyboard), I did what most of the other fans from the beginning have done: seek more! Initially leery of fanfic because it can butcher the original world, I have been absolutely astounded at the amazing quality of the work available. Greatfall is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of those offerings to date. I'm hooked and I like it.Greatfall is the first part of the story of a Silo gone by the wayside. One of the mysterious dark Silo's, it is assumed to be dead. It's a valid assumption but eventually the powers that remain decide to send someone to verify it and find what they can find. After all, knowing why a Silo goes dark might help them avoid the same happening to another Silo.Enter Silo 23. It isn't dark meaning an absence of light. It is Dark as in deeply disturbed. I don't want to give spoilers because the story absolutely deserves to unroll as the author intended without me giving you all the punchline. That said, one has to say something, right? In this case, it is a given that there is no story if the Silo is dead so you know it's not. It's also a given that whatever and whoever remains in the Silo has been disconnected from that which gave it structure and kept it on a course for generations. What kind of culture might arise from the ashes of the twisted world without sunlight that is the Silo? You get to find out in this story.Isaac, a touching character who is drawn deeply into the doings of adults very suddenly and without expecting to, is the primary character. He undergoes a right of passage like every other child his age but never expects to survive it, as many before him have not. At best, he expects to live a life of no particular renown if he does survive. But Silo 23 may have something else entirely in mind for him and his journey is one any Wool/Shift fan will want to ride along on.Highly recommended for any fan of the Wool/Shift series by Hugh Howey. Not really recommended for those who aren't familiar with it because the basic premises in the book won't make sense. If that is you, then immediately search for ""Wool"" and put this one on your wishlist. Believe me, you'll want it later.Oh, and to the author, HURRY UP and WRITE!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPUBI1UZJX9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7CPDGA#wasThisHelpful","R3UPUBI1UZJX9Y","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fan of Hugh Howey and an early reader of the magic that is the Wool Universe (yes, I do have a T-shirt!), I was a little hesitant to delve into the fan fiction that began cropping up for fear of it skewing the near perfect world as yet created by the original author. But with the end coming soon in the Hugh Howey offerings, I decided to give it a go. So far, I certainly haven't regretted it and this is a fine addition to the Wooliverse.Karma, as she is known now, isn't really named Karma at all. But then again, we know from Hugh's books that things certainly are never what they seem in the worlds of Silo. Karma finds herself pregnant and then remembering, much like another pivotal character in Hugh's work starts to remember. Of course there are consequences to remembering and Karma finds herself wondering who she can trust and how much she can trust them. She's stronger than she seems (particularly when reading about her as a side character in Hugh's stories) and we get the first installment of how it has all played out from her point of view.Sorry, so very sorry, to be cryptic like that but if I say even just one word more I'll ruin it for any Wool fan who has read all the books. You'll figure out who it is. So, if you're a Wool reader take this advice: Buy it, read it, fill in a gap you know has been missing and be happy you did so.Excellent first part of the tale that is exceptionally well written and flows very nicely. The writing style is different from Hugh's which is actually a good thing. It makes this character, one that didn't get full treatment in any Wool/Shift book, really come to life and in her own way. It works.I suppose there are one or two questions that I have lingering, which is pretty standard for any Wool/Shift book, but I remain hopeful that this is addressed in later installments. Primarily, if the water (and we all know what they did to the water) is possibly dangerous for the unborn, then wouldn't there be problems with babies and children? That tends to be a fairly common trend with medicine and I would have expected it to be particularly true given the *type* of treatment included in the water. Also, why weren't pregnant people watched more closely or did this one occur so quickly that they simply didn't know the effects were as complete as they were?Regardless, I really enjoyed this and was sad to see it end. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for the next installment, you can be sure of that. Highly recommended for fans and previous readers of Hugh Howey's Wool/Shift series but not for those not already familiar with that series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLUZGSSE4XF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0G25AA#wasThisHelpful","R1RLUZGSSE4XF5","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I hit the click to get this book, I did it because it was on a free day for the book. I admit it. I'm in a different sort of reading groove right now and this genre wasn't what I was looking for. I'm so very glad I clicked.I read this in two marathon sessions and did almost nothing else so I could keep reading. It was that good.Imhotep is a figure of mystery in history. His tomb has never been found and he excelled at some many different fields he is almost bigger than life. He also made huge leaps in knowledge, at least based on his work that appears to be true, and so the mystery around him is even deeper. This novel gives us a wonderfully imaginative romp through time to find him.Tim, our main protagonist, is a man at the nadir of his life. He has suffered a senseless and devastating loss and is now alone in Egypt carrying out the trip he was supposed to take with his beloved. He sees something odd while visiting a tomb and finds himself in the distant past along with two other modern age people. The adventure that ensues forms the basis for our time and secures the rise of the great civilization of Ancient Egypt.The amount of research the author must have done for this book is staggering. Every single aspect, from the food to the climate to the way in which the people are portrayed is incredibly detailed and, I believe, astonishing in accuracy. Based on all that one can read or discern from historians and anthropologists and archaeologists has been wonderfully distilled into a fast moving and intelligent story.The cast of characters is large but each is very unique and easy to tell apart. Despite Tim being our central character, it is another character...let's call him Apy...who really steals the heart.Super enjoyable and recommended for those who like a mix of alternate history type science fiction, historical novels, smart fiction and even mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23QZYIBYQRNJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K16Q3G#wasThisHelpful","R23QZYIBYQRNJE","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one took me by surprise. Absolutely and totally grabbed me and shook me and entertained me all the way through. Now that I've given the praise, let's talk about the story.In this dystopic future, women are in charge but not all women are equal to other women and most of the people of this world lack any semblance of control over their lives or destinies. Vika is one such. Though her mother held a position of some merit, the lack of emotional connection required of their world means that does little to help her and she is just another young woman without healthy offspring and therefore, entirely disposable. Her chance comes when she is assigned a husband. If all goes well then she will have a child and be one of those chosen to travel to the distant land of China where the last remaining good land lies and the hope of a new civilization. Of course, nothing ever goes well in dystopias, does it?I'll end the synopsis there because more would start spoiling the story. Overall, I really liked Vika but more importantly, I could get into her skin and her character felt fully realized. The world that is the setting for the story is so well fleshed that it is almost another character and one that is malevolent at that.The words flow well and the story does too. The imagery is evocative and the setting extremely well realized from inception. In a way it is like someone took their favorite elements of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, The Handmaid's Tale and The Gate to Women's Country and made a new world that has enough punch to easily join that group.For all my praise, there are a few hiccups in the book that I put down to a young writer. One deals with the physics of fallout on a global scale. There is almost no likelihood...by that I mean a vanishingly small chance...that China would not be as significantly impacted as every other landmass. It would have been MORE believable had we a clear idea that Amana is North America and the promised land was Australia or New Zealand or something like that. That might have worked better. If there is some further deeper mystery that is revealed in the second book about ""China"" not being what they've all believed, then a hint that this is so would be better in the first book.Also, there is the idea that girls are being raped in the place where defectives are. If women control this world, then why is that happening. It is a jarring note of discord.But other than that, I found no real flaws. Instead, I found a developed dystopia with intriguing and unique elements that I enjoyed thoroughly.

"This story, a prequel for a full length novel, is a short story about a little girl and her mother in a world going to hell in a handbasket. Young, small and so very vulnerable, Sunni is also a hopeful little girl who enjoys dressing as a ballerina and dancing. When things go badly and she winds up alone, there will be no more dancing.It's just so very sad and tragic and all too imaginable in a world like the one we live in now.The story is well written and flows beautifully with characters very well fleshed for a short story. It is very easy to sink into the story and relate to the characters despite the brevity of the work. This is a disturbing story though and not at all suitable for the young. Ensure you can be alone afterwards if you have a tendency to be soft hearted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QYQS0KOD3NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QYH9SU#wasThisHelpful","R6QYQS0KOD3NE","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a lot of people, I need it dark to sleep. I've also noticed the coolness creeping around the curtains in my bedroom when I walk past them more this winter. So, even though I love my curtains, I needed to buy new ones.While I was browsing around for new ones, with none of them striking my fancy, I came across this item in my search results. It seemed a no brainer for me to give these a try and then be able to keep my curtains.They arrived quickly and well packed, of course, and it took me only a few minutes to put them up behind my other curtains. I used the same rod and just put these on in between the slots for my curtains. I bought the pins recommended just in case, but didn't need them.As soon as I got these on I knew it was perfect. I closed the curtains and it went full dark. By that night, I also noticed that the creeping coolness near the window wasn't there anymore either. Since I put them up, my bedroom has been much warmer overall. With so many windows in the bedroom, it's easy to lose heat, but these appear to have stopped a whole lot of that.Do note that this is for one panel only. You'll need to measure and get multiple panels. In my case, they match the size of my curtains so one panel of these per curtain panel. Also, the back side of the panel is an off white so that is what will show outside the windows.

"I really, really liked this story despite myself. It isn't the genre I normally read and it is a very different sort of story. Thomas was just a young boy when he disappeared suddenly from his family's life. And, like so many other unfortunate families whose children go missing, these parents never know for certain the fate of their child. While they know in their hearts he was taken and that he was almost certainly killed by whoever took him, there is always that spark of hope.Well, hope sometimes isn't in vain. But all is not what it appears and fear and love can become terribly intertwined. Thomas is the true hero of the story and his life is both beautiful and sad.This is a rather short book, more of a novella, and one should be able to read through it in one satisfying sitting. It isn't perfect in terms of the emotional content, but it is heart felt and understandable and enjoyable. Highly recommended to those who like supernatural stories, family stories and just beautiful fiction with heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0U0NF8KCKWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009G9T9C6#wasThisHelpful","R1M0U0NF8KCKWP","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At some point, I may get tired of pandemic based end of the world stories. Until then, I just keep clicking and reading and enjoying. As a big fan of indie fiction, I haunt the lists on an almost daily basis for anything that tickles my fancy. This one was a recommendation that showed up when I finished another piece of indie fiction on my Kindle Fired HD. I grabbed it up and thoroughly enjoyed the story.To be fair, there are some grammar mistakes and a misspelling or two in there. Nothing egregious, but they are there.The story revolves around a couple, Mike and Liz, who are awfully lucky to miss the first pass on a new disease. Mike is also a prepper of sorts and saves the day with his forward thinking and preps. I do love a good prepper story. As far as the story, it is pretty hard to get unique when it is a pandemic. Sickness starts, people die, civilization breaks down, bad guys start to show up and so on. But the way the people interact within the story is what makes it good and this one has all that it needs to continue on into a fully realized story.This is just the first episode so it does cut off without a significant resolution in anticipation of the next volume. If you don't like those kind of cliff-hangers, then give a wait until more of them come out. I sure hope the next chapters live up to the promise of the first!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OKRLZ6IN3AYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB1WC12#wasThisHelpful","R2OKRLZ6IN3AYN","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was using a different product, one I also reviewed quite highly, but after my old man doggie had his latest bout with a persistent infection and some more surgery, we needed something a bit stronger to help his gut. He had to be on 2 months of strong antibiotics of multiple kinds (sulfa and PCN) and that will tear up a gut and cause some very nasty business during his walk.So, the vet prescribed this and we love it even better than the former digestive enzymes. It was like he had a normal butt for once in his life! And it eased some hardness problems (sorry this is such a gross topic but if you're reading, you've probably got a similar issue with your pup) with my elderly female dog too.In short, this relieves problems on both ends of the spectrum and it does it immediately. We use half a scoop in their food, once per day, for each dog. Weight is right around 30 lbs. It costs significantly more at the vet, so we bought it from Amazon and it came fresh and ready to go. No differences that I can see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TRBAXYKR455/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ECLM9Q#wasThisHelpful","R12TRBAXYKR455","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely refused to pay for cable at two homes so I did a bunch of research and decided that only hooking up fast internet and then using Roku and the services at both homes would be a better choice. However, I know nothing about Modems and such so I had to read a whole lot of reviews and look up all the ComCast data and such. Hopefully, this will make it easier for anyone else like me who is also looking to cut down on fees and buy a really good modem.Hook up was super fast and since I had the tech come to do all the other set up, I didn't do anything at all. BUT, it was very fast and it just needed a single phone call, the numbers from the bottom of the box and then it was good to go. This modem is a very good one based on the ComCast tables and gets speeds right at the maximum listed for the service. That's really nice since I'm using Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and HuluPlus for most of my viewing (along with an antenna for local channels). No problems with picture or sound and I run my computers at the same time.The lights on it are a little bit bright so that might be a consideration if you are looking to put this in the bedroom. I find them quite merry and don't mind them at all. Also, unlike my cable modem at my main home, this one isn't blazing hot all the time. This gets a touch warm, but not scary hot like my other one.Overall, I do think this does just what it should and it does it well. And I'm not paying $7 a month for the rental fee!

"I have a big rice cooker and do love it. I've had it for years. But...it is huge and meant for substantial pots of rice. When cooking a smaller portion it doesn't do as well and I can wind up with yucky rice. Enter my search for a smaller version.This Aroma cooker has many virtues and so far, not a single drawback when used properly. Depending on the type of rice you like or are using that day, the function will vary somewhat.When using Jasmine rice, rinse it once or twice and you can cook almost the full 3 cups of dry rice for a hefty 6 cups of finished rice. When using Nishiki rice, rinse once and it will come out nice and sticky for sushi making. For other rices, you'll often need to rinse twice to reduce the foam created inside the cooker and prevent some of it coming out the top.Steam does come out the top from the steam vent. But it is supposed to and if it didn't, you wouldn't get the same effect from the cooking process. Very important so don't stop it up. Just be careful not to rest your hand over the hole and no problem should be encoutered.The steamer attachment is awesome! I used it for edamame and it came out perfect. I plan on using it often. It is best suited for modest portions, however, so probably not a good choice for a veggie loving family who wants to do hefty portions for more than 2 people.The only caution I have is that when the rice is done, be sure to be handy in order to fluff and serve or at least remove the heat. It will quickly brown the rice a bit on the bottom if left on the heat after it is done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWQEDMLAL8J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057XGM5W#wasThisHelpful","R2VWQEDMLAL8J7","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I can't say how this story willl turn out or whether or not the promise we see in Chapter 1 will be delivered in further chapters (beyond 3, that is), the first chapter was an exciting and engaging introduction into a highly unique world with some really engaging characters.In this world the author has built, something dreadful has happened. A group of young people and a cook, are trapped in the upper stories of an apartment building and have been for months. Below them is nothing but death. Everyone on the ground or who goes down the stairs more than a couple of stories has died, choking to death on ""something"".I'd rather not give spoilers so I won't go into any further detail, but in this first chapter the world is sketched for us and the central characters given some depth. It's a very detailed world and one that I had no trouble envisioning. It is also very tense, as it should be, given the situation.While I can't vouch for the physics of such an event. Since I've read through chapter 3 I have a bit more knowledge on what will be revealed. I can't find any way such a thing could happen, but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. That is pretty high praise because most of the time, physical impossibility in our current physical paradigm will ruin a story in some fashion.I very much look forward to future chapters and hope the author will collect these chapters into chunky blocks for release as well. Should appeal to those that like science fiction, adventure fiction, apocalyptic type fiction and TEOTWAWKI fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6G15EES220H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B4XLHA#wasThisHelpful","R2S6G15EES220H","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to hand it to the author for such a concept and premise. I can see real promise in the world she has crafted and the characters show the potential for depth and connection. The political skew has also a great deal of promise in terms of dystopic world building.However, none of that is carried off well enough to get through this book.First off, when doing work in which the character spends equal time in retrospect and in current action (or what the reader believes is current action) you have to structure the book just so. It is important to immediately anchor the person where you want them to be. That isn't done in this book so the reader is spent trying to figure out where and when the protagonist is rather than read the book. It absolutely prevents engagement by the reader and many will simply give up. I would highly suggest using a timeline or structure software for writers. Aeon Timeline is a good one for this type of work.Next, she is 13. It shows too much. Most 13 year olds have fairly complicated inner lives. It is merely how they express it that gives away their age. In their heads, where the writer is merely translating the complexities into language for the reader, they are still complex. Don't dumb down her thoughts because then we can't relate to her.Overall, this work has very serious problems and it was a huge struggle to try to keep reading. I gave up at about the 60% mark because I simply couldn't find any further interest and enjoyment while trying to figure out what was actually going on. To the writer, I suggest pulling this or at least re-writing and releasing it with a strong and unflinching edit and the use of a timeline editor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29OMBWP9QK1SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FMW4IA#wasThisHelpful","R29OMBWP9QK1SF","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this collection in one sitting before bed. Probably not the best time to read these but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Because I could read it all in the time before going to sleep, it is certainly a short work but very fully packed with twists and turns throughout. Each of the stories has a distinct voice and were reminiscent of the short tales told in ""Night Gallery"" or ""Twilight Zone"". They would fit right in to either of those shows without any problem.""Insight"" - Totally not what you're thinking is going to happen. Just putting that out there. Good stuff!""In His Eyes"" - I really felt for them and could almost taste the undercurrent in the story. Could easily be expanded into a novella or even a novel if those undercurrents were explored. Still a very satisfying tale.""Reverie"" - Whew. What a personally frightening tale. For most people, the loss of individuality would be the ultimate loss. After all, consider how we think of zombies who are exactly that. I liked the ending.""Mo's"" - I really liked this character and it did remind me of tales of Jim Crow times or even gender discrimination in other places even now.""Doppelganger Mine"" - Like the title says, it's about a double, but it is more than that. Very tense and taut. The showpiece of the collection and I really enjoyed it. Not conducive to sleep just after.Overall, I enjoyed the collection and the way the writer plays with and uses his words. I like how quickly the characters are revealed and the sketches of them are just enough to get to know them without spending more words than are comfortable in a short story doing so. Highly recommended for those who enjoyed their suspenseful short stories with a sci-fi or speculative twist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJHTK2QX73RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1A000Y#wasThisHelpful","ROJHTK2QX73RV","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mountain House is pretty much the gold standard when it comes to freeze dried food for backpacking, camping or whatever other occasion might call for quick, easy to prepare meals. The down side is their cost. For a two person meal the costs varies from about $6 on sale to about $8, depending on the store. Finding this multi-pack at such a good price and containing some of the favorites inside was a delight.For those who don't know about these, they are pre-made entrees that are then freeze dried. All you have to do is add hot water (take out the dessicant packet first!), stir and reseal the zip and wait ten minutes. Stir again and then serve. Our family uses them pretty extensively for the purposes I listed above but we also use them in our emergency kits in case of hurricanes creating power outages or a requirement for evacuation to a hotel.Inside the pack are 10 meals in 2 person packs. I'll review each.Beef Stew (2) - This one is number 3 on our ranking scale of favorites in this pack. It is very rich so we also like to cook some noodles, rice or macaroni and serve the stew over that. When that is done, this provides 3 very hearty helpings or 2 decent adult helpings and 2 child portions. Two big hungry men would also be filled up. Without the added pasta or rice, it is two adult servings but it is very rich. Plenty of beef in this one too.Lasagna (2) - This one is number 4 on our favorite scale. Only add as much water as it says to add or it will turn out soupy. Also, if you do something to keep the heat in, like wrap the bag in a coat or sleeping bag, it will heat better and more thoroughly. We like it, but it is just a bit more finicky to get heated correctly than the 'stew' like entrees.Chicken Teriyaki with Rice (3) - This is number 5 on our scale. This one has a lot of sauce, so definitely cook up some additional rice if you can. We like to serve this over sticky rice but that is pretty hard to make around a campfire, so minute rice will certainly do in a pinch. I suppose it is the light color and lack of vegetable color that makes this one not quite so high on the favorite list. It certainly does taste perfectly like what it says!Beef Stroganoff (3) - This is number 2 on our favorite scale. Like all of them, it has a lot of sauce and is best served with additional noodles if you can. That will expand this to be a decent meal for 2 adults and 2 smaller children easily. Two big hungry ravenous adults will also be satisfied with extra noodles. Because of the lighter nature of the entree (lots of noodles really with a meaty and mushroomy sauce), without any additional noodles or bread to soak up the sauce, only one truly ravenous person would be satisfied. It has a very fine flavor, especially when you consider it is freeze dried!So where is the number 1 on our favorite scale? That would be just about all they could do to improve this set in my opinion. Add some Chili Mac!Prices on Amazon can vary some depending on a number of factors so I would suggest putting it in your cart and then clicking ""save for later"". Then you will see every time you visit if there are price changes. It will usually only be a buck or two but occasionally will be more, like $5 or $8 so it might be worth it to keep track of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301NOE0N61KJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OMWSNQ#wasThisHelpful","R301NOE0N61KJU","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the first book in a trilogy, one expects to get the best the series has to offer. After all, it must be good enough to support the writing of the other two, right? In this case, it's a bang up start and the rest of the volumes keep the interest very high indeed.Cass Devlin is just a regular Aussie girl leaving school. Poof, she is now in a totally different place and all alone. She survives...sorta...but when it looks like it might be the end she is picked up by: wait for it.******Psychic Space Ninjas******Oh yes, you read that correctly. Cass has now stumbled upon the worlds once populated by other humans, called Lantarens (note the similarity to folklore) and their offspring who have disrupted the balance of power in the universe and created monsters in other dimensions. And so, of course, psychic space ninjas exist to fight them.This is a rollicking adventure in the form of diary entries by Cass. It's got a good dose of teen angst, secret crushes, fainting and puking and other fun stuff to fill out the drama.I thoroughly enjoyed it and quickly purchased the next two, which I also finished in record time.

"I'll admit that I've been a drill dinosaur. Now, don't laugh, but I was still using a wired drill. Yeah, I know, I know. How inconvenient, but I loved the power of it and found the last battery drill I had to be a joke. So, I never tried again. Only a year ago I finally gave up and started buying the Black and Decker 20V compatible systems for various uses and I loved them. The hedge trimmer made me smile. The little chainsaw tickled me pink after storms. So, I saw this and said I would try a battery drill one more time.When it came I, of course, had to drill something. I had already ensured I had one of the batteries from one of the other systems charged up so I set to drilling. Wow! No more corded drills for me, though I will keep it in case there comes a time I need super power for longer periods or need a drill for a second pair of hands.The accessories that come with it are pretty good, it does save money over buying the various kits individually and it includes pretty much everything an average user...or even a drilling fool...should need. Like others have noted, I wasn't overly happy with the case interior since that rattling will give a person a cringe as to what's going on with the drill inside, though I don't think it will hurt anything. It's a pretty sturdy machine. Still, I used some of the cardboard from the outer packaging to correct the rattling and it makes me feel better. :)I got this on sale, so I feel overjoyed at the value I received. There's no place around here that I could find it at that price in a month of Sundays.

"So many times I read books and see interesting characters peek in for part of the story. Then I wonder, what was their story? I may really enjoy the main characters and feel entirely satisfied with their tale, but I'll still wish I had a bit more on those barely known others. Finally, an author who recognizes that desire in many readers and addresses it. In this short and enjoyable book, we get to see six characters that are only peripheral or only touched upon in the books. And they are really interesting stories with a whole lot of sad endings.In ""The Pilot"" we get to meet, however fleetingly, the pilot of a jet packed with passengers when the zombie infection takes hold. They are going bingo on fuel and really, what choices do you have at that point. He makes his choice and I cringed along with him. In ""The Boy"" we meet Paul, the lucky survivor of a cruise from hades who then finds surprises at home. (I didn't find the contradiction in power that others did, it seemed he still had power. I think I may have simply got it after correction or it was read wrong.) I felt really bad for Paul and got a serious twinge at his situation. ""The Fry Cook"" follows Doreen, a woman unhappy in the job she needs to do to pay the bills and what happens at the restaurant that day is a whole lot more than a health code violation. In ""The Inmate"" I really got the shivers as we get to meet Hank, a fellow you definitely don't want to meet in a dark alley. We also learn exactly what NOT to do in the event we someday find ourselves in charge of whether or not to open the cells at the end of the world. Want a hint? Don't do it! ""The Subway Passenger"" was a delicious tale that was so un-nerving that I got tense just reading it. Anyone who has been in those dark spots in a subway will get probably get that same shiver of recognition. In the final tale, ""The Sniper"", I was really touched. This was my favorite story by far and I found my heart just tugging for her. Carrie is a complex character who, out of all of them, finds something none of the others did.I really liked these stories and found them engaging and fun. Zombie story, yes.

"This is a very short little book that gives some basic information on spending money. That's pretty much it.Most of us know that we should budget our income to meet our needs of today and provide for our needs of the future. That's sort of a duh statement. The problem is that whole ""future"" concept. It's hard to save and even when a budget is in hand and adhered to, we are often left with a feeling that we are missing something we might have had. So, the problem isn't that we don't know the logical answer of saving a few bucks on cable by dropping premiums. The problem is that once we do we will realize how much we miss watching Boardwalk Empire or True Blood or whatever other show we like. Solving that problem...the feeling of missing something...is what needs solving.And that is not what this book does. Instead, it gives the pablum of all answers by saying...ditch the premiums. Ditch the landline. Buy clothes on sale. Etc.

This is, however, an excellent sterile water packaged exactly as you need it in a flexible bottle and ready for use.

"I've been caring for a family member post surgery for a couple of months and when you bandage anything at all for that long, the skin begins to break down. Yeah, I know that's gross, but you know where I'm at when I write this review.At any rate, she also has sensitive skin so we knew we would have problems. Bandage tape, especially that which can withstand dampness or drainage, is pretty serious stuff. Hypafix turned out to be the lifesaver we had hoped it would be! It really holds it's place exceptionally well. It is very flexible so that the person wearing it doesn't always feel like movement will dislodge it. It doesn't even blink when washing or taking a cautious shower.For anyone who must bandage an area for any length of time, say past about 4 changes of tape, or who has even remotely sensitive skin, this should be in your medical kit and ready for your use so you don't go through the pain of skin that has lost one too many top layers from tape.HINT: For absolute best results, use Skin-Prep (either pads or spray) over the area where you'll put any tape of any kind. It will clean and leave a film that adheres to both skin and tape, like a bridge, that is also water soluable. Then use Hypafix over it. Works like you wouldn't believe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLPCV2QTD4AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CDP1I6#wasThisHelpful","R1HLPCV2QTD4AR","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these because I was using a great deal of it while tending the skin irritations of a family member recovering from surgery. Opening and re-opening the tube over and over seemed less than ideal and a way to contaminate things so I decided to try out the single serve packets, like these. The ones that our nurse brought had a fairly good quantity in them and we used two or so per dressing.So, needing more, I got these to try. They came quickly and were well packaged and fresh so that's no problem. But the amount in them was a real disappointment. We went from using two per change to seven or eight per change. So, essentially, one box of these lasted about a day and a half which eliminates any economy gained from using the packets. While I do like that I was able to open a fresh packet, with no cross contamination at each opening, I wasn't able to feel like I was getting everything out of the packets either.Overall, the amount contained inside the packets is enough to cover a small scratch or cut, possibly even to put a very thin layer on a larger abrasion, but no more. In that sense, these are fine for a basic first aid kit used for the daily scratches of children, but not good for a serious kit or for bigger uses. In terms of compact kits where every square inch is valuable territory, these won't save you room or weight because so much of it is packet and not the contents. In that case, you might want to get the packs with just a smidge more inside.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304MOZ3M17RVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EPQ6MG#wasThisHelpful","R304MOZ3M17RVL","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(You thought I was going to say the best something else, didn't you?)In Second Shift we get so many questions answered and we see whole new vistas open before us, ripe for exploration so long as we have a well sealed suit. It's true that we aren't with Jules, a wonderful heroine, in this story, but instead we are given the great gift of getting to know Mission, a porter in Silo 18. His friends and family are there and he is a character of such depth and honesty that my heart strings were pulled tight many times. We also catch up with Donald, whose culpability is stark and whose choices are few. Thurman is there as is his less than lovable daughter.In this volume, we see more of the origination of the Silos and their inexplicable ability to not carry on multi-generational memories or stories is now revealed. We also get a tantalizing glimpse into what could be a whole new dark path as several silos are deemed lost, but only secretly and never assuredly.I hesitate to say too much for fear of ruining the pleasure of other ""Woolies"" out there who have, like me, been waiting with bated breath for the next installment. It would be a near criminal act.What the reader will gain from this part of the story is answers but will be presented with deep ethical questions that will linger and give us much food for thought. I will say that Mr. Howey's writing has never been better, and that's saying something. This is such a polished work with each word perfect for the moment, mood and impact. I just can't say enough about that. His characters are almost too real. They won't leave you be when you click the home screen and leave the book. You'll have to put off whatever it was you thought you might do...cook dinner, start the laundry...and let the characters carry you on a little more. And the epilogue...EPIC.I have only one thing to say to the author aside from Thank you and Bravo and that is HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSOUKML0SGAL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6ZT2FS#wasThisHelpful","RSOUKML0SGAL3","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen the other reviews where the book is compared very unfavorably against ""Lights Out"" and I understand completely where people are coming from. This isn't the epic tome with layer upon layer of development that the previous book was. But that one, while I loved it and have read it many times over the years, is often too deep and too intimidating a read. ""Collision Course"" isn't ""Lights Out"" light, it's something entirely different. Comparing them isn't where I'm coming from at all.In Collision Course we're faced with the destabilization of our economy and the rapid disintegration of society and social services that comes with that. It is, unfortunately, a situation that is becoming more possible in our country at this time. Not likely, but less impossible. Our two main characters are coming from entirely different points in life.DJ Frost, a prepper extraordinaire, who has all the bells and whistles including a modified quiet ATV and a trailer for it. He also has a full range of every survival toy one might imagine to stick in it. He seems almost obsessively prepared. When things finally get too bad in the city, he executes his plan to escape to his rural ""bug out"" location where he can live and thrive.Gabe, on the other hand, is a falling down drunk who has never gotten over a tragic loss in his life. He lives in a trashy little trailer on a remote bit of land and gardens when he is sober, making a living from his produce. Not only is he not prepared for ""the balloon to go up"" he isn't even aware of it at first.What follows is the story of the journeys both men take, both figuratively and literally. They each become what they really are during the course of the story and the ending was a total surprise! No spoilers from me.This book isn't huge but it also isn't small. It's 350 pages and not a word of it is wasted. It's all story and no fluff. I really enjoyed the pacing and how the relative length of the chapters began to shift in focus from one to the other as they changed. I really like how David wrote about the dark side of some preppers/survivalists, something many feel uncomfortable with. But the truth is that some of those mall ninjas and some of those more vociferous forum writers ARE a little unbalanced. It was a reminder, wrapped in a great story, that not everyone who seems fine is one to be trusted.I think this is a good book for those interested in a story about the sort of things that can happen in a destabilization of our economy or devaluation of our currency by other countries and how people react under stress. It would specifically appeal to many preppers but those who might be too sensitive to seeing a prepper cast in a bad light might want to steer clear.And no, no one asked me to write the review and I'm not a specific friend of the author. Same forum at one time is all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7BVDKTFUFYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451238079#wasThisHelpful","R2F7BVDKTFUFYK","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this from my Kindle library loan...otherwise I wouldn't have seen it at all. Very glad I did and now I have all the others in my Library queue. I liked it that much.As far as zombies go, I really like the genre. They're fun to read. Different from us in an almost unimaginable way, but yet they strike a deep chord of unease in most people. In effect, zombies are the artistic expression of what it means to be the ultimate ""sheeple"". But enough of that! Suffice it to say, I've read more than my fair share of zombified fiction and this one was delightfully different, yet classic enough to not stray too far from our zombie expectations.The characters in this book are extremely numerous. It's rather hard to just pick out who the main characters are because everyone is, for the most part, very well fleshed and unique. That level of work is usually reserved for a few main characters but it is done here without wasting words and very naturally. There are several groups, all coming from different areas and for different reasons so it is often easier to just associate the group rather than specific folks.That said, there are still a few standouts that I either really liked, or really hated, but felt strongly about. Jasper, that whack-job cult leader who is a mirror of Jim Jones is one. He is super creepy. Ed, the old retired Marshall who kicks butt just as well as he flirts with the ladies. Jeff and Colin, a mismatched pair of friends if I ever saw them. Robin, a porn star who turns out to be a sweet and nice girl. And then there is Billy...well, Billy is my favorite, despite his criminal past. Hope we see more of him. Richardson, the reporter, shows up in other books so he must be the closest thing to a main character is also prominent here though I didn't get as much feel for him as I did Ed or Billy in this novel.Our story starts a couple of years after the zombie infection, which doesn't actually kill them but does destroy their ability to think, has begun and the Quarantine wall has trapped millions in the infection zone. As such walls always will, this one is breeched, and the infection again begins to spread. The tale is of several groups who all eventually converge in one location for the explosive culmination of this portion of the tale. They face severe trials and travails along their path and even when it seems like they are home-free, they never are.One thing I particularly liked in this version of Zombie is that they aren't dead. Instead, the part of their brain that thinks past a reptilian level is simply gone. They are, in effect, just moving viruses with a need to reproduce. They sleep. They get wounded. They even die from their inability to care for themselves properly. It's a fascinating take on the genre and exceptionally well done in this book.All in all, I would highly recommend this book to those who enjoy the Zombie genre but are not firmly tied to the ""living dead"" version of the zombie. I'd also really recommend this to those that like post-apocalyptic fiction, adventure fiction and thrillers with a twist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ9TXDIF1SKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWC1Q0#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ9TXDIF1SKY","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally got a couple of boxes of these for my home medical kit, one large and one medium, and didn't think too much more about them. Then I ran out of the normal latex gloves I use for yucky jobs around the house and broke these out. If it is possible at all to do so, I certainly fell in love with them and haven't looked back. The nitrile gloves are far less smothering in feeling and they don't stretch out at every turn and get caught in everything while doing jobs.A good example would be chopping up jalapenos while making salsa. Definitely, a job for gloves but the latex ones stretch at the fingers while I'm trying to line things up and cut them, leading to small tears that cause problems. These stay put and make all kitchen work requiring dexterity so much easier. And they are stronger, which is a huge bonus.As of about a month ago, I've had to have clean gloves for changing bandages twice a day for a family member. We've gone through boxes of these things doing that and I've just recently stocked up on more so I'll never be without again. Not one tear, not one rip and my hands aren't dried out or messed up even though it's been a full month of wearing about an hour or more a day.As to sizing, the medium fits my hand well and I'm tall with pretty long fingers to boot. The large are too large for me. There is no powder and no smell. I really like these. As far as pricing, the prices seem to flex quite a bit. You can monitor the price by putting it on your shopping list and then tracking it since Amazon will show the price changes. Next time, I'm buying a case for the best bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DW3U6NC995T6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013U75B8#wasThisHelpful","R3DW3U6NC995T6","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many others out there, I continue to bemoan the loss of the classic PC world building game within the new game releases of recent years. The heyday of such games included titles like Pharoah and the Cleopatra follow on, Caesar I, II and III and a host of other lesser known but fun works like Poseidan.Sadly, the rise of the action element in popularity means that dedicated long term games where your goal is to top your own game and compare your ability to create with others waned. Caesar III was one of my favorites and I bought this title, Caesar IV as soon as it came out years ago. At the time, however, my laptop couldn't handle the graphics and at some point I lost the game.Recently, I was retro'ing an old laptop so I could continue with Cleo, Birth of the Federation and the others when I remembered this title. A quick search on Amazon showed it was still being made and ready to ship. Of course, I clicked.It came well packed and within 2 days. No instruction book was included and, surprisingly, no PDF on the CD that I could find. Since this game is years old, it wasn't hard to find a site online that had all the instructions so I don't deduct for that. It is increasingly common in old games.But don't let my use of the term ""old game"" deter you. Caesar IV is an excellent world/city building game that is pure in intent, design and execution. The graphics were too advanced for the time of release, severely limiting who could run it effectively. It looks fresh and modern to my eyes now.Currently, I'm running an i7 chipped laptop that's got all the higher end whiz-bangs to go with it and it runs like a dream. It even looks great on the HD screen despite the age. Definitely, ahead of it's time there. For those wondering about compatibility, there is a 1.2 patch out there you'll need to download to fix some 1.0 issues but it is loaded just about everywhere, including Gamestop and the Tilted Mill sites. I run mine in Compatibility mode for XP with upgrade 2 just to ensure there are no kinks and I've had none whatsoever.For gameplay, the progression is fairly standard for a city builder. You start out on easier missions and it gets harder fairly quickly once you get to the Empire missions. The choices have been expanded greatly so that almost every mission has a relatively peaceful mission choice as well as a military choice. That's really nice for mixing it up.It's not a piece of cake to get these missions either and city design is important. You really have to think and plan to get it right. But they are a thing of beauty when done correctly. Like many others, I've had the most issues with Prosperity since the combination of housing influences it more than anything and one naturally needs more Plebs than Patricians. Also, it isn't easy to make money in this one and I really love that it reflects a more realistic economic model.Overall, this is a great...no, fantastic...game for those who like the long challenge of building empires and one that you won't want to miss having in your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WHW4BK88ZNDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EDPQMU#wasThisHelpful","R2WHW4BK88ZNDO","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My love for Dystopian fiction is only surpassed by my love of Coffee. Yes, that's a bold statement and I like my dystopias as bold as my coffee. This is such a dystopia. I found it very entertaining but this definitely isn't a book that everyone will enjoy.Our protagonist, George Washington, isn't named for the president of that name. He doesn't even know that is the name of the founder of our country. Instead, he is named by the workers who grow the children after a Beatle and a City. In this dystopic USA of the future, the ""left"" has won the war for control, but not in a traditional sense. Instead the increasing creep of policies with the caveat words, ""for the good of everyone"" or ""to protect the children"" stripped the rights of people until they were left an unprotected and guided mass. Of course, there was the ""right"" that fought and lost.So here we have George. He has never known parents, taken a drug that is to make him happy his whole life and is just schlepping along. Until he finds a hidden door and is introduced to the world as it really is via the recorded words and objects left behind by a long dead patriot. What unfolds is George's awakening inside the world of 2084.Now to my opinion of the work. Mechanically, the book is well done for a self published book. I found just a couple of mistakes in the whole book, and it isn't a short one. The vocabulary is diverse and appropriate and the pacing is pretty good.In terms of content, well, there is no question this book is politically right and that the author takes great exception to left policies. But that is perfectly okay with me. Dystopic stories generally do take a limited set of elements and vastly exaggerate them to create the dystopia. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" took elements of the right to create a horrifying dystopia and I enjoyed that a great deal. So, if you put aside any really strongly held political beliefs and enjoy the book as a dystopian work, it should be very appealing to those that really enjoy the genre.Many people like to know which type of story it is and if put into that corner I would say it is a combination of ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"". It combines the very workable use of hedonism as a control mechanism with the pervasive surveillance society of 1984. Very nicely done.There were some areas where the dialogue went a little long for me but in each case, I can see where the author felt the concepts needed to be spelled out. And for many they probably do. I simply ""got the picture"" quickly and didn't need so much explanation via the dialogue. I think that anyone that keeps up with politics and law-making with a libertarian leaning like myself may feel the same.There is some relatively graphic sex in the book, however it did fit in with the story and there were only a few occasions of it. I simply skipped those segments because I don't really like to read that stuff. That is a personal preference of mine and doesn't at all impact my assessment of the story.This book is highly recommended to those that really enjoy dystopian works, right leaning or libertarian political fiction and those that enjoy a ripping yarn on our current political system and the future effects of it. Nicely done!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PIGGD7G9NDX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053A6WB8#wasThisHelpful","R1PIGGD7G9NDX4","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom had an emergency surgery a few weeks ago and now we've got an extended period of careful care for her wound. While she can shower carefully I don't feel at all comfortable with her trying to wash her hair in there. Knowing there must be tons of others in our situation, I figured there was something for it. A quick browse on Amazon showed there are loads of options and I chose this one based on reviews and most likely fitting our needs.It came quickly and well packaged, of course. Like others have commented, it doesn't come with a pump. I tried to use my yoga ball pump with it but that didn't work at all because it is one of those nozzles that needs to be squeezed for the air to go in. On the flip side, that also means that the air doesn't leak back out in between breaths. It only took a couple of minutes to blow up but that might be an issue for some people.The basin itself reminds me of a pool float made of really heavy plastic. It has a hose that comes out of the bottom in order to drain the water but it also had a nice well fitting plug so that you don't have to use the hose if you don't want to. The hose is a stiffer plastic and wasn't coiled in the package, but rather bent and folded so it had very stiff kinks in it. You'll have to work those out a bit before using it to drain things.We used it a little differently. I filled up the basin with some water and washed her hair using that water. I could easily carry the basin to the bed and easily wash her hair. My Mom thought it felt wonderful and was quite comfortable in the basin and it was nice for her to be able to easily have nice clean hair without too much fuss. I really like this unit and highly recommend it. I'll update with time if needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IO98TKHR4HUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JS0X64#wasThisHelpful","R1IO98TKHR4HUS","A3RX6E9EP1J5WW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RX6E9EP1J5WW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Call me ignorant, but I had no idea such a thing existed until it popped up as a recommended add on item when I was making a purchase. I immediately added it in. It arrived quickly, as always.

"Book 3 of the Bow Street Runners trilogy tells the story of Nick Gentry, the handsome rogue from book 2 who turned out to be John, Lord Stanley, Lady Sophia’s brother who did not die on the prison ship as she had thought. To save him from the hangman’s noose, Sophia persuaded Sir Ross, head of the runners, to let her brother have another chance. Now, three years later, he is a runner and doing quite well, still as Nick Gentry.In book 2, Nick was portrayed as a handsome, dangerous hero of the streets. In this story he seemed different, less dangerous (unfortunately) and very vulnerable to one young woman. One might have titled this book the taming of Nick Gentry for that is pretty much what it is.Nick wants nothing to do with his title that Sir Ross seems intent on having him claim. The runners will soon be disbanded and Sir Ross tells Nick he must take his place in the House of Lords and assume his real identity. Early in the story, Nick takes a wife, one Miss Charlotte Howard, who he was hired to find and return to her betrothed, an old and controlling peer. Having no scruples and knowing Charlotte is on the run from her betrothed, Nick offers her his protection in the form of marriage. She accepts.Mostly this is about the relationship (both emotional and physical) between Nick and Lottie but there is this villain lurking somewhere in the background. Like the others in the trilogy, it reflects Kleypas’ research into the Bow Street runners and that is interesting. In this book, they are fading out as the “New Police” are coming in.Lottie is an innocent and Nick is a madam-trained (as in bordello madam) man of sexual sophistication so you know where the love scenes are going. And like the other two books, there are many (some might say too many).

"This is book 2 in the Bow Street Runners trilogy. Set in the late Regency era/early Victorian period (we have no date till book 3), this one features the head of the Bow Street runners, Sir Ross Cannon, who has been celibate since the death of his young wife years earlier.Lady Sophia Sydney intends to seduce the unattainable Sir Ross for her revenge because of the death of her brother, John, on a prison ship--a death she blames on Sir Ross. Sophia manages to get herself hired as his assistant/housekeeper to gain his trust. It is clear from the beginning he wants her in his bed and she wants him, the revenge notwithstanding.Kleypas tells a good story and has obviously done considerable research into the history of the Bow Street runners. The characters are limited but we learn a great deal about Sophia and her brother John. And a respected thief-taker by the name of Nick Gentry who is the bane of Sir Ross’ existence.I did like book 1 more than this one and perhaps that’s because this one seemed so similar: a Bow Street guy reluctant to embrace marriage falls for a woman and turns into a doting lover. I liked this heroine less well, too. Both stories are replete with love scenes (one might say too many) and lots of internal dialog. To me they are very different than Kleypas’ Regencies I had previously loved.

"This is the first of Kleypas’ Bow Street Runners trilogy. Though a date for the stories is not given, since the Bow Street Runners operated from 1749 to 1839, I’m guessing these are late Regency era or early Victorian since the hero in book 1 had been a Runner for many years, but no monarch is mentioned.It begins as Grant Morgan, a famous London Bow Street Runner, is called to the Thames where a half dead woman is fetched out of the water. Grant recognizes the redhead as the infamous courtesan, Vivien Rose Duvall. Grant takes her home where his staff cares for her. When she wakes, he discovers Vivien has amnesia.Vivien accepts Grant’s claim she is a prostitute and that they were lovers, despite her misgivings. He tells her a lie about them being together as revenge for her snubbing him once at a ball. He believes she is the courtesan and tells her she sells her body for money. While Vivian is appalled by the thought, she knows her near drowning in the Thames was no accident. Someone wants her dead.Meanwhile, Grant hunts for the criminal all the while very attracted to Vivian who he believes is playing the innocent.I have to say that I did not want to put this one down. Kleypas does a great job with the sexual tension between the hero and there is just enough of a mystery as to who the heroine is and who wants to kill her to keep you reading. Though I figured out her identity before I was half way through, I still wanted to know how it ended.The Bow Street Runners trilogy:Someone to Watch Over MeLady Sophia’s LoverWorth Any Price","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4QWNI5P7G12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380802309#wasThisHelpful","R2J4QWNI5P7G12","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 3 in Hartman’s Camelann series, stories set in America during and after the Civil War. This one begins in 1875. Abbey (heroine in Sacred Ponies, book 2) is leaving the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, taking her ill husband, half-breed Will Thunder Cloud, back east to see a doctor.When they are settled on the train, Will falls asleep in their private car. Thomas Custer, younger brother to the famous General George Custer, has been helping Abbey and her two children. Then, in a sudden moment of shared passion, he takes Abbey up against a door in that same private car—with her full cooperation. Abbey had betrayed her wonderful husband and Thomas just added another woman to his list of conquests. (His brother, George, teased him about the string of bastards he’s left behind him.) At this point in the story I respected neither and wondered where it was going…Thomas, it seems, was immediately in love with Abbey and couldn’t stop thinking about her. And due to circumstances, their lives would continue to be intertwined. Meanwhile, Will gets some good medical care and, while his heart is still a problem, he lives, unaware that his beloved wife, who has betrayed him, continues to engage in inappropriate behavior with Tom.And then Abbey’s first husband, Ed Kincaid (from Sacred Ponies), who she thought was dead, shows up… (are you with me?)Hartman is a great storyteller and this one, like the first two, will keep you turning pages. But I have to say that I never could get past Abbey and Tom’s selfish act betraying her husband, a hero I had come to love. As far as I was concerned, Will was a saint, especially the way he reacted to Abbey’s perfidy.The battle of Little Big Horn is a part of this story, told from both sides with Red Cloud and Sitting Bull as characters.

"This is book 2 in Hartman’s Camelann series, stories set in America during and after the Civil War. Sacred Ponies begins in New York in 1865. The war is over and Abbey Charteris, sister to Daniel (hero in book 1) is wed at West Point to Capt. Ed Kincaid. Immediately, Kincaid is ordered to Ft. Laramie on the frontier to protect those building the transcontinental railroad from the Sioux Indians.Ed doesn’t love Abbey, or at least not at first, but he does love her body. And Abbey is in love with her husband. In the Nebraska Territory, she learns a horrible truth about Ed and suffers the terrible wrath of his best friend, Jake. Disgusted, hurt and afraid, Abbey flees to the Indians she has come to know from the Indian school where Army wives teach the children.There, while still married to Ed, for her protection, she is “married” to Will Thunder Cloud, the blue-eyed, half-breed nephew of Chief Red Cloud. When her brother, Daniel, arrives to inquire about what has happened, he finds her living with the Indians with no intention of returning to “white society”.Will Dupree aka “Thundercloud” is a noble hero and a self-assured, somewhat cosmopolitan man for his era. Raised among his French relatives in Canada and educated as a Jesuit, he also considers the ways of his Lakota relatives important and now lives among them. I liked him a lot, especially the way he treated Abbey.Beautiful Abbey is constantly in danger from the men at the fort as well as the renegade Indians. Lots of action and angst here, too.As with book 1, real historic figures populate the story, including among others, Generals Sherman and Sheridan and Red Cloud and Crazy Horse. The plight of the Indians is well documented as the white men hunt the buffalo to extinction and the Indians retaliate for their lands that are taken.A story that will hold your interest. I do recommend reading the books in order.The Camelann series thus far:Summer RoseSacred PoniesStar Riders","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AUGKH6JB62HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989387119#wasThisHelpful","R2AUGKH6JB62HE","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Victoria Holt’s romances and every now and then pick one up as a “pallet cleanser”. While more a mystery than romantic suspense, there is a lot of intrigue here.As always, it’s written from the first person. Ellen Kellaway, orphaned at age five, was a “poor relation” raised by wealthy cousins. Plagued by the same terrible dream, she lives in a family where she is never allowed to forget that her fortunate circumstances are owed to Cousin Agatha.Ellen is beautiful and her cousin, Esmeralda, lives in Ellen’s shadow, afraid of her own. The two get along well together, however. When Philip Carrington, the younger son of a powerful family, asks for Ellen’s hand in marriage, she is delighted—her relatives are not. They wanted him for Esmeralda.Then tragedy strikes, one Ellen cannot imagine happened as they say it did. Her fiancé is dead, suicide they claim. Amid the bleak prospect of her future, Ellen receives a letter from Jago Kelloway, a man who apparently knew her father and who lives on the “Far Island” off Cornwall.Ellen goes to the island where more mystery awaits and she begins to have feelings for Jago, though I have to say when she believed she was in love with him, it came as a bit of a surprise.To me this was a mystery that Ellen unraveled… her past, her fiancé’s death and who is trying to kill her when so many have a motive.A good story that will draw you in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15I17YC4M31ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312384173#wasThisHelpful","R15I17YC4M31ME","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Nottinghamshire in 1194, this is a thorough telling of how Robin Hood came to be… and the love story of Sir Robert (Robin) of Locksley and Lady Marian of Ravenskeep. In the words of the author, it’s “…a fictional interpretation of imaginary events leading to the more familiar adventures depicted in novels…” And so it is.The whole cast of characters is included in intricate detail (and consuming nearly 600 pages): Alan of the Dales, Little John, Friar Tuck, William Scarlet, one-handed Wat and the boy, Much, to name some—Saxons made outlaw by Norman cruelty, egregious taxes and the Sheriff of Nottingham’s “justice” fed by his selfish ambition. Richard the Lionheart, who makes a cameo appearance at the end, is mentioned frequently and motivates the stalwart souls to engage in thievery to raise his ransom.Sir Robert (whose mother called him “Robin”), returns from the Crusades as a broken man, plagued by memories of his captivity with the Saracens. His father, the Earl of Huntington, has plans for his son to take his place as heir to their castle at Locksley. But much has changed in England while Robert was gone and Robert/Robin has little desire to live in the castle.Self-serving, ambitious Prince John seeks to reign in his brother’s sted and William deLacey, the Sheriff of Nottingham, seeks more power and wants Marian in his bed. With the death of her father, Marian is now a ward of the Crown and alone at Ravenskeep.Marian begins as a woman too easily manipulated by the conniving Sheriff, but at times shows a backbone as she learns to stand on her own when she is abducted by a murderer (Will Scarlet who murdered 4 Normans and with good reason) and is then rescued by Robin with whom she spends the night in Sherwood Forest. She is ruined, no matter that nothing happened.I am a fan of Roberson and loved Lady of the Glen. So, I couldn’t wait to devour this one. It’s a bit different and you just need to be ready for that. Unlike Lady, this story, though well crafted and kept me turning pages, is long and contains a lot of detail, a lot of perspectives (every character had one) and at times is just a tad repetitive. Still, it’s superb storytelling and it has Roberson’s wonderful characterization and writing.I love her work and this is an exceptional effort. (I already have the sequel, Lady of Sherwood, sitting on my “to read” shelf.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTCHIXF0Y2BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B60D9VU#wasThisHelpful","RRTCHIXF0Y2BJ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally published under the title “NIGHTWYLDE” by Kimberleigh Caitlin, this is a beautifully written story with a compelling hero and a wonderful heroine. You will not be disappointed. The author has now republished it under her more well known name of Kimberly Cates.Set in Donegal, Ireland in 1718, it is the story of wealthy English Protestant Maryssa Wylder and poor Irish Catholic Tade Kilcannon, the heir of a proud Irish family dispossessed of their title and their ancestral lands by the English. He is known to only a few as the masked patriot, the Black Falcon, who raids the British to help and protect the Irish. To everyone else, handsome Tade appears as only a rakehell known for his drinking and his female conquests. He takes no woman seriously until he meets the beautiful, unloved and innocent Maryssa, who has been banished from the English court for objecting to heinous torture of a young woman.Both are the victims of their fathers’ anger: Tade’s father is disappointed in his rakehell heir (knowing nothing about his escapades as the Black Falcon), and Maryssa’s father hates her for her mother’s supposed infidelity. In addition, Tade’s father hates Maryssa’s father for all he stole from the Kilcannons. The undercurrents of tension are rife as are the dangers swirling around the young lovers as Tade responds to the desperate longing for love he sees in Maryssa, and she responds to his tender loving and kind words, something she has never had.Tade stands as the strong defender of his people; and Maryssa, once a shy and retiring girl, becomes a fiercely courageous woman who will fight for the man she loves.It’s a beautiful and poignant love story, very well told and very exciting, set against the tumultuous time in Ireland’s history when the English treated the Irish brutally: Catholics could not hold titles of nobility; they could not own land in their own country; they could not educate their children (except in secret as Tade’s parents did); and they could not practice their faith or have their priests (Tade’s brother Devlin, a priest, is hunted by the English).I highly recommend this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXPMRY6J3HBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SKQXZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3GXPMRY6J3HBV","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Scotland, Normandy and England in 1137 (prologue in 1127), this is the story of Giles of Moray whose birthright was taken from him. While still a teenager, he got it back in a brutal slaying of those responsible. Ever thereafter they called him “the Butcher of Dunashie”, a knight to be feared.Elizabeth of Rivaux had been married by her noble father to one Ivo who was “no husband” to her and, because of him, she wants no other, though she is in her early 20’s and her father, Lord of Celesin, would see her wed. When war looms between Stephen and Matilda, Elizabeth becomes her father’s “liegeman” vowing to guard his castle at Henlowe while he and her brother are off fighting. On her way to Henlowe, disguised as a nun, she is attacked by her former father-in-law’s men. Giles comes to her rescue and escort her to Henlowe. But once there, in a fit of temper, she turns on him, taking him prisoner.Elizabeth and Giles get off on the wrong foot but he likes her for her courage and her spirit and means to have the feisty woman any way he can. And Elizabeth can be reasonable… when she gets what she wants!I loved the tortured hero and the woman who hid her hurt with anger. Both had been disappointed in their prior marriages. Mills deftly weaves in the history of the time as King Stephen tries to hold onto his throne while threatened by Empress Matilda. Giles sides with Stephen and Elizabeth’s family with the Empress.Mills is such a good storyteller. And her historical research shines through as she includes rich historical detail and terminology of the period when knights fought for their king. The only thing the book lacked I wanted was a map.A worthy romance and another great installment in the Fire series:Lady of Fire (Eleanor of Nantes and Roger FitzGilbert, set in 1085)Fire and Steel (Guy, Count of Rivaux, Eleanor’s son, and Catheine of the Condes, set 1106)Hearts of Fire (Gilliane de Lacey and Richard of Rivaux, Elizabeth’s brother, set 1135)The Fire and the Fury (Elizabeth of Rivaux, Guy’s daughter, and Giles of Dunashie, set 1137)Winter Roses (Arabella of Byrum and William of Blackleith (Giles’ brother, “Willie”, in book 4, set in 1132)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH5E4I5X3P35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZEBY40#wasThisHelpful","R2IH5E4I5X3P35","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a great battle is won yet all is lost, will love be enough?This first of Roberta Gellis’ medieval romances begins in England in 1149 as supporters of Henry of Anjou gather forces to defeat weak King Stephen. It’s one of those historical romances that have actual history woven into every page. I just loved it.Roger of Hereford is a young, handsome knight, his father’s heir and confident of his abilities both on the field of battle and with women. He has just returned from France to lead the forces against King Stephen. The woman he wants by his side is Elizabeth of Chester, beautiful, intelligent and difficult. Used to ruling with her father a large demesne, she has turned away many suitors but accepts Hereford’s bid as she thinks he will allow her to be herself. What worries her is the passion she feels for him and so she holds back what she could give.Will Elizabeth help or hurt Roger as he seeks to put a worthy king on the throne?Gellis brings to life this period in England’s history. There are lots of characters as you might suspect, some honorable and some not so, including Roger’s controlling mother and his two sisters and jealous brother. Henry—the would be king—is also a character, and a charming one at that. Roger must handle them all. While he will take Elizabeth to wife, she will do something out of rebellion that compromises his mission and he must find a way to have her aid him without hurting the cause.What you won’t “see” in this book are any love scenes. You only know they take place by what is said around them. (I had to read one passage three times to realize they’d made love.)This is a great story and highly recommended for lovers of serious historical romance. It may start a bit slow but you will be quickly drawn in won’t be able to put it down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CSK7F1Y8TS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380006049#wasThisHelpful","R29CSK7F1Y8TS9","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story begins in 1841 as Ian Cameron, the Scottish soldier rescued from the pit of hell in book 2, but left with only one eye, thinks only of returning to his regiment in India and seeing again his fiancé, Georgina. Alas, thinking him dead, she is no longer his.Discouraged, Ian decides to resign his commission. When he learns he has inherited the title of Lord of Kilkirk, he plans to return to Scotland. But first he must carry out the request of his fellow prisoner, Potyr, a Russian who died, and deliver a Bible/journal to the man’s niece, Larissa Alexandrovna. But “Lara” is now Laura Stevenson, having taken the name of her stepfather who she loves.Ian comes upon Laura in a crisis in the jungle where a man-eating tiger threatens her camp and her stepfather has just died. Both suffer nightmares from their past and bring each other comfort. Ian believes he cannot perform sexually after his brutal beating in prison and Laura wants no sexual relationship, so when Ian proposes a marriage of convenience, she accepts.Heading for Bombay, they encounter many adventures and a detour that reveals a plot Pyotr was a part of to spread a fire over India, an upheaval that will see the British gone. Along the way, Ian discovers he is still a man in all ways.Putney very cleverly inserts passages from Pyotr’s journal that tell Laura much of her new husband and what happened while he was in prison.A rich tapestry intricately woven that gives you a look at the many faces of India.

"This is book 2 of the Victorian Silk trilogy and tells the exciting story of Lord Ross Carlisle, younger son of the Duke of Windemere, and friend to Mikahl Khanauri (now Connery), the hero in book 1. Ross is a world traveler and adventurer and now returns to Central Asia.Though it is set in Bokhara, Uzbekistan in 1841, it begins in Constantinople where Ross learns that his brother has died and he is now the Marquess of Kilburn, his father’s heir. And it is there we discover that Ross is actually married—to Juliet Cameron, daughter of a Scottish diplomat. They married young and Juliet left him six months later feeling that she could not handle London Society. When Juliet’s mother asks Ross to go to Bokhara to find her son, Ian, he agrees, never knowing he will soon find his estranged wife.Juliet is an adventurer in her own right, winning the respect of the Persians where she rules a people. Ross, a splendid hero everyone seems to love, admires her as she admires him. They seemed perfect for each other and Juliet’s leaving a man she clearly loved was a bit mystifying. They do have a “big conversation” at the end but it wasn’t that surprising as Putney dropped large hints as he story developed.Putney has done much research for this story and she brings the culture of Central Asia to life. It is rich in historical detail—the sight, sounds, dress and food. The scene of the Uzbek equivalent of polo, played with the body of a dead goat, was thrilling.

"Set in England at outset of the Victorian era in 1839, this is the story of Lady Sara St. James, the daughter of the Duke of Haddonfield and Mikahl Khanauri, an exotic chieftain from the East who has come to London for revenge on Sir Charles Weldon, betrothed to Sara. Mikahl is introduced to London society as Prince Peregrine of Kafiristan by his good friend Ross, Lord Carlisle, Sara’s cousin.From the very beginning, practical Sara is drawn to Mikahl, as are all the ladies of London. He is mysterious, masculine and very wealthy. She does not love her betrothed, Charles, but thinks he will make a decent husband for a plain girl with a limp (from a terrible riding accident she had as a child). Charles, who has a dark side, wants her for her noble lineage and for her dowry. Mikahl thinks she is beautiful and courageous of heart.As a part of his revenge on Charles, Mikahl seduces Sara to the point she will be ruined and arranges for her father and her betrothed to witness her shamelessly kissing him. Then he offers to marry her, never realizing his heart is involved.Putney brings us a wonderful set of complex characters and at times their banter had me laughing. And who could not love the mysterious Mikahl who sees beyond the surface to what lies beneath? He recognizes Sara’s pain because he has experienced much pain himself. She may think little of herself, but he does not.The plot will keep you guessing, knowing both the hero and villain hide secrets as they prepare to unleash their weapons on each other.

"The story begins in New York sometime during the Revolutionary War (no date is given but it was before Yorktown so I’d estimate 1781-82). Rahab McClellan (Rahab, as in the name of the prostitute in the city of Jericho in the Bible story) is living with her brother, Salem, and his wife Ashley. Knowing Rahab wants to be involved in the war, Ashley sends her sister-in-law to a tavern to carry a message to a man working for the rebels. Rahab is delighted, no matter the danger. Which is characteristic of this heroine… she is reckless.The only women in the tavern are whores servicing the Redcoats, which seems an unlikely place for a lady to be delivering messages. When Rahab takes on the role of a serving wench (not a part of the plan) and the bartender suggests she make her appearance more alluring for the customers, she complies. While serving customers, she knifes one who tries to grab her, killing him. When the men in the tavern threaten her, she is saved by a man named Jericho (yep, same city) Smith. Jericho is actually the guy who was waiting for the courier who he thought would be Ashley.Jericho takes Rahab to General Washington’s schooner, which is oddly devoid of any crew. There she suddenly comes down with a case of amnesia and can’t remember who she is. She and Jericho fight like cats and dogs. Jericho tells her she is a whore and she accepts it. (Are you still with me?) Of course they are attracted to each other. And, not surprisingly, given all this, Jericho thinks he’ll have a quick tumble with her. After all, she is a whore, right? She certainly sheds her clothes like one.About a third of the way through the story we begin to get a sense that there’s a war going and the characters get briefly involved in it. And then the story moves to England and the war is forgotten. There, we discover that Jericho is actually Goeffrey Hunter-Smythe, the Earl of Stanhope and he intends to recover his title.Readers might note this reads like a Regency with terms of that period (pelisse, set down, missish, sirrah, etc.). Once the story moves to England, it seems to fit.The author writes well and the story, while a bit improbable, has many twists and turns. The heroine is at times the gentle lady and at times the curse-spewing shrew. Hard to know the real woman. I did not read the first book in this series.

"The first thing I need to tell you is that Hartman is a master storyteller. And she has served up quite a saga set in the last years of the Civil War. It also reflects much research and attention to historical detail, which I so appreciate. And, lest I forget, despite are some brutal twists and turns in the 481 pages, it’s a wonderful historical romance.The story begins on the Maryland-Pennsylvania border in 1863 as the Civil War rages and two Union scouts, Capt. Daniel Charteris and Capt. Hal St. Clair, best friends since their youth, discover a beautiful isolated lake and a boy named Kip. Kip brings them dressed fowl for dinner and tells them about the father and brothers he lost to the war. What the two officers don’t realize until later is that Kip is really a young woman named “Summer Rose”.Both young calvary officers are in love with Summer but Daniel stakes his claim early.  For Daniel, it’s love at first sight and he can’t wait to make her his wife. Summer, it seems, loves him, too. They marry and move to Washington D.C., where Daniel and Hal are drafted into an assignment with Jack, Summer’s older brother who is working for President Lincoln to find the culprits behind a ring of child prostitution in the Capital.Both Daniel and Hal fall in love with the valley that Summer calls “Camelann” and decide to buy the land from Summer’s brother.In the course of rescuing a child, Summer, Daniel and Hal make an enemy, a really nasty man who vows revenge for Summer’s cutting his face when he tries to rape her. (Did I mention she is good with a knife?) There are some very exciting scenes in this story that are very well written.Much happens as Daniel and Hal return to the warfront and Summer tries to cope with Daniel’s absence. And then Hal comes to tell her that her husband has been hanged by the Rebs. (Don’t worry… there is a happy ending.)This is a well-written, leisurely paced story that will draw you into the world of Washington DC during the time of the Civil War and into the lives of Summer, Jack, Daniel and Hal, to name a few of the wonderful characters. Some are historical figures like President Lincoln, General Philip Sheridan, and others. At one point Summer, disguised as a boy, and with General Sheridan’s permission, takes up the role of “Lt. Ross” to be near Daniel in order to try and rebuild their relationship after it is torn asunder.If you love Civil War romances, consider this a keeper.

There, she partners with the dashing Jack Holloway, a pickpocket and thief. Modesty uses her artistic talents to alter the appearance of the stolen items to look entirely different. Both are clever, quick-witted characters.When Modesty and Jack are caught, Modesty sails to Jamestown in the Virginia Colony as a bride-to-be in order to escape Newgate and Jack becomes an indentured servant, both in Jamestown. And both in the home of one Mad Dog Jones, a gifted barrister of the Star Chamber who is now living on the Virginia frontier. Modesty only chose Mad Dog to be her husband to avoid being burned at the stake as a witch when a villain from her past shows up to accuse her. There is little affection between her and Mad Dog to begin with and their wedding night only a grudging acceptance of what must take place. Still, oddly enough, there is passion between them.Bonds tells this well-written story through the eyes of the women who sailed to Jamestown to escape their former lives, prepared to become brides of the bachelors in the new colony. Modesty, Rose, Annie and Clarissa each choose a man they hope will make them happy. Meanwhile, Modesty plans to return to London on a ship Jack now sails for Mad Dog.

Now both are living in a convent and Caryn longs to escape.Though a series of events, Caryn finds herself betrothed to Raolfe de Gere, the Norman knight they called Ral the Relentless. He has been given Braxston Keep, once the dwelling of her Saxon family. She agrees to wed him for protection but arrives at a bargain she will not share his bed. Ral has a leman, a beautiful blonde, who takes care of his “needs.”This is a well-told story with a good medieval feel though there is no history of the period here (and lots was happening in England then). Most of the story is set in or around Braxston Keep. Caryn finds herself attracted to her new husband and jealous of his leman and though Ral sleeps with his leman, he would prefer to bed his wife. Each is stubborn and fights the vulnerability that their growing love creates.There’s lots of action and subplots in this one to keep you entertained and an evil knight who wants vengeance on Ral for suspense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M1734PD01NEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041392#wasThisHelpful","R1M1734PD01NEI","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yet she falls in love with Jesse and is the one to suggest they make love—without benefit of marriage. Jesse seems to have only honorable intentions but it takes him a while to get around to that. And then there is the war…Preston brings to life the time at the end of the War of 1812 when, unaware that a peace treaty had been reached, the Americans and British in New Orleans fought on. She obviously did much research to get the events correct. Her fight scenes are exciting and the fictional intrigue believable. Elise is a sympathetic figure though at times she does seem a bit confused about her goals. Still, she is unselfish and wants only the best for her mistress, who saved her from a fate worse than death. Jesse is honorable in all things and his cousin is a worthy character (who will be a hero in an upcoming book).It’s a great start to her French Quarter Brides series and I recommend it:To Save a LadyTo Lose a Lady (coming)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCY1XZYEAG4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJF5MFK#wasThisHelpful","R2PCY1XZYEAG4W","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heroine, Jeanette St. John, is a Civil War widow living in Texas in 1862 looking to aid the Confederacy by trading her cotton for weapons she can supply the South. But the only ship’s captain able to run the North’s blockade is a Frenchman named “Kitt, the Frenchman,” operating out of Mexico. And so she goes to see him and agrees to a strange bargain: her virtue for his successful runs of cotton for arms and ammunition.Meanwhile Jen has a childhood friend, now grown into a handsome man and returned from years in France, one Cristobal Cavazos, who would have her think he is a gay fop when he is anything but.When the war draws near Jen’s home in Brownsville, Jen’s sea captain father orders her to the North where he lives, but she has no intention of going. She thrives on the excitement and danger around her. So she talks Cristobal into marrying her—a marriage of convenience where they will live their separate lives. And then the Frenchman, Kitt insists she keeps the terms of their bargain.Of course I knew that Cristobal was Kitt, but even knowing that, I loved watching Jen stumble around doubting the virility of her husband. Cristobal was a great hero and put up with Jen’s snippy overreactions to learning of his assumed identity. The story is intriguing as both Cristobal and Jen take on the role of spy, her for the Confederacy and he for the Juaristas in Mexico.The story reflects Bonds’ considerable research and events of the Civil War in Texas. It’s a story of second chances and love in the middle of tumultuous times and in a tumultuous relationship. And there are some well-written exciting scenes as Cristobal tries to outrun the Union troops. Very enjoyable!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYOHERCACYX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLEXN58#wasThisHelpful","RMYOHERCACYX0","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my blog followers recommended this book and I thank her for it. It’s now on my keeper shelf. It’s the kind of story that grabs you and won’t let go. I highly recommend it.De Blasis brings us the intriguing story of a well-educated young woman, raised to be a lady, who because of a tortured past gives herself to a man nearly twice her age who she knows harbors a love for his dead wife. But the Tiger is a man who can protect her from the one who hunts her.Set in San Francisco, Seattle and the San Juan Islands, the story begins in 1869. The widow “Mary Smith” (an assumed name) is on the run from killing a man, or thinking she might have. Then a man who she encountered ten years ago (when she was only 8), Jason Drake, sees her dancing in a saloon and decides he wants her. She flees to Seattle, never knowing that Seattle is his home, where he is known as “the Tiger,” a man of power and wealth who has his own island.When she discovers that the Tiger is feared and respected, Mary decides to become his mistress in a bargain that will secure her his protection from the evil that stalks her. Neither thinks the relationship will be anything but transitory, each meeting the other’s needs. But they are both in for a surprise when they fall in love and Mary’s past slams into her present.De Blasis brings to life the world of logging and the lumber business (“the loggers had a kingdom, a language and a code of chivalry all their own…”) and creates a wonderful world that includes an island in the San Juan Islands where the misfits Jason has collected thrive. De Blasis has obviously done considerable research for this story, even down to the ship scenes, the vegetation, the Indians who show up one day and so much more. It is all very well done.It’s a poignant story of two people whose pasts tear them apart but whose love will draw them together again, a love strong enough to overcome fear.

"Set in Kansas in 1870, this is the story of Buck O'Connor, who fought in the Civil War on the Confederate side, and Amy Langford, who is working with the railroad to import brides to Kansas to help settle the former Indian lands. Unbeknownst to Amy, Buck is in Kansas at the bidding of his cousin, who is fighting the railroad that is threatening to take his land. When Amy, who is being stalked by a killer, asks Buck to be her bodyguard, Buck accepts thinking it will enable him to help his cousin.It’s pretty much instant lust on Buck’s part and Amy is not far behind him, notwithstanding she is engaged to another man. She is an uppity, “progressive” woman, a widow who sits on the board of the railroad and wants to be involved in all the plans. Buck, an unusual man of his time, admires her for it.This is an adventure with intrigue, a bit of mystery, treachery and deceit (among other things). There’s a rich cast of characters that will show you life in the early years of America’s railroads.Burke did much research into the building of the railroad through Kansas and the history of the two companies vying to be the first to lay the railroad from Oklahoma to Texas. I always like real history in my historical romances. And it’s a well-written story, too. For those of you who love stories set in America in the late 19th century and railroad stories, this will certainly appeal.More in the Romance and Rails series:Passion's PrizeHer BodyguardA Dangerous PassionFugitive Hears","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GO6LW5ZRE0B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIXEZUK#wasThisHelpful","R1GO6LW5ZRE0B1","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins in 1891 as impetuous Ariah Scott arrives in Oregon as a mail order bride for one Pritchard Monteer. However, his uncle, Bartholomew Noon, keeper of the Cape Meares lighthouse, meets her at the station instead. Bartholomew and Ariah quickly fall in love, which wouldn’t be so bad except that Bartholomew is married, albeit to a harridan named Hester, who denies him her bed.The story is well written with great descriptions of the environment on the Oregon coast and life among the lighthouse keepers. And one can tell the book is based on solid research, even down to the Chinese ring neck pheasants that Bartholomew raises.Though she is in love with Bartholomew, Ariah marries Pritchard, but Pritchard isn’t quite up to being a husband. Instead, he finds his manhood in the bed of a poor, mistreated waif of a girl who lives “in town.” Noble Bartholomew remains in a loveless marriage while pining for another man’s wife with whom he shares a love of poetry and birds. And Ariah tries to find her place while fearing a Greek uncle bent on her demise.It’s a story of mismatches and the mistakes of youth that affect one’s later life. All of the characters hide something from their past they would rather not face, something they don’t want to reveal. Raddon treats well the difficult subject of infidelity, and though the morality may be confusing at times, she brings and intriguing story to the page.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DBQ5BHP1CFTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NBK88W#wasThisHelpful","R2DBQ5BHP1CFTV","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins in Missouri in the 1850s with a duel where Rory Campbell, a gambler and steamboat captain, plays second for his employer, Quintus Moreaux, a riverboat gambler and an ruthless, abusive man. Rory has a plan to get free of Moreaux and it involves his childhood friend, Philadelphia (Dell) Samuels, the daughter of Moreaux’s dead wife and her black lover.Like her mother, Dell has an uncanny ability to read people. Rory wants her to help him win at gambling, earning enough to gain his freedom. To get Dell to go with him, Rory intentionally runs his steamboat aground near where Dell lives with her uncle. Given few options (marrying an old lecher or poverty), Dell accepts his invitation to go to St. Louis where her evil stepfather awaits.For the first half of the book I did not like Rory and I thought Dell might be a fool, given her dreams of respectability. There was a lot of lusting going on between them and she did end up in his bed. The issue of Dell’s being a mulatto was never dealt with and she pretty much passed for white so I could not tell how important it was to the characters, except for her uncle who would not have a word of it uttered.It’s a well-written riverboat adventure with great descriptions of card games as Dell uses her talents to probe for the truth of men’s weaknesses. The ending is exciting, too. But underlying it all is a secret involving child sexual abuse that Dell must ferret out. Jones handles it well but the reader should know it’s there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IUR9GL2GR42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619228211#wasThisHelpful","R11IUR9GL2GR42","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Nevada in 1858, this is the story of Lila Cameron, an eastern-raised debutante, andMorgan Kelly, a silver miner who longs for a ranch, a wife and a peaceful life in the shadows of the Sierras. Dragged west by her elderly father, a doctor, Lila was reluctant to leave her life in Virginia. And the trip to California proved to be perilous. A man named David Gardner shows up to rescue her runaway stage attacked by bandits outside of Virginia City and Lila thinks she had met the man for her. However, David is a ne’er do well gambler who puts himself first, unlike stable Morgan, a mature man, whom she meets next.It’s a well-written tale with a plot that has some surprises. Belle did a great job of describing the runaway stage and Lila’s firing on the bandits, killing one of them, which draws her much local fame. She is a heroine with spunk, who sometimes takes foolish chances that get her in trouble. And one of the bandits wants his revenge for her killing his brother. When Lila’s father decides not to move on to California, Lila also thinks Nevada may be the place for her and dives into learning how to be a proper woman on the frontier.Belle has obviously done much research for her novel and describes well the issues with silver mining at the time. And the mine cave in was very exciting with Morgan and his brother narrowly escaping a terrible death. I liked the characters Belle created, especially Ellie, who ran the boarding house. In the end, I wanted to read the next one, Desert Sunrise, the story of Morgan’s brother.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCS5I5HGJ3DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6Y1S8K#wasThisHelpful","R3TCS5I5HGJ3DR","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins in 1849 in St. Louis where Brianna Wight, fleeing an abusive husband, joins a wagon train heading west to Oregon Territory. To ensure she gets there, she hires a mountain man, Columbus (“Col”) Nigh. Soon they discover her husband is in pursuit and wants revenge. Meanwhile, Col, whose Indian wife died sometime ago, finds himself attracted to the very proper woman who initially told him she was a widow.Raddon brings to life the struggles and hardships of the pioneers heading west along the Oregon Trail: cholera, bad water, torrential rains, a tornado, hail, grasshoppers, tainted water and insects. (Amazingly, there were no Indian attacks.) Her meticulous research provides a solid foundation for the budding love between Brianna and Col. Alas, while she includes three maps, they are way too small to see in the ebook (and I love maps!). The ebook also doesn’t open at the beginning, but in the middle of the table of contents, so just be aware.Col is a worthy hero and a complex man, much like the real fur trappers and mountain men who infiltrated the far west in the early days of America. And Brianna is a woman who cares for the hurts of others having lost so many she loves.It's a story of second chances and finding the courage to leave an abusing relationship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30EONXF8OL4D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OMPHEY#wasThisHelpful","R30EONXF8OL4D1","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins in 1860 in Texas where Sara Rawlings, left alone and destitute by her father’s death, goes to live with a cousin, Sam Cantrell, a man her father’s age. Sam has a son, Yancy, by his first wife, a woman of noble Spanish linage, and he has a young wife, Margaret—the woman he stole from Yancy.As might be suspected, Margaret is threatened by the younger, 16-year-old Sara. And Sara is captivated by Yancy, a man Margaret was once engaged to and now thinks to seduce. The one thing Margaret wants for her unborn child is Casa Paloma, a thousand-acre parcel in the middle of the land Yancy’s Spanish ancestors have owned for generations. Yancy vows he will kill her before she can have his land. And then Margaret turns up with a Spanish dagger in her chest.Much of the book is taken up with the machinations of the family and its history that has led to the distrust, if not dislike, between its members, all of which Sara must suffer through. In the midst of it, Sara and Yancy find love, albeit like two prickly people coming together.Busbee’s descriptions of Texas and the hacienda are superb. You will feel you are in the old West. Yancy is a drool worthy hero and Sara finds him so. Oh yes, the murder mystery remains unsolved until the end. Busbee will keep you guessing.

"Having read the first in the series, I could not wait to dive into the second. This is the continuation of the love story between Alisha Williams, a sheltered innocent raised in England to be a young lady, and Gray Eagle, son of the Oglala chief. Set in the Dakotas, it continues from Savage Ecstasy, which began in 1776.I thought Taylor’s ability to keep the conflict, action and mystery going into this second book was brilliant. And very difficult to do. After all, we know that Gray Eagle wants Alisha and when Savage Ecstasy ended, he was getting her back after the “blue coats” had “rescued” her and were now forced to give her back to Gray Eagle. After two sweet days together, Alisha is told she bears a mark that makes her the missing daughter of the chief of the Blackfeet tribe. But how could that be?As the newly discovered daughter of Black Cloud, Alisha is now “Shalee” and promised to wed the chief’s son. Gray Eagle is determined to take back what is his. But how will he do it? Thus begins an adventure you will not want to miss.Like the first in the series, this is a compelling story I could not put down, and this one perhaps brings a more satisfying “end” to the romance of Alisha and Gray Eagle, but there is more. This is the first in the 9 book the Gray Eagle series, the first four of which comprise the story of Gray Eagle and Alisha:Savage EcstasyDefiant EcstasyForbidden EcstasyBrazen EcstasyTender EcstasyStolen EcstasyBittersweet EcstasyForever EcstasySavage Conquest","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FOIN9JC5SES9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VSNADU#wasThisHelpful","R1FOIN9JC5SES9","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in 1776, in Oglala Sioux territory in the Dakotas, this is the story of Alisha Williams, a sheltered innocent raised in England to be a young lady and brought to the new world by her parents, who are now dead. She is living with her uncle when Gray Eagle, son of the Sioux chief, is taken prisoner and treated badly by some of the white men in Alisha’s settlement.Appalled by the treatment Gray Eagle receives, Alisha tends to his wounds only to have him reject her care. But he has plans for her. When he escapes, he tells his friend White Arrow that he will take her as his slave. Soon, his tribe returns to attack the settlers’ fortified site and Alisha is taken prisoner.Taylor brings to life the Plains Indians’ culture of the 18th century, the food, the crafts, even the language (which added much but was sometimes beyond my understanding). It took a bit of getting used to Taylor’s writing style as she frequently hops into different heads and drops in as the narrator to give us some bit of information. But she is a good storyteller and kept me turning pages.Gray Eagle is a hero with both tender and cruel sides. He comes to love Alisha but he will let no one know of it, else he will be perceived as a weak leader. (“He constantly reminded himself she was only his slave and enemy. He would keep her at arm’s length at all times, except when he made love to her at night.”) Alisha tries her best to appear the obedient slave in order to survive. She is intelligent and quick to learn the Sioux ways and wins the love of the brave White Arrow. But she suffers anytime Gray Eagle loses his temper or she crosses a line. Though he understands English, he never lets her know. I couldn’t help but feel sorry for how she and the other captives were treated. It was not pretty.This is a compelling story I could not put down, but to get the ending to the romance of Alisha and Gray Eagle, you have to read another book or perhaps three. This is the first in the 9 book the Gray Eagle series, the first four of which comprise the story of Gray Eagle and Alisha:Savage EcstasyDefiant EcstasyForbidden EcstasyBrazen EcstasyTender EcstasyStolen EcstasyBittersweet EcstasyForever EcstasySavage Conquest","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI35VJF4MHOME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082175453X#wasThisHelpful","RI35VJF4MHOME","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Set in 1751, this is a post-Culloden tale from the Highlands, the story of Ranald Kincairn, Laird of Clan Cameron whose brothers were killed by the English and whose sister they raped. He wants revenge. His plan is to abduct the virgin bride of the new English “Lord Lieutenant of the Western Highlands”—the man who raped his sister—and plant within her a Highlander babe, then send her back. The bride is Enya, a Lowland Scot from Ayrshire whose family, the Aftons, sided with the English.Though Ranald tells Enya he intends to ruin her, it seems it’s just talk as he puts her to work in the clan castle as a scullery maid, but doesn’t lay a hand on her. As time passes, he is a bit inconsistent toward her. First he tells her he won’t touch her, but threatens to give her to his men; then he tells her no one will take her against her will; finally, he beds her himself. Ranald is a worthy leader of his clan and respected by all. Of course, Enya falls for him.There are two other romances tied to Ranald and Enya’s—Enya’s mother and the man she has loved since she was 15, and Ranald’s sister and Duncan, a Lowland Scot who came with Enya.There’s an exciting scene at the end when the villain shows up to reclaim his bride.Bonds brings to life the Highlands and the struggle to survive after the terrible devastation the English brought about after Culloden as the Highlanders are hunted and the English are determined to wipe out the clans.And, should you be curious, yes, there is a tie in with the author and the name “Afton” which the author explains in a note before the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0449Z6A455N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQ0BN22#wasThisHelpful","RL0449Z6A455N","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: this review was done on the book before the re-release] This is Riley’s first novel and it’s a great one. Set in Ireland and Norway in 876, this is the story of Selia who, along with her twin brother Ainnileas, were found in the woods when they were two and raised by a kind Irish merchant. One day when Selia is 15, she decides to go to Dubhlinn (despite her family’s wishes) hoping to see the Finngalls, the warlike Vikingers and their ships. While Selia is watching the Finngalls, one of them, Alrik Ragnarson, is watching her.Alrik follows her home and tells her father that she will come with him when he sails to Norway, either as his wife or as his thrall. Though her father is distraught, he would rather see her a wife than a slave and consents to the marriage. Alrik is a brute who at times can be vicious, and at times tender—definitely a disturbed individual. His Norwegian name is Alrik Blood Axe (sorta describes him well). Though Selia is small in stature and not much of a match for the powerful jarl, she finds Alrik attractive and thus endures his rough ways, trying all the while to avoid his temper.On the way back to Norway, she develops a friendship with his half Irish brother Ulfrik, who teaches her the Norse language. Unlike his brother, Ulfrik has softer ways and seems more intelligent, more stable. He is aware of Alrik’s seeming madness when angered and tries to protect Selia.When Selia learns Alrik has murdered children in the past, she tries to escape, unsuccessfully, and in the process, Alrik and Ulfrik learn a secret about who she really is, but neither tells Selia. Meanwhile, Selia suffers from spells where she remembers an attack she and her brother once experienced.I found this story exciting and captivating. I could not put it down. It is well told and obviously based on solid research, which I so appreciate. Riley does not spare us the brutality of the Viking warriors who were quick to kill to take something they wanted. And her characters reflect her understanding of human psychology so there is great depth here. It is unusual story in that the tale does not end with this book, but continues on through the next two, but you can still enjoy this one while waiting for the next.I highly recommend this story to all you Viking romance lovers. There’s no fantasy here, no paranormal and nothing modern to distract. It’s a pure authentic Viking saga and, in my opinion, great storytelling!Note: Selia’s story is told in 3 parts and ODIN’S SHADOW is only the first. For the whole story, you’ll need to read the next two coming in late 2014 and 2015: A FLAME PUT OUT and OATH BREAKER.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1VYB4D9FKRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXNMWGO#wasThisHelpful","R1W1VYB4D9FKRJ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has all the elements of a great gothic romance: a castle on the moors near York, a “brooding, melancholy and emotionally distant” British lord, and a mysterious ghost that may not be a ghost at all.Set in 1858, this is the story of Alexandra Benjamin, whose Jewish father left her with little in worldly goods but a love of science and an ability to help the deaf hear. Under the ruse of being her dead father, she travels to York to accept a position with John Damien Newell at Cairncross Castle. Damien has lived in darkness for a very long time, haunted by an evil governess who at one point scared his younger brother, Samuel, speechless.

"Set in England in the mid 18th century, just after Culloden when the Scots were brutally hunted down and killed by the Duke of Cumberland (“the most hated man in England, a bloodthirsty villain”), this is the story of Cameron (“Cam”) Gordon, a Scot who did not support the cause because he believed it doomed to failure. But once the battle was over, he gave the proceeds of his successful career as a writer of fiction to his surviving relatives and to those Scots seeking vengeance on Cumberland.While Cam is watching one of his cousins about to be hung at Tyburn, a street urchin—a young woman in rags—picks his friend’s pocket and Cam is determined to see the miscreant brought to justice. But his friend urges restraint, reminding Cam he needs a maid. And that is how Miranda James became Cam’s bondservant—for seven years.Miranda was born the daughter of a nobleman but a dire set of circumstances left her an orphan and living on the streets of St. Giles. Miranda speaks like the poor thief she is. But before her educated mother died, she taught Miranda to read and write and love Shakespeare. Cam, who has become a writer of thriller stories, treats Miranda harshly, demanding she work hard and keep his house. He never questions why it is she speaks like a guttersnipe but is intelligent and well read.Wilde paints a vivid picture of 18th century London, the politics, the condition of the poor and the life of the theater and the rich. Miranda will rise through it all and thrive. You can see his research woven through every page in this well-told story. I loved it. Of course, despite the face Cam and Miranda become lovers, there is no mention of love or marriage by him and (because this sis a Wilde story), no pregnancy when they become lovers.A great adventure with incredible depth and attention to detail. A very worthy classic. If you miss the depth (and length) of the older romances, this ones for you. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2Q0RD8FLR7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3TBDYE#wasThisHelpful","R1V2Q0RD8FLR7C","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First published in 1978, this was Small’s first novel and by her own words, she spent 5 years researching it. I love that her stories reflect deep historical research. It shows in the many details and the vivid descriptions. This is a saga covering more than fifty years. It’s divided into 5 parts, named for the heroine’s roles: the Ambassador’s Daughter, Cyra, The Kadin, Hafise and Janet. And the beginning and end, which take place in Scotland, provide perspective on her life.This is the story of Lady Janet Leslie, the only daughter of a Scottish earl, Lord Glenkirk, King James’ ambassador to the tiny Mediterranean country of San Lorenzo. At 14, she is happily betrothed to the San Lorenzo’s heir, but then she is betrayed by a servant, abducted and sold on the auction block in Crete. The highest bidder was Hadji Bey, chief eunuch for the Sultan of Turkey. Even Janet’s father could not find the gold to outbid him.Taken to the Sultan’s harem, Janet’s name is changed to Cyra (meaning “flame” for her vivid red gold hair) and there she is taught all she needs to serve the Sultan (which conjured images of Esther and Daniel from the Old Testament). She also makes two friends bought by Hadji Bey around the same time, one from China and one from the Caucus mountains. These two women become her closest friends. When the 25th birthday of the Sultan’s youngest son, Salim, arrives, he is given the choice of six women from the Sultan’s harem to form his own. Unbeknownst to the Sultan, Hadji Bey has been hiding the three virgins he wants Salim to choose. Salim chooses Janet (Cyra) and her two companions, to be among the six, as he was encouraged to do by Hadji Bey.A wonderful cast of secondary characters surrounds Cyra as she takes up her role as Salim’s favorite. And Small’s research is evident in the many details of harem life and the eastern culture that pervades the story. That Cyra, a strong-willed, high-spirited young teenager could easily accept her fate was a bit hard to swallow. But as the story continues, it is consistent with her character and her decisions to pursue the path of diplomacy and wisdom.Many things happen in this saga. There is intrigue, treachery (including murder) and jealousy among the women—exactly what happened historically. Cyra takes her place among the Kadins (the women of the harem who give Salim children) and becomes the bas Kadin, the mother of Salim’s heir, Suleiman (a real historic figure and the longest-reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire). Cyra’s wisdom and leadership rise to the fore and she is respected and loved by all but her rivals.Great storytelling, wonderful characters and real history deftly woven make this a well-loved classic. However, the end is bittersweet, which will disappoint some romance readers who prefer to be left happy. And, with the events in the Middle East today, romances that feature a Muslim sultan acquiring an European Christian woman to add her to his harem, have lost much of their former appeal. It would not be the fantasy of many women today.The sequel is LOVE WILD AND FAIR, the story of Catriona, one of Janet’s descendants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZZWLF9GG9RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380016990#wasThisHelpful","R2NZZWLF9GG9RC","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a wonderful romance! It’s superbly written and kept me up reading way too late. It’s the captivating story of a rich American in Regency London and a waif of a young woman who lost her place in the aristocracy due to one man’s evil. (The villains in this story—and there are more than one, although one is more evil than the others—are some of the best I’ve encountered.)It begins in 1796 when Hester Devlin, Dowager Countess of St. Audries is dying just after the birth of her daughter, Morgana. Months before, Hester’s husband was murdered—unbeknownst to her, by his brother who wanted his title and his wealth. Overhearing the man’s perfidy instructing another to “get rid of” Hester’s baby, she leaves clues in a Bible and prays her child survives. Morgana does. By 1815, 19-year-old “Pip” is living on the streets of St. Giles as a boy with two young men she thinks are her brothers.Royce Manchester is a handsome American with lands in Louisiana and England, a connection to the nobility and enough money to buy anything he wants. One day, while out with his friends, a street urchin (Pip) tries to pick Royce’s pocket. Royce plucks the boy from the streets and decides to give him a better life. When he discovers the boy is actually a woman named Morgana, he makes her a maid in his London household—for her safety. But she is hardly safe from him, as he wants her for his mistress. (Of course, he would never marry a petty thief.) And then he recognizes her striking gray eyes…the St. Audries eyes! He assumes she must be the bastard child of the earl, his enemy. Ah, the plot thickens.400 pages of delightful reading from a NY Times bestselling classic author… action, mystery and many twists and turns. I recommend it!Note: This book is related to and follows MIDNIGHT MASQUERADE but either can be read as a stand alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOSANN1D5TSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Q7OL2A#wasThisHelpful","R2AOSANN1D5TSZ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Australia in the mid 19th century, this is the story of Sarah Markham whose father is a sheep rancher, and Dominic Gallagher, a Irish convict who was transported to Australia for a crime he didn’t commit and was then “purchased” by Sarah’s father to serve out his 15-year sentence. Because he is a man who speaks up when events call for it, he is whipped and abused. Sarah intervenes to save his life.The handsome Irish rogue knows Sarah is attracted to him, as most women are. But the odd thing to him is that he is attracted to her—a tall, skinny and plain woman. Robards, as usual, serves up delicious tension and some exciting action as life in New South Wales on the sheep station presents many dangers: convict uprisings, fires, rustlers and draught. Meanwhile, Sarah’s father is trying to get her to wed his ranch manager who has a cruel, evil side.I loved the picture of the brooding sexy Irish hero—an alpha male to be sure—thrust into the dusty Australian frontier where life is even harder than what he left behind in Ireland where he longs to return. Both Sarah, who is biased against convicts, and Dominic, who has suffered wrong at the hands of his mother and now Sarah’s father, have trust issues they must overcome. And Dominic has connections to an English earl…Robards’ portrayal of Australia is vivid (had me reaching for a glass of water!) and her characters very well drawn. A worthy read combining a favorite hero origin and a fascinating time in history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYMTQQ4GHFKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV63IQS#wasThisHelpful","RFYMTQQ4GHFKG","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins in London in 1888 as Molly Riordan sets out with her mistress, Lady Elizabeth Summersby for America where Lady E is to wed the man who, in a one night encounter at a London masquerade ball, impregnated her with his child. In Colorado, Dirk Ballinger has a cattle ranch, and there he has promised to do the honorable thing.On the way to the ranch, bandits called the Lovejoy Gang attack the coach Molly and Lady E are traveling in. In a bizarre coincidence, the father Molly is searching for is the driver. She is unaware, of course. As he is dying from a gunshot wound, her father tells the sheriff, who comes to their rescue with Dirk Ballinger, that the woman the bandits took off with (Lady E) is the maid and the woman left behind (Molly) is Lady E. Got that?Ray Lovejoy, the head of the bandits and Dirk’s illegitimate half brother, has the same green eyes as Dirk so that Molly thinks they are the same man.While Molly is still suffering a head wound, “semi-conscious and drugged with laudanum,” Dirk (thinking Molly is his betrothed) has a reverend perform a marriage ceremony. Molly is unaware. (That such could not be a valid marriage is never mentioned.) Then, concerned about the pregnancy, Dirk has a doctor examine her (Molly). The doctor just taps her stomach and never looks beyond that to see she has suffered a miscarriage or that she is a virgin. Instead, absent any blood in that region, the doctor tells Dirk she must have lost the baby in the attack by the bandits. The whole thing was a bit improbable.It takes some time for Molly to tell Dirk the entire story and for Dirk to tell her about his half brother. And then he persuades her to let everyone believe she is Lady E and his wife as they set off to find Lady E (who all believe is “the maid”).It seemed everyone was hiding a lie in this story as many secrets are revealed at the end. I had trouble thinking of Dirk as honorable because all the time he was planning on marrying Lady E, he was making moves on Molly. And Molly, who knows all this, is allowing herself to fall for Dirk. Ah, well, this is that kind of romance. Somehow, Stover managed to hold all the threads in her writer's hand. And did I mention that everyone seems related to everyone? So you see, this story has many twists and turns on the way to love. If you're looking for an unusual Western with an Irish heroine, you'll find this one entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178TW25TRR7OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AAREC0#wasThisHelpful","R178TW25TRR7OR","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in 1810, this is the first in Harrison’s “Heart” trilogy of Regencies and tells the story of the English aristocracy in Ireland, beginning with Lady Anne Wadsworth, an earl’s daughter who lives with her sister and parents on their estate in Ireland. Anne is well aware of her English ancestors’ role in persecuting the Irish, in her words, “…they overlooked the displaced Irish folk with placid arrogance.”Early in the story Anne encounters Diarmaid MacGuinness, a red-haired Irishman who is working for Ireland’s freedom and tells her of the Irish living reduced to being starving tenants living on land that was once theirs. Meanwhile, she has a new English neighbor, Hugh, Marquess of Ashbourne, whose mother is counseling him to take a wife. Though Anne has no affection for the marquess, and he admits he does not love her, she agrees to marry him to stay in Ireland and avoid a Season in London. A marriage of convenience soon becomes one of love.Harrison writes well and has delivered a solid story that depicts the fate of the Irish in the early 20th century (before they gained their independence). There are some good action scenes when Anne makes some foolish decisions while trying to help them and the marquess rides to the rescue. (One could not help feeling sorry for Diarmaid who only wanted to see his country rid of the English. His tale was left unfinished so presumably it continues in the rest of the series.)The trilogy:The Divided HeartThe Broken HeartThe Rebellious Heart","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1639CLCRXRAYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USVQH5S#wasThisHelpful","R1639CLCRXRAYA","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 3 in the trilogy about the Darnleys and the Kirallens. Set in the borderlands between Scotland and England in 1379, this is the story of Lady Maude Darnley, who when she was 14, suffered a horrible attack and ever since has suppressed the truth (even to herself) beneath a cold exterior. But at 21, she is barely holding herself together. Meanwhile, her father has been consumed with taking revenge on their enemies, the Kirallens, whose raid brought about the horrible event.An Irishman named Ronan Fitzgerald, who is a taibhsear (a healer and a seer, and in his case, also a bard), is dispatched by his teacher (who is aware of the facts but is sworn to secrecy) to Lord Darnley to offer his services. Ronan carries his own baggage from the past and knows nothing of his mission, but soon realizes that Lady Maude needs his help. He is patient and as they enjoy their music, she slowly begins to reveal her past and the horrible event that changed everything. But can the horrible event of the past and the terrible revenge it produced be made to come right?This is a very different historical romance. It is really the story of one woman’s struggle back from a horrible event to find love in the arms of her healer (a patient falling in love with her therapist, if you will). And Ronan, an insightful and gentle man, finds the woman who can hold his heart. Both are complex characters. It’s a well-told, intricately woven story, but likely not for everyone. The medieval stage is well set though there is not much history here, just the warring families on the border.It can be read as a stand alone story though there are references to earlier happenings and other characters.The Darnleys & Kirallens:The Border BrideLaird of the MistThe Linnet","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98JFM79YT0H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8ICNVY#wasThisHelpful","R98JFM79YT0H1","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love French’s stories and was pleased to find this one set in America at the beginning of the French and Indian war. It was a time when many Irish left Ireland fleeing the English for a better life. Such was Rory Desmond, who in 1743, helped by a young girl, fled to the Maryland Colony to become a tobacco planter.Ten years later, in 1753, the wife he loved is dead and with his debts piling up around him and a young baby, he decides to take a rich Irish wife who comes with a dowry. He returns to Connemara to wed Mary Aislinn, the daughter of a wealthy man. But Mary Aislinn wants to be a nun, so her illegitimate half sister, Linna O’Neill, who has the same name “Mary Aislinn,” devises a plan whereby she will take her sister’s place. Unbeknownst to Rory, she is the same young girl who helped him escape ten years earlier.When Rory learns the truth, he spurns Linna as breaking his trust. He sends back the dowry and, hoping to make enough money to save his plantation, takes off to be a scout for the colonial soldiers in their battle against the French and their allied Indians. When Rory's troops are massacred and word reaches Linna that he is likely dead, she refuses to believe it and sets out into the wilderness to find him.French was inspired to write this adventure story from her own family roots that began in Connemara, Ireland and lead to the New World. She has done much research into the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Indian tribes like the Shawnee, and it all comes together here. If you like early American history and marriages of convenience, you’ll love this love story. Linna is brave and courageous, though sometimes impetuous, and Rory is a man whose strength is only tempered by his love for red-haired lass.French says, “The hardships that early settlers faced in crossing the Atlantic and settling on the frontier amid overwhelming obstacles leave me in awe of their courage and fortitude.” Very well said.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Z772LAOUDSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI1KPIA#wasThisHelpful","R28Z772LAOUDSJ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally published as THE IRISH GYPSY, this is the story of Kitty Rooney, born to Irish peasants but gifted with a glib tongue, an ability to weave tales and an understanding of people. Set in the Victorian era, it begins in Ireland where Kitty’s grandfather and brother eek out a living on the estate of the O’Reillys. When famine hits, the O’Reillys, at the urging of their business-wise son, Patrick, move their tenants to Lancashire, England where they have three mills.The first time Kitty encounters Patrick, she is attracted to him, and he to her. Each has a plan for the other, Patrick to make Kitty his mistress, Kitty to become Patrick’s wife. But Patrick is a man of means and Kitty is a poor gypsy who is put to work as a maid in the O’Reillys’ home in Lancashire when Patrick’s father realizes what a beauty she is.Henley is a great storyteller so you are never bored. Shocked, perhaps, but not bored. Our modern sensibilities may find it have to believe that landed Irish gentry in Ireland would take advantage of a beautiful peasant girl, but it should not be surprising. I’m sure it happened all the time.The book is well-written, fast paced and takes you from one tangle to another as Kitty’s story reminded me of the “perils of Pauline.” In the beginning, she is told that she will have three husbands, so you know what’s coming. Patrick wants Kitty and she wants him, but he is always off on some business venture that leaves Kitty without protection, particularly of the noble kind. But she does meet some wonderfully interesting characters on the way back to Patrick’s arms.I recommend it for those who like the unusual.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBB63YXNQVZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IPZBVS#wasThisHelpful","R2CBB63YXNQVZZ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the author of NIGHTWYLDE comes another wonderful Irish historical romance.Set in Ireland in the Regency period (early 19th century), this is the story of Sir Aidan Kane, a war hero and a man who was wronged by the woman he married. He lives with guilt he may have killed her as some say he did. The child she gave him, Cassandra, is his greatest treasure. Now 15, Cassandra decides to give her father a birthday present, one she thinks he very much needs. But she fails to tell him it’s a wife.Norah Linton arrived at Castle Rathcannon in Ireland, expecting to find a lonely widower because of the letters she’d received, which unbeknownst to her, were actually written by Cassandra. Instead, she finds a man in a fit of temper over the whole idea until it occurs to him that a woman of untarnished reputation, like Norah, could help smooth the way for his daughter into society, a daughter who would otherwise face scorn for her father’s many sins.It’s a great story, well-told and brimming with angst. There’s a bit of the conflict between the English and the Irish as well since Aiden’s ancestors took their land from the Irish. Norah is a sensitive, caring and brave woman who sees beyond Aidan’s hard crust to the loveable man inside. Cassandra is endearing and the secondary characters satisfy.I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HDTJL453D80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671897454#wasThisHelpful","R20HDTJL453D80","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First published in 1997, and re-released by the author in 2011, this is a Viking story with an Irish heroine. It begins in Ireland in 805 A.D., but then, with a Viking raid, moves to the land of the Norsemen where Gillgannon puts you in the middle of the Viking culture.Fiona of Dunsheana, daughter of an Irish chieftain, faced a marriage she didn’t want, one arranged by her father. Being a clever girl, she conceived of a bizarre plan to avoid the marriage by giving herself to a Viking prisoner, Dag Thorsson, which would render her unworthy. Though she goes to Dag and sheds her clothes, he believes she’s one of the fairies he’s heard about and is too injured to do anything anyway. Taking pity on him, Fiona tends his wounds. He recovers—just in time for a Viking raid by his brother where Fiona is taken captive.Fiona is allowed to live because she saved Dag’s life. Immersed in the Vikings’ culture, she is exposed to a language she does not speak and is dependent upon Dag’s protection. Amazingly, Dag does not take Fiona to his bed, at least not until it’s her idea. Fiona has her challenges. She is mistrusted by the Norse for her understanding of herbs and her modern views that women should be able to control when they have children. Like many Norsemen, when the woman he is coming to care for is shunned by his people, Dag begins to wonder if his future might lie in Ireland.The pace of the story may seem a bit leisurely, but I appreciated Gillgannon’s research into Viking life reflected in the details of her story, the long houses, the clothing, the food. You get a picture of what it was like to live as a Norseman. Fiona is a strong heroine who continues to see herself as the Irish princess even though she is now a slave. She can also be foolish. Dag seems the understanding male with a soft side for both animals and women, especially Fiona. Some might find him a bit modern in his views, especially for a Viking, but there had to be such men even among the Norsemen at the time.Gillgannon has included a poem that is delightful. Here are some of the first lines:My VikingHe says he’s IrishBut I look into those eyesBlue as the North SeaAnd I know he’s an immigrantLike all the rest","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PKK2BG1XZ2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GCQ2IA#wasThisHelpful","R33PKK2BG1XZ2B","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew when I read LADY OF THE GLEN, Roberson’s poignant love story set in the time of the Glencoe Massacre in the Highlands of Scotland that her earlier work, THE IRISHMAN would be a treat. And it was. Oh, my.Set in England in 1617, this is the story of Elizabeth Stafford, a baron’s daughter raised in Kent and, through her father’s wrangling, given an appointment in King James’ court as one of Queen Anne’s ladies. Before she ever gets to court, however, a carriage accident puts her in the clutches of Kieran O’Neill, last of the royal Irish family of the O’Neills, who has come to England on a secret mission he hopes will win his country’s freedom.What can I say about a proud, dark Irish hero, descended from the Earls of Tyrone, who only wants to see Ireland free? And a high-spirited young Englishwoman, one of Queen Anne’s ladies-in-waiting, who rejects all her noble suitors for the love of such a man? The story is well-written, wringing with emotion and angst, and steeped in the history of the times. This one will keep you turning pages, I promise.Roberson has done much research for this story and understands the feelings of the Catholic Irish, persecuted and suppressed by a Protestant England. I applaud her for that. King James I is a character who would have Elizabeth for his mistress and we see the debauched lifestyle of his court as Elizabeth tries to preserve her virtue. Her dialog is often brilliant, her storytelling compelling. Her characters vividly portrayed.Note: The book was first published in 1986 under the title of ROYAL CAPTIVE but the author now has her rights back and decided the title she had in mind was more appropriate. I agree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XB0CTP8Q7V1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YH9Z9S#wasThisHelpful","R14XB0CTP8Q7V1","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you loved the movie, Last of the Mohicans, I think you will love this book.I discovered Mills’ books last year and am now one of her fans. Great storytelling, meticulous research and gripping love stories characterize her novels. This is yet another.Set in the 18th century during the French and Indian War (1754-1763) when British America fought against New France, this is the story of Sarah Spender, whose baron father gambled away their wealth leaving Sarah in poverty.Sarah has known the Hastings brothers, Devin, now Viscount Audley, and Adam, now Captain Adam Hastings, since they were all children. As Sarah grew into a beauty with spirit and uncommon courage, both Devin and Adam developed feelings for her. When her father died and her home is forfeited to the Hastings family for debts, Devin makes her a dishonorable offer, which she soundly rejects. Adam, unaware of his brother’s dishonorable act, offers marriage to Sarah. Having loved Adam all her life, she accepts.As Adam readies to leave with his regiment for the war in the American wilderness, Sarah learns she is with child and so Adam’s plans to take her with him must change; she will stay behind in England—where his brother remains, a rising political figure aligned with William Pitt.Much happens in both America and England in this well-written story. Mills has done the research to put you into the sweeping historical events, using real historic figures, such as William Pitt (in this story, Devin’s superior), and John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, who in 1756 was made the commander of the British forces in America (in this story, Adam’s superior officer). Adam will join Rogers’ Rangers and lead his own group of rough men.This time in American’s history fascinates me because it contains the seeds of what would become America’s war for independence. Mills brings it to life in a love story where two brothers love the same woman, who incidentally, is a very worthy heroine. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3348TDMWSM9WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWLQ914#wasThisHelpful","R3348TDMWSM9WQ","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Though she was also condemned for piracy, Callie was freed when gunpowder exploded causing a distraction and her bonds were cut--something her husband had arranged. She flees to Cornwall with 10-year-old Jem, her husband's cabin boy, where they take up life in the village of St. Swithin near Penzance as ""Caroline Jenkins, the widow of a missionary, and her son, Jem.""In Cornwall, Callie meets Sir Thomas Sedgewyck, the richest man in the area, who is taken with her and thinks to make her his wife. He buys her a wardrobe of clothes, which Callie is forced to accept. And there is another man she met on the beach--Finn Blount, the smuggler--and his dog Cyrus. Callie rather likes the man Finn, who is rough but honorable. She wanted to lie low, but it seems her beauty, an arrogant man's desires and the jealousy of other women won't allow it.This is a well-told story of second chances, of life after a great love, and of staying true to who you are. Du Bay gives us a wonderful glimpse of small town life in 18th century Cornwall with many wonderful details and at a time when pirates were active and smugglers dotted the coast. The characters are vividly portrayed and the heroine a worthy one. The love scene is very abbreviated but fits the story.It's not a long tale but it's a good one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40VZS9GG4L25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAA0GIA#wasThisHelpful","R40VZS9GG4L25","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well-written and well-researched, this is a story set in 1803 beginning on the island of Sanit-Dominque in the Caribbean (today modern Haiti) in the time of violent slave uprisings. Elene Larpent returns from school in France to find her papa has betrothed her to Durant Gambier, a man she thinks is harsh. Worried about whether he’ll be kind and gentle, her maid comes to her with a solution…a perfume that will enthrall any man and keep him her slave.Before Elene can be wed, the island’s slaves attack and she and her maid flee into the sugar cane field where she is rescued by the privateer Ryan Bayard.To escape the violence, a mulatto friend of Ryan’s hides them in a pit under his dining room…only 4’ x 7’…for 3 days—and of course, Elene’s perfume drives Ryan wild. You can guess the result. Since she has lost everything, when they escape the island, Ryan persuades her to come with him to New Orleans where much is happening in the change of countries ruling Louisiana. Ryan asks Elene to marry him, but she thinks it’s only due to the perfume and refuses—but is it?Blake sets her story in a time of great upheaval in the island and in Louisiana and did the hard research to make the background and historic details authentic as indicated in her “Author’s Note” at the end. The descriptions are rich, the dialog clever and there are some wonderful characters. There is also a mystery as people keep dying of arsenic poisoning and Elene is determined to find the culprit.I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9PSLA7VM91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00987MQ1W#wasThisHelpful","R1B9PSLA7VM91","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set during the War of 1812, this is the story of Maren Jones, an American who is sailing on her cousin’s ship from England to her home in New Orleans when a privateer by the name of Captain Hawk attacks and boards their ship. The infamous Captain Hawk is actually Jared Morgan, a patriot from Savannah who is working for President Madison and looking for traitors supporting the British. Maren’s cousin, Eric, tells her he is also working for the President, but it seems he is lying to her about many things.Maren met Jared when she was 15 and was so enthralled, she disguised herself as a lad and followed the handsome young man around the wharf. So, when he captures her ship and then steals a kiss, she does not resist. Jared finds her enchanting, but he is also suspicious of both her cousin and her.This is a tale with many twists and turns and wartime treachery as Maren and Jared come together to solve some mysterious happenings and find a way to be together.

"This is a wonderful novel from a winner of the Romantic Time Lifetime Achievement Award.Set in New Orleans and environs beginning in 1811, this is the story of Nicolette Vernet, a beautiful Creole girl, who falls in love with Jean Laffite, the gentleman pirate. I thought it was very brave of Weyrich to choose a real person for her hero, but she did it well and the story is absorbing.Nicolette dreamed of a handsome husband and a family of her own, but it seemed fate conspired against her. Her first betrothed was killed in a sword fight and, to avoid scandal, her father sent away to Paris to visit her Aunt Gabrielle. On her way home two years later, her ship is attacked by pirates. She is rescued by Jean Lafitte who assumes she was raped. And thus begins an adventure that takes Nikki on a very different course than she’d imagined for her life.Weyrich writes well and the story will keep you turning pages. It’s obvious she has done much research into the enigmatic figure of the pirate Jean Laffite. Her other characters are richly drawn, too, including Aunt Gabi and Jean’s two older brothers. I loved the romance that developed between Nikki and Jean and hated the bad guy that her father wanted her to marry. (Weyrich does a good villain!) If I had any negatives it would be Nikki herself, who at times seemed weak, yet at other times was brave and defiant.I love this description Nikki gave of Jean’s hair:“I’ll always remember the texture of his hair, how wonderfully warm it feels against my palms, how fresh and clean it smells, like sea air and Spanish limes.”A great story from old New Orleans in the time of the War of 1812. I recommend it.Note: This is a bodice ripper but it’s not the hero doing the bodice ripping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TMRFQLMC3A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LENEL1Q#wasThisHelpful","R4TMRFQLMC3A0","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First in the Nelson Tea series, this is the story of Lady Constance Danbury who in 1804 sailed from London to Spain to seek her Aunt Lydia's support to escape an arranged marriage to the horrible Lord Burton. On the way, her ship is attacked by the same pirate who killed her mother years before. Among his crew, however, is a spy--Percival Avery, the Marquess of Stanton--pretending to be a pirate to find the one responsible for his sister's death. Constance interferes in his plans, forcing him to take over the ship before he was ready in order to save her from the lecherous pirate captain.Though Percy knows Constance is the daughter of a duke, he takes her innocence and, in his own words ""well uses her,"" never telling her his real name or that he's a peer or the heir to a dukedom. In other words, he's a true cad. Yeah, he's a part of some super secret ""Nelson's Tea"" group, but still. Constance finds she is with child (no surprise there), and panic sets in. Must she marry the man she hates, or is there another option?Bone has talent and can write well as many passages attest, however, detracting from an otherwise entertaining story were repetitious passages and dialog, incorrect forms of address among the nobility, incorrect ship terminology and some highly improbable elements for the early 19th century.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1WNHNDRIQ3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWVD7D6#wasThisHelpful","R1S1WNHNDRIQ3L","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in England and Scotland, beginning in 1559, this is the story of Anne, Baroness Wharton, an earl’s daughter who was married by proxy to Baron Wharton and sent via galleon ship to join her husband in the far northwest of England. But before she could get there, Scottish pirates capture her ship. They are led by Calum MacLeod from Raasay in the Hebrides who needs the cargo to feed his starving people.Calum did not expect to find a woman on board the ship, much less the wife of the dreaded Baron Wharton who the Scots well remembered as having defeated them at Solway Moss. Calum decides to ransom the baroness, but soon regrets his decision when he becomes fond of her.I never thought of the Scots as pirates but that’s what Calum is, albeit with good motives. And, of course, the baron was such an evil villain one could not help but hate him. Some exciting action scenes await you in this tale from the Highlands as the Scots in the Hebrides battle the English. Jarecki does an excellent job in keeping you on the edge of your seat.There are a few issues, however,  with forms of address, wrong ship terminology and incorrect historical details, which some readers may not notice (I did). The story is otherwise a good one and enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DUGV7YYYPDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I094S7Y#wasThisHelpful","R28DUGV7YYYPDF","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in England, Scotland and the Caribbean, beginning in 1709 (and going to 1713), this is the story of Oriana, the daughter of a Norwegian princess and a savvy English sheep farmer on the border of Scotland (near Hadrian’s Wall) who went into the shipping business to transport his wool. When his son disappeared in the port of Calais, he raised his daughter to take the son’s place. And Oriana thrived in the world of ships and sheep, dressing more like her brother than the young lady she was.Oriana loved only one man, Gaerith Treig, a Scottish neighbor and fellow sheep farmer who plays bagpipes and makes her laugh, but who is unfortunately locked into a loveless marriage. His wife is a jealous harridan of a woman who is slowly going mad. One night when Gaerith and Oriana are at sea, she gives herself to him, and for him she wants to become a lady. On a trip to the Caribbean, she gets the chance to be made over in appearance (with some help from heroines of books 1 and 2 in the trilogy) and she takes it. Still courageous, intelligent and independent (my favorite kind of heroine), Oriana is now a woman men drool over.The story drew me in from the beginning and held my attention through its many twists and turns. It has great depth and detail. There are some great action scenes, wonderful characters and some funny episodes as the women try to make tomboy Oriana into a lady. Althea, the “auntie” who takes Oriana under her wing, is priceless. Oriana is a very worthy heroine, taking initiative, rising to every challenge and caring unselfishly for others. Gaerith is noble at heart and constant in his love for Oriana. There is history, too—of a tumultuous time in Scotland’s past (Rob Roy is a character). And all the twists and turns are neatly tied up in the end.It’s well written and a pleasure to read. I recommend reading the trilogy in order as some of the characters reappear in this last book.The Pirate trilogy:LADY OF FIRESEAFLAMEORIANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JV105ONZYF6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440167795#wasThisHelpful","R1JV105ONZYF6U","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first by Sandra Hill. I had been putting off reading one of her stories since I learned most are fantasies. (I prefer straight historical romance.) But then I got a list from her that told me which of those she’d written were not fantasy (see list below). While this one is not fantasy, it is fanciful. And witty, at times funny and, while not a serious historical romance and sometimes modern sounding, it is also very entertaining.Set in 952 AD, this is the story of Tykir Thorksson, a wealthy Viking trader in amber, who is sent by the King of Birka (present day Sweden) to find a redheaded witch who, the king is certain, has cursed his male part. The target of Tykir’s quest, Lady Alinor of Yorkshire has been thrice widowed and is done with men. She prefers to be left alone with her sheep. But her two ridiculous brothers want to betroth her once again, this time to a fat man Tykir dubs the Lord of Lard.Alinor denies she is a witch and resists going with Tykir, but he gives her no choice and so she and her dog and some of her sheep follow Tykir into Northumbria and eventurally to see the king. In a clever story, Tykir comes to believe she is a witch when things happen he cannot explain.It took me a while to get used to Hill’s style as she begins each scene with a line that forecasts what you’ll see (I thought it was someone’s thinking but it’s the narrator), but eventually I rather liked that feature. She does manage to drop in some historically interesting tidbits so that I could see she knew her subject well and had done much research for her story. The place names are all there, too. The characters are wonderfully drawn and some quite funny. Bolthor the Skald comes to mind with his silly verses.If you like witty, off beat historical romances with extended love scenes, this is a good one. I suppose all of Hill’s may be similar. I would read another of hers, particularly Rurik’s story (The Blue Viking).The list of her Viking romances that Hill says are not fantasy:The Tarnished LadyThe Bewitched VikingThe Blue VikingA Tale of Two VikingsViking in LoveThe Viking Takes a KnightThe Norse King's Daughter","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JG3KXWZRZ4KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7LZWVC#wasThisHelpful","R1JG3KXWZRZ4KY","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one was recommended to me by a Goodreads friend who likes Viking romance. It’s my first by Scott.Set in 10th century in Ireland and Greenland, this is the story of Yngveld Sveinsdatter whose father once contracted her to wed Ivar Wolfson of Dubh Linn. Since Yngveld lives in Greenland, Ivar sends his trusted Irish bodyguard, Thomas Lachlann, bastard son of Viking Lord Harald, to retrieve Yngveld. Meanwhile, Yngveld, whose father is dead, has no idea of the prior contract. Her biggest worry is avoiding marriage to a ruthless man in Greenland who wants her and her lands.Thomas sails for Greenland only to have his ship seized by the same evil man who is after Yngveld. When she seeks a ship and a crew to escape to Norway where she has relatives, she purchases a ship and slaves to sail it, which turn out to be Thomas’s ship and he and his men. Ah, but Thomas has no intention of remaining a slave…The story takes off and held my attention as Scott brought me into the Viking world, sailing on a Viking ship to Greenland. All that was to the good. And the hero and heroine are a worthy pair. I really liked Thomas. The middle of the book meandered a bit (at 441 pages, I really thought it a bit too long for the story), but the ending was exciting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IC3SDA05RV06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0843943440#wasThisHelpful","R1IC3SDA05RV06","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Castel has tackled an unusual period for historical romance…it’s early England. And it’s not Viking but it fits the period when Vikings were roaming afar. This is the third in her Anglo-Saxon series and it’s a well written tale of an arranged marriage between enemies.Set in 630 AD Mercia in Britain, this is the story of Saewara, widowed from an abusive husband and wanting to take the veil but her brother, King Penda of Mercia, a cruel man, has betrothed her to Annan, the king of the East Angles, their enemy who Penda defeated in battle. Annan resents Saewara because he was forced to take her as a bride, depriving him of the woman he wanted, who is now married to his brother.Castel does an excellent job of bringing this period in England to life with some real historic figures, including King Penda. Her characterizations were vivid and the story well told with much detail. And I like that it’s set in an unusual time in Britain’s history. I think you'll find this story compelling and enjoy the diversion to the 7th century!Anglo-Saxon England series:DARK UNDER COVER OF NIGHTNIGHTFALL TILL DAYBREAKTHE DEEPENING NIGHT","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96NJRW06WOE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHPKS9S#wasThisHelpful","R96NJRW06WOE5","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the late 9th century in Jutland (Denmark) and England, this is the story of Freya, daughter of Thorfast, Lord of Danehof, a powerful jarl, and Alaric, son of the high chieftain Aeldred, descendant of the kings of Kent in Britain, whose father and brothers were brutally murdered by Thorfast in a Viking raid.When her father rejects her because she is not the son he wanted, Freya vows to become a warrior who will lead her father's men a-Viking. Her guardian, Sven, the skald who sees visions tells her that she will be taken in a raid by a great bear. And so she is. Alaric, called the great Bear, now leads his people. He captures Freya and vows to make her his thrall (slave) and take his vengeance. Oh, yes, he does that. But in the process, Alaric discovers the Viking maid he has taken has captured his heart. What is he to do when he is betrothed to another, one worthy of a Saxon thane?Neri writes very well and weaves a complex story that kept me turning pages. This is a classic sage and covers several years in Freya's life, first a jarl's daughter and a warrior, then a slave who wins respect, then freed to wed a man she counted as friend and then to find her true home and her greatest love. There are wonderful secondary characters, richly drawn: Robin the skald, entertainer and spy; Sven who became like a father to Freya; Olaf who she loved as a brother; and Ilse who Freya rescued, both to love the same man. And so many others.Rich in historical detail based on much research into the era, Neri brings alive the 9th century and the villages of Denmark, Wessex and Danelaw in Britain. And it is so well done--simply superb storytelling.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZ275VYXQK5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0821718886#wasThisHelpful","R3GZ275VYXQK5L","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the Kingdom of Wessex, England in 882, this is the story of Brandr Óttarrson, a Viking jarl's son who attacks a Saxon village only to be sent fleeing with his men by another band of Saxons who decimate the village. Among the ashes, a wounded Brandr discovers a Saxon maiden, Lissa of Yriclea, the sole survivor. He thinks to give her a merciful death but she persuades him to take her with him and his uncle as they leave. On the condition she becomes his thrall (slave).His ship having left without him, Brandr and his uncle must journey across England, avoiding those who would kill them, including a Saxon who hunts for Lissa. As they travel, they pick up others along the way.Norris does a wonderful job of bringing the reader into the Viking mind. It is obvious she has done much research to capture the speech, their way of thinking and their culture. Brandr, being the son of a jarl, must marry nobility, not a thrall. But he can make Lissa his concubine, and he wants her. Lissa, sees this as a possibility and she wants to remain with Brandr but not as his concubine. Secondary characters add to the complexity of what is otherwise a simple but very well told story of a trek across England to reunite Brandr with his family. While there are no love scenes there is great chemistry between the hero and heroine.A worthy Viking tale with authentic terms (there is a detailed glossary). The first in the Viking Brothers Saga.

"This is the 3rd in the de Russe series. Set in 1431, it’s the story of Sir Bastien de Russe, first knight of the Duke of Bedford, who, while fighting in France, was assigned the job of guarding the captured Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc. During the course of her captivity, they became friends. Before he death at the stake, she asks Bastian to bring her remains back to England to bury. He doesn’t do that, but he does bring back a piece of her.The Duke of Bedford, orders Bastien to London to become the “Lord Protector” for young King Henry. For his service, Bastien receives lands, the title “baron,” and the hand of Lady Gisella le Bec. Bastien and Gisella get off to a bad beginning when Bastien shows up at the manor where she lives and she is engaged in a play he finds appalling.While neither desires to wed, they quickly get over that and a sweet romance develops. Le Veque does an excellent job of portraying their budding romance. For all his bravado with his men, Bastien is a softy when it comes to the women in his family and, uncharacteristic of a warrior, he is comfortable showing emotion, both tears and “giggles.”It’s a tale with many characters, some no doubt from earlier books in the series, and some historical, but it can be read as a stand alone. Le Veque develops the secondary characters well. There is much action and intrigue as the French patriots who want the part of the Maid’s remains Bastien took from France and his new wife misunderstands his feelings for the Maid.This is a long one at 418 pages and a lot of it is taken up with medieval life, the food, the travel and the obligations of a knight serving nobility, and the relationships between Bastien and his family, all of which are well described. The ending was sweet and the epilog endearing. Fans of Le Veque’s work will love it.The de Russe Legacy series, thus far:BLACK ANGELDARK KNIGHTBEAST","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BASTPSQUHSKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMMPP30#wasThisHelpful","R1BASTPSQUHSKE","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While doing research for my current work in progress, a historical romance set in London and Paris in 1782, I found this book and am so glad I did. Not only is it interesting in terms of how the two cities changed over time, but it's very helpful on specifics. For example, I had often wondered where a lady of the beau monde in London might grab a bite to eat while shopping. When I came across this, I was thrilled:""In 1815, Debatt's Pastry Shop in Poultry was known for serving 'sweets, soups and savoury patties' to 'ladies and beaux of delicate stomachs.' These establishments survived well into the nineteenth century, catering in particular to genteel ladies running errands in the city or shopping on their own...""For a scene set in a taverne in Paris, I found a lot in the chapter titled ""The Restaurant,"" including specifics of what was served, what they called the establishments and who their customers might be.If you like history, you'll love this; if you want details on the cities, you'll find those, too. The chapter titles are Rough Crossings (stories of getting across the Channel), The Restless House, The Street, The Restaurant, The Dance, The Underworld and Dead and Buried.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XNRGL224Y69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619024403#wasThisHelpful","R20XNRGL224Y69","A3LEH416AV3VTU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LEH416AV3VTU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even after the abuse I put my hands through, my nails still looked shiny and wet, without much chipping.  I am over the moon!  Maybe I will start giving myself manicures now.  I didn’t do that much before because it seemed like such a huge waste of time, especially when the polish only looked nice for a day or two.

" 4:52 MinsIts hard to write a review about a light bulb. Lets face it, there is nothing sexy about a light bulb.  You can’t eat it, you can’t play games with it.  It’s just a light bulb.  But, surprisingly, not all light bulbs are the same.  I guess comparing light bulbs is like comparing apples and oranges.  They are both fruit, yet they are so different from each other.  That is how I feel about this light bulb.  Sure, I have used light bulbs in my life.  Of course I have!  I have used many different kinds of light bulbs from Christmas tree lights, to flash lights, to lamps and to head lights.  Just from that list you can see how light bulbs vary.  Let me tell you why this light bulb is different.  First off, it is 7 watts and provides 2700-3200 K (according to the manufacturer).  The light given off is a cool white, not a yellowish tone so your room looks brighter and fresher.  The light bulb has high brightness and low power consumption.  You get a whopping 30,000 hours of light from one bulb!  Imagine how much money that will save you in the long run.  I think the biggest problem is that when we purchase replacement light bulbs we are short sighted.  We want it cheap and we want it now.  We need to start thinking smart.  Thinking about the long haul.  Thinking about an accumulated savings over the years to come, sort of like interest on a bank account.  Oh, I forgot to mention, these bulbs don’t get super hot.  I still don’t advise touching them while the light is on, but at least you won’t end up with a second degree burn!

"The first thing I noticed about this Orblue all in one onion holder is its size.  Looking at the picture it just looks like a pick for your hair.  It does not look big at all.  In my pictures you will see a picture of the onion holder next to a Sharpie marker.  This is so you can get an actual idea on the size of this product.  The product itself is awesome!  It has very sharp pointy ""teeth"" that can be pushed into just about any fruit or vegetable.  It holds tight so that you can slice thin or thick.  The product also comes with a cardboard blade cover.  I wish it had one in a sturdier material.  This thing is sharp and I do not want to reach into my silverware drawer and get stabbed by it.  This onion holder works way better than a fork.  That's what I used to use to hold whatever I was slicing.  I bet you can even cut thin slices of tomatoes with this.  The blades are long.  I love the handle part too.  It is made so you can get a nice firm grip which is what you need to keep your hands and fingers safe.  I really like this product and would recommend it.  I think it is a handy tool to have around in the kitchen.

"I do not know how to do Origami but I have always been fascinated with it. I love how you can take one square piece of paper and turn it into something beautiful.  I am also fascinated with how fancy restaurants fold their napkins into shapes.  I see really cool money folding ideas on Pinterest too.  I love this pack of Origami papers.  The papers are already cut for you so that eliminates that step.  The papers are so rich and vibrant in color and you get 1140 total in sheets of origami papers.  There are three different sizes in this pack too.  These papers are heavier than plain computer paper.  They crease neatly which I have found out is key in making origami.  If you purchase an origami book in addition to this set of papers then you have a perfect Christmas gift.  What child or crafting person wouldn’t love that!!

"I have never tried any of Pure Body Naturals products before so I had no idea what I was in for.  I can report that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this product is.  First I would like to talk about the scent.  It smells bad to me, very bad.  It is a sent like blueberry mud.  I was very turned off by the scent but I continued on with applying it to my face.  It has light texture to it. It is not as exfoliating as the body scrub I use on my face.  I like to really scrub my face because I do not want black heads.  The oxygen facial scrub doesn't lather or anything. I could not even see it on my face.  I did not think it was working. I rinsed my face and was shocked at how smooth and soft my face was.  That was my wow I love this stuff moment.  I have been using it every day followed by a moisturizer.  The directions recommend a toner but I go straight to moisturizer.  My face hasn't felt this good in years!  My other cleanser did very well for me but this one is better, plus it is less expensive.  My advice?  Keep an open mind. Don't let this products ugly look or bad smell turn you off.  You will love it!

" 1:58 MinsWhen they say stainless steel jaw bag clips for air tight seal they really mean it!  These clips are big.  The ""jaw"" part is long and has ridged teeth.  The spring is tight so the clip closes very securely.  These clips are great for bakers.  They are sturdy and will hold flour bags closed.  I used to have to tape my bag shut.  Then when I opened them to use again it was such a pain.  Often the paper bag would tear leaving an uneven edge that was even harder to close than the first time.  These clips eliminate that problem.  I know my baking products will stay fresh and ready for me when I am ready for them.  These clips have such a nice finish on them too.

" 6:44 MinsI am loving this yoga mat.  It is longer than my orange yoga mat that I purchased at Wegmans.  It is thicker too.  I will not say that this yoga mat is super thick, or that it is thicker than the rest because that is not true.  I can honestly tell you that this yoga mat from Ashram feels like it is plush memory foam!  Yes!  It feels thick and cushy!  You could use this yoga mat for camping.  It would totally make you not feel like you are laying on the ground.  To me that was the most surprising thing about this yoga mat, that and the extra length of course.  Also, I laid the mat out on my hard wood floor and it stayed in place. My orange mat slides.  This one has sticking power.  I don't know how they do that.  I did have trouble getting the mat out of the straps, as you will see in my video, but I am happy to report that it is very easy to do when you use two hands.  In summary, I am pleased with this purchase. I think it is great quality.  I think it is good quality materials and I think my daughter is going to try to take it from me!

"You will not believe why I purchased these locks.  We took our puppy, well actually she is one already but I still consider her a puppy, to the Halloween safe trick or treating even.  She was a pirate.  We brought the grand kids too so it wasn't weird if that's what you were thinking.  Anyway, somehow my little fur baby managed to unclip the lobster claw clip on her leash that was attached to the ring on her collar.  She went toward the street!  My heart sank.  She was so confused by all the people, costumes, traffic, etc.  Everyone started trying to call her, strangers, us, everyone,  She got even more confused.  Miraculously she came to me safely.  My husband and I took turns carrying her for the rest of the event because I was so afraid she would slip off her leash again. When we got home we inspected the clasp, the leash, the collar, everything.  Nothing was out of place.  My little Houdini dog just got loose.  So, I decided I needed a pad lock so I can be sure my little fur baby never gets loose again.  I would never stop crying if something happened to my baby.  These locks work great.  They are small enough so that they don't add a lot of weight to my small pup.  They look sort of like they are jewelry.  Of course I only use one.  I do not think two at a time are necessary.  I feel so much better walking her now that I know she cannot get loose. I have never had an experience like this before with any dog, but then again, I have never had a dog like Sheli.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS800WICJ1O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0101BZMH8#wasThisHelpful","R1XS800WICJ1O2","A23LQ5DTU5DVXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23LQ5DTU5DVXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an awesome set of markers!  They  have an interesting tip.  It reminds me of an arrow.  It is slightly pointed at the tip but gets wide as it enters the chamber. I do not consider them fine tip or wide tip. In my opinion they are somewhere in the middle.  The colors are very vibrant.  There are several shades of your main colors so that you can give a blended look and add dimension to your art.  I purchased these because I recently got into adult coloring books.  These markers are perfect!  I love the variety of colors and shades, and the tips are just right for good coverage.  They are not too think or too thick.  My coloring pages really come to life.  Crayola makes such wonderful products.  I have tried other brands and for me, unless you want to spend the money and get artist grade markers, Crayola is the way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSI30YLM6RVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004UFOO#wasThisHelpful","R3GSI30YLM6RVZ","A23LQ5DTU5DVXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23LQ5DTU5DVXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great set of felt pads.  I love that you get 72 of them and that there are different sizes so there is one to fit almost anything!  I have hardwood floors.  When we purchased our house there was a shag rug on the living room and dining room.  Yuck!  It was like that 70's show!  I wanted our house to be pulled out of the 70's so we ripped up the rugs and redid the floors.  We rented a sander and went to work removing all the old stain and polyurethane on the floors.  They were in desperate need of repair.  Once they were sanded smooth, we had to carefully inspect the floor and re set any nails that were sticking slightly up.  Then came the stain and the polyurethane. We had three young children at the time and a dog.  Why am I telling you this?  Because I want you to appreciate how much work goes into a hardwood floor.  After doing all that work I want my floor to remain nice because I do not want to have to ever refinish it again!  That is where these wonderful self stick round felt pads come in.  By placing the right sized pad on to the bottom of my chairs, my table, my couch, my end tables, my tv stand etc. I am protecting it so that we will never have to do all that work again.  These felt rounds are also great for protecting your linoleum floors.  They too are a beast to replace, especially if you have the square tiles.  Each one has to be removed, all the old glue removed, and usually a sub floor put in before you can put down your new flooring.  So yes, it is very important to protect your floors surface,and it just makes sense.  You will be glad you took that extra step to put the felt on the bottom of everything.  Fridge, stove, everything!  I swear I hear my hard wood floor cry when someone drags something across it.  I wish I could but these on the bottom of every ones shoes too!

"This is my second purchase of kegel balls.  I am glad I purchased these because now I have something to compare them to.  I first noticed the difference in shape.  These kegel balls have two sets, one with one ball and one with two.  My other set is just a string of two balls.  You start with only one ball in and work up to putting the other ball in. Since they are connected on the same string, where do you think the ball that is out sits?  Yep, you guessed it.  I could not even bend over while I had a kegel ball in because it was very painful.  This set is different.  You have two strings with balls to choose from. It is suggested that you start with the string that has a single ball on it.  That makes sense, doesn’t it?  Then you work your way up to the string with two balls on it.  That string is obviously heavier and requires more muscle tone to keep it in.  These kegel balls are great because they come with an exercise guide.  There is a program laid out for you to follow explaining how you should use your kegel exercise balls.  If you are unfamiliar with them, they are medical grade silicon.  They are weighted.  When you shake them you can feel the weight.  It feel sort of like you are shaking an egg with the yolk moving inside.  They are attached to a silicon string type cord.  That makes getting them out really easy.  It is like pulling out a tampon.  To insert them, lubricate them with a water based lube then insert, again like a tampon.  They will not get lost so don’t even worry.  The cord like tail is plenty long.  Actually, it is easier to pull out than a tampon because the cord like tail is silicon, not a cotton string that gets moist and hides in your folds.  So, maybe you are wondering why you would use kegel balls.  Two reasons:  1. Enhanced sexual pleasure, 2. To help eliminate or avoid incontinence which can occur naturally with age.  I have a spinal issue.  My bladder nerves have been effected by this.  I take daily medication to prevent “leakage”.  The kegal balls are great exercise and of course they have the added bonus of increased sexual pleasure.  This set comes with a nice pouch that makes them easy to store, or you can keep them in the original package.  Just be sure to clean your kegel balls before you put them away.

" 5:27 MinsIn spite of what other reviewers said, I personally like these pants.  I only wish they were bigger, or me smaller!  I have not washed them yet so I can't say if they fall apart like one reviewer said.  There are many variables in washing an item.  Anyway, I think the Leward Men's casual  jogging pants are very nice.  I would even wear them for dress or to the office.  I think they look somewhat dressy and comfortable.  Yes,  I am female.  I wear clothes labeled ""Men"" a lot.  And not just because I am a plus size.  I do not feel a label should decide what I can and cant wear.  I decide that.  Even with my short plump stature, I was able to put these on.  I would not wear them though because they are too small for me.  I don't want to ruin them by stretching them out. They are very nice.  The stitching is very good.  I love the deep front pockets and that there are no pockets in the back.  I also like the feel of the material. It is soft and light weight. It reminds me of those ""jeggins"", remember those?  Looks like jeans and feels like jogging pants or leggings?  You get that same comfort with the jogging pants.  I would recommend buying at least one size up, two to allow for shrinkage.  I recommend hanging to dry.  I also suggest putting knows on each end of the draw string to help keep it from raveling.  I love that the draw sting is wide and not the thin shoe lace type.  I think these pants are great even though they don't fit me properly. I will be giving them to my son.

"I have recently started dabbling in essential oils and am just learning about their uses and great benefits.  You should have tea tree oil in your home.  It is a fantastic flea repellant!  I have saved so much money by not having to buy flea treatments to repel fleas.  I have four dogs and the Advantix was about $15 per dose, times four dogs times twelve months a year.  Someone was getting rich and it sure wasn’t me!  I Do not put the oil directly onto my dogs fur/skin.  I mix it with some water and mist it on them.  If I see fleas or flea dirt, then I put the oil on a cotton ball and then it goes directly one the skin/fur where the fleas tend to hang out.  Tea tree oil is also great for burns.  Just put it directly on the burn for some soothing.  Tea tree oil can also be sprayed on people as a more natural bug repellant as opposed to purchasing and aerosol can of OFF.  Tea tree is less expensive, works just as well and is better for the environment.  This particular brand, First Botany, is 100% pure and natural so it keeps the efficacy most intact.  There are no toxins or no preservatives in this bottle, and it is bottled in the USA.  I love that it comes with a glass dropper so it is very easy to measure out exactly how much you want/need.

"I was very skeptical of this bunion corrector pack.  Really?  How can you fix a bunion without surgery?  This kit is for one foot.  The picture is very misleading.  If you have a bunion on each foot, which is usually the case, you will need two of these kits, otherwise, I guess you would fix one foot and then the other.  Personally I think it is just easier to purchase two kits.  The pieces this kit comes with are soft and flexible. They provide great relief.  You can feel the splint aligning everything properly only it does not hurt.  I was shocked at that.  The more you wear the splint the sooner you will feel the results.  That is why if you have a bunion on both feet I recommend purchasing two kits.  And the other great thing about this kit is that it is a one size fits most type of thing so you really don’t have to worry about getting the correct size.

"I love this tripod!  It is sturdy and even holds my camera, not just my phone.  It is flexible so I can bend the legs in all kinds of positions to get the camera shot that I am looking for.  The tripod is so flexible I can even wrap the legs around things, like a chair leg or what ever, and know that it will stay there and not drop my phone or camera.  An example of this is:  I was doing a review on dog shampoo.  I put my phone into the holder on the tripod then wrapped the tripod around my wire shampoo caddy in the bathroom.  Now remember, I am shampooing a dog.  Lots of soap and water.  The tripod held my phone securely, and I was able to position it perfectly to video my dog getting a bath.

" 4:09 MinsThis is a great product and just in time for your Christmas shopping!  The 12 money cards are a great value and let you scratch 12 people off you holiday list.  The cards are a card stock type paper, just like greeting cards you purchase at the store.  Each card has a red envelope to go with it.  I think the envelopes are thin, but they get the job done.  The inside of the cards have perforations that you can slip your money right into and it will stay laying out flat.  The front of the Christmas money cards is so nice.  The images are raised off the card front for the look of added dimension.  Some have glitter and it does not flake off.  The glitter shimmers soft pastel colors when in the light.  These attractive cards are good for men, women, children.  They are unisex and the quality is good.  These are higher quality than you would find in the Dollar store.  I do think the envelopes are very thin though.  I like a heavier envelope, especially if I plan on mailing.

"I enjoyed this little ebook.  Some of the projects were cute and looked easy for a child to do with adult help.  I found the directions to be easy to follow and I liked that there were color illustrations of the finished product.  The ebook didn't wow.  All the projects could easily be found on Pinterest.

"I love this bug bulb!  Of course I did not purchase it with the intention of spreading bug killer.  I wanted it because I thought it would be perfect to blow the dust out of my keyboard and it is!  I simply put on the straw like attachments and point the tip into my keyboard then squeeze the bulb.  It is easy to squeeze and the air that flows is enough to get the dust out of my keyboard.  The tip is very narrow so you get a more concentrated air flow. I can certainly see how this device would be perfect for spreading bug toxins.  It is certainly well made and easy to use.  It even includes a small funnel to fill your bulb up with whatever chemicals you are using.  It  is a great product.  I love that it has many uses that make my life easier.

"I think this necklace is really cute.  It is perfect for the girl who is a whovian.  I don't think this necklace is good for a guy because the pendant is not that big.  It is on the smaller more delicate side.  The chain is a nice length and both the chain and the pendant are of good quality.  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.

"I love the look of these sunglasses.  I am a Beatles fan so these glasses are right up my ally.  When I wear them I feel like a hippie and want to tell everyone ""Peace"".  They are great for allowing yourself to be taken back in time. The sunglasses have no UV protection.  They are a bit oddly shaped for me, meaning they do not fit right.  But then if you look at old photos of people wearing this type of sunglasses, or even regular glasses with this round frame, they all look like they don't fit properly.  I think that was just the way glasses were made back then.  That era did not have the same technology we have today.  So, I can say I feel these are authentic sunglasses from the Beatles time era.  Don't expect them to fit or protect your eyes the way sunglasses do today.  They are great if you are going to a certain look or if you are dressing up for Halloween.  For sun protection though, they are not practical.  Allow yourself to have some fun by donning these cool sunglasses!

" 2:33 MinsGet your hands off my light!  That's what I would scream at anybody trying to take this from me.  It is an amazing product and so much fun!  Everyone loved it and asked where I got it.  Mine shipped quickly and arrived on time for me to hang outside on my front porch for Halloween.  It really set the tone and alerted the trick or treaters that I was open for the business of handing out treats.  The younger children stood looking up eyes wide and mouths open.  The teenagers thought it was ""cool"", ""awesome"", ""sick""-I'm assuming that means something good.  The light was on for hours and was not hot to touch when I brought it into the house once we ran out of treats.  I love how the multi colored lights reflect all over like a disco ball and the blinking/light patterns are random and so awesome.  At some points the light looks like a UFO hovering.  That's why I call it my UFO light. I can certainly see how this light will be fantastic at parties, bars, whatever!  It is truly awesome.  The light has no power on/off switch or hardware to mount it.  There are grooves in the back similar to a smoke detector has for mounting.  When I used mine last night I did not mount it properly.  I knew it was to be only for a few hours so I just hung it by the cord.  The light is light enough that there is no worry of the cord pulling away from the light.  I actually love the portability of the light.  Others have commented that they wish it had a longer cord, or an on/off switch but to me it doesn't matter.  I can always use and extension cord and I plugged it into a power strip so I could just turn the power strip off.  I would not let those two good points deter me from this purchase.  I would even purchase it if I had to wear it on my head! OH, wouldn't that make an awesome Halloween costume?  Or making yourself into a robot and wearing it on your chest.  I know they sell battery packs that you can plug into.  I have to write these ideas down for next year!  Bottom line, this product rocks and if you plan on having a birthday party, or any type of party, even a back yard BBQ then you need this light!  It will take your party from fun to WOW!!  I must mention that I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review.  Thanks for that!

" 4:22 MinsWhen I first received these silicon lids I thougth, ""What kind of crap is this?""  Yes, I actually thought the lids were junk.  I could have not been more WRONG!!!  OMG! They are amazing!  I have been finding so many uses for them. I don't even look for lids for containers now, I just grab one of these fantastic silicone lids.  They are wonderful!  I can microwave them, I can use them in the fridge, the freezer, wherever!  They are great as tops for my drinks.  I like to drink in the living room and occasionally one of my dogs sticks her nose in my drink and accidentally knocks it over spilling the contents.  NOT anymore! When a drink spills that has one of these magical lids on it, the contents do not spill!  Let me say that again.  It is important.  The contents do not spill.  And, if you already have say the small lid on something and you need a lid but do not have another small lid, no worries.  A larger lid will fit on a container just as great as the correct sized lid.  I know, you can't believe it right?  I would not believe me either except I saw it. I used the lids.  I played with them quite a bit actually.  Watch my quick video and you will see the prof that these MULTI SIZE 6 SILICONE LIDS are the best thing since sliced bread.

" 5:17 Mins I am quite impressed with this dark spot correcting fade cream. It not only lightens, but it hydrates so well.  I have been using it for a little over two weeks and can actually see results. The lightening effect didn't happen right away.  As I said, I have only been using it a little over two weeks and am now seeing results.  But even if my skin wasn't looking brighter, my freckles looking lighter, I would still use this cream because it is so rich and hydrating.  My skin absorbs it so quickly and I have no greasy feeling at all.  My face feels soft, supple, hydrated and smooth.  Those are things I haven't felt for a while.  I am entering my 50's and things are changing. My skin is getting dryer and tougher looking.  I don't want to say leathery, but it is not as soft and bright as a younger person. It all sort of snuck up on me.  I am glad to have a weapon to combat the signs of aging. I don't really mind aging, but I want to age gracefully, not fall apart!  This luxurious is my shield.  It is truly a great product. There is very little scent so it is great for sensitive people such as myself.  I have nothing to complain about...except...I would like it to come in a pump jar.  That would help control how much you use and it would keep the cream sterile.

" 2:27 Mins This is a great grinder.  It is very well made and was not skimped on with materials.  There is a good weight to this product.  The grinder has a perfectly smooth interior and the grip is nicely tooled so it is easy to hold on to and easy to use.  The grinder even comes with a nice carrying bag.  It feels like hemp and has an opening wide enough to easily insert the grinder.  I love when kitchen tools come in bags, especially tools that have more than one piece.

"I got this ball to replace my office chair. As a student, I have to sit for long periods of time, which really is not comfortable. With the ball, I enjoy shifting around, adjusting my position, and even occasionally bouncing just for fun. I switch between the ball and my chair throughout the week. I love it.1) I'm 5'10"" and the 65 is the perfect size for me.2) I feel much better after working for long periods, especially in my back and neck. I think using the ball diminished my fatigue and discomfort. My feet feel better - they no longer fall asleep while I'm working and they don't dangle!3) Make sure to inflate, wait, inflate, wait, when you first get your ball. It needs to stretch out overnight before it will attain its full size. If you don't do this and try to sit on it right away, you will be disappointed because the ball will be tiny.4) It's easy to re inflate, the pump that comes with it is a good size for keeping in a desk drawer.5) Have some awesome exercise guides with it.6) It's a fantastic conversation starter at work, and other people in the office are starting to order balance balls of their own.

"This is a great product. Its is so easy to use and very good looking too. I tested on three different knives (low grade, high grade, and pocket), of which it sharpened them and left a quality edge.

The design seems very durable, and the body fits solidly in hand.It is so easy to used it for it has a bar for you to place your hand so you can hold the knife in place while I attempt to sharpen. I love that I can do this myself and not have to ask someone to assist me. It is a easy two step process the ceramic wheel is a sharpening wheel for fine sharpening and honing of your blade.

It can be set up for different people and it has memory so you can keep track of both people if needed. The cuff is good sized and will fit a normal sized arm to a very large sized one and doesn't cut into you at all.

"The pen arrived on time, well packaged, and intact. Both ends are capped for no mess. There is a little brush on the applicator end. It took quite a few twists on the other end to start to see the gel in the brush end, but the twisting is very easy. A little bit of gel goes a long way and applies easily. I like that you can put it exactly where you want to. It foams up quickly and didn't have a bad taste. After just one application, I noticed a difference. After many, I noticed a big difference.

"After trying out the First Botany Dead Sea Mud Mask for a few days here are my opinions on the product. First my initial concern was what is this stuff going to smell like? Well let me tell you it hardly has a scent at all but the little scent it does have is just sort of a fresh hanging out at the ocean smell that I enjoy. The mask comes in a nice size container and the mask is dark gray/blue color.To apply you put a thick layer on your face and upper neck leave on for 5 minutes. I loved the feeling while it was on. It did not sting or burn it almost had a cooling effect and a light tightness as I assume it is doing its job. To take it off you gently rub to ex foliate and then rinse off with some water and pat dry. After this you put on your favorite moisturizer and it gives your face a nice clean feeling. I really liked it. I put on my moisturizer and took a look at my skin and my pores really did appear smaller. I am hoping as I use this longer that the effect will continue. I would buy this product again and am really enjoying it. Please note that I did receive this product at a discounted rate or free in exchange for an honest review.

You just have to get used to tightening & untightening the mop handle when using the spinner. My kids call it a salad spinner for the floor! It works as well as it is intended to - like anything else you buy - follow the directions and you won't have any problems. Common sense also tells you not to fill the bucket up too much otherwise you will have a problem- although it is clearly marked on the inside of the bucket itself. I wish I had ordered this mop a long time ago - maybe I wouldn't have detested washing my floors so much. I just need a little more practice using the string type mop head - I am used to the old sponge style! I will highly recommend this mop to all!I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L76ER9WKUBNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R406V9I#wasThisHelpful","R2L76ER9WKUBNU","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been skeptical of automatic, or electronic Blood Pressure measuring devices, finding them to be not as accurate as the old fashioned, Cuff and stethoscope auscultation method, but this nice easy to use compact wrist device is pretty consistent.Measuring a relatives BP 6 times over a 30 minute period, with this, and then the old fashioned way yielded very close numbers.You literally can use it within a couple of minutes by just installing the included batteries, putting the unit on your left wrist, holding your arm up at a slight angle, pushing a button, and holding still for 30 seconds or so to get your reading.This stores up to 60 blood pressure readings with date and time. And the battery last longer too.I also like how compact the unit is, this makes it so you can put it in the neat little plastic case and take it with you and check your blood pressure if you have a concern during the day. It also appears to be pretty robust. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone.I received this monitor in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1VX45LG469C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACBKPJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1O1VX45LG469C","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so impressed with this pedicure device being a very particular shopper that I am compelled to give five star rating to it. First, my feet are beatific and look 30 younger. The device holds power and charge as advertised which I am impressed with. Additionally I have used it every two weeks and am still using the same sanding/roller heads.I have used sand paper,scrapers and yes even my dremel tool trying to soften rough callused feet. Nothing seemed to work and sometimes even caused me pain due to trying too hard to remove those hard calluses.I found the remover was very easy to use. It’s shape allowed for easy reach and rolling movement over all the affected areas. It was painless and I could see immediate results in the quantity of dead skin on the towel beneath my feet. I spent about 20 minutes the first time I used the Best Electric and did not notice any slowing of the file as I worked. My feet felt noticeably smoother. It took years for the calluses to build up, so I did not expect to completely remove them in just a couple tries. I recharged the remover and tried again a few days later. This time, I used the device on two separate occasions without charging in between. The roller worked as effectively on the third use as it did on the first, it did not slow down while in use. The roller is easy to remove and clean with the brush that is provided and can be rinsed after each use.I would highly recommend this product to everyone.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIIF8K0XY325/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH7TFWI#wasThisHelpful","R1EIIF8K0XY325","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say the performance of the 9090cc shaver is one of the best in the market. The shaver removes all hairs, be it a one-day stubble or three-day beard. With a three-day beard though, you will have to perform a few more steps to completely remove the stubble.The shaver is designed in such a way that it is easy to grip with your hand and maneuver it across your face. The machine is a lot quieter than other shaver.With the series 9, removing long hairs is very easy. The razor of this Braun shaver captures all long hairs perfectly and shaves them without a problem. The double trimmers with the HyperLift&Cut and Direct&Cut ensure that all hairs are completely removed.As for the cleaning station, there is not much to say really. After connecting the razor and pressing the start button, the cleaning process immediately starts. The cleaning liquid is flushed out of the cleaning cartridge through the shaving head thereby cleaning it. The used (dirty) then flows back into the cartridge. The cleaning station does a perfectly good job of hygienically cleaning the shaving head without a problem. It leaves behind a clean, hygienic and fresh smelling shaving head. It is one all in one product the certainly delivers on its promise.I did receive this product as part of a promotion from the brand in exchange for a review, however all opinions are 100% honest based on my own experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIM6DFS3SL6YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X49PTKA#wasThisHelpful","RIM6DFS3SL6YW","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My face felt really fresh and clean after using this facewash. I like the orange color of the bottle, it is a good color to remind me that the cleanser contains Vitamin C.

"I have traveled a lot these years and never had one of this luggage scale. I used this small scale to test the luggage weight at home before checking it at the airport. It is beyond my expectation that this tiny, not expensive thing can tells so exactly as what the luggage weight at the airport. It is a really good way to avoid overweight charges for me. There is one bonus point. the LCD display comes with blacklight, which eases me to read clearly in low light.It is easy to use this. There are two buttons , one is for turning on and resetting, the other is to change the units, like kg, lb. Just strap the belt and press Z/T button. Hook the luggage and the weight display comes.

"I just received my scale and couldn't be more pleased. First of all - it is beautiful. It matches perfectly with my doctor's scale, so I am convinced of it's accuracy and overall pleased . I have a very small bathroom and must move the scale but recalibrating it each time takes only seconds of stepping on and then off and on again.  Since I have been losing weight I love the ""last weight"" tracking each time I weigh myself. This scale seems to be a quality made, accurate and beautiful item and an especially good buy. I recommend it highly.You don't have to tap it to turn it on, just step on. It blinks when its got your measurement, but if I step off before it blinks it still works. You step off, and the measurement is held for a few seconds so you can read it. If you are too large to see what you are standing on, that's a fantastic feature. Then the display changes to green and shows you what the last reading was before the one you just took.

"I've been looking to try out a new pair of workout gloves because I'm doing much more Crossfit these days and I needed something for my hands! I tried out B Nooch gloves because I read that the padding on the palms did a good job of protecting your hands but still didn't make the gloves bulky and make it hard to grip things. I have found this to be absolutely true.These gloves are made very well and have taken a beating so far, so good. I should say that I love the wrists straps for their tight support on everything.

"These are great: grippy, comfortable, and size as expected. I don't always want to do yoga barefoot (we have a yoga club just starting at work, and I don't like to be barefoot on the conference room carpet) and these are a great alternative that still allow the toes to stretch and move. Normal socks slide around the feet too much. I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up getting a couple more pairs.These are the best because they do not twist around on your foot, because the toe compartment keeps the socks the correct way, while doing different movements. Perfect for doing yoga exercises, or just to keep feet warm without slipping on wood or tile floors in your home, or to pack to use while traveling instead if big bulky heavy slippers.I received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N528MKQL363N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCB21U0#wasThisHelpful","R2N528MKQL363N","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This konjac sponge from Wonderpiel is great, I buy these regularly to wash my face. This type of sponge gives my face a nice cleaning massage each time I go in the shower. It really helps the soap stretch also because it doesn't take much to fill the sponge with lather. The konjac sponge is really soft and yet gives you nice exfoliation without damaging your skin to get it. The charcoal is supposed to add to the cleaning and help extract toxins from your skin. You really don't even need to use soaps with these if you choose not to. Just a great tool for cleaning your skin.I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IDD07J9DVFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1WOYC0#wasThisHelpful","R35IDD07J9DVFL","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- The sound quality is GREAT. The sound is smooth and comes in clear. It handles heavy bass music really well. The volume is also really good and it packs a good beat.- Call quality: I made a few calls, the sound quality was super clear for both receiver and me.- Noise cancellation feature and when tested at the gym, all of the outside noise was blocked very well.- Bluetooth pairing is easy and does not drop intermittently. Very nice range.- These earbuds are extremely comfortable! The ear clips are a nice addition as they keep the buds from moving or falling out.- The earbud size is just perfect to fit in my ears.- It has On-ear controls for calls and music. On-ear music/call controls help avoid removing earbuds from ear or dealing with tangles wires.- Charging slot is a common micro-usb connector so you can charge these headphones from your laptop or wall charger or car charger.- In addition to earbuds, Silicon included nice pouch to store this earbuds, usb charging cable plus few extra earbuds for replacement.Cons:- I would love to have it in few other color options.I received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IN3U5A8VLQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V45K5YQ#wasThisHelpful","R32IN3U5A8VLQW","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These hangers definitely keep your clothes on them...much better than plastic hangers. I have a number of slinky dresses that kept falling off the plastic hangers I had. The velvet on the hangers definitely keeps the dresses in place. I also take them with me when vacationing on cruise ships. They never have enough hangers in the cabins, and because the hangers are so thin, they don't take up much room in my suitcase.Also these hangers will make your closet look amazing. They hold everything thanks to the velvet covering so no more worrying about delicates or dresses falling off.

"This works great, smells great, easy to use... PLUS it sanitizes- great because I have two dogs and am regularly invaded by teenagers. Then today I went to clean the washable filters in my vacuum. I'd let them go way past sensible and finally had to wash them because they made the whole house smell like a smelly old dog. Problem was, nothing would get that doggy smell out. I tried dish soap, laundry detergent and even vinegar (there are only so many products that won't ruin a filter or the plastic casing). Then I tried Carpet afterlife to see if it makes any difference and sprayed it on there. I gave it a minute, rinsed it well, and guess what?

"The product is as described on the website. This screen was a breeze to put up, snaps closed behind you with an audible click. The dogs learned how to go through it in about 5 mins, and now think it's grand that they can let themselves in and out. And no more door getting stuck, right when you have an armload of stuff that is threatening to fall from your arms at any moment. This screen appears to be very strong and durable, and comes with extra tacks that help hold it in place, while being invisible. I had to maneuver the screen around my doorbell, and it was very easy to do. If you happen to make it a little too tight to where it doesn't close, simply pull it off the velcro strips and reposition it.I like the stripe design that it has it it. There isn't a whole lot you can do with these black screens but this stripe give it a bit os style versus a plain screen.

"I have been using Eye Cream For Dark Circle for about four weeks now. I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness. Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .) to mild rather quickly. The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit. I am hopeful that with continued use that both issues will be reduced. However, this product has definitely improved the appearance of the skin around my eyes. It is an effective moisturizer, and seems to decrease the puffiness of the old eye bags.

"No wires. Yay. Quick charging. Easy to pair. Quality sound. People usually play a lot more money for headphones that sound this good. The Direct Beat Systems headphones are steal! The sound is clear, it does a good job at blocking outside noise, and the bass is awesome! I also love the design. I love the sleek look of white headphones in general. It is also worth mentioning that the headphones can be folded which makes it easier for travel.They are soft around your ears but firm enough to where they don't fall off your head.I was blown away by the sound quality of these headphones. The volume is very nice, you do not have to turn your device all the way to be able to hear while using them.The other great feature is Bluetooth: Paired super easily and maintained connection. Flawless. Microphone in headset means it can take calls as well. Super nice feature. It has all controls like volume, next song selection etc. on headphone itself.These seem to be a really nice set. They work with cell phone(Android, iphones), mp3 players, computers and laptops, tablets, pretty much any device.The package contains bluetooth headphone, a micro-USB to USB charging cable, and audio cable jack.I highly recommend these to anyone who is in the market for an affordable, yet great quality headphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS52H054K8W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMJJCO4#wasThisHelpful","R1AS52H054K8W3","A2BD1KGJV0DPX7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BD1KGJV0DPX7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fitoby sleeves are an absolute bear to get on. I'm very impressed with the build quality of these sleeves. The stitching is excellent, the neoprene feels great and the overall feel is that of quality.

"This is the best hair styling pomade I have come across.It has a good flexible hold which I really like. The best part is that it doesn't flake. It's better than other gels I've used .

Just the right amount of hold and doesn't make my hair stiff.I use Le Garcon pomade every morning and it keeps my hair either spiked or other styled all day long also it gives my hair the shine affect I am looking for.

"I have two dogs so I was afraid to use crazy chemicals on the floor and beds. My pitbull licks everything. Literally, everything. This killed the bed bugs instantly. I feel so lucky because everyone says that it takes multiple attempts and months to get rid of them but it took us one try. I washed all clothing, bedding, and vacuumed. I also sprayed this everyday instead of every week or two. Two weeks of spraying and we no longer saw them at all! And I woke up with no bites!  It does not smell like other bug killers and it last long even after heavy spraying on floors, bed and furnishings. The spray pump really works well and is simple to operate.

"I've noticed there are two distinct types of books about India that come across my reading desk.  The first is those books that showcase the lives of the privileged; the people who are without caste, who don't struggle against poverty and the other injustices meted out by a flawed system.  The second are books that really dive deep into the lives of the underprivileged.  Those books tend to either produce an underdog who rises above or serve their purpose by educating the reader about a life that, quite frankly, 99.9% of those lucky enough to be reading the book, will probably never have to experience.  Under the Jewelled Sky by Alison McQueen is one of the books that fits the first category.That's not to say it wasn't a good book.  I was thoroughly engrossed, I'll readily admit to that.  But what I become completely enthralled with was a life that, on some level, I could relate to.  The forbidden romance, the struggles that, while terrifying in the form of Sophie's mother, could be overcome and were overcome by the removal of Sophie from her life.  What I felt was lacking was more of the story of Sophie's first love.  Instead, after making his brief and permanent mark on Sophie's life, he disappears, leaving me with only Sophie to follow.So I guess what I would have loved to see more of in Under the Jewelled Sky was a split narrative. While Sophie moved on with her life outside of India, I wanted to know what Jag was doing, what his life was like, how he managed to survive after the blow dealt to his family with the discovery of the forbidden romance.  Unfortunately, aside from a mere glimpse of Jag, the story focuses more on Sophie.Now, don't let that influence you, because I will say that Sophie's life is pretty fantastic to follow.  She's a strong woman who feels the pull to return to India and does what is necessary in order to life a ""normal"" life while still capturing that dream.  Still, compared to what Jag's life must have been life, I felt like I was being robbed a bit.  It's due to that feeling only that this book does not get a full five stars from me.I enjoyed McQueen's writing and I am looking forward to seeing what she does next.  I just hope, in her next novel, that she explores more the two sides that make up forbidden love and gives us more of a rounded picture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PC66HZRDRHGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1409131181#wasThisHelpful","R3PC66HZRDRHGX","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's settled.  I'm a fan, Alex Bledsoe.  I'm ready to dive in and explore all of the titles I've missed (especially the Eddie LaCrosse books - where have these been hiding?).  I haven't been moved to laugh out loud at a book in a long time and just a page or so into He Drank, and Saw the Spider, I was snorting and looking around quickly after to make sure I hadn't been heard.  Although this was #5 in the series, I never once felt like I was out of my depths.  Everything made perfect sense and I felt a connection to both Eddie and Liz that was strengthened as the story was told.This book has it all.  It's urban fantasy - medieval style.  Everything that is great about those times - sword fighting, kings and queens, intrigue ... but cleaned up to include modern euphemisms and not quite so much smelliness, making the sexy times much, much sexier.  And the quest storyline was pretty damn strong too.  I do love a good quest storyline.He Drank, and Saw the Spider takes you on a journey, that's certain.  From the rescue of a baby that involves the slaying of a bear to the 16 years that pass by before that baby is grown and is in danger once more, this time as a young woman.  There's romance, cheeky remarks, strange creatures that tug at the heartstrings, and... did I mention sexy-times?  Those were unlike anything I've read in urban fantasy as well - there's a scene between Liz and Eddie that had me laughing out loud.  Have I mentioned I just thoroughly enjoyed this read?If you are wanting series fantasy, then don't go here.  This is a tongue-in-cheek, very clever book that combines some of the best elements of urban writing and yes, some of the worst, and manages to make quite the story out of them.  It's fairly predictable, but it's entertaining, and that's what I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTNE4H2WX5FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765334143#wasThisHelpful","R2GTNE4H2WX5FO","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really, really hooked by the premise of The Detainee.  I've been in the mood for a good, gritty, adult post-apocalyptic book and, having read Traci Slatton's work in the more recent past, I really wanted to get a fix of the genre before her next book releases.  I'm impatient like that sometimes.  So The Detainee by Peter Liney looked like it just might satisfy my craving and, for the most part, it definitely did.I will say this, however, before I get into the praise-worthy bits.  There were times that things seemed just a bit implausible.  The entire explanation for all the fear, and the subsequent complete change of atmosphere later on in the book pushed the boundaries a bit for me.  But, the good in the book was strong enough to overcome those little nagging thoughts in the back of my mind.  I pushed them aside and continued to read in gleeful pleasure.The Detainee isn't really a thriller or suspense novel.  It may seem like that, at the get-go, but I believe that sort of beginning is necessary and that Liney did a great job setting the mood for the book as a whole.  ""Big Guy"" Clancy is living a miserable excuse of a life on an island in an age where Big Brother is even more invasive then the loudest-mouthed privacy advocates today could dream of.  Imagine being completely policed, at all time, and not only policed, but arrested, tried, and potentially executed all in the space of mere minutes, or even seconds?  That's the world that Clancy is living in throughout the story of The Detainee.There's also quite a bit of the survivalist feel throughout the book.  Between the tinkering of one character, the assured actions of another, and finally, the take-action attitude of Clancy, I felt myself getting caught up in the day-to-day details of living in a place, or a world, like that described in The Detainee.I'm glad I requested to read The Detainee by Peter Liney.  It seems to be running a bit under the radar and I hope it gets more attention as time passes.  It certainly kept a grip on me and I'm looking forward to seeing what Liney comes out with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ORZQLPP52CCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651085#wasThisHelpful","R1ORZQLPP52CCA","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm at a bit of a loss on where to start with the short story collection of Hassan Blasim.  It's been my goal this week to read with intention; to explore works by authors that are not white and/or male.  That's not to say that I'm able to fully get away from works by white men (or women), but that I wanted to broaden my worldview and start seeing things that have been in my life, sometimes in the background barely paid attention to, for some length of time.  The war in Iraq is one of those things.  So I was a bit nervous going into The Corpse Exhibition: And Other Stories of Iraq and the first story, right away, knocked me off my feet.  I felt weighed down and seriously put in my place.  I had no idea. None.  It took me some time to recover and then I picked up the next story, determined to read more.What a rewarding experience it has been, and I don't mean that in a way that implies that I got something great out of these books.  Don't get me wrong - anytime I get taken to school and put in my place, I consider it to be a good thing because I need that reminder that I have it good, I have it great.  I'm living in a place considered by most of the world as paradise, I'm free to practice religion and politics without fear of repercussions.  I have a tumbler full of water sitting next to me that speaks of pride in my hometown and my iphone is charging and beeping at me, reminding it's time to go to bed so that I can wake up tomorrow and enjoy a day in the sun, doing what I love to do.But the people in the stories of The Corpse Exhibition: And Other Stories of Iraq are not as fortunate as I am.  They are not given the opportunity to do what they love; instead, they are given hopeless choices, choices that make me wonder how on earth a person could decide.  I was completely wrecked by the story of a son's love for his mother and the lengths that he will go to protect her.  I was overwhelmed by the multitude of stories and symbolism in the tale of a newspaper man who thought he could make a quick buck by exploiting someone else.  But most of all, I was so incredibly grateful that I live in a country where a book like The Corpse Exhibition: And Other Stories of Iraq is ready and available for me to read and is not banned nor forbidden.  What would the world we like if we were all unable to experience, through books like this, what life is like on the other side?  And what would the world be like if more of us chose to do just that?The Corpse Exhibition: And Other Stories of Iraq is not an easy, simple read.  It's gruesome and horrifying and real and it will completely take control of you while you read it.  While, at times, the symbolism is a bit heavy and hard to understand (some of the endings of the story, I admit, completely went over my head), I think what I ultimately took away from this book was well worth the time taken to read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E65JQQSRUC4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCPHRO#wasThisHelpful","R2E65JQQSRUC4T","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been stewing on this review for quite some time now.  You see, I read The Sun and Other Stars by Brigid Pasulka in early December.  I couldn't wait, because it was in my hands, I loved her previous (and debut) novel, A Long, Long Time Ago & Essentially True, and the cover..it just taunted me every time I opened my e-reader.  So I read it.  And it was completely unlike anything I expected.  You see, I went into The Sun and Other Stars thinking it would be similar to Pasulka's previous novel, but it was so very different - or so I thought.But now, as I sit here months later, thinking back on the story, on the parts that really stuck with me, I realize that in spite of having a completely different setting, the magic was still there for me.  I know absolutely nothing about football (or, as we call it here, soccer), yet I was completely sucked in by the story that Pasulka told in this book.  The reason that the story has stuck with me for so long in such an intense way is because, in spite of the sport involved and all of the jargon that's part of writing and reading about that sport, and in spite of my lack of interest in it at all, I still absolutely loved every element of The Sun and Other Stars.What Pasulka does best is write romantic love stories.  I'm not talking sparks flying, instant love between two gorgeous people who have no flaws, love stories.  I'm not talking Twilight creepy stories or love stories that seem as if they are teetering on a very high cliff, ready to fall off and into pieces at the merest breath of a wind.  I'm talking a love story that grows from the roots up - that takes two seemingly ordinary people and makes them extraordinary, simply because of the love they share for the other person.  That's what The Sun and Other Stars is about, at its core.  It's about love: not just romantic stories either, but love between family and friends, and love within the community.I identified so well with The Sun and Other Stars in spite of our differences.  I don't speak the jargon that Pasulka had to beef up on in order to write a story that used sports as its platform, but I know what her heart was saying through the medium of this book, and I have to say, I'm just as in love with what she wrote here as I was with her previous book.  I'm a fan and cannot wait for her next release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SLIQ1AK5B39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451667116#wasThisHelpful","R27SLIQ1AK5B39","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to admit that I'm pretty much over the narration style that involves shifting back to a time in history then jumping forward into the present to connect things.  Jennifer McMahon manages to make it a bit better in The Winter People by making some of the historical narrative present itself as diary entries.  Still, there was a lot of dates happening at the beginning of various sections in The Winter People and it never fails to confuse me.  Not once.  I mean, who really pays attention to dates - years even, let alone the actual month and day?  How do you do that if you do? I always, inevitably, have to flip back and remind myself... very inconvenient in an ebook format too, by the way.Thankfully, the dates were not the only thing in The Winter People helping keep this reader on track.  McMahon offers up a compromise by putting various character names at the start of each change in narrative and this I could handle.  Honestly, if it hadn't been like that, I may not have pushed forward and allowed myself to get hooked by the book, that's how much I hate dates.  I'm glad the names were there, I'm glad I pushed forward because folks, this ghost story had me keeping my lights on last night.If you pick up The Winter People by Jennifer McMahon, be prepared for some pretty gnarly superstitious stuff to be going on.  This book has it all - historical events that involve blood and gore, spells, myth and folklore, mystery, strangers connected via unseen forces... it's all there.  And it'll have you guessing because, if you are anything like me, you'll be thinking you have it all figured out but nope, McMahon comes through again with one of her books and throws a wrench into what seems to be a carefully crafted story around an event that you start to think was never a mystery in the first place.The Winter People is unlike the other books of McMahon's I've read, but I knew when I picked it up that I was in for a white-knuckled read.  She's consistently been an author who has been my go-to when I'm having issues with a reading slump and I think The Winter People is a great addition to her repertoire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REH8XZCFTROE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538499#wasThisHelpful","R3REH8XZCFTROE","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Enchanted simply blew me away.  Seriously, folks, since when does a book about death row completely knock someone down, because that's what happened to me with this one.  I went into it thinking there would be a whole Green Mile vibe and walked away feeling as if I'd been suckerpunched.  Not only did this book completely absorb me, it made me reconsider everything I thought I knew about pre-judging a person.The Enchanted  is part real-life and part-fairytale, but a fairytale of the darker variety.  We are introduced to a nameless narrator, a man who is in a cell waiting for his death.  He is a voracious reader and, as the story unfolds, while he doesn't reveal all of what he's done there, it gets to the point where it doesn't even matter anymore.  Who we do get to really know, though, are several other characters whose lives unfold in front of that one prisoner, in a sense.The Enchanted  is a place where strange things happen.  There is a lot of symbolism in this book and it's impossible to catch it and understand it all on the first read-through.  But it doesn't matter, because the stories being told about the lives of those in the book are enough to carry momentum until the end of the book comes - and it does come quite suddenly.I think that this is a book that would touch anyone who decided to pick it up and give it a shot.  It's unusual, but not so strange that it would put off a casual reader.  If anything, it'll make that casual reader more interested in the fate of the narrator and the other prison guards, inmates, priests, and investigators.  The Enchanted is a very profound, elegant look at a life that isn't really a life at all.  And whose fault is that?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPI2UEF7A7MN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062285505#wasThisHelpful","RPI2UEF7A7MN9","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you would have told super conservative 17 year old me that I'd be reading a book titled Two Boys Kissing in 20 years, I would have thought you were not only lying, but you were going to hell for it.  Thank goodness I am not that 17 year old girl anymore.  One of the biggest areas of growth for me in the last decade has been a broadening of my worldview and an awareness of my own privilege.  While I understand that, as a woman, I still face some struggles, I need to also remember that there are others out there who are still being denied legal rights.  I don't often speak out politically on this blog, but I wanted to start this review with a reminder to my 17 year old self - a reminder that I was, and still am, in no place to be judge and jury and that I am here to promote peace and love, in a non-cliche way.  And this book by David Levithan, is an excellent reminder of the struggles that a portion of the population of this world faces every day.What I really enjoyed about Two Boys Kissing was the idea that the story was built on something that actually happened.  I mean, think about it, can you imagine locking lips with someone, anyone, for 32 hours and some odd minutes/seconds - still standing, mind you, unable to take a break for any reason at all?  The stamina that would take.  Now, why would you want to do something?  To merely break a world record?  That doesn't seem noble or even something that I'd be interested in cheering on. Yet the boys in this story take on an entirely different issue - they do this in spite of the fact that they have broken up, in spite of the fact that one of them has yet to come out to his family.  They do it for friends who have been abused and beaten because of their sexual orientation.  They do it to take a stance and say that no matter how much people want to brush them under a rug, they aren't going anywhere.It's a heartbreaking story as well.  Connor's story had me in tears.  I've been in a place in my life where something happened to me and I was unable to talk to anyone about it.  It about broke me.  I wanted to just crawl away somewhere and never be found.  Why do we, as human beings, make others feel judged like this?  Can you imagine making someone so afraid of what you will think of them that they don't tell you something and would choose to die instead?  That is what Connor struggles with and, again with Connors story, inspiration is drawn from a real life story.David Levithan blew me away with Every Day and with Two Boys Kissing, he once again made me think about being in someone else's shoes.  While I struggled a bit with the format of the book, I understand why he chose the narration style he did, but I think the story was strong enough that it didn't need that type of narration and, in parts, it almost seemed a bit gimmicky to me.  Still, this short book packs a powerful punch and I was thrilled to see it sitting in the featured section of my library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UMZG29UN8ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307931900#wasThisHelpful","R34UMZG29UN8ZZ","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really struggled with Clever Girl, I'm going to put that right out there first.  I seriously flirted with putting it down about five times, all before my usual minimum pages to be read before doing just that (63 pages, by the way).  But I pushed through and forced myself to pick up that book and .. around page 60, I finally was caught.  It's not often that I struggle like that for a book I end up rather enjoying by the end, but still.. my experience was tainted by those first 59 pages and, frankly, for a book this size (only 212 pages on my e-reader) that's a bit of an ouchie.So, Clever Girl did not merit a four or five stars from me.  The ending of the book was a solid three and a half stars to four stars, so it wasn't all lost, it was just that damned beginning.  I just didn't care about Stella and I was so confused by the cast of characters surrounding here (I still don't remember who a few at the end were) that I just kinda shrugged and pushed forward, hoping it would all work itself out.  It did, kind of.  But still, there were things left up in the air for me ... I wouldn't say resolved, because I'd have to know who some of the people were to resolve their parts.Where this book really shone was the writing.  It was downright beautiful.  I could be totally cliche and pull out all of the adjectives used to describe writing like this: lyrical, musical, flowing - but let me just say that the writing far outshone the story being told.  Unfortunately, I don't read books to read beautiful writing, I read them for a story.  That took second place here and it was far enough behind in the race that it almost didn't finish as a result.  There needs to be a good balance and Hadley didn't find it, in my opinion.I was sad that I didn't fall in love with Hadley's writing in Clever Girl.  I know she has other titles out and I was hoping that I would be compelled to seek them out.  Unfortunately, that won't be happening - however, if you would enjoy an extremely leisurely paced novel about a girl growing up in England from the 60's on, then check out Clever Girl.  It might just work well for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWDV542FDQ49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062270397#wasThisHelpful","R1IWDV542FDQ49","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for The Daring Ladies of Lowell.  I love historical fiction that centers around women's rights, especially when it surrounds the working class.  When I saw that this book was about mill girls I really, really wanted it to blow me away.  I know a little bit about the working condition of cotton mills so I was hoping to get even more of an education about the experience in addition to reading a story about the girls themselves.  What I got was a mediocre history lesson wrapped up in a somewhat cliche, and definitely predictable, romance.I wish that wasn't the case, I really do.  When I saw the direction being taken by Alcott I literally rolled my eyes.  It's predictable folks, from the first visit of a certain prominent family to the mill.  And not only is it predictable, but in a book about a valid part of our country's history, it's also really, really unreal.  Like, for the life of me, I couldn't see it happening.  I kept protesting, first inside, then actually in an audible way, as I worked my way through the book but no dice. The story had to go exactly where I was hoping it wouldn't.You see, romances like the one in The Daring Ladies of Lowell cheapen the story for me.  When I pick up a historical fiction about a serious subject, I want to see that subject treated seriously.  When the romance emerges and takes center stage it gives me this horrible feeling like it was merely being used as a prop to get the reader all swoony over some type of Romeo and Juliet situation.  That, folks, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.There are other historical fiction novels that deal with serious subjects in a more serious way...but if romance is your thing, Alcott's The Daring Ladies of Lowell isn't a bad read.  I finished it after all, it just wasn't for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALSVKH142JDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536496#wasThisHelpful","R1ALSVKH142JDK","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a confession to make.  I've been a Rainbow Rowell fangirl for about a year and I just finished reading a book by her.  As in, I've been drooling and eyeing my copy of Eleanor and Park since March 2013 but never dove in, never picked it up even.  I wanted to read it.  I was dying to read it. But I was afraid to.  So, instead, I semi-stalked Rainbow Rowell.  It wasn't until Attachments landed in my hands (and, coincidentally, it being her first novel published, I couldn't resist starting there) that I finally made the leap to establish contact with her writing.I don't normally review authors.  I think that there is a difference between an author and what they write.  I would never judge an author by a horrible character they put to paper, and so I would never judge an author by a perfect one either.  But there's just something about Rainbow Rowell.  First, her name is Rainbow and she also has that alliteration thing going for her.  Second, she lives in Omaha, NE - the place where I spent the first 17 years of my life (54th and Farnam, heck yeah).  Third, she has an active Twitter account where I have engaged with her several times.  I read about her in interviews, on Wikipedia, on blurbs and other blogs... so basically, right now I'm the Lincoln of our ""relationship.""And now, I've reached out and said hello with a book that reminds me so much of this ""relationship"" that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at it.  (Please, Ms. Rowell, if you are reading this I'm really not creepy.  I just really enjoy the above-mentioned things and the relationship is totally a not-creepy-at-all thing.  Still, if you ever come to Hawai'i I'd love to meet up for pupus!)So let's talk Attachments.  Part e-mail exchange between two co-workers (Jennifer and Beth) and part the story of Lincoln, an IT guy who reads those emails because they keep getting flagged and showing up on his computer as a result, this is probably one of the most quirky, true-to-life, adorable romance contemporary stories I've read.  I know gals like Jennifer and Beth and I am, as I stated earlier, remarkably similar to Lincoln (computer geek, loves D&D, adored the references to the 90's and I worked with computers during the Y2K ""crisis"").  I completely sympathized with the guy and loved getting to know Jennifer and Beth right along with him.Rowell writes with a very real voice.  Every character had such personality they leaped off the page for me.  Yet, there were tender moments too that had me choking back a bit of tears and appreciating the tact and delicate touch the situations were treated with.  I'm glad to know that my faith in an author I had yet to read paid off like this and I definitely think starting with Attachments was the right way to go for me.  Check it out - you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1AGK19NNM5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525951989#wasThisHelpful","R2F1AGK19NNM5N","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my week of exploring the world of Veronica Roth, captured in the books of the Divergent trilogy.  Unfortunately, after a strong start and middle, Allegiant fell in my esteem.  The reason for this is quite simple - and not at all tied to the ""shocking"" end that had the blogosphere in an uproar (I remember seeing all of that and, having yet to pick up Divergent, just dismissed it because I didn't want a spoiler to hit me.  I wasn't spoiled, but I wasn't surprised by the ending either.)  That said, there will be a bit of spoilers happening in this review because it's the third book in the series, so don't read on if you haven't read the first two: Divergent and Insurgent.Here's where Allegiant went wrong for me.  The dual narration technique.  All this time, I've been in Tris's head.  Four has had a mystique about him and, while I still don't get the whole romance angle (except from a marketing point of view), I liked the bit of mystery.  Imagine my complete and total disappointment to find that he thinks remarkably similar to Tris.  So much so, in fact, that there were times I had to flip back to see just whose head I was currently in.  Four was nothing like I imagined him to be, and I really didn't like him that much after being there in his head.  Not at all.That said, I think Roth overstepped in Allegiant as well.  Too much in too few pages.  Too many factions vying for control weakens them all, and the story by default.  I was so confused that, by the end, I was happy to actually see something happen - although the dual perspective tipped me off from the start on what the surprise might just be.  I was so disappointed, because really... Divergent was well thought-out and put together but by the time Allegiant began to move it became sloppy and hard to keep track of.  Too many people making stupid decision, too much happening out of character (how often have you seen people step down just like that? *snaps fingers*), it just didn't make sense.  I understand that there needed to be some kind of neat, package ending all tied up with a bow but the series would have been better ending on chaos and left out there in the air, for the reader to speculate.  I hated feeling pigeon-holed into fully believing all of the really far-fetched things that were happening.So, while I thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, Allegiant was a dud for me.  I would recommend the series, still, because the first two books carry it (and I'm hoping the movie ends up better since we are, thankfully, free of what's inside the characters heads).  But watch out for this book, man.  If you loved Four going in, you are really gonna have a hard time with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9THIILMVXFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006202406X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9THIILMVXFN","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my week of exploring the world of Veronica Roth, captured in the books of the Divergent trilogy.  I remain solidly in the four stars rating after reading Insurgent, let me just start off with that.  Roth continued the pace set up by the first book of the trilogy and her world grew stronger with the revelation of new and interesting twists and turns.  This review will have some spoilers (unavoidable in subsequent series book reviews) so if you haven't read Divergent, I urge you to do so first.Still, Insurgent also solidified my deep dislike of the romance angle.  I admire both Tris and Four - but together they seem weakened.  All the strength that Roth built up with Tris's training and testing in Divergent seemed to be taken away by admiration for a boy.  More so than admiration, out and out lust.  I'm sorry, but I find it supremely unbelievable that in the middle of all the chaos taking place in Insurgent, anyone's mind would be on finding a corner to make out in.  Especially considering what all Tris goes through up until the end of Insurgent.That little rant over, let me talk about what I really loved in Insurgent.  I loved that Roth kicks it up a notch.  Just when I thought I had things figured out, she sweeps aside the dust from the foundation she built in Divergent and begins to build the first story of the house.  That first story remains pretty solid, given the foundation that was laid out.  Without the groundwork done, there were a few elements of Insurgent that would have come off as weak or far-fetched, but I really didn't have a problem believing in the story, which honestly surprised me.  I found myself really and truly buying in to what I was reading.Insurgent is one of the more strong middle books I've read in a trilogy in quite some time.  There was a definite plan laid out and movement toward an end goal, something I really appreciated.  I put down the book thinking that it gave me something to mull over and, had I needed to wait for the third book (but I didn't so yay me), I think Insurgent would have given me enough to tide me over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5M55C8D7759/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062024043#wasThisHelpful","R3V5M55C8D7759","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so so so very late to the Divergent train.  Veronica Roth's novel hit it out of the ballpark for so many readers and it's been on my radar for so long that, frankly, I was scared to pick it up.  I remember my first experience with majorly hyped media: Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks.  I had heard from so many people that the movie would blow my mind that I thought there would be no possible way to live up to the expectations that I had built up as a result.  Divergent was a similar experience for me.  And while I love both the movie (and Tom Hanks) and really enjoyed Divergent, it also fell a bit short of, what I readily admit to be, my unrealistic expectations.I'm a huge fan of really gripping young adult dystopia.  The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner - these books thrilled me.  Strong female characters in fantasy books like Graceling also thrill me, so combining fantasty, science-fiction, an end of the world scenario and a really strong, but human, girl thoroughly appealed to me.  Plus, you know, there's a movie coming out so I figured I better kick myself into gear.Here's what I loved about Divergent.  I loved Roth's extensive world-building.  Every detail, down to the clothing being worn, was crafted and I never felt out of the loop on something.  Everyone's roles were clear-cut and defined and the initial struggle for Beatrice Prior was simple and complex, all at the same time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ideas of different factions being more than just based on physical ability or appearance.  I thought it the world set-up and the faction set-up provided a simple enough foundation for a very complex story to be built on them.I also enjoyed the thoroughness of Tris's journey.  I loved being privy to all of the strategies and tests.  Too often this step is skipped in favor of the bigger picture, but it really sets the stage for the story.  It's in those moments that a reader really gets to know the character and can sympathize with hard choices made in the future of the story.Now, what fell a bit beneath expectation was the romance.  I really shouldn't be surprised at this point, more often than not romances written for the young adult audience just move too fast for me to fully comprehend how in the world they work.  I mean, there are life and death scenarios happening in these books, in Divergent, and yet Beatrice is making eyes at some guy who just so happens to be making eyes back at her?  It didn't come off as believable, it came off as ""this book needs a romance because that's what audiences want to here, let's give it to them.""  That sounds really harsh, but everything else was taken just so slowly, it was just disappointing to see the romance take off at lightening speed.Still, Divergent was a fun read and definitely kept me up late at night working my way through it.  When I put it down I immediately picked up Insurgent, so you know that is worth something - especially considering the pile of books I should be reading instead.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie and watching the world that so captivated me come to life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5V5WJ1VIMAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062024035#wasThisHelpful","R3M5V5WJ1VIMAA","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I seem to be reading quite a few books that center around the community that forms within the confines of a suburban neighborhood.  I can immediately think of at least half a dozen books I've read in the past six months or so that have this theme and, considering the diversity of what I tend to read, that's pretty outstanding.  I don't know if it's a theme to watch for, or if right now with so much in the world going crazy between school shootings and other attacks happening on children, it is something that is prominent in people's (see: authors) minds.  And, as you have no doubt surmised, it was the theme in The Deepest Secret by Carla Buckley.So the question is this: if you had a child who only had a limited time on this early due to a rare and serious disease, and you did something that could compromise the time you spent with that child and, quite possibly, the child's well-being, would you own up to what you did?  That is the question that Eve faces.  Her son, Tyler, has a rare disease that makes UV quite dangerous to him - as in fatal.  She has taken care of him, given up everything for him, and now - due to circumstances beyond her control, she commits an act that would see her taken away from him for an extended period of time.Buckley studies the dynamics of the decision that Eve makes within the context of the neighborhood as a whole.  Some of the issues the family of a child with XP faces are brought to light as well as the behavior of the child that may be the result.  Sometimes, Tyler's behavior confused me and that is, ultimately, why the book didn't get a 4-5 star rating...because there seemed to be quite a bit going on that just didn't make sense, given the complete control Eve supposedly had over Tyler's life.As a mystery/suspense novel, however, this one had me biting my nails with worry.  I kept telling myself not to care so much about Eve - but I couldn't help it.  My heart ached for her and The Deepest Secret, if nothing else, showed me that seemingly black and white decisions are not always quite so black and white.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLL7RFP0HH5FK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345535243#wasThisHelpful","RLL7RFP0HH5FK","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw the cover for Belle Cora months ago - I believe it was with the initial buzz going around on the book blogs.  I was fascinated and I can't really explain why.  Every once in a while I get a bee in my bonnet and decide that I want to read some epic life story and usually I zone in on the most innocuous of things.  The corset on the cover of Belle Cora, the roses on the cover of Leila Meacham's Roses, the word Eden in Steinbeck's East of Eden (I'm not comparing books, just epic journeys dealing with someone's life).  Next thing you know, I'm obsessed and, in spite of knowing, usually, that the little thing I'm fixed on may not make up for the entire book, I still dive in the first chance I get.Now, with Phillip Margulies story, thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.  I was promised the tale of an epic life and I was given that.  Arabella Godwin not only lives in the pages of Belle Cora, but she leaps off them quite often.  She is larger than life, but she had to be - considering the life she led in the story.  And, as Belle Cora was loosely based on some real historical figures, well... as you can imagine, I was caught up in the story fairly quickly.As all of these stories go, there's usually heartbreak of some sort.  From Arabella's riches to rags story through her years as a self-supporting woman until the end...when her family is left instructions that will allow her story to be finally free, I was caught.  I loved Arabella's strength, and her ability to make some really tough choices.  I grieved for the things that life threw her way and caused her to be put in that place, of course, but I love seeing a woman rise above it all and make something of her life.Belle Cora has a little bit of something but it's tastefully lacking in what you might think it might contain in abundance.  Margulies knew how to tell his story without resorting to cheap tricks and tasteless sex scenes.  As a result, the story is even more powerful because it rises above a profession and, instead, showcases a woman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22QMNPRP7MZIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532768#wasThisHelpful","R22QMNPRP7MZIS","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I pick up a book and, in spite of it and my best intentions, we don't click.  I thought The Music Room was off to a running start when I began to read the story of a man who had just learned that his brother took his own life - I mean, that's a hard-hitting entrance to a story, right?  Unfortunately (and this is not a morbid joke), everything went down from that high moment.  I struggled with The Music Room , folks.  This one slowed me down, big time, and honestly - for a while, it made me regret even trying to carve out time to read.Still, I finished it.  I finished it because I hadn't finished a book in a while and this one I was determined to get through.  I was bullheaded and trudged through and, I will admit it, I had fond hopes that the story would redeem itself at the end.  Now I'm writing this review about a month away from having finished the book and I'm sad to say that I'm really struggling to even remember the ending.  That's how little of an impact this one had on me.With all that said, let me talk a few specifics - both good and bad.  The good was that beginning.  I was immediately caught in the story and, as I mentioned earlier, had hopes that this would be the book to break me out of a reading funk. McFarland introduces his characters well and I was interested in them.  It's the mystery that really didn't work for me.  Rather than face up to the fact that his brother is dead, we are inundated with all sorts of information and characters showing up (I can think of one in particular) who really don't do anything for the actual story other than produce a flimsy excuse of trouble before vanishing without any sort of resolution.  The combination of mystery and self-exploration ended up with a product that felt muddled and confusing and, rather than receive any sort of enlightened insight into the mind of a grieving man, I was frustrated and upset that I couldn't connect with the story.I wish I could recommend The Music Room , but I think there are other books out there that deal with grief like this in a much more coherent way while still retaining beauty in the style of storytelling and character development.  While I'm glad I finished this one, I'm pretty upset with myself that I wasted so much time on something that I would remember so little of, when all is said and done.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BHR4KAQGK4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031227470X#wasThisHelpful","R26BHR4KAQGK4L","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that I pick up a book that ends up completely surprising me by the time the end comes around.  The Swan Gondola did exactly that.  It surprised me in a few ways.  First, it referenced one of my favorite childhood stories in a subtle, tasteful, and...really, quite perfect way.  Second, it brought to mind one of my favorite (and the newest work) books of Neil Gaiman.  Schaffert beautifully mixes history, intrigue, romance, love, and a bit of magic in a way that took me back to my childhood in Omaha, Nebraska through the referencing of streets, of history, and of a time long past when Omaha was living a dream of becoming a real ""white city.""  I loved reading the history of the place I spent my youth, and I loved even more reading the story of a man who just fell in love and desperately wanted to make a life with the woman he fell head over heels for.If you are a fan of movies like Big Fish or shows like Pushing Daisies, or if you love magical realism from Neil Gaiman to Sarah Addison Allen, then put Timothy Schaffert's book, The Swan Gondola, on your list.  From the very first chapter I absolutely fell in love with Ferret Skirrett (although, not with his name).  I wanted to be in the book, to be embraced by the pages and the story and view the sights that were being described.  I already have nurtured a huge fascination with World Fairs but this one is special to me - it's one that referenced places I've been, streets that I've walked on.Schaffert's ability to tell a story that involved a very colorful cast of characters is only superseded by his ability to incorporate some really out there ideas (especially for the time period) in a way that was subtle and tastefully done.  I loved Ferritt's friends August and Rosie, I adored the idea of using an incubator as a nanny (you have to read the book, seriously), and I loved the idea of a well-known story being turned on its head and beginning in a way that was completely unexpected.If I were to read this book for the first time again, I would go into it just as I did this time.  Completely unaware of the connections to any other stories or ideas.  I loved exploring the tale before realizing what was happening and I would recommend The Swan Gondola whole-heartedly to anyone who loves entertainment, history, fairs, magic, and just plain, old-fashioned good storytelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NL25IIATQJFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486093#wasThisHelpful","R3NL25IIATQJFO","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read quite a few historical novels centering around England's royal family and its bloody history, but The Forbidden Queen by Anne O'Brien is the first book I've read that deals with Katherine de Valois exclusively.  What a story she had.  While I wish O'Brien had spent more time on her youth, I can understand that the information available about that time period may not be as plentiful as I wish, so I am happy to settle for the little we receive in The Forbidden Queen, and am grateful that it was there to set up a remarkable story.Katherine, as a queen, isn't one of my favorites in English history.  She seemed a bit weak, especially for being the Queen that begat the great Tudor line.  She grew up with a mother who slept around quite liberally and a mad father, so I have to give her a bit of a break, but still...you would think that her hard life as a child would have prepared her for the demands placed upon her as a wife, and then a widowed Queen.  For, as we all know, her husband, Henry V, died early into their marriage, leaving her with a young son, Henry VI, and no future ahead of her.If you are wanting a story that will completely play on your sympathies, then this is the one.  Katherine has to fight repeatedly for her own happiness and only succeeds by outwardly flaunting the law - but it takes a while to get there.  She, like her mother before her, creates scandal...although their methods are quite different.  What I really loved was the latter half of the novel when Katherine and Owen Tudor's story comes to life.  I thought O'Brien did a beautiful job of portraying their forbidden love  in The Forbidden Queen and tackling the difficulties that must have surrounded it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YATZRK1B6I29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848452152#wasThisHelpful","R1YATZRK1B6I29","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love historical fiction and, while I love a good European fiction novel as much as the next fan, there's something just.. special about reading American historical fiction.  So when I picked up Stillwater, as intrigued as I was about the twin angle, I was even more so excited about the historical angle - the underground railroad, the becoming of Minnesota as a state (a setting for a story I hadn't come across yet), you get the idea.  And while I was interested by the story, it just seemed as if there was something off - something that took away from my pure enjoyment.  After giving it some thought, I think I've finally figured out what that off-putting thing is.You see, Stillwater is told in a very choppy kind of way.  Similar to a short-story style, each chapter is a snapshot of a specific character in a specific time of the story line.  The twins are not the central characters to this story, rather the twins and those around them (the man that sired them, their mother, and the circumstances surrounding their birth) are all put together to create a sort of ambiance of a story rather than a clear, straight-forward tail.But that's not a bad thing and I think that, if some other ingredients had just been tweaked a bit in the book, the result would have been really enjoyable.  What I really struggled with was trying to figure out what all was supposed to be the story.  There was historical events, but just a slight touch of them.  There were interesting characters, but the end of the book left me wondering what their purpose had been.  Was Stillwater supposed to be a story about people or is a snapshot picture of a particular time period in a particular towns life?  These are the questions I was asking myself when I finished the book and why I ended up unsatisfied.Don't get me wrong.  There were really enjoyable moments in the book, moments that I found myself not wanting to put it down, and the writing was beautiful in many, many places.  But when it comes down to it, I enjoy a sense of closure in my novels - even if that closure leaves the characters in a place where I can picture an ending for them.  Instead, with Stillwater, I put the book down wondering... what was the purpose of this book?","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PMMMLHN1ISD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547898207#wasThisHelpful","R35PMMMLHN1ISD","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is what I am loving about the young adult books I’ve read this year (well, some of them…but enough to notice a bit of a trend): they are witty, challenging, deal with hard topics in an honest and vulnerable way, and they never once make me feel as if I am reading something that is dumbed down for a younger generation.  Chris Lynch’s Little Blue Lies is another check in all of those categories.  From the outset, Lynch establishes himself as an author who is not about to avoid big words simply because they are big words.  He uses his words wisely and they fit.  He sets the tone.  And, most importantly, he maintains it throughout this book.Little Blue Lies is the story of what a relationship is like between two people who enjoy lying.  Why? Because that’s their thing, their niche – you know, some kids have music in common, some enjoy eating the same food, some enjoy less healthy habits so Junie Blue and O (Oliver) have this thing where they white lie to each other – most of the time.  Except the book begins with something that could quite possibly break O’s heart.  Junie Blue has broken up with him.I loved the naked vulnerability of Oliver in Little Blue Lies.  What you see is what you get with him.  He’s the slightly tarnished white knight, the guy who wants to do the right thing but just isn’t allowed to be that guy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the presence of the parents as well – it’s such a rare thing to see functional parental units in a book (that’s not to say there aren’t some dysfunctional relationships happening here too).  I like that Lynch didn’t brush those dynamics under the rug and, instead, explored them in a way that made sense.I think Little Blue Lies is a heck of a way to start the New Year, and I really believe that those who love intelligent, thought-provoking writing should check it out.  I really recommend this to fans of Sara Zarr, John Green, Patrick Ness, and John Scalzi.  I think you will find yourself laughing out loud and sighing with emotion throughout the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116G86KXAMAVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C7BQZO#wasThisHelpful","R116G86KXAMAVA","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I love most about reading middle grade books is how a really complex message is written to convey something very deep and meaningful.  Kate DiCamillo is one of the authors that does this extremely well - which is one of the reasons for her popularity, I am sure.  Still, when I saw what Flora and Ulysses was about, I was a bit hesitant.  I mean.. a squirrel? as a main character? Really?  But it worked.  Let me tell you why.I teach piano for a living.  Many of my students are in the 4-6 year age range and one of the things that I've learned over the years of teaching is that in order to get a message across well, I need to bring a third party into the lesson.  Thankfully, the method books I use understand this as well and so with a little help from Faber and Faber, I bring in characters that live on the pages of the method book - in particular, a little firefly named Tap.  Lessons pass by so smoothly because Tap not only is there to offer encouragement to the student, but he's there to sympathize.  When a student struggles, I can show him that Tap is there and he also is learning right along side that student.  When a student does well, Tap celebrates with them.So, with that thought and lesson in mind, I approached Ulysses the Squirrel with a different mindset and what I took away from DiCamillo's tale is a story that deals well with the separation of parents through the medium of a fantastical creature who is able to listen, sympathize, and love unconditionally.  Also, he can write poetry.That's gold in a middle grade book, folks.  Sure, there's humor and silliness and moments where the story might drag a little bit, but ultimately, the message comes across loud and clear.  Establishing a relationship with a parent or sibling or anyone close to you doesn't just go away when things don't work out between that person and another in your life - yes, that's a great message, but ultimately the message that it's important to know that the feelings that happen when the split happens are not to be lightly dismissed and to look and find where the strengths are in those relationships to pull you through.  That's what Flora and Ulysses spoke to me about and I'm glad that I am not too old to be taught something by a book that may come off as simple, but in reality, is something quite else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XVUD5MI6EHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUV9644#wasThisHelpful","R29XVUD5MI6EHE","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not usually into mytery/thriller/suspense novels.  Granted, I have a few authors I follow pretty religiously (Ahem, Tana French, I'm so ready for your next), but mostly 10 years of reading James Patterson and Stuart Woods books pretty much put me off from the genre for the last few years.  When the buzz about Night Film started to emerge I took one look at the cover and dismissed the novel.  It didn't appeal to me at all.  But then, something strange happened.Have you ever looked at something and thought, nope, not interested, but then it lingers in the back of your mind and you start to think about wanting it and then that thinking turns into looking at it online...but then just before you decide to take the leap you worry that maybe you have built it up to be something it's not and you dread the inevitable disappointment?  No? Yes? Beuller? Well, welcome to what my mind is like.  So I didn't take the plunge, I didn't make the purchase, but I did put the book on my wishlist.No one got me it for Christmas.So how did I finally manage to get to it?  Let me tell you a bit of a story (please, indulge me because a real review is coming up and this is necessary for me to review it).  I didn't go to the library, I didn't manage to win a gift card or stumble across it on paperback swap.  Nope. I went home for two weeks over Christmas/New Years (my folks home where I lived while going to school.  I haven't been back since moving to Hawaii last May) and spent a total of 11 of my 14 days home there, looking at my beloved book shelves filled with books, and not noticing a thing until day 12.  On day 12 I noticed something odd.  A book in a strange place, right in the middle of a series. What was it?  Why it was an advance paperback copy of Night Film.  Weird, right?  It was the ONLY book that missed my change of address and so there it sat while I sat in Hawaii wondering whether I should finally take the plunge.So I read the book during a 40 hour trip back to the islands. I devoured every word, sometimes more than once or even twice.  I pored over all of the ""extras"" inside.  And the entire time I was immersed in this book I kept thinking of the circumstances that led to it being in my hands.  You see, this book is about something dark and deep, but also it's about being caught up in something that's bigger than yourself.  And that's what happened here.  Someone knew I wanted this book before I even knew it myself.  And so there it sat, waiting for me.  It's so strange that I didn't see it right away (my mother confirmed it arrived during the summer so it wasn't a recent placement), because I am usually very in tune with my system and what's on my shelves.I loved Night Film, folks.  I mean... I loved it so much that I'm going to sit right here and type that it will be in my top five books of 2014, and the year has barely begun.  The amount of detail put into this story is unreal.  From the articles to the entire persona built up by Pessl - the atmosphere is set right away and not once does the pace slacken or let loose its grip on the reader.  I actually had to put down the book and just absorb some parts because so much happened in certain scenes that I needed to take time to process and remember what had come before.So yes, Night Film is hands-down a favorite.  And now I know that I need to buy that hardcover edition - not just for myself but for the readers around me as well.  Marisha Pessl has a new fan right here and now I will add another author to that shelf that is anxiously awaiting my other favorite authors next releases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQEQ7NANPOHN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4WL2I#wasThisHelpful","RQEQ7NANPOHN9","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Adriana Trigiani for a while now.  I absolutely loved her last novel, The Shoemaker's Wife, and thought she had risen to an entirely new level with the story.  In fact, I loaned the book to my aunt to read and it's been making the rounds with her friends in the year since that occurrence.  I was excited, as you can imagine, to be offered the chance to review The Supreme Macaroni Company, the third book in Trigiani's Valentine Series, as a result.  I was anxious to see if she would continue the story in a way that showed the influence of that previous novel.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.It wasn't that I was disappointed in the humor or the witty, fast-paced dialogue contained in The Supreme Macaroni Company - don't get me wrong.  Many of the things I loved in the first two Valentine books were ever present.  I felt immersed in a very American-Italian culture and loved the reminder of just how special a pair of well-crafted shoes can be.  More, it was the pacing of the book that presented the issue for me this time around.  I felt as if Valentine had lost her voice.I'm a single, 37 year old woman so I can fully understand how scary it must be to face losing your independence, even if it is for someone you love with all your heart.  After this many years of being single, I have my ways set, and I'm not accustomed to asking for permission to do something before I do it.  So I appreciated the struggle that Valentine faces as she looks forward to her upcoming marriage with Gianluca.  And I was disappointed shortly after the books beginning when I saw that instead of really diving into those issues, Trigiani decided to go the fast-forward route.What do I mean?  Folks - so much happens in this book over such a fast period of time.  Literally two years pass in one book and so much happens.  It seems as if the engagement has hardly happened before the marriage is over (and talk about a disappointment there - I wanted to read about all of the details, not just be presented them in a haphazard fashion in the short pages leading up to them).  Then, Gianluca and Valentine start their life together, but rarely is the marriage explored and the very real issues looked at.  Instead, I felt as if Valentine remained front and center and her husband took a back seat, much like Ken used to do whenever I would play Barbies with my sisters.  You know, the wedding is fun to plan and all, but it's just too annoying to give voices to two dolls so Ken spends all his time out of the picture.  If you managed to give both dolls equal playtime, then I salute you.So, ultimately, I was disappointed by The Supreme Macaroni Company.  I walked away feeling a bit of whiplash and wondering how in the world all that was managed in a mere 352 pages.  It felt like a massive epic tornado.  I went into this book expecting to walk away with another series to loan to my aunt and to be read and read over again by different people, but unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXQCW2JOCIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062136585#wasThisHelpful","R2BXQCW2JOCIW","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It says something when an author can boast that they have been writing for seven decades.  Seven, folks.  Elizabeth Spencer creates a nearly perfect set of short stories with Starting Over: Stories.  Some of these stories broke my heart, moved me to tears, and made me put the book down out of sheer self-preservation.  I’m a fairly recent convert to the power of the short story (by recent, I mean within the last few years) so for a collection to move me as deeply as some of these stories moved me…well, let me just say that it doesn’t happen as often as I like.  Had I read a collection like this during my years of “not-a-fan of short stories,” I think I may have had a come to Jesus moment a little sooner.There are quite a few solid stories in Spencer’s collection, but I want to talk the most about a particular story.  ”Sightings” is a story about a young girl who has come to visit a father who she has partially blinded.  During her time with her father, very little comes out.  Actually, very little comes out in the entire story.  However, Spencer uses tension and some really deft writing to make her reader understand what is fully going on here.Spencer’s grasp on the intricacies of writing from different viewpoints and of portraying each character in a way that is true to not only themselves in the story, but transcends the story to read life, is something that should be marveled at.  During “Sightings,” I felt like I was there, in the story.  It was a shock to see it come to an end because I had become so invested in such a short time period.  This story alone makes the collection worth owning – but don’t let me talking about just one story convince you that there aren’t also other worthy stories inside.I think this book is one that would appeal to both the short-story lover and the reader who just wants to finally “get” what short-stories are about.  Spencer writes in such a way that I never felt as if the portraits were over my head and I found myself often making friends within the few pages allotted to each story.  Starting Over: Stories  is definitely one to be watching for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBBG7CBIPJFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DX5X9UW#wasThisHelpful","R2MBBG7CBIPJFU","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to Han Nolan through her novel Crazy, a book that has stuck with me in spite of having read dozens upon dozens of books since.  I remember being thoroughly impressed with the control she had throughout the book, giving each voice such a distinctive feel that they leaped off the page and grabbed my attention through dialogue and action.  So, I was walking through my library the other day and Nolan's name jumped out at me from the bookshelf in the young adult section and I knew it was time to give her my attention again.  Pregnant Pause, while not as smooth and polished a story as Crazy, was an entertaining read that had me flopping back and forth, much like the main character, between wanting to strangle her and cheer her on.In Pregnant Pause, Elly is a 16 year old girl with a major, life-changing moment about to happen.  She's pregnant.  And to make matters worse, she's surrounded by family in the form of missionary parents who are devoted to AIDS children in Africa, and an older sister (by at least a decade) who has been unable to conceive or carry to term a child.  But sweet 16 year old Elly is not only pregnant, she's so pregnant that abortion isn't an option and she is going to have to figure something out.  So she tells her parents that her boyfriend (who impregnated her on the first go, no less) has proposed to her.  Much to her surprise, both sets of parents agree that marriage is the best solution.  And that's just the beginning, folks.Nolan does a fantastic job of getting inside the head of a 16 year old.  Elly is stubborn, but she is also young, as evidenced by her constant flopping around on decisions that need to be made.  She wants the marriage, she doesn't; she wants to keep the baby, she doesn't; she loves this guy, she loves that guy...you get the picture.  I felt like shaking Elly so much throughout this story that I'm fairly certain I gave the physical book I was holding shaken book syndrome.At one point, about 200 pages in, I had just about had enough.  I felt like I was being constantly teased and that Elly was never going to get her crap together and figure out what to do with her life.  She had her head in the clouds, like many 16 year olds do, and she had so many false ideas of just how perfect life would be - in spite of no job, no place to live, and most importantly, no high school diploma.  It's at this point in the story that Nolan took a turn and really dove into the secondary characters.Elly has been living, with her husband, in a cabin set on the grounds of a campground that belongs to her in-laws.  It's not any campground, however.  It's a ""fat camp,"" and 16 year old Elly has been thrown into some big shoes when one of the counselors falls sick.  Nolan introduces a cast of girls who, like Elly, were aggravating, but real true to life, and that's when the story began to shift.  The introduction of Banner, the touching on the subject of bullying and ways to handle it, the neglect of children based on their looks, it struck a chord with me and I wished the story was able to explore those themes more and less the theme of pregnant Elly - although then the title would have made no sense.So Pregnant Pause is simply a coming-of-age story; a story about a girl who takes an unexpected pause in the middle of her teenage years to choose a path.  Will she choose to remain a teenage girl or will she grow up?  You'll find out if you choose to pick up Nolan's story.  Make sure you bring a Kleenex or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M2TFPHAKWH7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HJRRJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1M2TFPHAKWH7J","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever read a book and felt like it was unfolding so perfectly, so exquisitely, that the only thing you can compare it to is watching a rose as its pedals unfurl to greet the sun?  Sounds pretty cheesy, doesn't it?  And yet - it's so perfect for Someone Else's Love Story.  The first chapter of this book was so perfectly paced it made my toes curl with complete love.  The descriptions were so exquisitely painful and pleasurable all at once that my teeth ached.  I wanted to sink into the pages of Jackson's story and not emerge again until all was revealed and life was returned to its mundane self.I honestly can't tell you who I loved more in this story: Shandi or William or Natty - and that's not even touching on the love I felt for the ""best friends"" of the group - but I'll talk about them in a little bit.  Shandi and William try to steal the scene as being some of the most naive, innocent main characters a reader can ask for but then there's Natty thrown into the mix with his bits of wisdom and his regressions.  The result is a trio of characters so compelling it's difficult to put the book down because you just need to know more right now.Then there's Walcott and Paula - two of the most fantastic supportive characters I've seen in a book since... well.. since some of the classics (I'm thinking about Sam in Lord of the Rings right now).  While there is nothing fantasy-related about Someone Else's Love Story, the power of love and loyalty and devotion rings so true in these two characters that it's difficult to imagine living life without a best friend of your own, just like one of them.I am so thrilled I picked this book up.  I was a fan of Jackson's previous book, Gods in Alabama, so I knew that I would be in for a treat but I had no idea that she would hit it out of the ballpark with Someone Else's Love Story.  This one comes highly recommended, but be prepared to set aside hours for full immersion.  This love story demands nothing less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OKGVHYH8ZHOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKZ4OTW#wasThisHelpful","R2OKGVHYH8ZHOG","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a weakness for classics remade by a modern author.  I have thoroughly loved reading books that take their inspiration from great stories and authors, and The Madman's Daughter does this beautifully by taking H.G. Wells's story The Island of Dr. Moreau, and putting a new, fresh spin on it.  At times gruesome, other times horrifying, and sometimes spine-chillingly terrifying, Shepherd manages to still capture the attention of this skittish reader and I found myself reading until nearly 5am just to figure out what happens.While I've had some experience with Wells, The Island of Dr. Moreau has never been high on my list to read.  It is now.  And it is for that reason (and I'm sure many others have now put the book on their to-read radar) that I am grateful to re-explored classics.  I finished reading The Madman's Daughter and I felt compelled to pick up the next book. I had to have it - now.  Thankfully, I managed to get my hands on an advanced copy or... seriously, there's no telling what would have happened.I had seen some buzz about The Madman's Daughter late last year and it had always been my intention to check it out but what made me ultimately take the leap is the gorgeous cover.  The book was sitting on the shelf at my library and I had to read it now.  I picked it up, brought it home, and cracked it open without regard for my scheduled readings.  I wasn't disappointed.The Madman's Daughter is the story of a girl who was once the daughter of a prominent surgeon but now struggles to make ends meet after her father was labeled a madman.  She believes him dead - and now, she's on her own as her mother has also passed away.  She struggles with what you can imagine young girls struggle with: the unwanted attentions of older men, the decision of how to make a life for herself, and the curiosity and desire to know what exactly was going on under her own childhood roof.  Then, one day she stumbles into an old friend/servant and her life changes.  But does it change for the better?Imagine taking a leap of faith and sailing to an unknown island in the company of someone that you haven't seen in years.  Imagine being completely surrounded by lies and half-truths and trying to figure out just what it all means.  That's what was captured in The Madman's Daughter and why it was so riveting to me.  But that's not to say that it was perfect.  I felt as if the ending stretched a little too much.  That's saying something when talking about science fiction, but it still has to remain somewhat believable.  I found myself wincing a bit, but willing myself to just accept it because I was having too much fun to think too hard about the faults of what I was reading.  And, ultimately, that's the most important thing: to create a story that even the things that normally bug readers can't detract from.I highly recommend The Madman's Daughter to those who are looking to veer away from the zombie apocalypse novel-types and are looking for something a bit different with the same sort of feel.  I think this book would appeal to a wide range of readers and, if nothing else, will catapult a new generation of kids into reading one of the greats: H.G. Wells.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4NH3ULWKZD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOLW0#wasThisHelpful","R2K4NH3ULWKZD8","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our Picnics in the Sun by Morag Joss is a book that focuses on a few important aspects of life and family.  There are three stories happening: the dynamic between Howard and Deborah, the distance communication between Deborah and Adam, and the commentary on the life of a caretaker in a family ill-equipped to handle emergency situations.  Of the three, the one that broke my heart the most was the distance communication between Deborah and Adam, her son - but the combination of the three made for a powerful story, one that I both dreaded and ached to pick up ... just so I could find out what happened next.Deborah and Howard are an older couple with an adult son.  Free-thinkers, Deborah has always followed Howard's lead.  Howard is an artist and has some interesting thoughts on everything from bread-baking to where a woman should give birth.  But now, Howard is not able to express those thoughts due to a stroke that has placed him into the care of Deborah full-time.Deborah struggles to run (and really, fails is more the right term) a B&B.  She manages to make it into town on Wednesdays - the highlight of that visit being the time she spends in emails to her only son, Adam.  She dotes on her son and lives for his birthday when they can take a picnic out on the moor.  However, the last picnic was held in 2004 - a disastrous event that has resulted in Adam's refusal to make it home.  Still, Deborah hopes and hopes.Our Picnics in the Sun may sound like a title that could be about something happy - my mind brought up images of laughing children and games played after sandwiches and lemonade were consumed.  But Joss has written a book that highlights regret.  The regret of decisions made in the past, of relationships not maintained, of lives not lived.  Joss explores the stress that is placed on caretakers when a medical event occurs that requires all the time and energy of the partner and she really digs deep to portray the despair of both Howard and Deborah in a way that had me almost weeping.Although I'm not a fan of vague endings, Joss's worked well here - because this is not a book that tells a story that has a beginning and an end.  Rather, it's a book that explores all those messy feelings that happen during life and the effect they have not only on ourselves, but on those around us as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1IRBY8F0W3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5BEDNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2A1IRBY8F0W3Q","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since moving to Hawaii, I have been all about reading books by local authors.  I love immersing myself in the culture and I work to do that through reading, through conversing with my neighbors and friends, and through just living life here on O'ahu.  Mike Bond speaks with knowledge about the island, and life on the island; but he does so with a bit of an attitude that, frankly, turned me off quite a bit as I was trying to push myself through his story.  Saving Paradise is not so much a book about the investigation of a woman's murder as much as it's a diatribe against big businesses and the changes occurring on the islands.Now, don't get me wrong.  I am all for the preservation of the beautiful islands and the habitats they boast of.  I'm on the side of the whales, the seals, the sharks - basically the marine life... as well as the natural life that flourishes (and some that doesn't) on the land.  I hate to see beauty marred by skyscrapers and signs of progression and, I can tell you from personal experience, living on O'ahu is one of the biggest disappointments and thrills of my life.  It's paradise, but a dirty, sludgy paradise that I share with almost a million people in a 560 sq mile space.Bond chose to make a novel his platform - railing against real companies and real issues facing the island in recent years.  He loudly speaks out against windfarms and the proposed line that would upset more than a few marine habitats and coral reefs.  He uses derogatory language to speak of current and past presidents and the government - both national and state levels.  And he does all of this through the mouthpiece of his character, Pono Hawkins, a retired special forces veteran.It was difficult to believe that all of the hate coming out toward the people in power was purely fictional, and since real life was being pushed on me through the pages of Saving Paradise, it was difficult to lose myself in the story.  Instead, it became sort of a game to see who would be attacked next... and the mystery I lost complete interest in.  What I appreciated most about Saving Paradise was not its literary merit (there is none, really), nor it's riveting story (hardly existed) - what I appreciated was the wealth of information about the islands.  Now I know that instead of visiting Kaua'i, I want to go to Moloka'i.  I want to visit that Chinese restaurant down on King Street here on O'ahu.  I want to experience life like an islander does - to live with the aloha spirit and to hang loose.So while I am disappointed by not getting a good story, I do appreciate that I walked away from Saving Paradise with more information about my home since May.  I hope that I will come to love Hawai'i with the same passion and learn about my own special places that I can one day then turn around and share with another newcomer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AMNXTOAPO5DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627040013#wasThisHelpful","R2AMNXTOAPO5DR","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Morning Glory is my first novel by Sarah Jio in spite of having some of her previous books (The Violets of March and The Last Camellia) on my to-be-read list for quite some time.  Name recognition is a big pull for me, so when I picked up Morning Glory I made it a priority - I had to read something by Jio and this is where I would be starting.  The end result is enough pleasure that I am bumping up her other books and looking forward to reading them.  Still, Morning Glory was not quite perfect and in this review I'll be discussing a few of the things I had a bit of an issue with (although, mind you, it wasn't enough of an issue for this to be a negative review!)One of the things I loved about Morning Glory was the sense of history that came attached to the story.  It started with page 1 and just wove its way throughout Penny and Ada's respective stories.  Tie those stories in to one of the best settings (think Sleepless in Seattle and houseboats) and you have a heck of a story.  It's not often when there is a split narrative (moving from the present to the past) that I get thoroughly engrossed in both stories, but that definitely happened during my time reading Morning Glory and I anxiously hurdled on to the end of the book, wanting to wrap everything up with a neat, tidy bow.And everything did get wrapped up - but this is where my bit of a complaint comes in.  I'm so tired of contrived ""coincidences.""  You know, those surprise twists that make it so that this person meets that person who was connected to them in this way and they all live happily ever after.  It's unrealistic and detracts from the story for me and, unfortunately, instead of leaving a good ending where it was Jio chose to take that extra step.  It immediately left a bad taste in my mouth and, instead of feeling satisfied as I put the book down, I rolled my eyes and sighed.So, if you take out the bit of the ending that caused me to feel as if I'd just read a juvenile piece of fiction, the rest of the book was fantastic.  The mystery was interesting and kept me going, the struggles of both women were ones that I could relate to (and possibly shed a few tears over), and the writing was cozy and immersive, making When we dress in a way that has even the potential to cause a man to lust, we create an unnecessary war against his soul. one of those books that you should probably pick up over your Christmas break for some feel good reads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5H8C03LL804/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142196991#wasThisHelpful","R2W5H8C03LL804","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been following Slatton's After Series now since the first book was released and, frankly, surprised the heck out of me. The first book in the trilogy, Fallen, had me frantically turning pages and thoroughly enjoying a setting that was not only post-apocalyptic, but also more adult in nature.  When Fallen was provided to me, I had spent so much time reading Young Adult fiction that I had been craving something more mature and Slatton provided that in spades.  Far Shore, the third installment of the trilogy, was no different. Slatton thrusts her readers back into the bleak world and brings all of the major players together in a way that had me wondering just how it would play out.That being said, there were some things about Far Shore that just didn't work well for me.  In some ways, I could sense there was a bit of a struggle trying to reconcile relationships that were at odds through the first two books in the series.  The interaction between Emma and Arthur (and, frankly Emma and two other males in her small circle) seemed strained and awkward at times.  Add into the mix the ultimate breaking point for Arthur and the result was a story that was a bit more fragmented and unsettled than I had been used to from Slatton.That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the story.  If nothing else, Slatton writes in such an addictive way that I could swear there was some sort of addictive substance between the pages.  I know when I pick up one of her books I am not going to want to put it down until I finish it, and Far Shore was no different.  However, maybe things would have been different if she hadn't been roped into something that was labeled, from the start, a ""trilogy.""  I could see how there was more much to be explored, but time and space just wouldn't allow for it.Still, this is a worthy trilogy and an exceptionally good entry way point into more hardcore science fiction, for those who are looking to expand their horizons a bit.  There's a little bit of everything in it - romance, horror, mystery, science-fiction goodness ... it's all there and interesting enough to keep the reader totally immersed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IP01CVZI0W8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQJQJNM#wasThisHelpful","R3IP01CVZI0W8P","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there is a series that I am an evangelist for, it's Cherie Priest's Clockwork Century books.  The moment any friend expresses an interest, passing or intent, the first word out of my mouth is Boneshaker.  I have been reading Priest's books since Boneshaker was released and while some are stronger than others, each of them is enough to fan my addiction to her writing to an even higher level.  The Inexplicables is no different.Imagine my delight when I began reading and was immediately transported back to the world of Zeke and Boneshaker.  I knew I recognized the name of Rector ""Wreck-em"" Sherman and soon it became apparent why.  I may or may not have giggled a bit as I dove back into the dangerous world of Seattle and read about names that I not only know, but know intimately from their stories in the previous novels.  It felt like I was greeting old friends.I have a habit of putting books by favorite authors aside until they meet one of two criteria.  1. That they have another book out that I can put in the bank for the perfect day, or 2. that I just can't hold off and desperately need a fix.  Reading The Inexplicables met both of those criteria - but mostly when I saw that Fiddlehead was being released (and it's the final installment, y'all - I'm heartbroken) I knew it was time to dive in.Reading the books of The Clockwork Century is an experience.  The pages are soft, the typeface is sepia, there is artwork at each chapterhead and the books are pleasant to hold in the hand.  And then there's the story.  Rector's story in The Inexplicables is one of intrigue, addiction, reaching the bottom and climbing up, forming friendships and maintaining them, independence, and finally heroism.  There's so much action, a touch of romance that had me laughing out loud with delight, and - of course - loads upon loads of steampunk goodness.I am fairly certain that Priest has infused her books with her own fictional sap because that's how addicted I've become to this world.  I dread saying goodbye to it with Fiddlehead, but in the meantime I'll continue to crusade for it and bask in the non-fatal, totally normal (right?) afterglow of having read a book by one of my favorite authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17B87XLDDBEEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOE0Y#wasThisHelpful","R17B87XLDDBEEV","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received Revelations recently from Tor and was immediately drawn to reading the synopsis based on the cover.  It's colorful, interesting, and I was really hoping that it was the first book of the series.  It wasn't.  SO then I thought, maybe I'll try to jump in - but let me tell you, what I read from the first book had me desperately wanting to get my hands on it.  So I did.  I dove into Renegade that night and, upon finishing it, immediately moved on to Revelations.I loved Renegade, folks.  It was filled with brainwashing and utopias (or not), and mad escapes, and thrilling moments.  It made me want to walk around my house reading.  I was reminded of what it was like to be reading a really fun, engrossing young adult novel.  I loved it.  So I went into Revelations thinking that would continue.  And, while I might have enjoyed Revelations more had I not read Renegade first (although I would have been seriously lost in the story), I just thought it fell flat of the first book.  Let me explain why.First - the action. It's too fast paced.  Too much ground is covered and too much information revealed for just one book in this series.  I cannot be expected to believe in the scaryness and vastness of the world Souders has created if it can be covered in just a few pages.  Furthermore, I cannot be convinced of scary, deadly creatures if they are easily outrun or survived.Secondly, don't force a romance issue - even if it's just to instill a sense of tension and doesn't really exist.  Not only did the romance between Evie and Gavin feel forced and unnatural (she doesn't remember anything but somehow manages to be just as in love with him?), but the idea of someone else falling for Evie and barely knowing her just doesn't work.I felt like Souders had a great idea with this series and that Renegade was plotted well, but that she just bit off more than she could chew with the follow-up.  Quite a few things could have been removed to make the story more cohesive, but instead - I felt like I got a case of bookish whiplash from all the back and forth traveling in Revelations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2PH8IZM1476/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DA6XM6A#wasThisHelpful","R3I2PH8IZM1476","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a fascination with King Richard III.  As many people know, his skeleton was recently found (near a parking garage) and, as a result, we are able to know more today about what this famous man looked like - in addition to knowing more about his deeds.  Richard III was the monarch connected with the two princes, if you have heard that story.  He's also known as the ""Evil Crouchback,"" due to his having scoliosis, we have since learned.  Richard III was the last monarch before the uniting of the York and Lancaster Houses - two houses who had been at war for 100 years in the War of the Roses.  But Elizabeth of York is clearly not about Richard III - it's about Elizabeth.  However, Weir understands that in order to fully understand Elizabeth we have to understand how she grew up, what influenced her, and most importantly, what the evidence has indicated about the person she was.Elizabeth of York holds a place by proxy to some of the most famous figures in British history.  Her son was Henry VIII.  Her brothers were the famous princes who were murdered (allegedly) by Richard III.  Her mother was the famous Elizabeth Wydeville, the ""Slandered Queen,"" who supposedly ""seduced"" Edward IV.  Elizabeth I was also the grandmother to the beloved Queen Elizabeth, the ""Virgin Queen.""  Add on top of that, Elizabeth's part in uniting the houses of Lancaster and York, as well as having a powerhouse of a mother-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, and you have quite a group of people surrounding this queen.But that's all of the people around Elizabeth.  What about Elizabeth herself?  Her teenage years were fraught with fear, yet she ended up in a marriage that, for all accounts, was not only amiable, but also one of fondness, if not love.  She gave birth to a brood of children, as all good Queens were expected to do, and she managed to be a favorite of the people, placing a face of kindness on the monarchy in spite of her husband, who - while a good King - was also distrustful of most people due to his own upbringing.Alison Weir does a fantastically thorough job of pulling together all of the research and arranging it in a way that not only makes sense, but lays out a great story in the process.  At times, Weir gets a little wordy and at times a little forward with her assumptions of how certain figures might have felt, but it never goes too far overboard for me and her assumptions make sense.I loved reading Elizabeth of York and I loved seeing Elizabeth I finally pushed to the forefront.  As a Queen, she was the epitome of grace and beauty and she was able, even while submissive and dealt some really crappy cards in life, to pull off a life that is worth admiring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3RVM6YO8FOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQZ657O#wasThisHelpful","R3D3RVM6YO8FOR","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a pansy when it comes to scary stories.  I will readily admit that.  The book can be even not well written and I'll still be pansy.  Add pictures into the mix and yeah, I'll be sleeping with my light on for at least 2-3 nights after finishing the book (and sometimes during if I just can't finish the book in one setting).  Asylum was one of those books - I was so tired and haunted by the images in the book that it was a two night read for me...and the result was I spent a few nights restless in my sleep due to having to have my light on.I don't know about you, but the idea of an old mental asylum is only second to an abandoned carnival ground on a terror-ranking list.  When I was in my late teens, I accompanied a boyfriend and my sister to an abandoned penitentiary in eastern Wyoming.  It was Halloween and the workers had a blast filling each room with re-enactments of terrible things that may have happened.  Asylum provoked the memory of that experience through the medium of the included photos.  Not to mention - anytime I see a picture with eyes scratched out on it I get massive heebie-jeebies.That's not to say that Roux wrote a story that could have creeped me out.  In fact, without the addition of the pictures, I think I might have been a bit bored by the story.  It was a pretty typical one - group of kids get locked up, essentially, in a creepy old building and start investigating its history.  I got some massive Scooby Doo vibes from it.  But Roux did take it a step darker, which was necessary, with the inclusion of the photos.  The photos (and their credits are included at the back of the book) are a story in themselves.  So much horror contained in each, it is worth picking up the book just to examine them.I don't know of many kids that could handle the level of creepy that Asylum boasted - the photos might just have been a little over the top.  But I leave that judgment up to the parents.  For me, those photos were enough and I won't be able to get through a night in the near future without having that one little thought in the back of my mind that something might just happen once I click my light off for the night.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UW2PLL0Q7BXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NG312Q#wasThisHelpful","R2UW2PLL0Q7BXS","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over and over and over again in my reviews over the last several years I've found myself having to talk about using a gimmick to sell a book.  That gimmick could be anything from touching on curiosity that a reader might have on seeing things from a villains point of view to exploiting some sort of disability in an effort to sell the book.  J.M. Harvey has added yet another gimmick to my list of things to dislike: that of putting a story where there isn't a story in order to tell a completely different story.  Sisters of the Bruce was not a book about the sisters, it was a book telling the history of Scotland in the 13th century through the medium of women's letters and, to a lesser extent, their lives.The issue that Harvey, I'm sure, ran across is that there is little actual documentation on what the sisters lives must have been like.  Isabelle and Kirsty compose the majority of letters that provide an introduction into the book and those letters are full of politics, movements of the war, and other information that i highly doubt was made readily available to the women - through their brothers, husbands, or even other means.  Instead of getting an inside look into their actual lives, I was forced to endure a lengthy history lesson about the movements of different armies and the struggles for power - basically, instead of a book about women, Sisters of the Bruce was a book about men and the women were simply used as a tool to tell that story.While I doubt there is enough material to make a lengthy story about this bunch of sisters, I do think there is enough material to have made a short, more concise, but interesting look at the lives of the women of Scotland in the 13th century.  I understand, according to the summary, that Harvey has been influenced by some of my favorite female historians - but I think that his story development and his method of telling that story could use a nice long look.  Penman, for example, does not exploit characters in order to tell her story - instead, she focuses on specific characters, fleshing out their thoughts and reasoning behind their actions.I was really hoping to read a good, solid book with historical background - instead, I got a book on history with very little to do with the title, or the actual summary of the book.  If you are interested in good historical fiction, check out Sharon Kay Penman, Alison Weir, or even Nicola Griffith's newest book, Hild, for actual character development.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H514B7SIVEHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK2872G#wasThisHelpful","R3H514B7SIVEHZ","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Religious abuse is not a pretty subject.  The fear that can be instilled in a child is chilling; horrifying to think about.  My family once adopted a puppy from our local shelter and when we brought him home we watched as he cowered from the men in our family.  You see, he had been horrifically abused by men in the home that had him before and so it was only natural that when a masculine figure approached him, his tail would go between his legs and his eyes would take on that look - you know the one I'm talking about.  Now, magnify that picture in your head and replace the dog with that of a child.  Imagine the fear that child would deal with each time their parent arrives home.  There is no joy, no happiness, no skipping to the door to receive a hug and a kiss; there is only fear. Watch How We Walk by Jennifer LoveGrove tackles this incredibly complex and painful subject in a way that tore me apart.This is not a book for the faint of heart.  Not every story has a happy ending and not every character lives with hope or a figure who will somehow swoop in and save the day.  Emily, the child in this family of Jehovah's Witnesses, believes she may have that figure in her Uncle Tyler, her uncle who has not yet come out of the closet and accepted what the church will lay down on him as a result.  Imagine, even seeing the adult in your life who is a voice for you and dealing with the same type of fear - imagine what kind of life that would be.Watch How We Walk is aptly named.  There is a lot of talk in various religions of not just talking the talk, but walking the walk, and Emily's family is laid bare before the reader and we are able to see every intimate aspect of their walk.  Emily's own actions are heartbreaking and...well, like I said, this is not a story for the faint of heart.This would be a book I would recommend to people who are struggling to understand how religious abuse can take such a grip on a persons mind; or those who do not understand the impact that fanatic religious beliefs have on others around them.  It's the children who suffer the most; entire childhoods ripped away and can never be restored.  Watch How We Walk is a good, hard reality check and an important book as a result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VOL5U0DATQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770411275#wasThisHelpful","R3VOL5U0DATQC","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are times I will pick up a book, read it, and then sit for a long time afterward, thinking about what I want to say about it.  It's now December and I am still thinking about The Crooked Maid over three months after I finishing reading it.  I'm extremely torn on what I want to say, because - as so often happens with literary fiction, what I hoped for and what I got were two very different things.  The Crooked Maid deals with the time in Germany spent after the end of WWII - during the de-Nazification of Germany.  It's such an unusual setting and I was looking forward to reading about it, but what I got in Vyleta's story was something a bit more confusing.I understand that a story about this time period is automatically something that is hard to understand.  It's a subject matter that people don't often deal with in their lives, and really never deal with on a day to day basis (I'm casting a wide net here; that's not to say there are not things that are happening in the world today that are similar, but generally speaking, we aren't dealing with this particular re-building set during this time period).  And while I understood that a story had to be told along with it, to show what that rebuilding actually meant, the story ended up being one that left me feeling dissatisfied - like Vyleta had tried for something out of his grasp and ended up with a warped version of it.I think part of the problem was that I just didn't give two figs for Anna Beer.  I wanted to sympathize with her, she was undertaking a terrible journey and her path was one that was not easy - but frankly, I just didn't care.  The same with Robert Seidel.  Being described as a  schoolboy and, as a result, seeing the dynamics between him and Anna just left me feeling a bit sick to my stomach.  Then, there's the hunchbacked young servant - a character that the book was actually named after but one who plays a secondary role to Anna.  I just didn't care for any of them and, without caring for them, you can imagine how it was when I tried to care about what happened to them.  It made reading The Crooked Maid a bit of a chore.Vyleta has a beautiful way with description, and that's just about the only thing that really redeemed this book for me.  But, books are not all about beautiful descriptions and insightful thoughts - there has to be someone or something that the reader can connect to, so the result was that I read some beautiful words put together in pretty sentences but, like I often am when I hear a pretty piece of music on the radio, I am left with feeling like I've been robbed a bit when I found out the substance wasn't worth the packaging.The Crooked Maid is just another book that has me wonder about the awards process.  For longlists and shortlists, are various award committees looking at the packaging or are they really looking at the story?  Then again - it may just boil down to a matter of taste, and my taste just didn't extend to enjoying this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Z3EOKCM4HH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D78R5AK#wasThisHelpful","R24Z3EOKCM4HH4","AOKGRSAS5VNS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOKGRSAS5VNS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this desk lamp.

"Compact laser projection on the wall is so fun for my kids. You just plug it in and turn it either onto spinning through the pictures, or to where it pulses with music beat or clapping sounds. The projection is GREEN and RED. There are shapes like soccer balls, I heart you, Christmas trees,  a hand doing a peace sign, etc. You can not change the order or take any of the images out, it only works in one order. It covers a large wall for projecting - we have one room that is about 15 feet wide and it covers the entire wall floor to ceiling.You can't look towards the projection machine as the laser is so bright it hurts your eyes (and says not to look at it). The motor is really sensitive, it either is almost stopped or the images change super fast, there's not an in between speed.  We have only used it for about 15 minutes at a time - that's enough for my kids, but you can use it up to two hours at a time.

"Coming of age and Falling in love = Thea and Calder journey.  I enjoyed their charming backstory and how the characters evolved. He makes her want to be a better person, which was refreshing outlook since it's usually the girl trying to ""fix"" a guy. I enjoyed the easy moving dialogue and storyline.

"These smell wonderful but not over the top fake scent. It's more subtle, which I love. Not overwhelming like lush bath bombs can be for me. There are six golf ball sized bath bombs, two of each Christmas flavor, in a small egg carton. All of mine arrived individually wrapped and intact.They work upon dropping hem into the tub and again smell divine and cheery. Candy cane mint=yum.

"My previous Guide to Literary Agents was from 2011, so it was time for an upgrade. This book is solid packed full of info, from query letter examples, industry advice, and agents. The index is in tiny print and I've just recently gotten glasses so it's especially hard to use. I get wanting more to save paper but geez!  That said, the agent info is gold and it's an excellent reference for writers.

"Smells like Tropicana Sun Oil - remember that yummy scent. Coconut and Lime. It's my favorite scent so I'm particularly favorable of this spray. If you don't like coconut tropical smell - this is not for you.I've figured out that three sprays is the best for me. Remember to spray BEFORE you go to the bathroom. Lean in low so you're not just spraying the toilet seat and trash can, it will make a film over the toilet water. Then, do you business while the smell of Pina Coladas permeates your bathroom. It's like pooping in Hawaii:-)When you're done, and have flushed, you will only smell Coconuts, leaving a tropical paradise in the bathroom behind you instead of that awful fecal matter odor. Such a nice trail to leave behind for the next bathroom user.We leave ours in our guest bathroom so no one is embarrassed if they have to poop while visiting. It's become the outhouse of choice in our home for us that live there too.I'm not sure what it is made of, but it does say organic so that makes me happy. It doesn't leave that hairspray smell that makes you gag because it gets in your mouth and then everything you eat afterwards tastes like Aqua Net. This is a scent that lingers in the air and not your body.I don't know how they do it, but I love it. I recommend everyone keeps these in their bathroom, the packaging is nice and you can keep it by candles or hand towels. If I was working, I'd bring a bottle to work with me. I remember how awful it was to leave a dreadful bomb in the bathroom and have to smile as you wash your hands next to your co-workers.Happy to answer any questions. TMI - Ladies it also covers period smell (sorry, I know that's a lot of info!)

"My son is in love with this toy. He likes manipulating the lever and opening the hatch. His imagination is going wild.The transforming rescue bot is blue and is a ship and a robot. This is blowing his mind and he's been carrying around this cool transforming dude who is about 4 inches high, perfect for his little hands. Is this High Tide, I'm not sure, we have not gotten into the show yet. I'm sure that is coming!It's made of sturdy plastic and it's easily transportable. Nothing on it makes noise which I like, but my son would prefer it made rescue siren noise or something.Once it's out together it doesn't come apart.

"Like most nursing moms, I've tried a lot of different nursing bras. I really like this one! Why? Because it's a soft cotton fabric, there is support WITHOUT a wire! It's actually comfortable and I can wear it for long periods of time. It has padding! A lot of the bras I got at Walmart and Target did not have padding, so I appreciated the extra umph. This old grey mare just ain't what she used to be, so I'll take any help I can get. I know this is TMI - but I'm passed the leaking phase, but for anyone still there, you should probably still use nursing pads so that the milk doesn't soak into the padding of the bra, so you can still use it after you're through that stage.The pattern is cute and so is the lace on the front. It opens on each side easily and has not stretched out for me. I've learned to hand wash all my bras, or they don't last as long, so I've been doing that with this one as well.  And I hang dry.  It is for a machine wash, but that's your choice.And the price is awesome! I was fortunate to receive a free bra for an honest review and I feel comfortable recommending this product. It's the same quality as Walmart and Target and listed as very inexpensive. Plus I love the wide shoulder straps (they're adjustable in the back). I'm happy to answer any questions if you have any fellow moms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQAE4B5X4KVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ062AK#wasThisHelpful","R1RQAE4B5X4KVN","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is very different, meaning it doesn't necessarily follow the romantic formula. I was pulled in by the opening story of 12 year old love, but then I kept waiting while the book takes you on a completely different ride than expected. That is why it gets 4 stars from me. I was not expecting the turns it took and had to find out where it was going. That said, there are a lot of characters to follow.  A LOT. and I did like how much the friends were there for each other, but again, I asked myself more than a few times, ""Where is this going?!?!?"" I'm happy to report that I stuck with it to the end and the conclusion was satisfying for this reader (my personal opinion). Creative? Yes. Formulaic? No. It could be more of a journey of a woman finding herself than a romance novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIQS4AVDTI96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKX5LBK#wasThisHelpful","RIIQS4AVDTI96","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hesitant to purchase this, but I'm quite fond of it! The colors are brighter than in the picture, more red and purple and bold. Not soft colors like the photo. I've been wearing it with a lace tank under and it's super flattering. I thought I might look like Mrs. Roper (you have to have watched 3s company to get that reference) but I've been getting compliments on it and people asking where I got it. I always am worried that I look fat, but this is actually pretty flattering. I've worn it with tight black pants and skinny jeans (I'm not), and it's flowy and forgiving. For my body type, this really works well and I'm digging it.Note that it's a lot of fabric, super big. I typically wear a woman's size L and this is big on me, which I like. It's like a pretty tent that falls nicely. There is colorful trim on both the neck and at the end of the sleeves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3USFTFUV6KT0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCGQTEO#wasThisHelpful","R3USFTFUV6KT0Y","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Outdoor adventure Vest Awesomeness!  My son went ape over this best.  It's cute and he runs hot, so it's nice that the back is all mesh (and shoulders).  There is a sturdy black zipper down the middle that my son can manipulate once I get it started.  There are four pockets on the front of the vest, so lots of room for supplies, and collections like rocks and shells, depending on where you wear it.  This really puts my son in the adventure mood, he loves it.  He's small for his age, so it's a big big on him and sizing is so hard with everyone being such different body shapes, but this is could fit a toddler up to the early years of elementary (depending on your child's size).  It's sturdy and we've thrown it in the wash after some spills and it's fine (a little more worn looking, but the stitching stayed in tact and the pocket flaps are still laying down.

"These are fabulous megaphones. My sons have been playing with them constantly for the past few weeks and they're sparking their imaginations. And they're LOUD! But there is a volume dial at the bottom that turns the volume all the way off all the way to very very loud. My kids like it loud, but I prefer it to be quiet as to not upset the neighbors. There is a Fire siren that turns on and off by the left side button. It's easy to manipulate. On the right is the power button. You have to be pretty close to speak into the megaphone (there's a small slit where the speaker is), and my kids like to keep their mouths pressed on it to talk.These are nice quality megaphones.

"We seem to go through tons of ear buds in our home, so when I get a good pair like this, I hide them in my purse, away from my kids.  These Creative Aurvana in-Ear2 earphones are comfy in my ears and snug.  They have three size covers to choose from, but I like the medium ones that came on the pieces.  The shape of these suits my ears better than the iPhone standard white earbuds that are particular to which ear you use.  While these have set ears as well, I didn't notice a crazy difference if I had them in the ""wrong"" ear.  The audio on these from my iPhone is wonderful.  I could watch an episode of TV with my baby sleeping on me.  I didn't wake him up and I wasn't disturbed by the constant leaf blowers outside my windows (seriously, it's beyond awful) so thank you creative aurvana for helping remove their offensive noise.  I like the volume control and power on the cord, they're easy to use and work well.  The plug fits in my phone nice with a secure snap in, and also on my computer.  The case is convenient, and so far the ear buds have not slipped out of their packet.  As far as earphones go, these are one of the better sets I have reviewed.  Believe me, some really suck and break easily and are a hard plastic that hurt your ears.  These are better than that.  I'm confident that these will suit many customers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LYJB680480P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0WUI1O#wasThisHelpful","R23LYJB680480P","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Fins are awesome and once you're used to the flapping movement in the water, quite powerful.  The Mask fits snug and so far has been excellent at keeping water out, and not fogging up too often.  I've been using masks my whole life and this one is one of the better ones with a nice seal and suction to your face.  The snorkel fits in my mouth nice and I'm able to keep a solid grip while swimming and breathing.  The bag is handy to keep it all together and for travel.

"This is one of those toys that arrives in a big box and kids go crazy with anticipation of opening it.  My son about died the horse walks on it's own, he loves this.  Okay, the Barbie included is pretty and a regular size Barbie, with a soft feel.  The newer Barbie's I've gotten, this one included, are much softer in appearance than our harsh Barbies I grew up with and loved.  And I mean softer in appearance, not texture.  She's got on a cute riding outfit and equestrian hat and gloves, with boots.  She's just awesome.  And the horse is light brown, blue eyes, and a dark brown mane and tail (Not soft hair, it's all plastic).  She has a pink saddle and reins.  The horse has an on button disguised as bangs (mane) on it's head to make it go.  ANd on the side of the mane is a pink button where Barbie's hand goes before she's put on the horse.  It's fascinating and does work at times, but my kids mostly just put her on the horse themselves.  Overall, I'm quite impressed with this toy set.  It's cute and would make a great gift.

"These are quality pants that are lightweight, but built sturdy.  I'm pretty tall and these pants were long on me, so they should be able for most size 12 to wear, but they may need to roll up the bottoms or take them in on the length.  The waist fits comfortably above my belly button, so no butt crack when you squat down to pick anything up.  There are belt loops in case you want to wear a belt (I don't wear with these).  The fabric is light but not see through - no one can see the color of your underwear.  The legs are straight, so it depends on your body type to fill them out.  They were comfortable, slightly baggy on me, which I liked.  The front pockets are almost big enough for my hand, but not big enough to leave them in there.  Their is a pocket on each side in the back, it's a slit with reinforced seams, that a cell phone or something will fit in, but it's not closed so things can fall out.

"I'm quite happy with these bottles of Olive Oil.  Since I only use Olive Oil and Coconut Oil, I have tried quite a few brands and this one is excellent.  Why?  It's got a real olive taste.  Some olive oils are subtle and not watered down, but have less flavor.  These bottles have a very OLIVE kick.  Sorry, hard to describe tastes!  The bottles each have their own particular flavor.  I did a taste test back to back and their distinct, but again, hard to describe and I love them both.Cooking with these olive oils is divine.  They heat nicely (I know you're not supposed to get olive oil too hot), but I made a turkey sauce and it was wonderful..

"I've always been a fan of proactiv products, using them exclusively through my 30's.  I tried this product on both myself and my son.  It goes on grease less and soaks in quickly.  Though a gentle product, it still irritated my skin (in 40s), but worked wonderfully on my teenage son.  So, if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but if you're a teenager or don't have sensitive skin, it has cleared up an onery patch of acne off my son's temple.  Hooray!  This is a pretty large bottle and since you don't use it all over your face, just on problem areas, it should last a long time.  It says 3 months, but I think it will last longer for our usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNJBT00TZTIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7P7FO2#wasThisHelpful","R1SNJBT00TZTIL","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive rolling pin, that's heavy and solid, with adjustable measuring discs for the sides so you can roll out your dough to exactly the correct height.  I thought that was a super cool feature as I'm not much of a baker and any precision helps!  My teenage son is learning to bake and is high functioning autistic, so the exact measurements were a big selling point for him.  4 stars instead of 5 because I'm used to rolling the pin around all over in every direction.  With the measurement discs on the side, you have to use a smaller amount of dough at a time and don't have the flexibility to roll it around or it will put huge disc marks in your dough.  My son is new to rolling, so this wasn't an issue with him - because it was all he's ever known.  So new bakers might prefer this rolling pin, while old school dough all over the counter bakers will not.  Again, it's attractive and solid, so as long as I keep enough flour on hand, it's a no stick, fabulous, pin.  I'd recommend to an up-and-coming baker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TZ26DB113Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GG0T0KE#wasThisHelpful","R30TZ26DB113Z8","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book:  Dads of DisabilityCollected and Edited by Gary DietzAdditional Editing by Beth Gallob Poetry selected by Marly YoumansDads of Disability takes the reader inside the hearts and minds of men.  While so much love shines through each page, it is not sappy.  These men are brave, some are angry, they are fighting, and sometimes they break down.  The common thread is a raw and vulnerable honesty, the men do not hold back and their truth is appreciated.A plethora of special needs are showcased including PKU, Autism, Schizophrenia, Sensory Processing Disorder, Downs Syndrome, Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy, and Behavior Disorders, and ODD, which is informative, but not in the typical fashion.  Instead of reading about symptoms, the reader is drawn into the lives of these families and the learning is insidious rather than explained.  There is keen insight throughout.The book is told by several dads using poems, short stories, and  vignettes.  The editor keeps it moving, with no repetitive stories or themes.  At one point the women take over and talk about the men.  It's not all warm and fuzzy, but again honest and sometimes blunt. As a special needs mom, I resonated with these women.A segment by Jeffrey P. Howe was a nice surprise, having read his popular article in Money Magazine.  Reading about the article's backlash I hadn't heard about and his continued transformation was a highlight for me.  But, this doesn't take from any of the other stories. Each left their impact.Gary Dietz has a few personal stories planted throughout and doubles as editor.  As every movement needs a fearless leader, Gary puts himself out there, tears and all, which I imagine created the safety net for the others to follow suit.Some notable highlights:•How having a special needs child affects working relationships and your career. What not to say to a special needs child.  An example of a well meaning stranger with the best of intentions ruins a child's day.•The stress that will affect your marriage can make you stronger together or rip you apart.•That men have their breaking points to.•It's not about only the inspirational memes that are portrayed in the media.  These are real, everyday people with sometimes extreme daily challenges.  Not just the one minute hero moments to make everyone feel good.•Support is key.  While disabilities can create isolation, a common thread is the support from others.  Family, friends, a new girlfriend, a stranger, or even a yearly support retreat.  Support is vital.•These dads do not take the backseat.  It's a new generation and they are stepping up.  It's nice to hear the warrior dads roar.I recommend Dads of Disability for the mothers of special needs children to better understand their partners (or exes).  Grandparents should read to deepen their understanding.  This should be given to every father upon joining the special needs dad club (it would make a beautiful gift for those that don't know what to say).  And therapists and/or anyone who works with special needs families can gain a new perspective within these pages.  An enjoyable and important read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFECXJ4WXLON1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615971865#wasThisHelpful","RFECXJ4WXLON1","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belinda Jones is now my new favorite author and I'm reading through her entire catalog.  Why?  She's funny.  Really, super, laughing that stays with you, smile on your face funny.  Her humor is very quirky and out there at times, but I don't want t true story, I want and escape from all reality and she delivers. It's not a documentary people, it's fantasy!  Her lead character is a girl's girl, with great girlfriends.  There are many characters, but I could tell them apart easily.  It's sometimes ridiculous, but I loved the ride and enjoyed every minute of it.If you've ever harbored love for an old flame, or an old friend who was never a flame, this is your book.  Though I don't have that issue, I still enjoyed her journey to love and all the many, many, many twists and turns to get there.  The characters all learn life lessons and everyone grows.  Two thumbs up from me.  Hope you love it too:-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8QBP5H50WR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJSSJIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1I8QBP5H50WR3","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just Add Water: A Surfing Savant’s Journey with Asperger’s is the follow up book to the Quicksilver sponsored documentary of the same name (Just Add Water 2008).  Clay’s mom, Jill, begins the journey with Clay’s overdue birth and his early start in the water at just 2  weeks old.  Her and Clay’s story is all too common these days, with his turbulent school experience and struggles with social and emotional development.  The book is told by surfing author Robert Yehling, who takes you deep into Clay’s surfing world, waves, competitions, and travels, and snippets into Clay Marzo’s world by Clay himself, his journals from childhood, and perspectives of his family members, friends, and fellow surfers (and videographer and manager).  There are a few notable pictures included and some stand out Aspergers information from Dr. Tony Atwood and Clay’s behavior specialist Carolyn Jackson.As an Asperger’s mom to a teenage boy, I’m thrilled to have found this emotional and informative book, and to have someone like Clay in the public eye that my son can relate too.  While everyone say’s Einstein had autism, and that’s great, he’s not exactly someone my son wants to emulate, Clay is.The book is an honest portrayal into Clay’s life, his family’s struggles, and his current situation.  Yes, life continued after his legendary documentary, and Clay is now an adult.  They share how he’s dealing as a surfer presently, interacting with family, and how he manages to have a long time girlfriend, Jade.  It’s not all peachy and sugar coated and I enormously appreciate their openness and vulnerability.  The amount of awareness and educating this book does, while being entertaining, is as epic as Clay’s surfing.While surfing is a huge part of Clay’s life, the book examines all facets, including the importance of providing flexible learning environments for kids on the spectrum.  All teachers should read how much impact teachers had on Clay.  The traditional old-school, take away recess as a punishment, kind of teachers hurt Clay tremendously, while the progressive, kind and creative teachers brought out his amazing ability at creative writing.  Mary Anna Waldrop Enriquez was one of Clay’s champion teachers, and she made all the difference in his life.Clay shares his extraordinary outlook and the inner workings of his mind. Much like Temple Grandin who catalogs pictures in her memory, Clay memorizes each wave he rides.  He makes stimming cool (rubbing his hands together excitedly) , and he’s sharing his passion for surfing with other autistic individuals through his work with Surfer’s Healing.  He’s an inspiration, who isn’t on a pedestal, and an amazing athlete.  What’s not to love?This book will delight all parents (especially fellow warrior autism moms!), surf enthusiasts, teachers, and anyone curious about Aspergerg’s syndrome (or high functioning autism as listed by the DSM-5).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PXX3I4NU0EKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544256212#wasThisHelpful","R2PXX3I4NU0EKV","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Authors Scott Banks and Joe Kraynak have a new fan in me, having written a very thorough and comprehensive guide to Natural Cures.  If you're not into a natural lifestyle, this isn't the book for you, as it's about a completely natural lifestyle and not just quick fixes.  If you're interested in becoming more natural, this will help you take those steps from diet to sleep and exercise and avoiding Pharmageddon pitfalls.Part 2 covers most ailments I could think of from mental health to fertility to hair, skin and nail issues.  He tackles sleepIssues, adrenal and thyroid issues, and common kiddie health issues.  The remedies are mostly vitamins and or supplement recommendations as well as what may causing issues.  For example, for cataracts he suggests trying N-acetylcarnosine eye drops, triphala eye wash, dusty miller, and pascalite, all of which are available at health food stores and online (quality of all products matters).  Although the only cure for cataracts is surgery.Overall, I find the information to be helpful and I'm happy to have it on hand to reference and things come up with my family.  it's a reference book, but Ive found myself reading it all because it's interesting and informative.

One piece is a fully decorated minion (Siren Bob Minion), the other four are molded minions of different colors (blue, yellow, green, and orange).

"This is a short book, 123 pages, that is packed with information.  The book starts with excerpts from Dr. Temple Grandin’s speaking engagements.  She’s typical no nonsense Temple, with sound advice in each segment.  Advice that is applicable into your own or your child’s life.  There’s also brain scans and explanations to how the brain with autism works and WHY people with autism think the way that they do.The emphasis in these segments is on:•Behaviors and learning•Manners and social skills•Anger management•Autistics working/career development•Sensory development (multi-sensory activities)•And the autism brain (including fear box differences)The book then switches into question and answer format.  The questions are taken from Dr. Temple Grandin’s previous books including The Way I See It, Thinking In Pictures, and The Autistic Brain, and from questions asked at conferences and to Temple directly via email.  They cover the gamut of both sensory and autism specific questions.  She goes into her personal history, which inspires and educates simultaneously.Question Examples are:1. How do you feel about children’s book apps?  Are these better for learning?2. What should teachers keep in mind when teaching kids with autism?3.  How do you deal with teasing in high school?And many more questions, which are quite long and detailed from a variety of sources, but too long to list.Some important take-aways for me!•Teaching interaction with others.  I’m always shocked at the moms who tell me their kids don’t want to be social, so they don’t put them in activities.  Temple writes about the importance to socialize, especially if your kids don’t want to.•Learning to control anger.  This is big in the autism community.  She’s got great advice and personal experience.•Attention-Shifting Slowness.  Eye opening and should be mandatory reading for everyone who has autism or is around people with autism.•The fear box.  An ah-ha moment for me.  Helps me understand why my child is so fearful all the time.But that’s just a glimpse of what’s inside Temple Talks…about Autism and Sensory Issues.The audience for Temple Talks is parents who are overwhelmed and are weeding through massive amounts of information.  This book is useful because it’s divided into short bits that a parent can digest at their leisure.  It’s also great for a teachers, caregivers, or family member to understand the important things about autism and sensory needs. Sort of a cheat sheet for those without time to read temples library of work.And for the Temple fan, like myself, I always enjoy re-reading her advice, a reminder of how my child’s brain works.  And I always discover something new, or maybe I had glossed over before because it didn’t pertain to me at the time.My only criticism would be the lack of organization in regards to theme, but I think that's hard when there are so many questions about a million different subjects.  Just don't be expecting it to be sorted except for her talks and then questions and answers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW22PQPIM7QMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193556742X#wasThisHelpful","RW22PQPIM7QMT","A3IKLTT9JQACCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IKLTT9JQACCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have two extremely happy felines at the moment who are obsessed with these tunnels.  First, they're so colorful and happy looking, even I get happy looking at them.  Second, they're build well and the fabric is strong.  They each have a hanging toy that is like cat crack.  One of the tunnels is shorter and my cats like to hide in it and then dart out.  The second one can be kept in a circle type shape or opened to be long, so it's versatile.  It also has a hole on top for the cats to pounce out of.  The tunnels colapse a big if the cats spring on them, but then get back into their shape.  My toddler loves them too, but that's another story.  Oh and they're noisy.

"Our Baby Alive Lil' Sips Baby Has a Tea Party Doll has been quite loved at our home.  She's a hard doll (plastic, not soft) and her hair is plastic too (not the brushable kind).  Her arms, legs and head move at their main joints.  She's pretty and my kids swooped her up immediately.  Her dress is cute with gummi bears and cupcakes on it.The teapot and teacups (with screw on lids) have been the biggest hit.  They sort of change color when full of cold water, but they really like to pour the tea into the cup.  And then the cup lid fits perfectly into the dolls mouth and she drinks it...and then pees.  So now the diaper.  I have one kid still in diapers so I wasn't thrilled at the thought of buying diapers for a doll.  I found a pack of 6 diapers at Target for 6 dollars (NOT INCLUDED).  1 diaper is included in this set.  But the good news, if you put the diapers outside, they dry and you can use them again as long as the tape isn't totally ruined.  We have used our own tape on a few.  If your child really loves this diaper feature, be prepared to purchase diapers, but the novelty has worn out in my house, so we're good.The directions say to not put her in the tub.  Yeah, my kids could not grasp that concept and she went swimming with us and she had a bubble bath - she's fine and still works.  Probably not a good idea, but I'm just being honest here.  Maybe once she fills up with water outside of her drinking/pee system it messes her up.  So far, we've been lucky.  And just an FYI - my kids also put food coloring in her water to make her pee different colors.  Yes, kids are entertaining.Overall, especially since she's been through so much in our home, including a day of tattoos drawn on her ankle (hey big kids playing with the little ones - I'l take what I can get) , this doll is sturdy, pretty, functional, entertaining, educational, and all around fun.  She'd make a great gift for any small child, notice I didn't say girl because I have boys and my toddler has carried this around for the last few weeks (when he wasn't playing with trains and cars).

"This is a nice gadget for our kitchen for a few reasons.  While I personally don't love it as much as I wanted to, my teenager that is learning to cook does.  Since french fries and fried foods are high on his must eat list, this allows him the freedom to kind of re-heat frozen french fries in this contraption, and I like that it turns itself off when done (since my teenager is forgetful).  He thought he was super cool when he made his own chicken wings.  And I tasted them, they were good.  I'll update as we try to more items.As far as looks, it is a cross between a toaster and coffee pot and takes up counter space, but at least it's being used.

"They're relatively small, circle pills, that crack if you bite into them and are chaulky.  I swallow mine, but my son chews them.  He says they taste gross, but he does it anyways with water.  I'd say as long as you or your child can swallow small pills these are fine.We started these right before my son went on Spring Break, so I could monitor if there were any changes.  I didn't notice anything for about 10 days, but he said he felt good and had energy.  Almost 3 weeks in, he told me he didn't have autism anymore (not true! he still does!!!).  I asked why and he said, ""He doesn't feel like anything is wrong.""  So, I ordered another bottle.  Who is to say what is making him feel better, but this vitamin is the only change that we've added to his intake.  I doubt everyone would have the same results, but they seem to be working for him.  So, I'm taking them now too and so is my mom.  I don't feel any side effects and I have felt a bit more energized in the afternoons when I usually want to nap.  I certainly don't want to say they're miracle vitamins, so please don't misunderstand my review, I just wanted to share our experience.  I do like them and my entire family is taking them.  We are all being tested for the MTHFR gene mutation this summer, so maybe that has something to do with it.  My understanding is that these are made from Folate and not Folic acid, which is why we purchased them in the first place.  I'm not a doctor, just a mom.

"This tea beyond tea combo is fantastic!  First, my family and I enjoyed watching the tea buds open into flowers.  It's just fun.  They're not nearly as bright as the packaging photos, but they're more earthy and pretty.  The best thing about the tea though, besides the flowers, is the taste.  Even when steeping for too long, the teas are subtle and remind me of my favorite Chinese food restaurant as a child.  Simply tasty and smooth.  Sometimes teas can be hard on my system and make it hard to sleep, but none of these teas kept me up all night.These are lovely and memorable, which makes a really nice gift.

"The words ""The Great American Novel"" can only be applied to a few books, but choosing a single one is impossible.  Among those that come to my mind are ""Huckleberry Finn"", ""The Great Gatsby"", ""Point of No Return"" (J.P. Marquand), ""Sister Carrie"", ""Dodsworth"" and at least a couple by William Faulkner.  Out of the latter's fabulous bequest to literature, I would definitely choose LIGHT IN AUGUST as one.  (""Absalom, Absalom"" and ""Wild Palms"" are two others.)  Violence, sex, love, hate, religion, race, and the inescapable weight of the past fill this novel along with beautiful, sometimes even mystic, language.  While the story and atmosphere belong indubitably to Mississippi, the combination of all the elements is distinctly American and in some way, universal.  It was Faulkner's genius that made it so.  The central character, Joe Christmas, embodies the violence and ambiguity that slavery and subsequent race relations have imprinted on America.  He is marginally black, can pass for white, and maintains no set identity.  Joe Christmas has fallen through the cracks.  Yet such was the virulence of our racism (and maybe the past tense is not entirely appropriate) that many could construe his very existence as a crime.  There is a murder: the murderer is caught.  An abandoned, pregnant woman comes looking for her absconding man and finds another one.  A former minister can't rid himself of the Civil War ghosts of his father and grandfather.  The complexity of the plot is not what will hold you---rather it will be the masterly depiction of psychological forces, of personality, the past and how it continually echoes in the present.  Also it will be the way the whole story unfolds in slow majesty, revealing everything in due course.  If you have never read Faulkner, you might start with a shorter book, but this is probably his masterpiece.  I cannot think of a more powerful work of literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SD9G8RA4XWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679732268#wasThisHelpful","R12SD9G8RA4XWD","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some may hail him as a master of 20th century literature, but I found these four long stories pretty tough going and not always interesting.  There is very little description of people, places, or the times when the action takes place.  Many characters don't even have names; known only by police rank.  Without much knowledge of the author, whom I had not encountered before, I would say that he wrote more for himself than many other writers do.  He writes in an always-intellectual style on political, moral, and legal topics that interested him, whether readers share these concerns or not.  The phrase ""investigative essay"" has been used to describe Sciascia's writings and I think it's a fair term.  The third piece in the book, ""A Straightforward Tale"" most resembles a story in the usual sense of the word, though it is delightfully not straightforward at all.  All four parts of OPEN DOORS concern murder, the death penalty,  justice, and the question of whether it's really possible to understand the nature of crime, though of course we know when one has been committed.  ""Open Doors"", the title piece, harks back to political twists in 1937, the Fascist period in Italy.  ""Death and the Knight"" takes place in 1989, the year the author died, and deals with terrorism.  ""A Straightforward Tale"", already mentioned, is most Sicilian, connecting police, the courts, the church and the Mafia without ever mentioning that last organization.  ""1912+1"" also deals with a murder case, this a real one in 1913, in which a countess shoots dead a young lover---but why?  All the stories are interlaced with countless literary references and philosophical wanderings.  OPEN DOORS is definitely not beach reading, but thoughtful and illustrative of an interesting mind and a top writer.  It's not surprising that he doesn't have a mass following.  If Sciascia had not chosen to write in this genre, he might have gotten a Nobel Prize.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OS5ROO421XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679735615#wasThisHelpful","R19OS5ROO421XX","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life is certainly made up of mostly trivial events and repeated patterns which are in themselves uninteresting.  Even death, success, failure, and love can be lost in an overwhelming mass of trivial events.  ""I got up, I brushed my teeth, I ate a piece of toast with apricot jam, I put on my clothes and didn't put my pajamas away, I went out, saw a yellow Volvo heading down the street, then my brother called me on my cell phone and told me that our mother died.""  If this sort of narration interests you, you will like THE SMELL OF IT.  The ambience is Cairo/Egypt of the 1960s, not one which would be familiar to English readers of today.  That is an interesting plus.  The author spent five years in prison for political reasons, so his experiences and attitude are reflected in the writing too.  The five stories in this collection have a sad atmosphere which surrounds the tales of lower middle class Egyptian life of the time---an ex-prisoner's alienation, a fear of open spaces and raw nature, a child's view of divorce and war, an isolated family vs. the world.  All of these stories are embedded in a mass of trivia that indeed does surround us, but may or may not constitute satisfactory reading material for you.The author took this minimalist style in this, his early work.  Later he wrote more directly political material.  He is one of the important Egyptian writers, but not much translated into English.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MRZ7QXGT1AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=043599400X#wasThisHelpful","R11MRZ7QXGT1AD","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A callow youth spends some days in the English countryside at an estate presided over by a gray, unflappable host with an eccentric, colorful wife.  His other companions are a deaf girl, a cherubic girl who wants to try ""it"", a cynical bore with a speech for every occasion or topic, and not forgetting a lovely young thing who's a bit of a tease.  For awhile we also meet a youthful ladykiller with a yellow car.  Our callow youth dreams of romance with the lovely young thing but can't quite manage it.  He comes close once, but ah.....  Humorous and satirical, CROME YELLOW is full of Huxley's various philosophizings and you can definitely note the seeds of the idea for ""Brave New World"" that came later.  Crome is the name of the estate, and there is a paint color called ""chrome yellow"" I believe, but except for the ladykiller's car, there's nothing particularly yellow about this novel.  I confess to have missed something.  This is a light read.  The cover notes tell us that this novel shocked Europe in its day.  Well, that may have been, but it's totally innocuous by today's standards.  People who liked ""Brideshead Revisited"" will certainly like CROME YELLOW....it's not an action novel, but a lightweight satire of manners, of youth, and of those now-long past days.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZS2DSF4WO9GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492723851#wasThisHelpful","RZS2DSF4WO9GA","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oscar Lewis, in a brilliant series of books on Mexico and Puerto Rico, argued that poor people live in a special ""culture of poverty"".  It seemed to me when I read them that there were some flaws in this argument, though for sure poverty means the same thing all over the world.  It means you don't have everything you need.  It means more struggle, more worries, and odds against everything---proper health, education, housing, etc.  It means that generosity is more prized and unkindness more often remembered.  If you read about the lives of the Moroccan family in Munson's book, you will certainly recall Lewis' work too.  However, village life in Morocco probably resembles village life in Mexico or India more than it does urban slum life in the same country.  Urban slum dwellers everywhere face similar problems.  The middle class, ditto, the rich class, ditto.  And people can move from one class to another, often changing their behavior accordingly.  They keep their religious affiliations, even if the strictness of their observance may slacken. And they maintain their ties to the people back in their former way of life....sometimes quitting one milieu for another.  Some move up the ladder and return only as visitors..  So I am not sure that you can speak about ""a culture of poverty"".  It is enough to say that people with similar economic circumstances may face similar problems and come up with similar solutions.  They may behave in similar ways.  This is a family history, told through two members of the clan, a lower class man of strong, conservative beliefs and a woman who, through education and chance, moved to Europe, then America, marrying an American professor.  They both comment in turn upon all their relatives and tell the family history.  The research was done around 1980, thus dating the book somewhat.  However, as a rare insight into the details of Moroccan family life in unvarnished detail, it's a valuable study.  Though Westerners think of Muslim societies as strict and puritanical, the amount of philandering in lower class Moroccan society shown here calls that into question.  A case of ideals being overrun by reality.  People even in the same family follow entirely different economic, moral, and behavioral paths.  The difficulty of generalizing is so apparent when reading a book like this.  Readers may also be interested in ""A Life Full of Holes"" by Paul Bowles in cooperation with an illiterate Moroccan, Driss ben Hamed Charhadi, as well as Elizabeth Fernea's ""A Street in Marrakesh"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7H20L68N4PUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MEFFUM#wasThisHelpful","R7H20L68N4PUO","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the late 19th century, before the French finally occupied Morocco (calling it a ""protectorate""), there were no roads or railways in the country.  The Sultans could not control the outlying areas.  They tried to do so through local caids who had their own armies and made continual raids into the large, rugged areas beyond central control.  The fortunes of these subordinate rulers waxed and waned.  Maxwell's book is about the most successful family of these in the 20th century, a family based in the Atlas Mountains, which divide Morocco more or less down the middle.  In competition with two other of these local caids, the Glaoui family cast its fortune with the French and became the most powerful in the whole country.  They commanded an army of Berber warriors who gradually got modern arms.  They plotted and planned and got their relatives into all the important positions in much of the country.  The Glaoui family became so powerful as to get the sultan dethroned and exiled to Madagascar.  They called the shots---but only for a short while.  The tide of history changed.  Colonialism became too expensive and politically untenable.  The nationalist movement (Istiqlal) grew stronger, taking the exiled Sultan as its symbolic leader.  The French saw the writing on the wall; they were fighting a vicious war in neighboring Algeria.  They caved in.  The Sultan returned and the Glaoui fell from power.  T'hami El Glaoui died in early 1956 and Morocco regained its independence in the same year.  Today the once-mighty forts erected by the Glaoui family sit crumbling in the mountains.  How all this happened is a fascinating story, very well told in this book.  While it might not be academic history, you don't get a chance to read about these events and these characters in many places.

"Melville Herskovits, who died in 1963, is not the most famous anthropologist ever, but he was the first white man to tell the world to wake up and smell the coffee.  That is, that African cultures were rich and varied, that they had been brought by slaves to the New World and still lived on, though mixed with European and Native American-derived elements.  He founded the first African Studies department in the US and a great library at Northwestern University.  His many studies of African cultures in West Africa, Haiti, Surinam, and Brazil showed the way to many others.  In the racist society of his day, it took a white man to open the door, through which many scholars of many races have followed.  It was not news to people of African descent.Herskovits also tried to show how cultures mix and meld, how it is impossible to divide a society like Haiti's into European and African sectors---everyone lived in both sectors.  At a time when ""voodoo"" and ""zombies"" were the stuff of comic books and horror tales, he attempted to describe Haitian vodun accurately, with no sensationalism, and link it to West African religion.  LIFE IN A HAITIAN VALLEY is a lengthy compendium of all the details of many aspects of life that he and his wife were able to amass in some three months of intensive field work.  In my opinion, that was not enough time to do a thorough job, but as one who has never set foot in Haiti, I'm not in a position to criticize his observations or comments.  This is ethnology in the mid-20th century style---trying to cover in a single book life cycle, economic life, religion, magic, and the arts as well as trying to link the whole to a wider African culture.  There is no link to any individual; the observed don't speak, only the observers.  As I said, this was the prevailing style, so it's not a real criticism.  I think the value of Herskovits' work is in a) the ties he draws very well to West Africa, b) the comments he makes about the relevance of his work to the USA and African-Americans (he uses the word ""Negro""), c) the down-to-earth approach to Haitian religion.  Maya Deren's work ""Divine Horsemen"" covers similar ground but plunges into the depths of the matter so quickly that it doesn't provide much of a learning experience, d) his comments on the mixing of cultures, which after all, is almost a human universal, whether you like it or not, and e) in providing us today a social history of Haiti 80 years ago.

"This is a collection of badly-translated essays written by two gentlemen of Japan back in the late '80s.  One was the chairman of Sony Corp., Morita Akio, and the other, a rather unsavory right-wing politician, Ishihara Shintaro, who later became Governor of Tokyo for 13 years.  While I think it would be positive if Japan stood up to the US against some of our more dubious activities, the ""Japan That Can Say No"" takes a narrow, nationalistic tack backed by some doubtful facts as well.  That the two authors failed to see that Japan's bubble of the 1980s would someday burst and that that day would come sooner rather than later speaks loudly of the ""wisdom"" of their comments.  That Mr. Ishihara thinks that Korea and Taiwan benefitted from Japanese colonialism may be true in the same way that India, Vietnam, or Indonesia ""benefitted"" from European colonial rule.  But when he suggests that Singapore (under Japanese military occupation for four years) also owes its later prosperity to Japanese tutelage, I just had to laugh.  Americans behave like mad dogs, they are shifty, they are doomed....yeah, well, OK, how y'all doin' ?  I wouldn't claim any ""knight in shining armor"" role for the US, but Japan's role on the world stage before 1945 was not marked by much altruism.  The most telling point to be made about this book is that Mr. Morita, to his credit, disavowed his participation later on.  THE JAPAN THAT CAN SAY ""NO"" created a minor splash at the time, but I think that today it can be forgotten.  If you are looking for a good book on Japan's situation up to the mid-1990s, you should take a look at ""The Emptiness of Japanese Affluence"" by Gavan McCormick.

"The American media has always liked to delineate ""sides"" in any conflict.  We come to think of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", aggressors and defenders.  But in many situations, it's not so simple.  Look at the Middle East today.  I'm not going to go into that.  But the situation in Poland, as World War II drew to a close, was at least as chaotic as today's conflicts in the Arab world.  You had Nazis, you had German civilians beginning to flee west before the oncoming Soviet army.  You had that Soviet army, in no mood to forget what the Germans had been doing in their country since 1941, but unwilling to help the nationalist rising in Warsaw in 1944.  The instigators of that rising, the former ruling class in Poland, many of whom had fled to Britain in 1939-40, broadcast encouragement and tried to support allies still in Poland.  These were as anti-Semitic as the Nazis; they hoped to recover their privileges at war's end.  Opposed to them were Polish Socialists and Polish Communists (who marched to the Soviet drum).  Jews and other Poles, released from the camps, Russian slave-workers freed from Germany---all were criss-crossing the country, trying to survive in the destroyed cities.  As the Russians advanced, it became obvious they were planning to stay, their Polish allies would help them do it..  Polish guerrillas gathered in the forests.  Atrocities occurred all around.  Ideology often trumped humanity.  Tell me...who were the good guys here?  Most people just tried to stay alive, not easy.  To explain how all this felt, Milosz, previously a poet, wrote this novel, giving a number of characters roles which would display how all the different ""sides"" thought.  From Marx to Catholic conservatism, from uneducated peasants to philosophers, he draws a fine political portrait of that tragic, unsettled time in Polish history. For a glimpse of the Polish politics of the 1940s, you couldn't do better.  How strongly do you feel the pull of that subject?  On that, you should base your choice.  It's well-written, if somewhat diffuse owing to the large number of characters, but the objective is clear.  This is literature with political intent, as the title may show.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYHNE886CFIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0349123322#wasThisHelpful","RQYHNE886CFIB","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By 1939, Alan Villiers, an Australian, had already sailed in most kinds of sail-powered ships still at sea.  He wondered how it would be to sail with the fabled Arab navigators who still ran dhows and other types of traditional craft from Arabia's rocky shores to India and down the East African coast.  Being a man of action, he (by some means not quite clearly described) managed to become a passenger on board two trading vessels.  The first took him on a short cruise up the eastern coast of the Red Sea.  The second, the description of which takes up most of the book, sailed along the coast of what is now Yemen, then doubled back, crossed to Somalia (then under Italian rule), and slowly moved down the coast to Kenya, Zanzibar and the Rufiji River delta in Tanganyika.  The return voyage took Villiers all the way along the coast of Oman, past the Trucial States and Bahrain, to Kuwait, home port of the captain and sailors.  I don't know if any Arab sailing vessels still ply those waters, but I suspect the combination of motors and oil wealth in most of the region has put a stop to such ship voyages.  So, SONS OF SINBAD is one of the few records we have from ""inside"".....a Westerner living on board an Arab ship in extremely difficult conditions, suffering the horrible climate and living conditions in a huge mangrove swamp, while not speaking very fluent Arabic.  He liked everything and describes his experiences with genuine delight, while not making light of the hardships, the worst of which (on the voyage outbound) was the presence of a huge number of passengers who covered the deck.  There are many interesting tales within the story.  We realize that the Arab sailors of the 1930s, no longer had the skills and knowledge of the ancient mariners that crossed oceans.  Villiers' companions always hugged the coast.  Villiers also accompanied a pearl merchant as he sailed out to the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf to buy his merchandise directly from the captains of the boats.  You may contrast the hard life of the indentured divers with the lives of their grandchildren who live in the oil-rich kingdoms of Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Emirates, not to mention Saudi Arabia.Villers was nothing if not an experienced sailor.  He seems to have written this fascinating adventure mainly for other sailors.  Unless you have a good knowledge of nautical lingo such sentences as ""Her few ancient blocks were battered deadeyes."" may stymie you.  You should be ready to understand pintles, quarter dants, in catspaws, spanker, the bole of the mizzenmast, unwieldy parrals, grapnel, and a host more words which, I admit, do not trip off my tongue so easily.

"Journalists who cover Mexico ought to speak Spanish .  Terry Pindell traveled around Mexico by rail (and other means of transport) for a considerable time.  He obviously likes people and got along with everyone, yet I have to wonder if we are not reading these words courtesy of his companion, Lourdes Ramirez Mallis, who maybe should have written the book.  This ""train"" travels on two tracks.  The first is a potted Mexican history, which I thought was well-done, fair, and written with the average reader in mind.  This was a plus.  The history is interspersed with the detailed accounts of his travels from the US border to Guatemala and lots of points in between.  We learn about the parlous state of many Mexican trains in the 1990s, the sights to be seen from the windows, a few people met on board, and the hotels, drinks, food, and street life of the various cities visited.  Mexican opinions about the Zapatistas of Chiapas (very active at the time), about corruption, politics, and poverty are found throughout.  I noted that he stayed in luxury hotels everywhere, at some pretty fancy resorts. I noted that he had some interest in crystals and he called the Maya and Zapotec ""tribes"".  A praiseworthy attempt to sympathize with the plight of Mexico or to express his delight in its culture goes too far sometimes.  He claims that English colonial policy was ""genocide"" but the Spanish one differed.  Events in North America may be called ""genocide"", (though it was more the Anglo-Americans who did it later) but what about the English behavior in Asia and Africa?  Did they enslave the population of India?  Did they forcibly convert them?  Did they knock down their temples and put churches on top?  Did the population of the subcontinent drop by 90%?  No, Mr. Pindell, I don't think that comment washes.I thought the travel ""track"" lacked insight and was ridden with unnecessary personal details he should have left in his travel diary.  YESTERDAY'S TRAIN turns out to be a metaphor for the PRI, the long-ruling main party of Mexico.  The time had come for a change.  They were ""yesterday's train"" and the country needed a new engineer, a new set of rails and a new direction.  Would they get them?  It's a good image.  But if you want to know about Mexico's problems and current direction, you could read Mexican authors if you know Spanish, or read some foreign authors who have a deeper acquaintance with the country.

"If happiness is the coincidence of good digestion with egotism, then we can understand why the protagonist of this brilliant novel is seldom happy.  In Portuguese style, he lives with ""saudades"" of the past, of times gone by and irretrievable.  But for him, happiness is far away as he recalls his despair, anger, disgust, and trauma at his experience of 27 months of colonial war in Angola back in the 1970s.  A doctor with the frontline troops in the remotest part of a remote colony, he sees the endless, useless bloodshed, the cruelties and stupidities of a war waged by a small European country in the heart of a vast continent that it could never control.  Portugal itself was poor and backward, what to say of its giant African colonies?  The doctor talks to you, the reader, or is it a nameless woman with whom he shares a one night stand?  It's a monologue....she departs without saying a word.  Perhaps Portugal's occupation of African lands was something of a one night stand that lasted 400 years in part.  The doctor hopes she will listen to his sad agonizings about what he did or didn't do; she should listen as he describes why he no longer believes in himself.  The story is basically ""how I survived the Angolan war"".  Maybe he didn't really survive as himself, but turned into another person, far older and more cynical than his actual years.  What makes this novel unforgettable is the language, brilliantly translated into a poetic, lyrical monologue full of clever or beautiful images that will strike you as original.  This novel, originally with a title probably unprintable on Amazon review pages, but having to do with an idiom in Portuguese meaning ""the end of the world"" or as Aussies say, ""beyond the black stump"", was the author's second.  If you like this one, read his ""Fado Alexandrino"", a longer, more complex tour de force, also to do with soldiers returned from African wars.

We hope to widen our scope by reading the various works of anthropology written over the years, but since the world is changing very fast, today's anthropology becomes the social history of tomorrow.  So, we continuously need more fieldwork.  But how is that fieldwork actually done?  You are going to get just a vague idea about that in this book because the trouble is that nobody can really describe your fieldwork experience for you before you have it !As Rabinow says in this short but very effective book, nobody really teaches you how to do fieldwork.  Most authors never let on how they got their opinions and information, we never meet the people who spoke to them.  You study all kinds of theories and models in graduate school, read some of the great studies of the past, but if you don't do fieldwork, you never really join the fraternity of anthropologists.  Even if today's anthropologists no longer search for ""untouched cultures"" (in quotes because these scarcely existed and your presence put an exclamation point on such an idea), they still undergo similar experiences.  You arrive at your destination, whether in a Greek village or on a remote Pacific island, a New York slum or a group of Sri Lankan hospitals.  What should you do first?  Whom should you contact?  Do you speak the language well enough?  What are appropriate questions here?  What ideas and preconceptions have you brought with you? What will be the consequence of linking up with this person instead of that one? The list of questions is endless and it can be a bewildering experience, at least at first.  Rabinow tells the whole story (I think) of his own fieldwork experience and reflects on it at the same time.  It's a magnificent effort which should be read by anyone planning to do fieldwork in anthropology.  Along with Hortense Powdermaker's ""Stranger and Friend"", David Maybury-Lewis' ""The Savage and the Innocent"", Nigel Barley's ""Adventures in a Mud Hut (or ""The Innocent Anthropologist""), and maybe Malinowski's ""Diary in the Strict Sense of the Word"", this volume can abuse anyone of the idea that you just waltz in, ask your questions, eat some local food, and head home.  If you have already done field work, it will bring back a lot of memories and may help you to make more sense of your own experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QT24RGF2HU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520251776#wasThisHelpful","R11QT24RGF2HU1","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say that ""Kentucky"" meant ""dark and bloody ground"" in some Native American language.  That may or may not be true, but in world bloodshed sweepstakes, that American state probably does not deserve the name.  We humans have excelled in turning all sorts of places into ""dark and bloody grounds"".  The Caucasus and eastern Anatolia come to mind, as do Afghanistan and the Balkans.  We are hard at work creating more candidates.  One such place which does not immediately spring to mind today is that part of eastern Germany now lying split between Poland and Russia, the area once known as East Prussia.  The original Prussians were a pagan people neighboring the Poles and Lithuanians.  Over some centuries bloody campaigns against them wiped them off the map.  Their name was usurped eventually by those Germans (and a few others) who conducted yearly crusades against the pagan Baltic peoples.  This group of northern crusaders became known as the Teutonic Knights, a kind of Knights Templar or Knights of Malta.  They had their own organization and knights from all over Europe, bored or zealous, flocked to their standard to engage in killing and pillage among the Balts.  They fought the Catholic Poles on occasion.  The Lithuanians converted to Catholicism and united with Poland.  The Teutonic Knight leaders accumulated vast estates and finally became rulers or nobles.  They lost a giant key battle with the Poles.  Prussia emerged as a new kingdom on the map of Europe, uniting with Brandenburg and Berlin.  Their rulers became the Hohenzollerns, a series of warlike, Protestant kings culminating in Frederick the Great who died in 1786, but continuing in united Germany till the end of WW I.  Prussia helped partition Poland, was conquered by Napoleon, and finally merged with the other German states in 1871,  Prussians were famous for iron discipline and being very conservative politically.  Perhaps incorrectly, their name got associated with German atrocities and militarism in the 20th century.Roy had an interesting idea.  That was, travel around the Polish areas taken over from Germany that used to be East Prussia and around the isolated enclave of Kaliningrad which used to be the city of Konigsberg and environs.  Together with the travel impressions, he would bring the long, bloody history of the area alive.  In his work, I would say he was halfway successful.  Up to the 19th century, we follow everything very well.  We understand that we are learning about Prussia---the kings, the battles, the Junkers (country squires more or less).  But then, we are launched off into long digressions on German motives, behavior and achievements in WW I, in the Weimar Republic, and during Hitler's rule and WW II.  Prussia sort of recedes into the distance, though the travel part keeps going.  We get long sections on the Holocaust and Nazi soldiers' experiences.  These are not new, they are not really connected to ""A Vanished Kingdom"".  The black and white photos provided are very blurry, the maps poor (no map shows how the former East Prussia was divided), and the focus is on military history and the suffering of Jews, Germans, Poles and even Russians.  Everything else is cut short.  I was rather disappointed.  My own paternal grandparents emigrated illegally from Russia, worked in Konigsberg, and sailed from that city to America in 1905.  Thank God they did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5K45U64UZN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813337933#wasThisHelpful","R3U5K45U64UZN5","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 1960, John Steinbeck wildly overloaded a converted pickup truck and took a trip around some of the states for a few months.  He said he was ""looking for America"" but I think what he really found was John Steinbeck.  He traveled with a poodle named Charley and named his truck ""Rocinante"" from Don Quixote.  His quest was definitely quixotic.  He left his home on Long Island, traveled through New England and upstate New York, then across the Midwest to Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota.  Passing through Montana, he then went over to the West Coast and visited Washington and the scenes of his youth in California, met a few of the odd characters that had populated such novels as ""Tortilla Flat"".  Finally, he drove Rocinante across Arizona and New Mexico into Texas where he visited some rich folks, then observed some appalling scenes of segregationist aggression in Louisiana.  He returned home from there.  There is not much of local color aside from occasional lyrical descriptions of the landscape and weather.  He doesn't get into much history either.  His philosophizing about the character of the nation and the nature of Man is the strong point of the book.  He meets some interesting characters, has a few small adventures, but a lot of TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY is internal.  It could have been called ""Travels in John Steinbeck"".  I thought his concern for our over-materialistic culture, our plasticizing everything, our (then) lack of worry about pollution and the environment way ahead of his time.  For this, he deserves any amount of stars. He realizes that the America he'd grown up to believe in, to treasure, was already gone, but was wise enough to know that such changes have always happened.  I believe the book was a book-of-the-month club selection when it came out, so Steinbeck no doubt provided no small influence in changing the way people thought about our national direction.  Charley, though anthropomorphized like crazy, didn't have much to say after all, but his presence was a plus.  This is one of Steinbeck's classic works, the fine product of a Nobel Prize winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8D2QQ8JZCGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140053204#wasThisHelpful","RL8D2QQ8JZCGN","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Madagascar is widely-known (if known at all) for its unique wildlife and plants.  The Malagasy people and their cultures are almost hidden.  This is a shame, for they are among the most interesting on earth.  Profusely illustrated, Mack's offering is less an in-depth approach to any one aspect of Madagascar's culture or cultures, and more an introduction to that fascinating land.  It was written to accompany a large exhibition in the British Museum's Museum of Mankind back in the 1980s.  While of course events and statistics have moved on, this is still an excellent book which provides an outline of Malagasy history as well.  It starts with a consideration of the origins of Madagascar's people---both Indonesian and African, discusses the role of Islam in early times (it faded out over the centuries), and the rise of the small early kingdoms that arose in many locations.  The mostly-19th century development of an island-wide monarchy comes next along with the rise in European influence at the same time.  He then turns to the role of the ancestors in Malagasy culture, the famous famadihana (exhumation, reburial, and subsequent celebrations with the wrapped bones of the ancestors) and the styles of tombs or cenotaphs around the country.  All through, the author discusses various crafts and arts practiced by the Malagasy.  Though short, it is an admirable job, very thoughtful, presenting ideas developed by many anthropologists and historians who have worked in different parts of the great island.  While some readers may require more, this would be a good source for someone just beginning an interest in Madagascar, for a teacher who wanted later to introduce more in-depth works by Bloch, Feely-Harnik, Kent, Kottak, or Sharp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAFJ9YF9262C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0714115800#wasThisHelpful","RZAFJ9YF9262C","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doing field work is, as the author suggests early on, a kind of rite of passage for would-be anthropologists.  Not only is it the way to know a particular place and culture in depth, but it helps you to understand how all those other works lining the shelves of college libraries were brought to fruition.  But, let's face it, by 1978, when Nigel Barley set off for field work in Cameroon, the pattern of going off to some remote tribe or isolated people and trying to ""re-construct"" their whole culture for the edification of readers (and Ph.D. committees) back home had tapered off significantly.  Lots of people went to urban or agricultural societies, did research on less all-encompassing subjects and still turned up with interesting results.  What I mean is that Barley did not have to undergo the difficulties that he did; he could have chosen a less-rigorous location or topic.  It wasn't necessary to seek out the Dowayo in northern Cameroon.  But, OK, he did choose them.  More power to him, sure, but then why complain about it?  I felt very irritated at the beginning of his book.  Once he gets through the urban bureaucracy, though, I liked the way he honestly sets out the basic problem of field work----you aren't sure what you are doing, you aren't sure where you need to go next, and you wonder if anything you're doing is meaningful.  You have to sort out good informants from bad, misleading information and wrong information from good.  It's not easy.  And in trying physical conditions, when people have absolutely no idea about what you are doing, it's even more difficult.  Insects, bad or weird foods, illness, transport problems, heat, lack of sex....it's a lot easier to do research in a library somewhere.  But in that case, you won't write a very readable book.  At last, after a long time away, you have to re-enter your own culture with a vastly interesting experience behind you which almost no one wants to hear about.  In turn, their concerns may seem extremely small and prosaic to you.  If you would like to read an honest and sometimes amusing account of doing field work, you could do far worse than get hold of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCCDEDDFR4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814908802#wasThisHelpful","R1MCCDEDDFR4V","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can you imagine describing a Van Gogh painting as being ""yellow, blue, green, and white""?  How about Beethoven's Ninth as being ""made up of eight notes in various octaves with a few sharps and flats tossed in""?  No, right?  So, then how can we describe Goa, an Indian region, a very small state OK, as being composed of Catholics, Hindus, and Muslims with a few castes or tribes tossed in?  You definitely need a sharper, deeper mode of description.  People have been trying to do this for some decades.  Alexander Henn's new book tries to describe Goan reality in a new way and I would say it is brilliantly successful.  If it veers more to ""religious studies"" modes of description then probably that is what it takes.  He covers several topics including the fascinating question of why the Portuguese seemed to have mistaken Hindu religious sites and practice for Christian when they first arrived in 1498.  While this might seem tangential to a discussion of modern Goa, it underlines the long, complicated nature of the Christian-Hindu encounter over 500 years.  Then there is a wide-ranging and thoughtful analysis of the relationship of the two religious traditions in Goa as seen by Henn himself over many years of research.  He looks at the Hindu-style Christian ""puranas"" written long ago and he goes deeply into the inseparable ties of land, people, and gods in Goan villages.  These ties may have changed religion in many cases, but they remained as close as ever.  Religious festivals in which people of both religions participate have long been noted in Goa.  Henn discusses some in detail, especially the Jagar of Siolim village of which he has made films also.  And finally, he turns to the whole question of ""syncretism"".  Whether this word (which others have used as well) should be applied to Goa is a question.  Is it actually helpful in description?  After all, what culture is not a product of syncretistic patterns?  It is only a question of whether they were observed by our contemporaries or not.  Certainly a Goan culture exists, even if all Goans belong to one or other of the great religious tradition and no one to both.  Others have written about Goan culture, but I think, with this book, the exploration has been taken to a much higher level.  If this volume is not exactly ""bedside reading"" for most people, it is not less valuable a contribution.  I think in future, people seriously interested in Goa and its fascinating history and culture must read HINDU-CATHOLIC ENCOUNTERS IN GOA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNZTOYUFY5ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253012945#wasThisHelpful","R3NNZTOYUFY5ST","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While doubting Freudian psychology and its techniques, Svevo creates a psychological tour de force in which his main character, Zeno Cosini, reveals his thoughts and life over many years, from the 1870s up to the middle of WW I.  Set in Trieste, then a prosperous Austro-Hungarian port, the novel traces Zeno, through his ""own"" writing, from childhood to late middle age.  We learn of his childhood behavior and his weaknesses (especially his inability to stop smoking despite constant declarations throughout his life that ""this would be the last cigarette"").  His world of relationships seems very limited.  He lies constantly, repents, makes foolish mistakes, makes many unfulfilled resolutions.  In short, he's like a lot of us.  He develops a crush on the eldest of four sisters, but she wants nothing to do with him and indeed, he can scarcely get up the courage to speak to her.  Instead, in some moments of indecision and confusion, he winds up asking one of the younger, less-desirable sisters to marry him, while Guido, a handsome young fellow with a wealthy father in Argentina, marries the eldest.  What are his thoughts on this?  We read them in plenty.  He eventually takes a mistress, but it isn't a very smooth relationship.  His business dealings too are far from smooth or competent and he gets too financially involved with his brother-in-law, the same Guido, who might be seen as an opposite personality of Zeno himself.  Overall, Zeno lacks self-confidence, he's given to making contradictory statements, puts his foot in his mouth regularly, and he is guided in action only by his latest sentiment, which tends to change drastically.  The story closes in a very dark mood, as Italy plunges into its disastrous WW I campaigns.  CONFESSIONS OF ZENO is a brilliant psychological portrait.  There is not very much action and the drama is all psychological.  Unless you are intrigued by that sort of novel, you might find this book tedious.  I thought it was amazingly well-constructed and wondered how much of the personality revealed in the pages was Svevo's and how much just the product of a skillful writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DU2ASO6LLZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNXDAZ4#wasThisHelpful","R16DU2ASO6LLZE","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anthropology split long ago with its practitioners heading off on many diverse tracks.  Gender, health, law, image and identity, family, religion....the possibilities became legion.  And if you wanted to ""keep up"" in your field, you had to read the books which dealt with that particular track while hoping to be able to follow---in a more general way---some others.  So, I must confess that this volume is the first I have read which deals with ambiguity and marginality.  While finding a study of a small area of Greece near the Albanian border interesting---it is a part of that region called Epirus, which has been contested for some considerable time---I realized as I read that ""ambiguity"" plays a far more important role in life and society than I previously considered.  (I had not considered it, to be frank.)  Anthropology, the author points out, has always emphasized ""belonging"" to a place and what separates the people found there from others, rather than the connections, the possibility of marginality, and the constant change which makes certain things invisible, then visible again.  But instability, contested-ness, and fluidity have been part of Epirus for a long time and if you think, part of so much of the world, now more than ever.  The Balkans, she argues (riffing on the English word ""Balkanization"") don't suffer from too much fragmentation if you look under the (Western-imposed) surface, but from too much connection.  ""Everything about the Balkans,"" she says (p.140) ""is contested, including explanations for that state of affairs."" I may add that on thinking, I surmised that love is ambiguous, especially bisexual love or love of more than one partner; immigrants live in marginal, ambiguous circumstances, what to say of refugees?  And in many parts of the world, religion has ambiguous qualities.  The work of Rosaldo (on history in Philippine anthropology or vice-versa) and Leach on the ambiguous identity of hilltribes in Burma don't feature in Green's gaze, but I suspect they and far more could be included in an imaginary ""Ambiguity in Anthropology"" series.  As a book, NOTES FROM THE BALKANS ranks as highly-academic, lots of footnotes, lots of jargon and lots of the use of ""ironic"" or ""questioning"" quotation marks (which certainly add to the general atmosphere of ambiguity, by the way!)  I found it rather tough going, but full of interesting ideas, full of all sorts of side topics which, when considered, add a lot to the overall impact of the book, topics like fractals, soil erosion, contrast of modernity and modernization, statistics and their usage, and geomorphology.  The author's experiences in Greece over some years in the 1990s play a role, but overall, this is more a book of ""thinking about a topic"" than ""in depth ethnographic description"".  The papering over of differences to seem more modern, to get more funding from the EU, to make Greece into a more mono-ethnic state, or just to avoid conflict means that ambiguity exists under the surface in many ways.  Epirus as a region was marginal to the Ottoman Empire, to the Greek state, and is still to Europe.  The region she focused on is marginal even in Epirus. Green has elucidated all this very well and finally, may I say, unambiguously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8FNTI6VKXG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691121990#wasThisHelpful","RN8FNTI6VKXG7","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The love of the exotic lurks in many hearts and has for centuries.  Some people, when told a place is closed, off limits, verboten, must go there at any cost.  So it was with Tibet.  But not only was Tibet far away, a blank spot on world maps, it had an aura of magic, mysticism, and mystery.  Tibet---mysticism---the occult---spiritual life: these connections spread through the West and Russia like measles in a kindergarten.  What a challenge, then, for the adventurers of this world.  From the 1600s on, a certain kind of Westerners (missionaries, soldiers, explorers, mystics) yearned to reach Lhasa, the ultimate Forbidden City.  Their efforts are well recorded by Orville Schell.  Most of them failed, but returned with tall tales nonetheless.  In 1904, the infamous Younghusband expedition (""Bayonets to Lhasa"") battered its way to the Tibetan capital over the bodies of hundreds of Tibetans who had nothing to match machine guns.  This was supposedly in aid of keeping the Russians out, but Younghusband was dead keen on getting there long before.  Travel to Tibet, well into my own lifetime, was like a pilgrimage to ""Otherness"".  Tibet, a real society, with deep socio-economic problems, a feudal system, was turned into ""Virtual Tibet"", a figment of Western imagination.Meanwhile, back in Hollywood----the Dalai Lama became a cult figure for many of the figures of Filmistan.  The cultural destruction of Tibet under Chinese rule came to the attention of many who previously could not have found Tibet on a map.  In the 1990s, not one, but two movies were produced about Tibet----the film version of Heinrich Harrer's ""Seven Years in Tibet"" and ""Kundun"", more the story of the Dalai Lama.  Since filming on site was out of the question due to politics, the former was filmed in Argentina starring Brad Pitt.  Schell weaves an interesting tale, alternating between the story of Tibetan travellers and the production of the film.  In the end, it seems that the film and real Tibet merged because the film brought the extinct version of Tibet back to life for Tibetan actors and film audiences everywhere.  ""...in the popular imagination of the West, the plight of the Tibetans....occupied against their will....has been added to the lure of Tibet as a mystical place of physical beauty and spiritual refinement.""  But haven't Westerners created ""virtual Tibet"" in order to improve the quality of our lives, to give hope that somewhere out there Shangri La really exists?  Wasn't Heinrich Harrer an unreconstructed Nazi?  Do we know much about real Tibet?  These are very interesting questions because Tibet is not the only place, nor Tibetans the only people, to suffer ""virtualization"".

"Every school kid knows that gold was found in California in 1848.  If you ever sang ""Clementine"", you remember the words ""lived a miner, forty-niner"".  But how much else about that episode in 19th century American history have you really thought about?  I recently read a good novel, ""Bitter Passage"", about the harrowing trip across country taken by so many of the Argonauts of those days.  Like that novel, Rohrbough's book does not wax eloquent about the fortunes made by gold miners.  Only a few people really managed to come home with the prize.  Mining in the creeks and rivers of California was no joke; it involved tough, unending toil over months with no guarantee that you would wind up with more than a pittance.  Due to the sudden influx of thousands of hopefuls, goods and labor became scarce and extremely high-priced, so though gold mining might have paid more than farm labor or small-time shopkeeping back East, the cost of everything more or less negated the gains.  Many of those who headed to California ""saw the elephant"" but also saw that profit might lie more easily in providing goods and services to the mining mobs.  Even that did not always pay off.  DAYS OF GOLD is based largely on the letters and diaries of numerous participants in the Gold Rush gleaned from libraries and historical societies in 14 states; a research job which couldn't have been easy.  Turning the disparate sources into a flowing narrative was even harder, I imagine.  Government reports, travel stories, and other sources are used as well.  The chapters are organized topically rather than chronologically.  The author has not neglected to mention the role of women, the situation back in the home towns of the gold seekers, the effects on miners' families, the disappointments which were more common than the successes, the violence against Indians and non-American miners, life and leisure in the gold fields, the effect of new money and lost population on the East, and a host of other, interesting topics.  Well-organized and easily read, this book of social and economic history is both informative and a pleasure to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCTO7RW0WX9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520216598#wasThisHelpful","R2DCTO7RW0WX9Q","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it, you don't run across a lot of books on Malta so you have to read what you can get.  Jeremy Boissevain wrote a good ethnography on that small Mediterranean island called ""Saints and Fireworks; Religion and Politics in Rural Malta"" back in 1965.  That's the only other book on Malta I know.  This is a kind of short version, covering many of the subjects required by the immensely long Holt, Rinehart & Winston anthropology series.  It contains interesting information in its 100 pages and tries to connect the general patterns with individual lives and behavior.  The obvious problem is that HAL-FARRUG has now become social history.  Malta was changing in the 1960s, but it still had a rural sector, people still worked in agriculture or fishing; there was still a big difference between rural and urban life.  Men belonged to band or football clubs and jealously supported one or another patron saint.  Half a century later, cars, computers, cell phones, entry into the EEC and use of the euro, a much more educated population, and general prosperity have no doubt changed Malta beyond recognition, not to mention the recent flood of immigrants.  Saints and fireworks still loom large in its legend, but I imagine life has changed dramatically.  A lot of the book concerns family, marriage, and class differences, all of which must have been transformed.  So, if you are interested in Malta today, you won't find much here, that's why I've given it only three stars.  However, if you'd like to know what it used to be and read an interesting ethnography of a little-known society, this could be it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XK85VCNBLGXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0030765803#wasThisHelpful","R1XK85VCNBLGXD","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are more than 21 years old and living in America, you can't be unaware that this country once belonged to a number of Indian nations, who were dispossessed of their lands and often massacred or done to death indirectly.  While our school books seldom refer to these events as ""genocide"", it was pretty damnclose, even if there was no overall plan.  It was done anyway.  The native Americans alternately fought or tried to deal with the white interlopers, but were overwhelmed by numbers, technology, and disease.  But they have not disappeared.  Hopefully, at least some of those nations will hang on and eventually come back to pride and sovereignty.  It has been done many times in history.The question is: did they go down like innocents?  Did they never realize what they were up against?  What kind of people were they?  This collection of speeches and statements by Indian leaders and people will put you right.  They knew.  They saw full well that the whites would overwhelm them, they tried to reason with them, sometimes spoke defiantly, they always spoke eloquently.  Since everything is translated from a large number of Indian languages, we don't really know how good the translation was....especially since many of the speeches were 150 or more years ago.  There are a number of great black and white pictures of Indians of many times and places, tragic pictures of massacres too.  If they fought back, well, who wouldn't?The only problem with this book is the following; it's a collection of speeches, one after the other, with common themes.  It is a testament to the feelings of the Indians, their frustration with white double-dealing etc.  It is not a book that you can sit down and read from cover to cover unless you really want the WHOLE thing, because many speeches resemble one another or are mere fragments of longer speeches whose context we don't know.  That's why I have given this book only three stars. It's not a readable book, it is a book of evidence, it is a book you can use for reference.  If you want to know what the Indians felt about dealing with the White Man, here you are.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XB395BY1Q2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804005303#wasThisHelpful","R5XB395BY1Q2K","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ex-boy toy, assassin, bartender, polyglot, and high financier Slava Sergenko (aka Juan Carlos Sebastian and Roberto Maas) lives the high life thanks to a blackmail caper he pulled off back in Russia.  But the victims are on his trail, he has to watch out.  He's got plenty of dough and he likes spending it on rare, ancient treasures.  At the same time, a bookshop owner in an old section of London stumbles upon a crypt in which he finds boxes of old books and a stone sarcophagus.  Mum is the word; he only tells his wife and a crazy grandson who happens to be an expert on classical languages (he can even read Medieval Welsh) and British history.  This dude, Edward by name, does away with his grandparents in order to be sole possessor of the secrets in the crypt, but Slava gets wind of the find.  He (and Edward) believe it to be extremely momentous.  The relics could be linked to the Arthurian legend, even proving that he really existed.  Slava and Edward become rivals, duelling for possession and knowledge of the ""relics of the king"".  Neither of them could be described as a Boy Scout.  What happens?  Well, you'll have to read the book, a fast-paced thriller, with plenty of twists, turns, and surprise events.  We even go back to the late 5th century and meet Queen Guinevere, who turns out to be rather more (or less, according to your point of view) than the standard picture we had.  Warning: this is the first volume of a trilogy, so you might get hooked.I admit---if you check my Amazon reviews, you will not find many thrillers or mysteries there.  A couple books by Robert Parker, a couple by Harry Kemelman, that's about it.  So I may not be the most expert of judges here.  I met the author and volunteered to review the book.  I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to anyone who likes Bondian escapades and international hi-jinks, or who has a secret fascination for archaeology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NLJ08ZNXM5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQP1CQ0#wasThisHelpful","R18NLJ08ZNXM5T","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early 20th century, sentimental postcards were very popular.  They featured fully-dressed women with ample figures, flowers, cherubs, and corny captions like ""Two's company, no one else counts"" or ""You look mighty good to me.""  Any four letter word or nude body would have been unthinkable.  But today you can buy a whole range of cards, from the cutsie to the coarse.  The appearance of scantily-clad women thereupon is no surprise.  What I'm getting at is that the ""surprise"" of one era is the mundane occurrence of another.  Unfortunately, the same is true in literature.  O. Henry captured a huge audience in his day, his stories hit the spot then.  They are full of contemporary references which made the reader feel smart, and full of wisecracks on the life of the day.  Over a century later, perhaps we need footnotes, because a lot of stuff is not comprehensible otherwise.  He also liked to use big words like ""burglarious"" or ""obmutescence"" which no doubt made readers feel as though they were reading Great Literature.  His style, if read in dribs and drabs, is witty and kind.  He constantly identified with the lower classes of society.  His sense of humor is unfailing.  If you sit down to read a volume like this one, however, you will begin to feel a certain cloying, sweetish, 19th century postcard atmosphere in which the inevitable surprise ending is always a positive one, or one which makes you sigh ""ohhh"" as if you had seen a sick puppy (but don't worry, he's gonna get better).  O. Henry had a style, a style much appreciated in his day, and in the USSR for many years afterwards, but I think modern readers want a bit more cynicism, hard edged reality, etc.  But for any one reader, I could be wrong, so give these stories a try.  Some of them are classics which give you a sense of the whole period of American history, of the New York of the day, as well as New Orleans and the West.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GL809E0D3O9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671688618#wasThisHelpful","R3GL809E0D3O9U","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Indians are angry about their condition it's understandable.  What a history!  But anger and hate don't produce good books.  And they don't make for a good life either.  They screw you up for good.  Although you might become famous.  Or notorious.  I like FLIGHT because it's a picture of the path away from these things, towards a deeper, more philosophical understanding.  Not that you have to forget the past.  Oh, no.  But you need a wider acceptance of crazy human nature to survive.  The trajectory from anger---often derived from hate or self-hate---to a calmer vision is traced here in a zany, but ultimately clever way.  People are often many things at the same time.  Indian youths (so we read in other books) used to leave home, go into the wilderness, starve or otherwise suffer out there, till they got a vision which would guide them in adult life. Alexie has written a time-travelling, shape-shifting, modern vision quest in which an abandoned, self-hating youth starts the process of self-knowledge and wider understanding of the world.  It's a brilliant work which will make you laugh, but make you sad and thoughtful at the same time.  It's a product of modern America as emblematic as the Taj Mahal for India, or a bullfight for old Spain.  It's short, but it packs more punch than most long novels.  You won't put it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1RAKKB3DGZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802170374#wasThisHelpful","RV1RAKKB3DGZ2","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was a graduate student, many years ago, I read this ethnography as I prepared to do my own anthropology field work in India.  Wylie's study of a French town impressed me deeply as detailed, well-organized, and excellently-written.  I particularly liked the way he allowed many people to speak and I appreciated the sympathy with which he viewed their lives.  He underlined the variations found within the community, not trying to create a false picture of some generalized French culture.  Unusually for the period, he didn't hide behind ""academic objectivity"" and so put himself in the picture a number of times.  VILLAGE IN THE VAUCLUSE, along with Blythe's ""Akenfield"", Whyte's ""Street Corner Society"", Kozol's ""Death at an Early Age"" and the several works of Oscar Lewis inspired me to try to write ""readable"" anthropology.  I have not been entirely successful measured by these excellent works.  Nevertheless, even though the research for VitV was done in the early 1950s (with a little updating at periods since) and France, like every other part of the world, has changed immeasurably since then (Rousillon, the village concerned, has doubled in population and is now dependent wholly on tourism while it used to be supported by agriculture and ochre mining, though young people already had to leave town to find any other line of work), I strongly recommend this book as 1) an example of how powerful good anthropology can be, 2) a work on the social history of France, and 3) an example or guide to doing field work without cluttering it up with jargon that will fade and die in a few years, leaving your book to shrivel on the deserted beach of academic fads.  VILLAGE IN THE VAUCLUSE is one of the classic works of European anthropology and should be on your reading list if you are interested in that area.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SNPQW45FVR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KVRFEC#wasThisHelpful","R23SNPQW45FVR1","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know the author of this novel but unless I thought it was good, I wouldn't review it.  OK, it might not be Tolstoy or Balzac, the general plot might be simple, but BITTER PASSAGE will move you regardless.  What impressed me the most about the book---an epic tale of migration to the USA from Europe--is the amount of detailed research the author must have done.  While we all learned about pioneers and the gold rush of '49 in school, this tale will fill in those yawning gaps concerning what the covered wagon travellers actually went through.  A family leaves Germany in the 1830s, comes to New York where they have a fairly decent life and an import business.  But the husband gets caught up in Gold Fever, insists on travelling west where he ""is sure to make his fortune"".  The bulk of the book concerns the voyage across the continent, braving storms, floods, hunger, illness, mountains, snow, and fatigue.  We learn the details of what people carried, what they ate, how they managed, and at last, what fortune most of them found.  The title of the novel will clue you in before you start.  Everything in this novel rings true.  There is no glorification, no patriotic nonsense.  Relationships fray, people change, and tragedy looms.  If you are looking for a good story, don't ignore this book.  If you would like a novel which would portray in most realistic fashion the travails of the pioneers and the fantasies of those inflamed by the lust for gold, illuminating an important era of American history on the way, choose this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REL7MGYP5O8QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1463687079#wasThisHelpful","REL7MGYP5O8QB","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in my younger days, when the civil rights movement was at its peak, African-Americans called those of their number who adhered to white rhetoric or white behavior ""oreos"", referring to those innocuous cookies which were dark brown on the outside, but had a white center.  I thought of those long-ago cookies when I'd finished FATHERS AND SONS because despite his radical, nihilistic rhetoric, his insistence that science was everything, the Bazarov character's behavior didn't vary all that much from the older generation's.  Ultimately, I felt, he was a Russian ""oreo""; he talked the radical talk, but inside he was of the same old country gentry.In beautiful language, Turgenev describes the scene in the countryside as a young student returns home to his father's estate, bringing with him a friend who rejects all commonly-held ideas and behavioral norms.  He believes that everything in Russian society must be erased and a fresh start made.  He has profoundly influenced young Arkady, who claims that his friend is the future, a genius, an amazing man.  Arkady's father, a widower, has married again and had a child.  He lives with his brother, a fine-mannered aristocrat of the old school, who takes an instant dislike to Bazarov.  Bazarov and Arkady meet Anna Odintsova and her daughter.  Bazarov has sworn off  'love' as a bourgeois or feudal notion, but he does fall in love nevertheless.  He also winds up fighting a duel with Arkady's uncle despite his detestation of such customs. Arkady too succumbs to the country norms and conforms to the usual patterns of the time. I will not say how the book ends, though I'm sure somebody has already done so in these reviews.  I felt that the ending was unworthy of such a great writer.  The book peters out more or less.  I wouldn't read this book for a great, dramatic, human epic like ""Anna Karenina"" or ""The Brothers Karamazov""..  Rather, it is a great novel because of the skill of the author, which even in translation, shines through wonderfully.  This is one of the great Russian classics.

"When you are the 226th person to review a 180 page book that was a best seller way back when, you have to assume a bit of humility.  You are not going to come up with new insights or new episodes that nobody else mentioned.  This book is definitely cute.  Some of the stories about the life of two efficiency experts who developed time/motion studies for numerous industries in America and Europe in the first years of the 20th century and had twelve kids are still amusing.  You will definitely crack a smile at least.  Some of it seems a bit dated, though, seen from the perspective of 2014.  A lot of the story takes place before and during World War I when America was an entirely different place.  Frank Gilbreth, the hyper-active father, possessed some very original ideas but behaved rather like a genial tyrant, still a tyrant.  I felt throughout that it was much better to read about him than to have him as a father!  I think his ways could have palled really quickly, but the kids put up with it with only occasional resistance.  The two who wrote this book back in 1948 put the best possible light on their family life and infused some trying times with a lot of humor and warmth.  No doubt that's why the book went through so many printings, became a movie, created enough interest for a serious biography of the parents, etc. etc.  It's an easy read and probably once was good for high school classes.  I think today's students look for something a bit deeper with more reflection, but if it's clean humor and a ""Life with Father"" style you want, this is your book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162IRFANIS9SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006008460X#wasThisHelpful","R162IRFANIS9SX","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting study of family patterns and strategies among Japanese business families, Hamabata's bookalternates between two poles.  On one hand you have extremely complex descriptions of family authority structures and how families develop combined with a lot of Japanese terminology.  He takes the theories of a number of writers and tests them out in practice.  On the other hand, there is a lot of very interesting descriptive material which not only elucidates the more complex material, but reveals a lot of the research process and the personal tribulations (and even mistakes) of the American author.  It's a very honest book from which you can learn the difficulties of anthropological research as well as anything about Japanese society.  There are some contrasts in Japanese society which have been written about many times.  Hamabata connects them very skillfully with high-level Japanese business families.  One is the contrast between IE and UCHI, perhaps succinctly explained as between household and home.  In the former, continuity and organization are paramount, obligations (GIRI) are more important than human feelings (NINJ).  In the far more flexible UCHI, it's the reverse.  My explanation is simplified, for the details, read the book.  Hamabata himself writes, ""..the IE looks less like a family and more like a corporate group with a variety of options available to it...""  While admiring the author's work and not wishing to detract from it---I felt that few readers would be able to follow everything that he writes about the IE, the Japanese household or ""family"".  On the contrary, the descriptive material is extremely clearly-written.  The author was lucky, thanks to certain contacts, to be able to penetrate into the private worlds of several Japanese business families.  He socialized more with the wives and talked with the young adult children, rather less with the men at the head of the families because he chose to be ""an immature graduate student"" rather than a serious scholar who should have been married.  Love vs. duty, marriage arrangements, death, authority and a lot about rituals, expectations of life and family behavior are discussed in the various chapters.  While CRESTED KIMONO may not be the last word on Japanese society, and the research was done over 30 years ago, it certainly reveals a lot that is generally closed to outsiders, especially non-Japanese.  If you were compiling a short list of useful books for an introduction to Japanese society, I would still put this one on it, despite my comments above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOGWRBEE118/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801499755#wasThisHelpful","R2DOGWRBEE118","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never been a military man, but I can see the contradiction clearly.  You swear to serve your country, you are bound to serve it, you take pride in your work.  Then the political leaders go down the wrong road, they make a huge mistake.  What should you do?  In most cases, duty wins out over moral inclination or superior knowledge.  Whether we are talking about America's invasion of Iraq, Germany's invasion of the USSR, or Japan's launching of the Pacific War, some officers realized the unlikely chance of victory long before the defeat occurred.  They chose to serve regardless.  They gave their all.  Hoyt, who wrote over 200 books, mostly about military history, and was married to a Japanese woman, couched his biography of Yamamoto Isoroku in such terms.  Yamamoto, because he had studied at Harvard and lived elsewhere in the US, knew America much better than the short-sighted, puffed up militarists who were sure Japan could never be beaten.  He advocated peace, belonged to a faction in the Japanese military that wanted to avoid a war with America and Britain.  He wrote and said often that maybe he could ""run wild"" for up to a year, but then, if Japan had not won by that time, it would definitely lose.  And of course, that is what happened.  Nevertheless he gave it his best shot.  Many rivals in the Japanese military bureaucracy wanted him removed, but after his spectacularly successful attack on Pearl Harbor, he was an untouchable hero.  His efforts in the Solomons and New Guinea foundered because Japan was not able to supply enough ships or planes to counter the Americans.  Yamamoto knew from the start that America's productive capacity would eventually outweigh Japan's.YAMAMOTO tells of his rise, his early life, his long naval career, and his decisions during WW II with special details on the battle of Guadalcanal and the naval campaigns in the Solomons.  His plane was shot down purposely by American fighters on his way to a meeting by direct order from Roosevelt.  It was the only such assassination of a top leader by any side during WW II.  I found certain aspects of military detail unnecessary, but in general this is a well-written book in a very direct style, quite sympathetic to the viewpoint of the ""other side"".  The maps could have been better, we especially needed one showing the movements on and around Guadalcanal. It is very difficult to separate one man's life from the vast panorama of a world war.  I think Hoyt did a good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A06Q7ANK11EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158574428X#wasThisHelpful","R1A06Q7ANK11EB","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, Fosco Maraini wrote a fairly decent book called ""Meeting with Japan"" way back in 1959.  Though he might have been an academic, his main line was adventure.  He liked photography too, and his style was definitely ""romantic"".  So, though he may or may not have been an anthropologist by training, his essays into other cultures are over-infused with his personal tastes.  The reason I am saying this is that the present book has two aims.  The overt aim is to tell about a disappearing culture on remote islands off Japan where women dove for abalone and seaweed,  These women, called ama, wore only a small belt as they plunged into the depths in search of their harvest.  The ethnological description is light, but interesting and well-written.  The second aim was to get as many photographs as possible of the naked women as they went about their work.  For anyone not particularly curious about Japanese village life (in sketchy form), the only point of interest in this book is prurient.  The author shot a number of movies of the nude diving women which are still found on Youtube.  The captions on photographs of naked women can provide a few laughs.....""These goggles are worn underwater.""  ""The bucket of fresh water."" Etc.  While he found a number of villages on various islands where women engaged in diving work, they all wore clothing.  He kept looking until he found the ""right"" one.  OK, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, but I felt that he tried to pretend one interest was another, or if you will, tried to pass off interest in nudity as anthropology.  In any case, if you are looking for some attractive photos (not only of women) then you might like this book, but as Japanese anthropology it leaves a lot to be desired.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3LGGAF7NCK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DSBCE#wasThisHelpful","R3C3LGGAF7NCK0","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pérez-Reverte has an Updike-like ability to describe scenes in detail and to catch idiosyncrasies of personality.  So it's a wonder to me that he can't come up with better plots.  This one, like the later ""The Club Dumas"", is totally far-fetched and fantastic.  OK, maybe that's what his fans are looking for, but I prefer more believable mysteries.  There are plenty of them.  In each of the three books by this writer that I've read, he goes into a particular subject in great depth---fencing, Dumas and old books, and here, chess and old works of art.  It can be interesting, but also tiring in such detail.  The plot of this particular novel  is too complex to describe well  and then, if I reveal too much, people will call me ""spoiler"".  Suffice to say that it involves a 15th century painting, the art world in Madrid, chess, some murders, and a lot of rain.  The author creates interesting characters and potentially interesting topics, but in the end you feel let down.  Too much dwelling on arcane details and not enough punch.

"Can you trace your marriage back to a single moment?  You went to a party and met him/her and wound up spending the rest of your life with them.  Similarly, perhaps certain historical events changed everything later on---the invention of things from the wheel to the computer---or the birth of a certain person, or the death of a certain person who WOULD have changed everything but didn't.  It's too soon to tell for sure, but it seems to me that the Long March of 1934-35---led by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and many others---could have been the most important event of the 20th century, World Wars and the Russian Revolution not excepted.  I say that because it set in motion a chain of events which led to the triumph of the Communist Party in China in 1949, the latter mad excesses of Mao, the return to more rational policies under Deng Xiaoping, and the eventual emergence of China as a superpower and workshop of the world.  The story is certainly not over.  The dominance of Britain and America 1750-2000 (rough figures) may prove to be only a blip in world history in which China was usually the greatest, if seldom an expansionary, power.  In these pages you will find a detailed, nearly blow-by-blow description of how the Long March played out.  The Communists broke out of an encirclement in southern Guangxi province to look for a safer haven to establish their base.  They marched 6,000 miles through a great arc of China, fighting Chiang Kaishek's army, battling or paying off bandits and warlords.  They faced terrible terrain and weather, crossed rivers and gorges under fire.  Internal divisions arose regularly as well.  In 1984, Harrison Salisbury interviewed as many survivors as he could and retraced much of the historic route.  This book tells us what he learned.  He included an excellent map and also an epilogue in which he recorded the subsequent fates of many main figures---most punished, tortured or even killed during Mao's Cultural Revolution.  In addition I can say the style is eminently readable, if unavoidably packed with difficult names, and you may enjoy the descriptions of nature and towns seen by Salisbury in his travels.  THE LONG MARCH will not tell you where China is going, but it will tell you where it has been and reveal to English readers one of the most dramatic episodes of modern world history.  China has come much further since 1984 on its historic long march to transformation.

"They say there's an old, red continent down below those tropic isles where white rice is a constant.  Once upon a time it was inhabited by squatters, drovers, swagmen, bushrangers, tank builders, boundary riders, and a host of other characters.  Together, their lives formed a pattern that was later woven into the Great Australian Legend---the legend of the bush and mateship.  If you ever wanted to read the details of such, to know something of that outback life beyond the towns on the coast where most Australians lived then and now, this is your book.  Full of dry, Aussie humor and endless Victorian-style philosophizing in most circuitous language, SUCH IS LIFE contains a number of episodes said to have occurred to the author in 1883 in the area just north of the Murray River (Australia's longest), the country known as the ""Riverina"".  Numerous classical allusions may leave modern readers (like me) scratching their heads and as the author loves to write in dialect, the various English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, Chinese, and Aboriginal accents can grow perplexing as well as tiring.  Nevertheless, SUCH IS LIFE presents a fresh, never-stale look at conditions in society in a land that has changed so much in the 130 years since.  Just as gold was often found in nuggets down in the Victorian towns of Ballarat and Bendigo, so you will find many gold nuggets of humor and pleasure throughout this book.  ""Cleopatra"" is the name of a male horse that always tried to buck the author off, but would quiet down after failing.  Similarly, the book might ""buck you off"" at first, but I recommend that you persist.  You'll be glad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BMJVR0R9SB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1922147214#wasThisHelpful","R33BMJVR0R9SB2","A1TIZI060W4BD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TIZI060W4BD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had them all. R/C Cars, Trucks, Slot Cars, etc. This is a really neat racing set except for one problem for me. If you go off the track (and you will), you cannot steer it back onto the track unless you push down and hold the R/C Button. That means that instead of just steering back onto the track, you have to look at the controller and press and hold the R/C button. That means you have lost the race because by time you realize what has happened and push and hold the R/C button and steer the car back onto the track, your opponent is long gone and you are way off the track. It is also extremely annoying to have to do this. The natural tendency is to try and steer the car but it is in RI mode and will not respond correctly since it is looking for edge of the track and cannot find it so the steering just seems random at that point.The only real option is to race in R/C mode but that defeats the purpose of this AI doesn't it?I've read quite a few of the other reviews and I must be missing something. If you don't push it then you won't go off the track but what is the point in just motoring around the track? Has nobody seen a race car go off the track and the driver maintain control and come back on the track without losing a position? I wonder if any of the other reviewers have actually done that with a real race car, I have and you should be able to do that with this racing game.I can think of a number of ways to solve the problem and expect that future versions will offer some additional options to turn individual things on/off and maybe add extras like guard rails (for those that are too aggressive).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJYPM87QLXNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NJYPM87QLXNZ","A2X06FP2PQ6EK0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X06FP2PQ6EK0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These razors do a fair job and are a decent value. However, it you want a really close shave then not going to happen with these razors. The results are mediocre compared to Gilette Fusion. I shaved with one of these and it didn't feel as easy as with the Fusion, this razor actually felt dull on the way it pulled on the stubble. I went over my face twice with the BIC to give it a fair chance then I shaved again with the Fusion and you could feel the left over stubble being shaved by the Fusion so not that close a shave. These BIC do not fit well in the hand compared to other similar razors. These BIC razors are a lot cheaper than Fusion razors so they are a good value for what you get and I would rate them 4 stars on value but 2 stars on performance.

"Every year for several years now, I’ve traveled down to Blacklin County, Texas, to help out with a murder investigation. Seems like somebody’s always ending up dead in little towns around the county and it takes a heap of investigating to set things back to rights.Those little Texas towns are a lot like the ones where I grew up in Oklahoma. Same people, same diners, same economies, same problems. Now I like sophisticated murder cases too, and I like them spread out over the last couple hundred years all over the country, and all over the rest of the world as well.But there’s something about these hometown murders that I relish. Maybe it’s the familiarity with the countryside, how everything is laid out on the page just the way I know things really are. Folks in small towns can be small-minded, yet still hooked into the technological marvels we have today, but they still worry about feral hogs and haunted houses.I think one of the best parts of these Blacklin County murders is my good friend Sheriff Dan Rhodes. We’ve been riding the trail together for a few years now and I know how he thinks. Rhodes has changed a little over the years, got himself hitched and added to his critter collection, but he’s more or less the same guy I got to know in Shotgun Saturday Night (I started out a murder behind, but I caught up).This year, Rhodes had another murder. A dead outlaw turned up in what is believed to be a haunted house, and Rhodes had to figure out who done for the man and what was going on. As usual, a simple murder in Blacklin County gets complicated because lots of other folks are protecting themselves, others, and their secrets.In the middle of that investigation, there was a bull riding event, a brand spanking new paranormal investigation team (that I hope to hear more about), and a feral hog stampede that puts one man in the hospital and has the sheriff up a tree.These are the way Rhodes’s cases go. Along the way, he’s aided and abetted by his usual crew (although he’d point out that none of them are as helpful as maybe they should be). Gradually, Rhodes works things out, and there are plenty of twists and turns you won’t see coming. In my opinion, Blacklin County has got to be one of the most interesting places in Texas. Or anywhere, for that matter.If you haven’t been along for a murder in Blacklin County, come on down. And if you have, welcome back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3USYVTNZ37IQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250039703#wasThisHelpful","R3USYVTNZ37IQR","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try to keep up with everything being published, but it’s gotten harder with all the ebook publications that have sprung up. One of the series I missed when it first debuted is Craig Schaefer’s Dan Faust fantasy series, but I’m catching up.Dan Faust is an interesting character, a real-live mage who sometimes does street magic to pay the bills in Las Vegas. We meet him in the first book, The Long Way Down, which actually sounds like it could be the title of a Raymond Chandler novel. Chandler’s iconic private eye, Philip Marlowe, was one of Schaefer’s inspirations for his Faust character. Faust is just coming out of a broken relationship, too many booze-filled nights, and a slowdown in business.Faust’s major occupation is revenge for hire. If a client can prove the person they want revenge on deserves getting Faust’s brand of justice, and they can meet the price, Faust can deliver on revenge that’s merely a financial crisis, a loss of public image, or even death.I had a really good time with this book. Schaefer’s prose is easy to read, the plot is twisty but not overly complicated, and he brings in the backstory of the character and the world of magic pretty well. The reveals on Faust’s history and how he’d come to be where he is read well and are interesting.Overall, the book has a definite Raymond Chandler vibe to it. There are bad guys doing nefarious stuff and it ties back to some of Vegas’s history, some to the main character’s history, and some that develops organically. The pacing is good and kept me flipping the pages throughout, wanting to know what was going to happen next even though most readers can put it together easily enough.I like Faust’s “family” but they’re not as strongly developed in this novel as I would have liked. However, this is the first book of a series, so there’s time to get to all of that. They’re definitely an interesting mix.The love interest in the book threw me off a little. The attraction seemed to come out of nowhere (at least to me) on both their parts. The decision to get together (even though there is a TON of reasons not to do it) felt more an author’s decision than an organic thing that developed. There was plenty of reason for them to work together without the romance so the relationship side of things could be developed at a slower pace. Even the acceptance by Faust’s family would have had more time to come into its own and not feel as contrived.Overall, I had a good time with the book and have picked up the next one to read as well. Since the book is self-pubbed, I have to wonder why New York would have passed on this one. It will definitely appeal to the same audience who reads Jim Butcher and Patricia Briggs.The formatting and grammar in the book are as impeccable as that beautiful cover. So if you’ve become wary of self-pubbed books due to editing mistakes, rest assured this one is very well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN8V42015UMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990339319#wasThisHelpful","RNN8V42015UMI","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caitlin Kittredge’s graphic novel Coffin Hill Volume 1: Forest of the Night reads like a movie. As I turned the pages and absorbed the story and images, the film unspooled in my head. There was even a soundtrack—I don’t remember what it was, but it was definitely something with one of those beats that keeps raising the anxiety level on part of the reader.The story is very familiar in so many ways. I watched a lot of good movies growing up, and a lot of B movies too (not really different in my mind, but I know some people really like to keep those two camps separate). Forest of the Night reads like a mashup of a B cop movie, B horror movie, and something John Hughes would have done. Although the territory is familiar, Kittredge manages to stake her claim on her own territory and turn it into something different and intriguing.Inaki Mirada’s art drenches the pages in darkness and ups the fear factor of the story. The work is unique, and he’s just as versatile in delineating worlds as Kittredge is.I enjoy Eve Coffin’s character and am sympathetic to everything she’s gone through, as a police officer and as a young person growing up in the shadow of Coffin Hill. The two storylines—past and present—crash together in the final pages of this graphic novel like two trains headed for the same switch point at the same time.There’s a lot of angsty memories and relationships spread out through the pages, and lots of twists and turns as well. Somehow Kittredge transitions between cop work and witch lore easily, making both worlds jagged and edgy, too interwoven to take apart.Coffin Hill hides a big mystery, but there are a lot of little (but highly lethal!) puzzles along the way. Eve is an emotionally damaged character who is easy to sympathize with, and she’s driven to get to the core of the mysteries now that she’s been drawn back.Kittredge has created a great ensemble of characters here to play with, filled a town with people, and in all likelihood is going to expand on both. I’ve enjoyed my first tour through the town and its history, and I’m looking forward to more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCJ9KNBN2LDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140124887X#wasThisHelpful","R1VCJ9KNBN2LDJ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until I read Something Wicked, I’d never heard of Kerry Wilkinson. Then, amazed at how good the book was and wondering why I’d never heard of him, I did some research. It turns out that Wilkinson’s personal successes in the writing field are just as exciting and surprising as the novel.Wilkinson self-published his first DI Jessica Daniels book in 2011, which became a bestseller in England almost overnight. He followed that up with eight more Daniels books, two stand-alone crime novels, a YA fantasy trilogy, and Something Wicked, the first book in the Andrew Hunter series.All while serving as a journalist and a magistrate. Four years…fifteen novels. Wilkinson is talented and prolific. Doubtless his two other jobs aid and abet his creative output, but he’s accomplished some amazing work in a short time.Andrew Hunter was first featured in a DI Jessica Daniels novel, Playing With Fire. Wilkinson liked the character and decided to do more with him. Readers don’t have to read that book to enjoy this one (I didn’t, but I have gone back and queued up the other books to read in order).Wilkinson’s writing is smooth and easy to grasp, and it’s in a conversational tone that makes the pages so easy to turn. Add to that, the author’s natural sense of pacing and love of riddles and mysteries kept me nailed to the pages. I read the book in two sittings, and only because I started the book late, intending to only read a few chapters. The spirit was willing but the flesh was weak. I finished it up the next morning.Andrew Hunter is in his mid-thirties, a guy who’s been knocked around a bit by life and still has some deep-seated guilt (part of the mystery and confusion I love about the character). He’s partnered with a younger woman named Jenny who’s every bit as clever and interesting as he is (and I won’t reveal any more because those are Wilkinson’s surprises to spring.)At first I thought the mystery was pretty simple and straight-forward. Just a simple case of a missing person and backtracking the trail till answers were found. I was totally happy with that. Then things took a turn I didn’t see coming, and I’m betting most readers won’t either, although the foundation is laid in the novel.Knowing this is the first book of a series means the character gets out alive at the end, but there are a lot of personal mysteries revealed, some status quo changes, and a huge cliffhanger at the end (nothing to do with the mystery in this book because that is solved) that has me on tenterhooks for the next book to see how things proceed.As I read the novel, I couldn’t help thinking how this character, his partner, and their world could easily translate into a television series for the BBC. I’d watch it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RD9FF0TA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1447262093#wasThisHelpful","R1RD9FF0TA6","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will Murray has taken up the reins of the Doc Savage series quite well with his “Wild Adventures.” He’s given Doc fans new adventures with a definite nostalgia spin, and he’s twisted Doc’s life into new horizons (that still make sense). The pairing of Doc and King Kong was very well done and I enjoyed it.When I heard about the Doc Savage/Shadow crossover coming up, I was hopeful and excited. The pairing of the two biggest heroes of the age of pulps was something that I would have figured would have already been done. After all, the same company owned both characters. There was no reason not to do it.Maybe the editors saw The Shadow as more of a gritty crime story venue and Doc Savage as more of a fantastic elements kind of guy. But I’ve read volumes of both series and I feel like there were a lot of similarities. There’s no doubt in my mind that the heroes were playing to the same audience.Murray’s epic story of the two heroes meeting is truly that: epic. When I first got the book, I figured the story would veer more toward the Doc side of the story, or that the distinction between the two heroes would be more muted.Instead, Murray blends both heroes equally, and plays them (and their aides) off of each other in interesting and exciting ways. There’s even a tonal shift between the Doc section of the book and that focusing on the Shadow. It’s like the story was written by two different authors, not the same guy, which is quite a feat to pull off.Since I read the ebook version, I hadn’t really taken into consideration how long the novel was. I’d figured it was Doc-size, probably between 250-300 pages, the length Murray’s been writing them at lately—some of those like Skull Island and The Ice Genius. (The original Docs and Shadows were shorter, and got even more short as both series progressed.)The Sinister Shadow clocks in at 500 pages and each one of those is filled with twists and turns, mysteries and machinations, and danger galore. Packed into those pages, Murray also leavens generous dollops of Doc and Shadow lore. Readers new to both series can feel free to dive right into this book and thoroughly understand both worlds.In addition to all the lore and the exciting read, Murray also adds his own conjectures about the characters, their worlds, and the people who play in them. I was surprised and ecstatic to see one such revelation about a second-tier character(s) that makes perfect sense even if Walter B. Gibson (the Shadow’s primary raconteur) hadn’t thought of it.So for you longtime fans of both series, here’s a love song just for you. And for you new to the heroes and haven’t ever gotten brave enough to dive in, here’s the perfect jumping-on point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30K3VQHJMO1PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111BR6EE#wasThisHelpful","R30K3VQHJMO1PN","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of memories of the late 1960s and 1970s, and most of those memories are tied to books I read in those years.  I discovered Tarzan of the Apes, Doc Savage, the Shadow, and others.  Those books became the building blocks of my own writing career.  I learned a lot about plot and characterization.Back then I was a sucker for the tough guy hero.  In many ways, I still am.  Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe and Robert B Parker’s Spenser were my hard boiled heroes.  But I read Mack Bolan and the Destroyer as well as many other series in the plethora that Pinnacle Books put out in those years.I discovered Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) and his anti-hero thief Parker and loved those books.  It wasn’t long before I discovered a writer named Max Allan Collins.  Al, as he is known to his friends, created two of my favorite hardboiled anti-heroes: a professional thief named Nolan, and a professional hit man named Quarry.In the early books (publication wise, and that will be explained as we go along), Quarry is a truly hard guy, someone who was amoral on the surface, but a guy who had his own rules.  He also has a wicked sense of humor, which definitely appealed to the younger me.For a time, Quarry went away and Al went on to write a great many other books.  Or many other great books.  Those statements are interchangeable.  A couple more Quarry books came out a few years later, but it wasn’t until Hard Case Crime came into being that Al’s hit man anti-hero down renewed life—at the expense of other, unsavory people.  Now getting a new Quarry is almost a yearly event, and I’m happy about it.And this “renewed” series, Quarry’s life is open for revelation.  So far we have seen Quarry’s last hit, his first professional hit, met his ex-wife whose betrayal started our anti-hero down this path, and adventures in between.The latest book is more of the same that longtime readers have seen, but it’s got an interesting twist as well.  There are a lot of shenanigans and double-crosses and the Dixie mafia to deal with.  Quarry is up to his eyebrows in sudden death, a sex kitten, and southern fried lethal intentions.Quarry’s trademark humor is in play as well as his deadly skill set.  But the thing I enjoy the most these days is the way the Al makes those days come alive.  Throughout the narrative, music is mentioned and becomes a soundtrack to the story.  During different scenes, those songs played through my head.  I was at once in my chair reading, and transported back to the 1970s, not only in Quarry’s story, but also bumping up against my own memories.Quarry’s Choice is a compact book that rolls right along, filled with danger and surprises.  I enjoyed seeing Quarry in his element in watching the relationship develop with the Broker.  I hope Al eventually digs more deeply into the Broker and, eventually, the Broker’s wife.  There are still a lot of good stories to tell, and I’m looking forward to them.Now, if only there could be a new Nolan novel…","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MYTVCIQX1L2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRHV2E8#wasThisHelpful","R2MYTVCIQX1L2T","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ian Douglas has been pumping out military science fiction under this pseudonym and others as well as his own for years.  So he’s quite good at it.  Earth Strike is the first in the Star Carrier series, which is now up to book five in releases while the author is busy working on book six.Douglas starts up a lot of things in this novel.  There’s a disconnect between Earth and the colony worlds (I’m willing to bet I know how that’s gonna work out really soon), a green space pilot who has strange ties to a segment of people who are deemed unworthy by the rich and influential on Earth, yet refuse to climb onto the government dole, an admiral who becomes a war hero who would have been thrown under the bus if the conflict had gone any other way (no surprise there), and various other infighting that takes place.I really enjoyed Douglas’s approach to the science he’s espousing in this book.  Space fighters that can change shape depending on the environment and necessity is really cool.  Likewise, space travel becomes a real component of battle engagement when it leaves a unit separated for hours.The various plotlines spin out from a dramatic opening as the Earth’s space navy goes into a full-blown battle for the future of an Islamic colony that has split off from Earth.  The politics are interesting, to a degree, but serve mostly to fragment Earth into splinter groups.  It works, but I’m still not quite convinced what the furor is about.  Doubtless, further books will deal with that because the political differences haven’t gone away.Douglas knows how to write military SF and has anchored a fantastic and action-packed new series with this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JAU7ZA18S3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037B6QX4#wasThisHelpful","R22JAU7ZA18S3V","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allen Zadoff has dug into the YA suspense/spy market that has gone largely untouched.  Since Anthony Horowitz stopped writing the Alex Rider novels (why, Anthony????), there exists a vacuum in this area that needs filling.Zadoff comes close with his Boy Nobody series, now called the Unknown Assassin series.  This first book is a zinger loaded with surprising twists and turns that seem familiar, but instantly charge off in unexpected directions.  I like the first-person narrative because I was instantly involved with the character.  Zadoff doesn’t let up after an engaging opening:  an assassination by our main character.When I first encountered Boy Nobody in the opening pages going about his assignment, I didn’t care for him, but the jet-propelled pacing carried me further into the book before I knew it, and Zadoff quickly hooked me with the horns of Boy Nobody’s dilemma:  carry out his assignment and killed the girl he’s falling for pretty hard, or go rogue and potentially end up getting killed for being weak.The aspect of the book that aggravated me the most is that we don’t really get to know much about Boy Nobody.  He’s a cipher.  Although a few hints are revealed as we go along, I’m torn between being satisfied with that and hoping the series broadens the character’s past as it charges forward, or wanting to know about him.  I’m hoping there are more reveals in the second book, which is already out now.The romance triangle feels overdone, but Zadoff makes it fresh again with the way he handles his story.  In fact, the whole novel smacks of a Mission: Impossible/Rogue Agent kind of thing, but this is the kind of story I’ll always be a sucker for.The subject matter (assassination, murder, death, terrorism) is mature for young readers, but grade 6 and up can easily slip into this world for vicarious thrill and chills with nothing offensive on the pages.  Think of this as a more grown-up Alex Rider with a lot more intensity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2158HYVEN3WLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZVUIPW#wasThisHelpful","R2158HYVEN3WLQ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Moorcock originally wrote the first Michael Kane book under the name Edward P. Bradbury.  I read the DAW version of the book back in the 1970s, I think, and the book carried both titles City of the Beast or Warriors of Mars.I enjoyed the book a lot when I was a kid because it reminded me so much of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s John Carter and Carson Napier novels, which I had only recently discovered because Ace had a robust program to republish all those old books.Michael Kane is a swordsman (happened upon a French master bladesman who trained him) and a physicist (which I actually expected to see more of as the book progressed—I didn’t).  The book was initially released in 1965, so we knew more about Mars than Burroughs did back in 1912 when A Princess of Mars was first released.  Moorcock sidesteps this by having the matter transmitter throw his hero back in time as well as to Mars.All the major pieces are there:  a princess who Kane can’t quite connect with, a threatening barbarian horde (blue instead of green Tharks), swordplay, fliers, and alien science.  Oh yeah, and lots and lots of captures and escapes and fighting.I hate to admit it, but I’m no longer my innocent younger self (though I can get back to that quite comfortably, thank you).  Moorcock is a better writer than Burroughs, and the this book was action-packed and easier to read, but there’s something about John Carter that just makes him stand out.  Maybe it was because Burroughs’s Mars was more fleshed out in some ways, and the people were a lot more diverse.Still, I breezed through City of the Beast/Warriors of Mars in a few hours and enjoyed the experience.  Supposedly, Moorcock was asked to write an homage to Burroughs and that’s how these books came about.  At the time, though, Lancer was selling Conan books by the truckload and there were Edgar Rice Burroughs books on every spinner rack of every drug store and supermarket I saw.  I’m guessing that had a lot to do with it.You won’t find anything really new here, but the book is a great romp and timeless in its ideas of heroes and villains and fantasy.  The sword-and-planet novels remain as comfort food for me as a reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZM0OSHLMBJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601251041#wasThisHelpful","R2LZM0OSHLMBJ8","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a fan of Christian Slater’s television show, The Forgotten.  It only lasted one season, seventeen episodes, actually, but my wife and I were drawn into the emotional cases and the cast of characters that were so deeply affected by the unidentified bodies.At the time, I didn’t know that Todd Matthews, the Director of Communications & Case Management for NamUs, the man who solved the “Tent Girl’s” identity after decades, was a consultant for the show.  I knew the show was supposed to be based on real work by civilian investigators, but the background of those agencies and civilians was pretty murky.Still, the idea lingered…Just last week I found Deborah Halber’s excellent book on the whole civilian investigation movement that formed the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs).  The Skeleton Crew: How Amateur Sleuths Are Solving America’s Coldest Cases is a fantastic read, though it will be a somewhat difficult read for readers and interested parties who want a simple chapter-by-chapter, case-by-case format.Halber’s book is intensely enjoyable from the layman’s perspective, and for anyone who wants a BIGGER PICTURE story of what was going on with these people.  Halber opens the book with the discovery of a body (or a part of a body), which is where most of these cases start (though sometimes there’s a disappearance they also work on).  Just as I was deeply intrigued by “Tank Girl,” Halber drops into stories that feature other cases and other investigators.The really unique aspect of the book that I loved was that, like in every good mystery, all the threads of the story wrap up at the end of the book.  Many nonfiction readers might not like the way the book is laid out with the jumping perspective and caseload, but once I saw what was going on, I stayed with it and read it in two sittings.The portrayals of some of the major players among the civilian investigators and the infighting is illuminating and captivating.  Halber reveals them to be mostly isolated, driven people who end up straining family relationships.  In other words, these civilians are the same kind of dedicated investigator traditionally hired for police and investigative agencies around the world.The book is written so compellingly, I couldn’t put it down, so be warned and realize that you may want to carve out some serious time for this one.  I learned a lot of things from the book and I plan on revisiting it in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36GWO0NBV6436/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEECHKC#wasThisHelpful","R36GWO0NBV6436","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wide Spot in the Road was the first Jack Laramie Drifter Detective novella I’ve read in the series.  The premise is interesting, kind of a Jim Rockford (only a little tougher in the clinches) who lives in the back of his horse trailer and roves Texas looking for work.Jack Laramie is the grandson of Cash Laramie, Edward A. Grainger’s United States marshal in the old West.  Grainger is actually David Cranmer, who has been building up a pulp publishing arm with characters he’s created and co-created.Wayne Dundee is an old hand at storytelling, and he demonstrates his chops in this little gem that only covers a few hours in real time but changes several lives along the way.  He takes the old saw of a hero stopping in at a diner and ending up caught in a bad situation and makes a great little story out of it.The players are people you’ve seen before, so the various twists and turns taken in the tale aren’t anything really new, but Dundee delivers the people we love to cheer for, and puts them in the fight of their lives that we know they’ll ultimately be capable of winning.I don’t know if Dundee has plans to do another Drifter Detective, but I’d look forward to a second helping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOI5LX2XMAAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAMO86K#wasThisHelpful","R3AOI5LX2XMAAQ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My container for her snacks fits through the ends, so does her pacifier, sippy cup, etc.  I do end up opening it for the wipes though.

They are very easy to use.  I am also glad it was easy to clean.There were two things I had a little trouble with.  One was the size of the digital read out.  Small print is hard for me to read.  And these are small numbers.  The other was that when the temperature got close to the temperature it started go really, really slow.  It took about five minutes before it stopped moving.  Once it got about ten to fifteen degrees from the temperature it started moving two tenths of a degree at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7K7BSVNXB7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LO3N5MW#wasThisHelpful","R3A7K7BSVNXB7Y","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was much younger, I picked up the four books in Richard Avery’s Expendables series (which he glommed onto before Sylvester Stallone and his crew of action heroes nabbed lately).  Mostly I was drawn to them by the SF covers, the action, and the women (on some of the covers).As a young reader, I wasn’t entirely blown away by the writing style.  It was, and remains, very workmanlike.  The story and characters get the job done just fine, but the possibilities presented in the books were what really caught me up in them.Basically Commander James Conrad and his team are planet-busters.  They get shipped to planets to scout out resources, potential predators, and other pros and cons of establishing settlements and colonies for an Earth that is bursting at the seams with rampant population.  Population problems are more of an issue now than they were back in the 1970s when the books first came out, but even back then everyone could see the writing on the wall.The first book in the series is slow out of the gate.  I remember that being a problem when I initially read it all those years ago, and why I didn’t pick up that second book (even used at the five and dime!) for weeks.  But my mind kept wondering what world James Conrad and his people would get sent to next, and what challenges they would find awaiting them.So I read through all four books and wished there were more.  There weren’t.  I still have the copies packed away—somewhere in the labyrinth of boxes of books I have—but I’m really glad they ended up getting reprinted as ebooks.I read through the first one in a single sitting because I was caught between the story and remembering what I was like when I first read the book, which is always a delight for a dedicated, longtime reader.  Books become touchstones.I’m not sure why this series made that cut.  I think it had to do with the original art and the whole idea of getting shipped out to hostile planets and having to survive.  That’s what’s bringing me back to the series again, but it will probably be a while before I read the next one.  Just like last time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1091PSEAWRUOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVFQMGO#wasThisHelpful","R1091PSEAWRUOY","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately, before the release of the new Tempe Brennan novel, author Kathy Reichs blows through a novella about her signature character that takes Tempe and the reader to a new place and usually a new corner of forensics.  In this one, Tempe is on vacation (doesn’t last long because a body turns up—well, pieces of a body—in the stomach of a stomach) and is dropping in on another specialist friend.I didn’t know the true difference of necropsy and autopsy until this book, and it was fascinating to see all the science behind doing animal forensics.  Reichs throws in a lot of other science and detail, too, that made me want to go rooting around in science manuals to find out more about the topics, which is what any good instructor will do.Reichs’ writing is always great, easy to lose yourself in, and I really think she might be at her best with some of the shorter work she’s doing.  I don’t know what her writing time is like, but I know she has to stay busy keeping up with all the cutting-edge science in her field, the Bones television show that keeps on coming out year after year, and writing fiction.  Lately the novellas have seemed a little crisper than the novels, a little more on target, but they lack the twists and turns Reichs likes to throw into her longer works.  These novellas take place in a matter of days (so Tempe can do some work and get a few days off), and that definitely affects the reading experience.I blazed through this one in a single sitting, even though it seems longer than her last novella.  Although I haven’t ever been to Miami (other than Disney and a couple hotels), I’ve researched the area frequently.  While I was turning the pages, I felt like I was cruising down the back roads and the Everglades with Tempe.There were enough twists and turns to keep a mystery reader guessing, enough forensics to keep the armchair crime scene investigator locked in, and sporadic fun along with plenty of action.  This novella is definitely one for fans of the series and people who are interested in reading the books to jump on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XND8CI9AWIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRIUA9U#wasThisHelpful","R24XND8CI9AWIL","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People who are coming through the doors of Castle Perilous for the first time are in for a treat.  I first entered the castle almost 30 years ago, though it does not seem so long ago.  I recently re-read the book on an e-reader and was surprised at how much of the story and characters I remembered, and how much I had even on a re-read.There are eight books in the Castle Perilous series, and I’m truly surprised that John DeChancie didn’t continue writing them.  I know there are a lot of fans out there, and with 144,000 doors in the castle and dozens of Guests (with a capital G), there are a ton of stories surely waiting to be told.In this first book, there’s a loose plot that’s kind of filled in along the way by a dozen or so major characters, many different settings, and a sense of wonder that never goes away.  I love all the characters, though it’s really weird reading about Gene and Linda now that I’m older than them instead or more like a peer.  But Snowclaw is Snowclaw and just a lot of fun.The story is light and frothy, as are the characters, but the jokes are plenty, the twists and turns are at times surprising and at others predictable (if you’re a savvy reader, you’re rewarded).  This isn’t a book, or a series, that will introduce a well-read reader to anything new, but it is playful and fun and surprising.Turning through the pages, I couldn’t help but feel I was in a dungeon crawl in a D&D game from back in my college days, and that’s not a bad feeling at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3909J6PLL4Y0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0759231982#wasThisHelpful","R3909J6PLL4Y0X","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I dug into The Boundless, I was immediately reminded of another book I'd read by Kenneth Oppel:  Airborn.  Both of the books feature young protagonists in worlds that are slightly a-kilter from our own.  In the latter book, the world spun around large airships.  In The Boundless, the world revolves around a five-mile long train, which the book is named after.The opening chapter reminded me of a Jack London story, but maybe that was because of the character's harsh circumstances.  Young Will is the son of a man who is helping build Canada's Transcontinental Railroad (with a story similar to the one in the United States) and seldom sees his father because he's always gone.I liked Will immediately because he's an outcast and alone, struggling in a hardscrabble life but not jaded or jaundiced by it.  And he's got a skill that comes in handy throughout the novel:  art.Like a pulling engine on a train, the novel starts off kind of slow, then steadily gains steam.  The action up in the mountains that results in a sasquatch attack (yes, they exist in this world!) and an avalanche is a set piece, in my opinion, but it sets up events that need to exist for the rest of the story to play out.Then the book skips three years and plunges into Will's new life.  Things have gotten better for him in some respects, but now he finds himself at loggerheads with the father he so revered.  The age-old struggle between fathers and sons plays out as one of the subplots, but that's not where the action is focused.Like the airships in Airborn, I love the feel of the world presented in The Boundless.  The idea of a five-mile long train made up of hundreds of cars with thousands of people riding in them just boggles my mind, but Oppel makes it all come to vibrant life.  Some details seem to get lost in the mix, though.  I wasn't sure where the colonists were going, or why exactly.The circus background is really nice too and gave the train an extra exotic air that young readers will relish.  The acts were interesting, but I wanted more background on the circus and the people.  At that point of the story, though, The Boundless has gotten up a full head of steam and is plowing through the adventure while winding through snow-covered mountains.  Embellishing those backgrounds would have broken the pacing, but it goes to show how real the author is able to make his characters and situations.Young readers are going to have a blast plunging into Oppel's and Will's new world, and even seasoned armchair adventurers are going to get new facets to think about.  The Ponce de Leon and ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" mythologies are nice additions and twisted in ways I hadn't ever before considered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCP5S5FBJKJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DA9MH8G#wasThisHelpful","R1TCP5S5FBJKJQ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"World War II soldiers fighting dinosaurs in a land that time forgot began in Star Spangled War Stories in 1960, and the idea has never seemed to go away.  The “forgotten” war has shown up time and again in the DC universe, and even showed up in the New 52 in the short-lived GI Combat magazine.I was really looking forward to this one, especially after seeing how Darwyn Cooke played with it in his limited series, The New Frontier.  I thought I’d be getting something special.Instead, I got a story that had absolutely brilliant art, but was only half-baked.  The adventure through the prehistoric jungle actually got tedious even with the action-oriented plot and the threat of death on every page.  Then … it just stops.  I don’t know if the series got cancelled before the story could be resolved, or it this kind of ending was planned from the beginning.  I wish I had known I was going to be left hanging.The War That Time Forgot segment only takes up about a third to one half of the book.  The remainder is devoted to an updated take on the Unknown Soldier that wasn’t much better than the preceding story.  The story was dark and kind of punchy, and even tried to lift the mythos of the unknown soldier into the realm of the supernatural, but I wasn’t really that interested.The original run of the Unknown Soldier offered a lot more character, a lot more tension.  Basically, just a lot more story and adventure in general.  After having that, and even experiencing the newly updated Unknown Soldier that came before this one, I wasn’t given anything really new or rewarding.The Haunted Tank strip that ran for so long in the original incarnation of GI Combat was awesome, one of those series that I even now look back on with fondness.  DC even tried to unleash a new “haunted” tank on the DC universe a few years back that was interesting but in no way came close to the original.This haunted tank is a bit TOO supernatural for my tastes, and the story was too lightweight.All in all, I’m glad I bought this graphic novel because it allowed me to travel down some good comics memories, but I didn’t really make any new good ones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208YA5HEE5V13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2F92J6#wasThisHelpful","R208YA5HEE5V13","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the new 52 debuted with Animal Man on the list, I was pumped.  I’ve always liked that character, even back when he was just a back-up feature, a lightweight hero with kind of ridiculous powers.  Buddy Baker was just a guy’s guy who ended up putting on a costume and battling bad guys.I liked that.The first two volumes of the new Animal Man by Jeff Lemire were pretty solid, too.  They were both full of wild stuff I DID NOT see coming.  Lemire took his readers down a rabbit hole and exposed them to a whole new world in the Red.  I went willingly, gawking at everything he put on display.Then volume 3 happened and I wasn’t so happy.  *SPOILER ALERT*I was really upset that Cliff died.  The plot just didn’t make sense to me.  The Rotworld sequence ran long, got too spread out in some ways, too many guest stars, and then – when I was way exhausted from making my way through everything – Cliff gets killed.  It was like a kick to the groin.I honestly wasn’t looking forward to volume four that much.  Even if Lemire found a way to do a reset on Cliff’s death, the way he did for Buddy’s daughter Maxine, I wasn’t too interested.  Then the loss would have been an artificial emotional cudgel.So I approached this volume with trepidation.  As expected, the graphic novel centers on Cliff’s loss and how it has destroyed Buddy’s marriage.  In fact, I felt like the story actually WALLOWED in the event way too much.  The cult people Buddy goes up against actually offer a distraction from all of the darkness.Although the preceding volumes have all been graphic in nature, this one seems to raise the bar.  Or maybe I’m only sensitive to it in light of the other material being covered.  I liked the early adventure of Animal Man against the spider queen, and it was nice seeing Maxine so sure her brother is not truly dead, but it looks like that quest to return him to life isn’t gonna pan out, and if it did, the dead in the first place would simply be cheap theater.Volume 5 is going to be the last of the series, and I’ll pick it up to round out the series, but I’m not looking forward to the darkness I think is going to continue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DV95UUJZMD4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4EW0XU#wasThisHelpful","R2DV95UUJZMD4W","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edmond Hamilton was a pulp writer from the 1930s.  He wrote most of the Captain Future pulps and earned the sobriquet, World Wrecker, because of the planet destroying plots he embraced.In later years, he moved into comic books and wrote several of the early issues of Superman and Batman, as well as helping give the world the Legion of Superheroes, which has long been a fan favorite.I picked up one of his Starwolf novels back when I was a kid.  I think I read it, but I couldn’t really remember it.  The name of the main character, Morgan Chane, stuck in my head for at least forty years.Still, occasionally at Half Price Books and other places, I run across some old paperbacks I haven’t read.  My original is probably packed away in a storage shed I’ve had for years.After reading through the first Starwolf book, The Weapon from Beyond, I totally understand why I can’t remember reading it – if I indeed did.  The plot has a great hook at the start, and I do remember that, but the rest of it goes downhill pretty fast.Morgan Chane escapes from a blood vendetta put on him by the rest of the Starwolves over killing a friend of his.  This fellow Starwolf was one of Chane’s best friends, so that’s a story I really wish we’d gotten here.  We don’t, but I have hope that the next two books will pick up that plot thread, especially since the last book in the trilogy is called World of the Starwolves.In this volume, Chane gets rescued by an Earth mercenary leader named Dilullo and brought into the mercenary band, though we don’t really see why Dilullo would do that.  A father/son relationship almost forms in this first book, so I’m hoping that comes to the forefront during the next two.For most of the book I was swept away in the old pulp feel of the adventure.  Hamilton does a great job of bringing that starfaring kind of adventure to life, dropping in new worlds and new aliens at a rapid clip.  I liked Chane’s adventures on the other worlds, and it took me back to those days of discovering the early science fiction novels I found in the public library and on the creaky shelves and in musty boxes of the swap shops of my childhood.  This is the kind of stuff Andre Norton and Robert A. Heinlein did so well back when I was a kid.Sometimes it’s good to be a kid again.I didn’t expect a lot out of the book, just some good memories and a little fun, and that’s what I got.  Science fiction has grown up a lot since these books came out, and I miss the whiz-bang wonder of those old days.The Weapon from Beyond is a classic science fiction tale, short and to the point, and doesn’t delve too deeply into science.  The characters are thin and just fleshed out enough to keep the story entertaining.  The only quibble I really have is the ending.  For whatever reason, Hamilton doesn’t deliver an earth-shattering ending in this one.I’ll wait a little while on the second one, but I will get to all three this summer.  I’m looking forward to them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139H4YIGPYOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441784240#wasThisHelpful","R139H4YIGPYOV","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andy McDermott exploded onto the international thriller scene with his first novel The Hunt for Atlantis.  Since then he’s added several books to the series about American archeologist Nina Wilde and ex-SAS soldier Eddie Chase.  He’s even gotten them married and successfully continued their adventures.McDermott is a master of the over-the-top thriller in the vein of Clive Cussler, James Rollins, and Matthew Reilly.  His heroes and plot are globetrotters with lots of twists and turns fueled by high-octane explosions.I’m not sure if The Shadow Protocol is meant to be an ongoing series or not.  It appears to have first been published over in England as a hardcover (The Persona Protocol), then brought to the US as a paperback release.  McDermott started out as a paperback original in the US, and he continues to be released as such here in the US, but I expect him to hit hardcover status any day now.If Adam Gray is supposed to be a series character, he’s going to need more work.  Part of the plot depends on him being a cipher, a man the government can graft new personalities onto again and again,  He even calls himself a cyborg in the novel.  He’s not really a cyborg because other than the brain alterations (which are considerable), Adam is in no way boosted to superhuman levels.The character reminded me somewhat of Jared from the old Pretender series.  Like Jarod, Adam can basically be anyone whose personality he has been overlaid with.  The science involved in the process is murky and not really there to convince a reader this type of thing can actually be done.  It’s more a Mcguffin for the novel to spin around.As a result of having an incomplete hero, the readers know they’re supposed to root for Adam, but they don’t really know him, don’t know what he wants (because much of the time Adam really doesn’t want anything), and don’t know who the real villains are because there are a baker’s dozen of them found in the pages.Eventually that all gets sorted out, but not having that emotional connection with the character puts the story at a distance for a while.Still, there are pages and pages of chases and explosions and gun battles.  The book reads like a great action film and McDermott’s writing is smooth enough to just pull you along.  At 600 pages, there’s a lot of heft to the book, so settle in and enjoy it.  Fans of his work will prefer the Wilde/Chase novels, but this one is fun enough.  If it does turn into a series, the next book will definitely have more emotional resonance because all the mysteries have been removed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2T64LYR6B14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBRTZYU#wasThisHelpful","RO2T64LYR6B14","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, Jeffery Deaver’s new book, The Skin Collector, sounds like it has a lot in common with his breakout hit featuring forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme.  Well, like all of Deaver’s creations, the book meets some of the reader’s expectations and spins others wildly in another direction.This latest novel in his long-running series (Book 11) has a lot going on in it.  In fact, as I was reading it, I really thought Deaver was throwing a lot of disparate plot lines into the mix, something that he usually doesn’t do.  Ah, and even after reading all of the novels of his that I have perused over the years, he fooled me.  And he didn’t.Nope, I didn’t see how he was going to tie everything together, but he does.  But I wasn’t entirely convinced that everything could be as Machiavellian as he purports it to be.  By the end of the book, I just wasn’t completely convinced that everything fit so neatly.Still, the book was a crackerjack read that kept me up past bedtime a couple nights, and I learned a whole lot about the history and current-day psychology of tattooing than I had even guessed at.  Even so, Deaver doesn’t cover everything about the art, and I find myself increasingly curious about the field of skin art, to the point that I will probably search out a couple books he recommends at the end of the novel.  Deaver does continue to have that effect.The novel pretty much sustains the edgy tension the author is known for throughout the publishing world.  Events cascade in, the reader thinks he or she knows what’s going on, and then the author skillfully twists and turns those events to the point the reader isn’t quite certain which way is up at times.Deaver also plays fair.  His twists and turns and endgame are actually all on the pages, and when he lays out his final reveals, you’ll remember all of them and think, “I should have known this was coming.”  That’s when Deaver is doing his best, when you can look back and see everything.  However, it’s nearly impossible to see everything coming.  You know there’s more, but you just don’t know how much more or what it’s going to be.I felt like the end was a bit contrived, but all the pieces fit like a craftsman’s masterpiece.  It’s a dexterously built construction and it all plays out exactly the way the author intends it to.I really enjoyed the parenthood that Lincoln and Amelia are forced to contend with, especially since their “adoptive” daughter is now college age and not content to accept their views on everything.  This layer adds a lot more depth to the characters.The large cast of characters that have been added to the series over the years is working out well too, allowing investigations to branch out in new directions so that a lot more of our regulars can brush up against the killers they face.With this latest addition, Deaver proves there’s plenty of gas left in the Rhyme/Sachs tank for new adventures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C43AAUTP98F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXTUW5W#wasThisHelpful","R1C43AAUTP98F3","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been a fan of the Phantom Stranger for years.  One of the things I always liked about him was his mysterious origin.  Over the years, there were all sorts of legends about where the Stranger was from, and I liked that I didn’t know.  It was fun to suppose.Dan DiDio, the author and co-publisher of DC Comics, strips away the mystery in the Stranger’s first graphic novel, and I’m not sure how I feel about that.  Granted, this incarnation of the Stranger is really cool and has a lot of baggage to carry (especially since he is who he is, and what he has to do to get rid of the coins around his neck) as well as a family, but I liked having him be the guy that arrived on the scene with the answers and kind of fixing things.  Usually.  That was the beauty of the Stranger.  You never knew if things were gonna turn out okay.Well, things obviously don’t always turn out okay in this new incarnation either.The Stranger’s origin story was originally a number zero issue of the comics.  In the graphic novel it’s released as the opening bit.  I think I would have liked a little bit of the mystery remaining to the character before ripping it all away, but they did do that in the original release of the comics.The storyline starts out big and grows larger as Pandora and the Question pop into the story.  I’ll admit that I got lost several times along the way and didn’t know who was doing what to whom.I did like the nod to other characters that have bumped into the Stranger during his various incarnations.  Dr. Terrence Thirteen is a welcome addition, but I was confused about him in this present story because he obviously believes in magic since he’s pursued by a demon.The role the Stranger plays in Jim Corrigan’s life was a true surprise.  Corrigan became the Spectre after getting killed by mobsters and being revived by the Voice, presumably God.  Evidently the Stranger is going to continue betraying people as he goes along, and that bothers me to a degree.  I’m going to wait to see how this plays out, but I have to admit I was appalled by the events surrounding the young boy playing soccer.  I don’t know why that had to happen.Another interested character introduced into the strip is Pandora.  I’ve picked up the graphic novel that tells her story, but have yet to get to it.  Evidently a tapestry of sin binds the Stranger, Pandora, and the Question, and that is getting revealed slowly.  I hope not too slowly.The book ends on a cliffhanger, which I didn’t expect, and which I wasn’t truly happy with.  I’m not sure how I feel about this new Stranger and his direction, but I picked up the second volume of his adventures because the Stranger remains…mysterious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QY2M4NRR7VW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D59OVSK#wasThisHelpful","R3QY2M4NRR7VW9","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shazam, or Captain Marvel, was once the flagship of Fawcett Comics back in the 1930s.  Captain Marvel’s adventures were released in Whiz Comics and he soon became the hottest selling superhero for decades before a copyright infringement case was settled in favor of DC Comics.For a long time, Captain Marvel languished, then DC Comics got the rights to the character and began publishing his adventures again under the name Shazam (the mystical word 12 year old Billy Batson uses to change into the hero gifted with the power of the gods).The name change was necessitated by Marvel Comics’ creation of yet another Captain Marvel (the Kree character).  The 1970s and later decades weren’t kind to Shazam.  Nobody seemed to be able to lock into the character.I think a lot of the problem was that Billy Batson, Shazam’s alter ego, was a 12 year old boy and no one knew what to do with him.  Back in the 1930s, kids bought comics and they enjoyed the idea of gaining superpowers one day.  But the market had changed.  Shazam was brought back several times, only to hit popularity for a short period, then disappear again.Geoff Johns is noted for his ability to find new takes on old characters, of breathing life into those characters so they fit into today’s world.  He does it again in the Shazam graphic novel pieced together from backup stories in the Justice League book.  Waiting on the original run of the story must have been hard, because there’s a lot going on in this book.Johns’ Billy Batson isn’t a goody-two-shoes.  He’s a 15 year old kids who’s been kicked around by the foster care system and has learned to care about nothing outside his own skin.  Except for Mr. Tawny, however.  Mr. Tawny is a tiger in a zoo that his parents took him to.The new foster care home Billy is taken to has Freddy Freeman (who will become Captain Marvel, Jr.) and Mary (who will become Miss Marvel).  This is nicely done because the kids are a motley group of unique individuals.  Billy doesn’t fit in at all, which I liked a lot, but he has traces of nobility that show up when he battles the group’s schoolyard hecklers.That enmity with the school’s brattiest kids ends up leading Billy to the subway tunnel where he encounters the old wizard.  I like that Billy’s cynical side wins over the wizard’s trust instead of suddenly becoming a beaming example of all that humanity can be.  Billy is still an aggressive kid waging war on adults with ideas of how good life is.Billy becomes Shazam and doesn’t know what to do with himself.  In fact, his first protest is that the wizard made him “old,” which is probably what someone in his shoes would think.  His second instinct is to share his change with Freddy, which sets them off on a series of adventures that are amazing because they are so well done from a kid perspective.Even as the fun is beginning, though, Johns throws in the storm with the revelation of Dr. Silvana, one of the longtime foes of Captain Marvel.  There are some tweaks and twists, but the character is essentially the same as he’s always been.  Johns is awesome at not changing anything that works, just bringing it up to date.Through Silvana, Black Adam is released, and he begins hunting for the wizard only to find that the powers have been given to someone else.  That sets off a hunt for Billy, who’s first instinct – in keeping with a child – is to hide by turning back into his 15 year old self.The adventure goes on from there, and Billy learns what it is to be part of a family, and what it is to be a hero.  There are no real surprises in the story, but man Johns hits all the stuff superhero readers want to see in a comic.  The battles are grand, the stakes are high, and it’s a person’s courage, not superpowers, that truly save the day.Gary Frank is a frequent collaborator with Geoff Johns, and his art is dead on in this graphic novel.  The panel breakdowns draw the eye and the action consumes the mind.  Don’t be surprised if you find yourself going back through the pages to get the visual aspect of the story once you see how a situation resolves.  I wandered back through the pages often, just taking in the depth of the world Frank created throughout.I don’t know what’s in store next for Shazam, but I’m really looking forward to reading more of his adventures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XQNZ8H166XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCETLI8#wasThisHelpful","R24XQNZ8H166XA","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was blown away by James Robinson’s first Earth-2 book, but not so much the second.  The first graphic novel collection seems like it moves quickly, introducing a ton of idea and world building.This second volume has a ton of world building too, but it’s like it’s been exposed an Ice Age.  There are a lot of words on the page, a lot of machinations, a lot of panels, but not much movement.  Sure, we get introduced to the new Doctor Fate (and his mysterious Tower), but it’s only eventually.  Then the battle with Wotan takes place.  And I actually felt like the baddie should have been plumb tuckered out after talking to Jay Garrick’s mom so long about how he’d been looking for the Tower and everything.  I know I was tired.I look back over the graphic novel and I try to figure out exactly what happened and I’m not certain.  I know that Doctor Fate and Wotan fought, I know that Jay Garrick inspired Khalid to become a hero even at the risk of losing his sanity, and there’s a lot of stuff Wesley Dodds, the Sandman, was doing.We just didn’t get introduced to enough new stuff in this book.  Alan Scott is still pining over the loss of his lover, goes to see his lover’s dad and kind of makes peace there, only to find out that there’s a mystery surrounding the train crash.Hawkgirl still hasn’t quite settled in for me, and this graphic novel didn’t help much in that regard.  I know she was involved to a degree with Khalid and the search for Nabu’s helmet, but I’m not sure if she’s cool with being a hero now.  And she’s left hanging in the wind at the end of this book too, which doesn’t make me happy.  Thankfully I’ve already bought the third volume so I’ll load it up into my iPad soon and hopefully get more of the story figured out.I do like Nicola Scott’s art a lot.  The breakdowns and the action are some of the best I’ve seen.  Even though not a lot was going on and Scott didn’t get to draw as much of our main heroes as I would have liked, the pages look fabulous.I also like the fact that Jay’s mom is in on his secret, and that they’re now moving in with Alan Scott while he tries to figure out what to do with Jay now that he’s been outed.  I’m sure they’ll come up with something, and seeing the dynamic of all those people under the same roof should be interesting.I don’t much care for Alan Scott’s wallowing in grief.  Not when the world is in trouble.  Grief is something that takes place on your downtime.  I want to see him being the hero.  The whole getting summoned away and leaving Hawkgirl behind while she works on figuring out who attacked the train bothered me.  He could just as easily have taken her with him.The pot is certainly boiling now, and I can’t wait to see what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5LLWO1COSDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET886KK#wasThisHelpful","RV5LLWO1COSDL","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greg Rucka is a writer I routinely follow in comics.  He writes some of the best character-oriented stuff out there.  I enjoyed his run on Wonder Woman and on Gotham Central (and I’m wondering how much of that will be cherry-picked for the new Gotham television series coming this fall).  I love his work on Stumptown, his private detective strip set in Portland, Oregon, where Rucka himself lives.Lazarus is something new, and yet it’s something the same as well.  It’s Rucka telling an action-packed story about a world that might yet evolve if economic trends and overpopulation continue.  As a result, it’s scary stuff to contemplate, which is what he wants his readers to do.However, Rucka also gives you a great story, so you get plenty of bang for your buck.  This one is like Dynasty, the old 1980s series with John Forsythe and Linda Evans.  The family in these pages is anything but loving.  Or moral.  They’ve got twisted and reprehensible covered in spades, though, so they’re very interesting.Forever still remains something of a cipher to me.  I know she’s the Carlyle family’s “Lazarus,” their strongarm warrior that – apparently – can’t be killed.  That alone has got to take a toll on the character.  I like her a lot, and I feel sympathetic for her situation, but I know she’s not getting out of it any time soon.  Which is good, because watching her struggle against all odds and knowing the lies she’s being told keeps me turning pages!The world Rucka depicts is harsh and bleak.  I like the sacrifices that are made with the same fervor that I hate that they have to be made.  I like that no matter what Forever does, she’s pretty much screwed until she figures out everything that’s going on.Rucka is a smooth writer though, and even though the reader knows more than Eve does, we still don’t know everything that Rucka knows about this world.  I can’t wait to see who gets thrown under the bus next, which makes this very much a soap opera like Dynasty.In an interview, Rucka says that he and artist Michael Lark have been hoping to do something together for a while, and Lazarus is their project.  Having a writer and artist who know and respect each other on a comic makes for a good story.  Rucka knows when to get onto the page to advance the story, and when to leave it up to Lark to carry the plotline.  There are lots of action sequences throughout the book and Lark makes the most of them.Evidently the comics are going to come out erratically, but volume two is projected to release in July.  I’m looking forward to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1446HEJ4REWKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNFCCSS#wasThisHelpful","R1446HEJ4REWKP","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Creature Commandos first saw the light of day in the November 1980 of Weird War Tales, I was twenty-three years old, so I picked it up and read it.  All I really remembered was that J. M. DeMatteis had created a team of soldiers that were based on the old Universal Monsters:  Frankenstein’s Monster, Dracula, and the Wolfman.When I saw the collection go up on Amazon for the Kindle, I bought the e-graphic novel hoping to get in touch with my younger self.  Comic books (for me) are a great touchstone for who I was and what I was doing at the time that I first read them.Over the years, I suppose I picked up a few more issues that featured the Creatures.  I remember some of the covers assembled in the collection, though I couldn’t really remember the stories.DeMatteis didn’t keep writing the erratically published books.  That task soon fell to Robert Kanigher, who had created Sgt. Rock and wrote the first Barry Allen Flash comic for Showcase.  Kanigher fished out the Creatures’ original run.The idea of using Universal Monsters as soldiers during World War II is fun, but the writing tended to be very pedestrian.  I think getting the issues parsed out with a few months between actually worked better than sitting down and blazing right through them.In reading the collection, the Creatures’ origins get rehashed time and again, such as Lucky’s (Frankenstein’s Monster) constant suicidal thoughts, then his pining after Dr. Myrra Rhodes (who became, essentially, Medusa through a freak mishap.  The constant barrage of repeated verbiage got old quickly, and nothing ever advanced on those scores.At the beginning, Warren Griffith (Wolfman, who was from Oklahoma and how did I NOT remember that?) had problems maintaining his change to Creature.  Later, for some inexplicable reason, Sgt. Vincent Velcro (how did that name slip by?) became afflicted with the same problem when it came to turning into a bat.The stories were pretty run of the mill, although the appearance of G. I. Robot and the lost island of dinosaurs from “The War that Time Forgot” were kind of cool.  And they even took a turn for the totally weird when the Creatures used a time machine to travel to the future.  (Think about it:  if a time machine had existed during World War II, somebody would have gone back and killed Hitler, or chosen a million other turning points in the past to “adjust” the present.)I read through the stories pretty quickly as a result of the repetitiveness, but it was nice seeing Kanigher’s work and that of the artists that penciled the comics.  I found out later that the Creatures actually figured into the New 52’s Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E., which I also purchased on ebook, so I may have to pick that up now and see how it was handled.The idea of Creature Commandos is a cool one, and Marvel even picked up the flag for their own Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos.One of the things that really bothered me about the stories, though, was Lt. Shrieve’s constant harassment of the Creature Commandos.  The character just became an unrealistic bigot, and the issue that was later written to kind of correct that just didn’t do enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F61R7DA0K9GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV1Y426#wasThisHelpful","R2F61R7DA0K9GQ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a kid growing up in southern Oklahoma, I devoured a lot of Westerns along with my science fiction books and pulp reprints.  To me at that time, they were all adventures, and some of the science fiction wasn’t too far removed from the Westerns.I read everything Louis L’Amour had out at the time, and a lot of other writers as well.  Ray Hogan and Jonas Ward were a couple I enjoyed, and then there was Lewis B. Patten.  His books were always thin, promising quick reads, and I picked them up and read them right along with the others.Truthfully, I can’t remember much about Patten’s books now, but occasionally I see them at book events in the boxes of Westerns.  I didn’t even know Amazon Encore had started publishing his stuff until last week.  I looked over the selections and made a couple choices that I felt pretty certain I hadn’t read before.Ride the Red Trail is a collection of three novellas that are all standalone adventures.  Patten is an easy to read author, but his habit of jumping from one point of view to another without warning bothered me.  When I was a kid, I probably never noticed such a thing, just went on turning pages to find out what was going to happen next.The first novella, “Summer Kill” reads more like a novel and has a dozen characters that Patten flits through.  In it, a family patriarch is murdered and his two sons, both of them estranged from the father as well as each other, are moved to figure out who killed him.  There’s a lot of plotting by the bad guy, then two other bad guys who intend to take advantage of everything that’s going on, that requires a more attentive read.  The two sons each have their own stories as well, and there’s more than a twist or two of coincidence to thoroughly stir the pot.  The story plays out more like a family saga and doesn’t really have a central character.“Ride the Red Trail” is a straightforward action piece that actually may be too straightforward.  Once Lew Harvey steps off that train and finds out villains are intent on stealing his folks’ place, the action just doesn’t let up until hot lead scorches the air.  The story has a lot of depth to it because there’s a lot of emotion that spills out of the back story.My favorite character is Burt Norden, a young cowboy who’s trying to keep his family’s ranch together in “Rustler’s Run.”  Burt’s only eighteen, his father is dead, and his mother has lost herself.  Patten jumps around between characters in this one as well, moving the story along, but Burt’s story and his subsequent adventures as he discovers the truth behind the rustling that’s going on in the area keep the pages turning at a smart pace.This book doesn’t offer anything special, no characters that are larger-than-life the way L’Amour’s Sacketts were, but it’s a great little book to settle in with for a couple hours of stead entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJDRGDGU8RVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAY1MJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3IJDRGDGU8RVZ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover on The Poor Boy’s Game sold me on the book.  I love that sepia tone and the aggressive stance of the woman holding the pistol in the reader’s face, and the title caught my attention too.  I’ve never heard of anything called the poor boy’s game.When I started reading the first few pages, I immediately got caught up in the story, so I figured the book would fulfill the promise made by the cover.  There was a lot of tension, then action, then shooting.After that, though, the plot veers off in several directions, and the building tension actually gets scuttled.US Marshal Frannie Mullen is someone I’d like to see again.  She has range and depth, and more than a few scars I’d like to watch her work through.  Her father is one of the worst criminals you can imagine, her sister is a basket case, and she’d just walked away from a job I thought she loved.I have to admit that I had problems with Frannie’s reasons for leaving the Marshals service.  Maybe someone who didn’t have her rough upbringing would crumple under such a bad thing happening, but her cashing in her chips and bowing out of the Marshals just didn’t work for me.  From everything in her background, Frannie is the type who would try to work through the rough spots.  Not give in to them.Patrick Mullen, her father, is an interesting guy.  Sure, he’s a villain through and through, but I would like to see him in action, actually.  He has his own journey in the novel as well, but I had trouble buying the twist that takes place toward the end.  There was no real foreshadowing of the twist, or of Patrick Mullen’s actions.The second half of the book shakes out other storylines as well, picking up the viewpoints of other bad guys coming after Frannie and Patrick, as well as the bosses who want Patrick and Frannie dead.  I didn’t see that they added anything to the plot and I would have been happier to see Frannie striking back earlier.The writing is pretty good.  The character sketches are deep and intense, but I didn’t feel like I needed to know as much about the bad guys as I ended up getting to know.I’m planning on going back for Tafoya’s earlier two books and checking them out to see what he’s doing, and I’ll pick up his next book as well.  The author is going to grow as a storyteller, and he definitely knows the city he writes about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8EH8A9D6HJOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJHA2Q#wasThisHelpful","R8EH8A9D6HJOV","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grant Morrison’s The Return of Bruce Wayne is one of those dividing books in the DCU.  You mostly either hated it or you loved it.  I’m pretty much a fence-sitter on this one.  I was okay with reading it, but not blown away.  It felt too much like an “imaginary” adventure that was prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s.It was kinda fun watching Batman in action as he tried to recover from Darkseid’s Omega Effect, but since each issue was in a different time period the secondary characters didn’t really get a chance to step up and count.The Caveman Batman (which was done back in the 1950s first, I believe) was interesting to a degree.  I could see the young caveman sticking around and becoming the world’s first “Robin” if Bruce had stayed there.  Otherwise the story was too lean, depending too much on action that was too choreographed.  The tribe is defeated, Batman goes to save the survivors, etc.  The addition of Vandal Savage was cool, but that was a given too.The Pilgrim Batman didn’t work for me at all.  I like that Bruce was displaying deductive reasoning and all, but the storyline just didn’t seem to come together or fit well enough, although another clue to Batman’s overarching mystery was presented there.The pirate tale was better.  I liked the treasure hunting aspect of the story, and the fact that they were ducking into what will eventually become the Batcave.  I also liked the reveal of who the real pirate was.  I didn’t see that one coming.  Edward Teach with fuses lit in his beard was fun.Pitting Batman against Jonah Hex was pretty cool.  After I heard there would be a Wild West Batman, I’d wondered if that was where Morrison would take the story.  I didn’t much care for his presentation of Hex, and I didn’t for a minute believe that Batman could “outdraw” multiple gunslingers with his batarangs.  Sorry, but bullets travel much faster than batarangs.The 1930s Bruce Wayne detective story was pretty interesting.  Morrison seemed like he was comfortable in that milieu and Bruce Wayne as a tough guy detective is a natural fit.  Even down to the femme fatale who betrays him in the end.The last issue collected in the graphic novel offers a resolution to the whole event and actually comes off pretty weak to me.  Batman as a threat just didn’t work for me.  I understand it could happen, but I don’t think it was developed enough.Overall, I’m glad to have Batman back in the DCU, but the trips through time just didn’t offer enough to be really special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38O1V4KJRQ59V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064W67AU#wasThisHelpful","R38O1V4KJRQ59V","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first issue of this graphic novel collection when it came out and was impressed.  The story is pretty emotional and there’s lots of action along the way.Marjorie Liu is a novelist by trade, and the layered plot shows off those skills.  She also does a really good job building up all the Marvel characters that are in Black Widow’s life.  Captain America (Winter Soldier version), Wolverine, and Tony Stark all ring true.The initial impetus of the story is well-done, cycling quickly up into the action regarding the attack on our heroine.  However, I had to ask myself, if the eventual baddie really wanted her dead, why not kill her then?  It’s a complaint I (and several other readers/watchers) haven whenever a hero ends up totally in the villain’s clutches.  I have a hard time understanding why a villain wouldn’t take care of business at that moment.The “bug” the Black Widow carried bothered me too.  Sure, she’s a spy and not from America, and she has a checkered past, but she’s resolved all of that, right?  At least, I’d thought so.  And I seemed to be more put off by that revelation that the heroes.  You can’t just dismiss that as “that’s what she does.”  Tony Stark at least would have known with all the tech he deals with.  And I think Wolverine might have smelled the bug on her.After the initial action, things kind of slow down and take a step back.  Black Widow pursues her villain, and along the way we get to know more about her, but I’m not sure that her loss really deepens the story enough.  It would be enough for another character, but I just can’t see it with the Black Widow because there has been so much history there.  The emotional scars would have shown up somewhere along the way.  Especially with the way she’s confronted about her reluctance to hold a child.Although I was a little jarred by the subject matter, Liu is an excellent storyteller.  There’s enough interaction between the characters, the back and forth between the Widow and Bucky – especially with them being lovers, that I bought into that particular emotional journey.Daniel Acuna’s art is fantastic.  I don’t know what the medium was that he used, but it almost looks like watercolors, bright and liquid.  His panel breakdowns are very well done, and I ended up going back through the book just to look at the art after I’d finished reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH5C39J1G9SKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAJQWZ8#wasThisHelpful","RH5C39J1G9SKN","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cheap Shot spends a lot of time hitting buttons in the Spenser World.  After a while, I started to feel like I was checking off names on a scavenger hunt.  Hawk.  Check.  Vinnie Morris.  Check.  Rachel Wallace.  Check.  Hugh Dixon Check.  (Only long-time readers would have picked up on that one from The Judas Goat.)  I was actually surprised that Rita Fiore wasn’t mentioned.In many of the past novels in the series, Spenser has been fired by clients, then continued to work for the clients to resolve things.  Hawk even mentions it in passing humor.  In this novel, I couldn’t keep up with who fired (and rehired) Spenser last.  By the time I turned the final pages, I wasn’t sure who paid him for services rendered.I also struggled to figure out the plot.  The shooting was pretty straightforward, and then the kidnapping, but I couldn’t believe how tangled everything got before the final resolution.  I also struggled with the fact Spenser didn’t follow up on ALL the leads he had at his disposal.  The one that he didn’t follow through on was important.  The biggest problem I had was the kidnapping.  I couldn’t figure out why it went down like that, and it still bothers me.Of course, over the years I had the same problems with Robert B. Parker’s novels.  Parker tended to wander around wherever he wished as well and often seemed to pull an ending out of a hat.  Still, the thing that kept me coming back time and again were the characters and the writing.Ace Atkins is doing a great job continuing the series.  The writing is smooth and the characters are mostly on.  Hawk felt strange to me in this one, and I couldn’t figure out why.  Maybe it’s because Z and Hawk are both fulfilling the second banana role and there’s not enough stage time to pull Hawk through.One of the main Hawk story lines that didn’t get played out was his being “smitten” by Kimbro Heywood’s ex-wife.  Or maybe the resolution of that is waiting in the wings.As for the writing, I think Atkins is actually writing smoother, embellishing little things, and making easy to turn pages regarding the narration.  Parker tended to be leaner and do a lot more with dialogue.  Atkins does a lot with dialogue too, but we get more of a chance to be inside Spenser’s head with this one.  Atkins also keeps tabs on the other characters better in some ways.  Zebulon Sixkiller has come a long way since Spenser first introduced him, and it would have been interesting to see what Parker did with Z.  Would he have become Spenser-lite the way Atkins has filled him out?  I like Z, and would actually like to see more of him.The action got a little lean in this one, I thought, and the ending needed something more.  I would have liked to know how things turned out for Kimbro and the others.  Overall, I had a good time with this one and am looking forward to the next Quinn Colson book this summer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1875ER7DGFSO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L11PI#wasThisHelpful","R1875ER7DGFSO0","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a long time, Bucky Barnes was the deadest superhero in the world.  Though other heroes died and came back, making the ultimate sacrifice just to sell more issues of their comics, Bucky remained blown to pieces somewhere deep in the ocean.  That Captain America survived was just impossible to believe, though his return heralded a new era in comicdom and still maintains an international level of attention.As it turns out, James Buchanan Barnes didn’t die after all.  Ed Brubaker breathed new life into the character, bringing him back in a horrific manner and even equipping Bucky with a more adult origin than he’d ever had at any time before.  Dick Grayson was wimp by comparison.  Dick, who remains one of my favorite heroes, got trained to be a superhero sidekick and gradually stepped into his own.Bucky was trained to be a commando, a boy who could slip in behind enemy lines and wreak havoc with German troops.  A kid who laid down his life not only with Captain America, but also on his own during missions even Cap didn’t know about.That was just the retcon.  Brubaker pulled out all the stops when he turned Bucky into the Winter Soldier, one of the most feared killing machines of the Cold War.  There’s a lot of history between then and now, and you can find it in the pages of Captain America’s own graphic novels.Everyone (mostly) believed that Brubaker had again killed Bucky after his sojourn as the new Captain America, but that was a fabrication created by Bucky and Nick Fury.  Bucky was trained to operate in the shadows, and after his near-miss with death, he wanted to return to those dark places and fight the fight he knew how to pursue.In the opening five-issue arc (with an issue of Captain America thrown in to explain how Bucky is still alive), the Winter Soldier has returned and he’s paired with his lover, the Black Widow, to hunt down three Cold War sleeper agents who have a world threatening secret.Brubaker is a master at retconning characters, and he does it again with the Red Ghost.  Initially, the Ghost was Ivan Kragoff, a supervillain who subjected himself and three trained apes to the same cosmic radiation that gave the Fantastic Four their powers.  In the pages of The Longest Winter, Kragoff shifts from what in the past has kind of been a laughable character to a formidable one.The Winter Soldier and Black Widow continue the chase through the back doors of spydom, a place Brubaker is totally confident and at home in.  The story quickly switches from feeling like a superhero strip to a spy story.  The plans, the moves, the setbacks, all play out like a Mission: Impossible assignment.When the story eventually reveals the true threat to the world, and it involves Doombots created by Doctor Doom, the stakes are raised as high as they can be.  The Winter Soldier and the Black Widow have no choice but to attempt to bring Doctor Doom into the fold to help bring the threat to a close.The world is still standing, so we know how that turned out, but the adventure is getting there.  Brubaker is a master of pacing and character, and all the pieces of his layered plot fit well together.Butch Guice’s artwork looks like captured celluloid.  The action, the shadows, the cities, and the dark rooms all come to vibrant life.  The inking is heavier than I generally like in a comic, but in this strip it’s the backbone of the mood and the threat.Pick this one up, but don’t expect a quick, breezy read.  The story and characters draw you in, and the artwork will guarantee you’ll flip back through it just to see Guice laying out some of the best panel work he’s ever done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C75A0DRT4FKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EARP2X4#wasThisHelpful","R2C75A0DRT4FKD","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m trying to settle into my summer (post-college semester) with reading and writing.  So yesterday when I discovered that Constantine was indeed going to be making a small-screen appearance as a series in the fall, I thought about the first graphic novel of the “new” Constantine I’d picked up but hadn’t gotten around to yet.The new John Constantine is the old John Constantine.  Mostly.  This is the version that’s been traveling around with the Justice League Dark series.  I’ve read and reviewed the first two graphic novels of that series and loved them.  Just discovered the third graphic novel was out, so I picked it up too because the last one ended on a cliffhanger.This Constantine is ten years or so younger, has a romantic history with Zatanna (DCU’s backwards speaking magician), and has a lot of the same history as the original.  The comic books are no longer called Hellblazer, dunno why.The collection offers the first six issues of the series, led off by a three-issue arc that explores, more or less, Constantine’s present world.  This arc is written by Jeff Lemire and Ray Fawkes, I guess as a sort of handoff from Justice League Dark that Lemire has been doing.  The handoff is pretty much seamless in my opinion, because I had to go back to look where Fawkes took off on his own.In this first arc, Constantine is presented at his best.  He’s smart, selfish, and curious, and mostly out to save his own neck as things go bad.  I enjoyed the ties back to Sargon the Sorcerer, one of the Golden Age’s heroes that I didn’t know about until the 25 80-page giant comics back in the 1970s, although Sargon isn’t actually in this graphic novel.This new Constantine appears to be a world traveler as well, globe-hopping with aplomb and knowing people everywhere.  I like the idea a lot because it opens up all sorts of out-of-the-way places and world magics to climb into the coming stories.  It only stands to reason because Constantine has access to the House of Mystery (see the Justice League Dark to get up to date on that).I like the Cold Flame as a threat, especially with the new Sargon the Sorceress.  I can tell they’re going to be around for a while.  And I liked the confrontation with the Spectre, though I couldn’t tell exactly how this version of the Spectre fits into the new DCU.  The Spectre is one of those characters I enjoyed a lot and look forward to.The second story is a standalone, pretty much a-day-in-the-life-of scenario that works really well as it comes full circle.  Constantine gets a chance to balance the scales here and there, and work his magic as he gets himself out of hot water with Papa Midnite, a voodoo-slinging character that looks to be another recurring personality.As we see, Constantine’s on-again/off-again relationship with Zatanna is pretty much off, but it is nice to see her and get an idea of what she’s up to.The next story is a two-parter that stars Constantine with Shazam/Billy Batson that on the surface looks like it wouldn’t work, but Fawkes does a good job of setting up all the whys and wherefores.  Plus, we get a look at a Captain Marvel Constantine who is interesting to watch in action.  I like the new Billy Batson too, and he’s kind of a chip off of the old Constantine because he’s not the St. Billy everyone remembers.  He’s a kid who’s been in the foster system and gotten really jaded before he got his superpowers/magic.  I do like the new hood he wears.I’m also enjoying the fact that Constantine’s world tends to evolve and bring back old characters at the same time.  In most comics series once a character is dead, that’s pretty much it.  (Unless they’re brought back to life and turned into something really cool – like Winter Soldier.)  In the last issue collected in this book, one of the victims of Constantine’s earlier machinations turns up from the afterlife looking for revenge.For a time Constantine hovers on the brink of life and death, only to be helped by a former combatant.  And that just sets us up for the cliffhanger ending.One of the best things about this new series is Renato Guedes’ art.  The panels and the pages simply pop.  I also like the lighter treatment of colors everything is rendered in.  It would be too easy to lose detail (or simply not draw it) if the strip was heavily inked.  The colors here most of the time are a pastel hue that makes everything easy to see.  Yet, even in these lighter hues, Constantine’s world is creepy and malicious.I’m really hoping the new television series riffs off of this new series because there are a lot of fun characters in these pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNGR970RDGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4EW10M#wasThisHelpful","R2BNGR970RDGF","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very impressed with the paintbrush set from Chameleon Art Supplies.  I particularly appreciated the wide range of sizes and shapes and the large number of angled brushes, as most brush sets include flats and rounds but very few if any angled brushes.It is also tremendously useful as an art teacher that the set includes larger brushes instead of lots of detail brushes which are rarely useful in the elementary classroom setting.  The length of the bristles was ample, and the ferrules seem to be high quality, not prone to bristle loss.  I like the length and finish of the handles as well.Finally, as an elementary art teacher, I am constantly having to remind students not to dip the bristles into the paint too deeply (as students usually want to dip the brush into paint all the way to the ferrule); though I don’t know the intention of the manufacturer, the darker discoloration at the tips of the brushes provides a nice visual guide for students.  I would love to see these brushes available in classroom sets at an affordable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16UDMX7WJGD6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGKOZRM#wasThisHelpful","R16UDMX7WJGD6O","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the positively creepy Gothic cover on the front of The House on the Cliff by Charlotte Williams, I was expecting a creepy, delightful read.  Even reading the synopsis on the back of the book didn’t put me off of that expectation.What I got, and what you will get if you pick up this book, is a well-plotted and twisty little psychological mystery novel.  The cast of characters is small, but there’s a lot going on.This is supposed to be the first book of a series about Jessica Mayhew, a psychologist juggling an unfaithful husband, two teen daughters, and a practice.  The mystery in this book reaches out to Jessica and directly involves her, but I don’t know how the author is going to pull that off again and again to meet the needs of a series.I really liked the writing style Williams employs here.  The first person narration is good, the character is deep enough to draw me in, and her world feels real.  She spends a lot of time describing things, but I was somewhat disappointed because the book is set in Wales and it feels too familiar to me.  I didn’t get that Welsh feeling I was expecting.  Part it that might have been because the scenes were set in Jessica’s office, home, and Stockholm where she visits for a bit.  The most striking thing about the setting is the house, and that may have been because of the cover.The problem she presents here is interesting.  I’ve NEVER heard of anyone having button phobia, and I’m still not sure I’d believe someone really had it even if they told me.  Buttons just don’t do anything.  They sit there.  I can understand a fear of snakes, dentists, etc., but a fear of buttons just put me off.  I struggled with this part of the book, especially when – as Jessica points out – it could probably be handled by a conditioning exercise.The unfaithful husband comes into play immediately, and I never did warm up to the character, although I think I was supposed to.  Bob was kind of vapid and selfish, and I just never got around to trusting him.The problem with Nella, the out-of-control teenage daughter, put me off completely.  I can’t imagine any parent knuckling under to that girl’s arguments, especially a professional psychologist.  That part of the story really draws you along to see what happens, and is in many ways more explosive than what is supposed to be the main problem.  I got caught up in the fallout from that situation even though I had to check my disbelief several times.  I just can’t imagine this situation would have gone on as long as it did, or get solved so quickly.The mystery of the dead au pair and the situation Gwydion Morgan brings to Jessica’s door gets lost in the narrative too often to work as a true puzzle, and I had it figured out well before I got to the end.Still, I sat down and breezed through this book in an evening, sucked in by the storytelling.  Charlotte Williams is a deft writer in narrative, and I’m interested to see what she does for a follow-up.  With the family issues pretty much settled in this novel, the next book will have to focus more on the mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3OFJLEI8Y7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3D3XO#wasThisHelpful","R1R3OFJLEI8Y7J","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed (and loved) about my Easy Living picture frame was the glass in it wasn’t glass, but a sturdy piece of plastic.  I have had many picture frames fall for various reasons and the glass would break and sometimes cut the pictures.  I have young grandchildren that love to look at my pictures and they drop them occasionally. The plastic is awesome!The construction of the frame is well done.  The corners are nicely mitered, and fit well together.  The wood on the back has been sanded down enough that I don’t get splinters.  I have had splinters from frames in the past.  That is one thing I am more careful about since I have grandchildren now.This is not a fancy frame or a frame that demands attention.  But that’s one reason I like it.  It lets the picture be the center of attention.  Over all I give this frame a five star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGN0807QL8U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4PGEPG#wasThisHelpful","RHGN0807QL8U8","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Smart Weigh Digital Pro Scale is small, sleek, and easy to read.  The downside is I thought I could use it to weigh food.  Some foods are fairly easy to weigh, but others are more difficult with the read out in the center and flat.  If the read out was at a slight slant I think it would be easier to read when items are larger than the ‘scale’ portion of the scale.Because this scale does ounces, grams and TARE, I think this scale would be better used for other things than weighing food.  I have a friend who is a gun enthusiast and loads his own shells; I think this would be great for him.For me this is a three star, but for the right person I think this could easily be a five star item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHWEWVNO9ZJWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1YHZK#wasThisHelpful","RHWEWVNO9ZJWL","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I received the Tap-n-Flush I was excited.  It took me a few minutes to figure out which installation to use since I didn’t know the model of toilet I owned.  I was very grateful for the diagrams provided in the instructions.  This helped me decide which instructions to use.  Once I knew which one to follow it only took about ten to fifteen minutes to install.  It did say that there might be some adjustments that might need to be done over the next week or so after the initial installment.  I have only had to adjust it once since the first week.  It has been working great since.The component that sits on the back of the toilet has little rubber ‘feet’ so it doesn’t slip around.  However, the lid on my toilet tank is slightly rounded, so I have to keep an eye on the component so it doesn’t slip off the lid.  For me the ‘feet’ don’t help much for holding the device in place.The Tap-n-Flush claims to save money on your water bill.  I have noticed a slight decrease in my water bill.  My toilet is a fairly new energy saver one to start with so others may have more of a decrease in their bill than I have seen in mine.  I have also noticed the flush amount from the tank is less.Overall, I give this product four stars.  I do like it, however, the movement across the lid can get irritating if I don’t remember to keep an eye on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZZGB1FY277Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRP2UOO#wasThisHelpful","R3HZZGB1FY277Y","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LED motion detector light is awesome!  It is small and did adhere to our wall without any problem.  We put it in the hallway so kids don’t have to fiddle around trying to find the switch in the middle of the night.  It works great for what we are using it for.  Even though it is small it gives off a lot of light.  It also is very bright.  For that reason when you install it be sure not to put it at eye level.  You will probably blind someone if you do! We are considering getting a couple more.  A couple of places we’re considering putting them are in our shed and a couple for our emergency bag.  We live in Tornado Alley and at times we lose light due to tornados and/or high winds and these would be handy to have.I have been impressed with this small, yet effective light.

"Chekhov’s Gun by Vin DeLoach is a novella based in the new Kindle Worlds licensed franchise of Veronica Mars.  I was a fan of the television show, and am currently aggravated that the movie has not shown up yet in my hometown.  So when I heard that there would be new Veronica Mars stories I was excited.I’ve never read anything by Vin DeLoach.  The writing is incredibly smooth and the plotting is almost effortless.  He should stay busy writing.  I looked, and sadly, there are no other books written by this person.I’m sure fans of the television show already had suspicions of how Veronica always knew when the drug dogs were going to be brought into the high school.  Perhaps, some thought it was just because her father used to be the sheriff.  In this novella, the “real” reason Veronica always gets tipped off about the drug searches is revealed.Fans who pick up this novella will feel instantly at home.  The Neptune in these digital pages feels like the town where we first met Veronica.  Many of the characters stepped through these scenes as well.  Characters like Jerry Sacks and Don Lamb resonate perfectly and haven’t changed a bit.The plot is simple and straightforward, a very clean vehicle for getting Veronica on thin ice with Sheriff Lamb while her father, Keith, is out of town.  Jerry Sacks’s gun has gone missing, and he’s not sure what he’s going to do.  The last time he remembered having his weapon was prior to the drinking binge he went on with the sheriff.Veronica’s investigation into the matter is very logical, very much like a detective, which is what we have come to expect from her.  The twists and turns of the story are engaging and it’s way too easy to read this tale in a single sitting.  It’s paced just like an episode of the television series, and I wouldn’t have been surprised to see it as such.So far only a couple Veronica Mars stories have shown up as Kindle Worlds properties.  There is also a Veronica Mars novel forthcoming from Rob Thomas, the show’s creator.  If you miss the show, pick this one up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBMFSHTYMAPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4XVMTM#wasThisHelpful","RTBMFSHTYMAPG","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not a doubter anymore.  I received Yacon Syrup by Food for Life just to see what it was all about and to see for myself if it worked.  I could not see how taking just a teaspoon three times a day could help you lose weight.  I found out it does.  I lost five pounds in the first week!My ‘normal’ routine was planning the next meal before I had finished the one I was eating.  I also made sure there were ‘quick’ food items on hand for snacking between meals.  I took a teaspoon of Yacon Syrup before each meal.  And I would eat what I would normally eat for a meal.  As the week went on I thought there is no way I lost weight.  However, I got on the scale this morning and was down five pounds!  Reflecting back, I now realize I didn’t snack between meals, I did not eat as much as I normally do during the meal, and food was not on my mind nearly as much all week.I’m not sure if this is related, but I also had more energy to get things done and seemed more focused on tasks at hand.

"I got this kit from Yazycraft and took it to school for my fourth graders to use during indoor recess.  THEY LOVED IT!  Both the boys and the girls were using the bands to make rings, necklaces, bracelets, and even characters from the movies.  It was the best indoor recess all year.When I asked them what they liked about it they said these rubber bands were softer and easier to use then the ones they got with their kits.When I asked them if there was anything they would like to see changed they said they would like some of the bands themselves to be multi-colored.  Another girl would like to have some of the clear S clips to be colored.  The sectioned container was ‘awesome’ because they could find their colors easier.The glitter glue was not used with the bands.  Even though the glue was put out with the bands, not one wanted to use it on the bands.  Instead they made pictures with them.They had problems with controlling the flow of the glitter glue.  One girl got pretty good with the glue coming out evenly, but every so often a glob would happen.  When the pictures dried the glitter and color were still there and it looked pretty good.  The bands I would give 5 stars to, but the glitter glue would be 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1NNCCZWHM63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1O3690#wasThisHelpful","RJ1NNCCZWHM63","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the three Wailea Fitness Resistance Bands to go with some PT I had on my shoulder a while back.  I do like these better than what I was given from the therapist. There are two things I wish would have come with this set, instructions and the level of resistance for each band.  I believe the therapist said the order was green, red, then black, but I’m not sure.  Also, since it’s been awhile since I have been in therapy, I am going by memory on the exercises.  I know I’m forgetting some.  Instructions for various exercises would be nice.My guess for not including instructions and resistance level of each band would be the company wants you to work with your physical therapist for the best results with these bands.Even with no instructions or resistance levels, I’m giving these bands four stars.

I also found the body fat instrument and chart easy to use.I have not been exercising in many years (regularly) and wanted to start in the privacy of my home before getting out in public for more intense workouts.  However, with this set I will be able to go from beginner to advanced at home if I wish.  I did have a little problems attaching to the door handle at first, but was able to figure it out eventually.Another thing I like about this set is that with the carrying bag everything is easy to take on the go if I need to.

"I got the Yazycraft hooks and the first thing I noticed was the cool colors.  The second thing I noticed was if you like smaller hooks this was a pretty good set.  The molded plastic makes it easy to hold and control the direction of the ‘hook’.  I like this because I don’t crochet a lot, but when I do I sometimes get frustrated with the hook turning on me.  There are five hooks that are 1.6mm in this set.  I’m not sure why there are so many of them, but as I said, I’m not an avid crocheter.  The other hooks start at 2.0mm and go by increments of 0.5mm all the way up to 5.0mm.  Right now I’m using the 4.5mm, which I am pleased with, to make an afghan.

"I do like the color and the grips on the bottom of the BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks.  I agree with the person who said they do run on the small side.  My feet barely fit into the socks.  I was concerned about stretching them and having them possibly tear.  So I did not stretch them too much when I put them on.The feel of the gel against my feet took a little getting used to.  It was cool to the touch to start with, and then as they form fitted to my feet, my feet began to sweat.  I would wear them from an hour to two at a time.  Walking in them felt like I was walking on a baggie of gel.  It felt very strange.

"I found the Sterling Pro French Coffee Press pleasing to the eye and easy to use.  What I liked about it most, I was able to make my coffee, fill my to-go coffee mug, and then my son would be able to use it to make his coffee (a little stronger than mine) and we could both enjoy our coffee at the strength we like.  What was very nice as far as I was concerned was how clear the coffee was.  There were no grounds in it at all.  The beaker and filter were both easy to clean.  The filter seems very sturdy and looks like we’ll be able to use it for quite a while before changing it out for one of the extra ones that comes with the coffee press.

"I had not previously read Simon Kernick, though I was aware of him because I check the bestseller lists.  So I figured I was in good hands when I booted up Wrong Time, Wrong Place.  The story starts off full-on action and tension, and just gets more wound up from there because the killing comes on fast and plentiful from that point on.The idea of four people (two couples) caught up in a nightmarish circumstance simply because they tried to help someone strikes too closely to home.  I was hooked at once because I have sometimes found myself doing exactly that because I’m originally from a small town and we help each other.  I currently live in Moore, which has been in the news a lot with the tornados, and that same sense of camaraderie exists.Kernick doesn’t waste any time setting his killers onto the two couples, and the body count climbs as ruthlessness abounds.  The author throws in a lot of curves, some emotionally resonant character studies done in the heat of the moment that don’t slow down the action, and weaves it all together with a thorny sense of desperation that will not abate.I’m of mixed feelings about my overall experience with the novella, but I am convinced that Kernick is an author I’m adding to my current overwhelming stack of ebooks.  He has another short piece, “The Debt,” for those that want to try him again before digging into a full novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGOBZH846WME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOHG07A#wasThisHelpful","R3RGOBZH846WME","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got my Bellesha Round Facial Sponge pack of 12, I had my sixteen year old son use it.  He suffers from teenage acne.  I reminded him every morning and evening to use it.  After only three days we could already tell a difference on his face!  I asked him if he would keep using the Bellesha sponges and he said he would.  Yay…I found something he will use and works for him.  I use my sponge twice daily and loved the slightly rough texture.  It was just enough to open up the pores and let my face ‘breathe’, without making my face red from the scrubbing so many other brands often cause.  My skin feels soft afterwards.

"I was impressed with Castle Hill 500 thread count 100% Egyptian Cotton Sateen queen sheet set I received.  In the package the bedding looked nice.  Once out of the package it was so soft!  I expected it to be `cool' to the touch because of the `sateen' look, but contrary to how it looked, it felt great. I also looked carefully at the machine stitching around the pillowcases and top sheet.  Often on other brand of sheets the tension of the sewing machine is off and the stitching is loose, uneven, or bunched up.  Not on the set I got from Blow Out Bedding/Amazon.  The stitching was neat, even, and precise.  Beautifully done. After three days of sleeping on them I was even more impressed because they actually stayed on the mattress.  The last two sets of sheets I had kept coming untucked at the corners because I toss and turn a lot in my sleep.  These sheets stayed on perfectly.  That alone would have sold me on these sheets!

"I received my Smart Weigh DVS250 Digital Vanity Scale in the mail just days ago and love it!  The stylish, sleek, modern design virtually blends into the background of my bathroom.  The tempered glass and silver and black trim outline the scale and makes the back lit, digital read-out easy to read.  The Smart Weigh DVS250 is about one-fourth smaller than my old scale which is nice since my bathroom is not too large to start with.  I weighed myself three days in a row, three times back to back and the scale was consistently the same.  On my old scale it would fluctuate as much as five pounds in a five minute period! Another nice feature it has is that you can change the read out to stones, pounds, or kilos. The only thing I find a little frustrating is it is rather difficult to find exactly where the `on' button is on the scale.  I have to feel around in the bottom right corner of the scale until I hit the correct place in order to turn it on.  On the flip side, if there were a label for the `on' placement it would distract from the clean look of the tempered glass. Overall, I am very pleased with the DVS250 digital scale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWAA2GJPKLRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRZVQI#wasThisHelpful","R3KWAA2GJPKLRQ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the old ghost stories that manage to sweep you away to a menacing world where death may lie around any corner, where things wait to spring out on you, and where there’s a mystery central to the supernatural manifestations that take place.  I think a lot of horrors readers like the same thing.Christopher Golden delivers most of that in his new novel, Snowblind.  Golden knows horror, and his familiarity with the genre reaches back a good long while to the Stephen King novels that first caught horror fandom’s attention.Snowblind is a riff on those oldie but goodie horror novels that King used to do and sometimes still delivers.  The book has a large cast of characters and multiple plots that all dovetail in the overall storyline, but those stories eclipse, to a degree, the horror that comes in during blizzards that hit Coventry, Massachusetts.The characters are well delineated, and their problems are all easily understood.  TJ and Ella fell in love during the first blizzard that strikes in these pages, but twelve years later, their marriage is on the rocks.  Most of that appears to stem from the economy and external stressors, which everyone these days can understand, but I’m not certain that I totally bought the collapsing marriage because they seemed to get along well throughout.Doug Manning was a curveball.  When he first appears on the pages, he’s something of misfit, standing up for himself at what seems to be the wrong time and not wanting to face his wife after losing his job.  During the first blizzard, he also loses his wife, Cherie.  When he steps back onto the stage later, he’s on the verge of becoming a criminal.Jake Schapiro lost his little brother Isaac in the first blizzard and has turned into a photographer, only able to achieve solace when peering through the lens of his camera.  He also shoots crime scenes on the side.Joe Keenan was a rookie patrolman when the first blizzard swept through Coventry.  He was too late to save a group of missing boys and that has scarred him throughout his career.Golden puts all of these characters through the emotional wringer as he advances his story and brings in the weirdness.  Readers expecting a slam-bang fright fest aren’t going to get it.  This is a spooky ride, one that gives the reader plenty of time to think and wonder, “What if…”The book moves along and is easy to read, peopled with sympathetic character I felt I knew by story’s end, but I really wanted more explanation of the ice entities.  There were really cool, so to speak.  In the older traditions of horror, I know writers didn’t always reveal what the nature of the horror was, partially so readers could envision some of that for themselves and make those creatures even more frightening.  However, I wanted a reveal here.Of course, given the ending, Golden may have a sequel planned.  On another note, I think I prefer the British cover over the American one.  It seems genuinely more creepy, just not very urban.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CMS0FDA2N5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8HRRBU#wasThisHelpful","R4CMS0FDA2N5W","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much of the forward moment set up in the first two volumes of what has turned out to be one very LONG story gets frittered away by endless action scenes.  The battle in this volume seems to go on forever and involve a cast of thousands.  Or at least a lot of horrific versions of the DC Universe.  There are some cool things, but they get lost in the narrative.The Rotworld saga also overlaps the Swamp Thing title, which is good in some respects because it gives readers a view of what Alec Holland and company are doing these days, but there’s just too much going on to get it all sorted.  Then, when Lemire throws in Frankenstein Agent of S.H.A.D.E. and Black Orchid and John Constantine, things get tangled quickly regarding who’s doing what to whom and why.Again, there are light points to enjoy, such as when Maxine starts manifesting animal powers like her dad, but even that bit of lighter fare gets eclipsed by the ever-increasing darkness.  You can feel the oppressing BAD THINGS that are going to happen in this story.  The tale is bleak and almost hopeless.  It’s almost like watching a Rocky movie, watching Rocky get beaten up and knocked down again and again, knowing that at the end he will rise to his feet and become a champion.  But man it’s a long time till we get there, and the ending just sucks all the relief away in one vanished heartbeat.The imagery is sharp and intense, something I’ve come to expect from this series, but it almost reminds me of Marvel Zombies, a title I was aware of but never really got into.  Superheroes like the Justice League are turned into monstrous creatures.  Even Batgirl, who’s somehow working with Swamp Thing to offset the effects of Rotworld, has been changed into something macabre.The Swamp Thing storyline almost invades the Animal Man arc to the point that Buddy Baker and his concerns all but vanish here and there.  It was interesting, but I had to work too hard to figure out where Batgirl and the Batbot came from or how they got there.  There was simply too much going on, and not all of those events took place in this graphic novel.I assume reading the Swamp Thing graphic novel about Rotworld will fill in those gaps, but I don’t know that I’ll be all that interested in rehashing everything that goes on in this book.  Once was enough.  However, Scott Snyder is currently writing Swamp Thing and he’s a writer that I’ve recently found and am enjoying.  So … we’ll see.As to the Rotworld saga, it grinds to a close in this volume of Animal Man but it leaves emotional destitution in its wake.  I didn’t see the ending coming, and I’m not really happy with it.  I know writing is supposed to elicit an emotional reaction on part of the reader, but this one is just a total downer.  Maybe there’s a reset button waiting in the future, but if Lemire doesn’t handle that well, I’m going to feel cheated.The fourth volume won’t be out for a while, and at this point I’m really not ready to get into it anyway.  This entry exhausted me on several levels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFFORWL6WW8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW4RCX8#wasThisHelpful","R2OFFORWL6WW8Z","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Animal Man: Animal vs. Man takes the read on an even darker turn in this new imagining of the life of Buddy Baker.  The road trip from/to Hell continues unabated.  I’m glad I decided not to list the book for juveniles because I personally think young minds are simply not ready for all the violence and gore in this one.Parental aside:  Seeing a horror movie with your kids at a young age is different (to me) because you’re there with them to remind them that what they’re seeing isn’t real.  A comic book, read by an individual, is a much stronger, more immersive experience.  So if your child is consuming questionable material, read/watch it on your own if you have to in order to understand what’s going on.  Just my two cents.  Things aren’t as scary when you can discuss them with your parents.The art in this graphic novel changes slightly as Travel Foreman is joined by Steve Pugh, but if anything, the weirdness – if anything – increases on a geometric level.  This is just a harsh and edgy look at a new world unfolding in the pages of Animal man.Despite the inherent darkness in the book, author Jeff Lemire manage to get some quality time in with the Baker family.  I love how even though their lives may be hanging in the balance that Cliff manages to be obstinate and self-centered as any kid his age would be.  I also loved the moment Buddy gets to be the super-dad and raises Cliff’s street cred in one fantastic swoop that leaves a couple girls’ mouths hanging open in awe.Socks, Maxine’s cat/avatar/guardian, has turned out to be quite a nice addition to the family, and unveils some surprises of his own that I really enjoyed.  I’m not so certain about the addition of Ellen’s mother.  Her character seems to hit all the familiar tropes of a superhero mother-in-law (can there really be such a thing?) but I think her presence, if not wholly original, strikes a familiar tone readers will enjoy.Ellen, Buddy’s wife, really shines in this story.  While Buddy and Maxine are off in the Red figuring stuff out, Ellen gets accosted by John Constantine, Zatanna, and Madame Xanadu.  In the end, I was kind of frustrated by their presence there, though.  They don’t really do anything or add anything to the story, but Ellen’s confrontation with them (and Maxine’s threat) are just fun to watch.Of course, off in the Red, things are much more serious.  There’s a lot of dark in this book despite the bright colors, and that heavy presence really started to weigh on me and I went through the pages.  I think the series is definitely horror at this point, with the Baker family on the run and Buddy’s body hijacked, but there’s a huge emphasis on fantasy as well.  Buddy’s travels and battles through the Red with the Shepherd are fantastic and pure quest trope fantasy.  The bone sailboat crossing the ocean of blood is just iconic.At the end of this volume I was again disappointed in the fact that events still haven’t come to a head.  There’s still no rest for the Baker family, and Buddy is in a bad way.  In real-time (buying comics monthly) this story would have taken over a year and a half, which, I think, is a lot to expect from readers.  It’s even a lot to ask of a guy who can buy the graphic novels and read them one after another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGH46R4RJIF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B14FN9W#wasThisHelpful","RYGH46R4RJIF9","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Animal Man is one of those weird superheroes who was – seemingly – destined for obscurity.  In the beginning he was picked up by aliens and exposed to a process that allowed him to temporarily take on the abilities and attributes of animals, although he didn’t change shape to do this like the Doom Patrol’s (and later Teen Titan) Beast Boy did.  He was Buddy Baker, which sounds about as blue collar as you can get.Then Grant Morrison picked him up and did strange things to him, turned Animal Man’s powers inside out and made them more mystical.  That treatment also turned Animal Man into one of the hottest selling titles at the time.  But even that wore off after a while and he just returned to obscurity.With the New 52 relaunch, Jeff Lemire took over the scripting chores.  Lemire has an affinity to and a penchant for mystical things.  I’m not sure who created the ideas of the Red and the Green (maybe kinda modeled on Geoff Johns’s rainbow Green Lantern Corps?), but Lemire has owned them.  I liked his work on the New 52 Justice League Dark and dipped into his Animal Man series out of nostalgia and curiosity.I like Lemire’s take on Buddy Baker.  Buddy is more family guy who happens to have superpowers than a superhero.  Most of the first graphic novel spins around Buddy’s relationship with his wife, Ellen, his son, Cliff, and his daughter,Maxine, whom he affectionately calls Little Wing.  The opening sequence of a family meal disrupted by self-indulgence and uncertainty (Buddy) and by the wants of the warring siblings is just so normal I slid right into the story.Lemire obviously knows families and his love and understanding of them and how they work is fantastic for this book.  If nothing else, Animal Man is the story of a family and how they adapt to Buddy’s superhero role.  But that’s not the real problem, as Lemire so chillingly reveals.  Maxine is also tied to the Red, which is where Buddy gets his “morphogenetic” powers.When weird things started going on, I got really interested in where Lemire was taking Animal Man this time around.  When Maxine raises animals from the dead, I got even more interested.  But you see, even all of that is merely the tip of the iceberg that Lemire presents.I loved the idea of the Red and the new “origin” story for Buddy Baker’s animal powers.  The whole Red world is a fantasy trip through exotic locales I’d never imagined Buddy would go.  Travel Foreman, the artist, does a good job of depicting this strange new realm, and I have to wonder where he was getting these images.I have to admit that I was somewhat disheartened by the fact that the story doesn’t wrap up at the end of the graphic novel.  I wouldn’t have wanted to wait month to month for the story to unravel, and thankfully I didn’t wait to pick up the next graphic novel because at the time of this writing the first three are already out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHOG9C4NKQIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008IPBAEY#wasThisHelpful","RNHOG9C4NKQIZ","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years now, Daredevil has been a dark character.  I remember when Frank Miller took over the writing chores of the monthly book way back in the day.  We’d never seen cinematic art like that, and we’d never seen Daredevil portrayed so … mean.  I liked the change.  Daredevil became a must-read book and he was hitting everyone’s radar (yep, that’s a joke!) almost overnight.I enjoyed the run for a while.  I enjoyed Brian Michael Bendis’s time on the character, and Ed Brubaker’s run was a natural follow-up.  Both Bendis and Brubaker went on to write other quality noir stuff, and Brubaker has pretty much made that flavor his standard.But I was, quite frankly, ready for a change.  I didn’t go through the Shadowland premise, but I heard about it.  I was kind of happy to hear Mark Waid picked up the title, but I just hadn’t gotten around to seeing what was going on till lately.If the first graphic novel is any indication, and I’m certain that it is, Daredevil is about to go through a whole new renovation that will leave the character drastically changed, yet true to his roots.Waid is one of those writers that I usually read and enjoy.  I liked what he did on the Hulk and the Fantastic Four and Brave and the Bold, and there have been several other titles he’s written that I loved (Potter’s Field, Ruse, Unknown)!  His run on Indestructible Hulk is a blast.One of the first things you notice immediately is the colorful brightness of the pages.  Visually, the book is a lot different from what Alex Maleev did while working with Bendis.  There’s a lot of WHITE on the pages, lots of open space that let the art breathe and allows the reader to relax and enjoy.  I love the artwork and the visual feel of the pages.  Paolo Rivera and Marcos Martin do an outstanding job of moving the story along and giving dynamic perspectives to Daredevil’s action sequences.  The battle with Captain America was delineated well.I like the fresh take on the series, that Matt Murdock is so high profile that he can’t practice law and ends up counseling clients on how to handle their own court cases.  However, that’s unbelievable, especially when these cases involve such high stakes.  On the other hand, that’s probably more believable than a blind man flipping across rooftops and zip-lining high above the city.  So – okay, I’m all in with it.I wasn’t too happy with Klaw (or a facsimile thereof) being the first villain up in the roster.  Likewise, I wasn’t overly fond of the confrontation between Daredevil and Captain America, but that was true to Marvel roots too.  I remember when Daredevil took on Sub-Mariner way back in issue #7 or the original series (back when DD first broke out the red suit).  That was how Marvel heroes got to know each other back in the day.I did like the way Daredevil took on the Spot at the opening of the first issue.  The battle was pretty cool, filled with action and humor.  The idea of Daredevil kissing the bride was a bit much, in my opinion.  It was a great visual, but when you think about the act, you realize that Matt would know such a thing would be assault and actionable.  Still, the art really makes that pop, so I excuse it.The Klaw arc plays out and leads into a case closer to Matt’s heart:  a young blind man is wrongfully fired from a company where he’s been working.  Of course, that initial incident leads to many others, and a showdown that ends up being both physical and cerebral, showing that Waid understands Matt is both hero and lawyer.I also quite enjoyed the Matt/Foggy sidebar story (see?  Lawyer term!  Bonus).  The health food kick Matt is putting Foggy through is dynamite.  I like it because it shows Matt cares about Foggy, and the two argue and fight like brothers.  Or like two law school students who shared a residence back in the day.There are other plot strings out there, like the assistant district attorney who’s interested in Matt/Daredevil, the fact that Captain America is keeping an eye on Matt, and the potential of all the world’s criminal organizations targeting Daredevil after the events in the graphic novel.  I can’t wait to see what Waid does with them.And I just started reading this series in time for the location to be switched from New York to San Francisco.  That’s an interesting curveball, and like Matt Murdock, I didn’t see it coming!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUYJVTKPGK5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DP1E8KE#wasThisHelpful","RRUYJVTKPGK5H","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author/artist Francesco Francavilla has been on my radar for some time now.  I just didn’t know it.  I loved his covers for the Shadow, Batman, and various other comics titles, but I’d just never bothered to check for his name.  It’s a shame, but I’m an author myself and know many readers just don’t take the time to figure out who the authors/artists are on comics and books.  I try to be more attentive, and do know many of the names, but I miss them occasionally.  Of course, then I find out who they are because they keep pinging my radar, then I go find pretty much everything they’ve done that I think I will like.Francesco Francavilla’s Black Beetle comics are some of those properties I’ll track down in the future.  As graphic novels, though.  I can’t see having to wait month to month, or even every two weeks for the new arc starting this month.  I’d rather have the whole adventure in my hands.The Black Beetle is, unashamedly, cut from pulp cloth.  His adventures could sit right up there beside Doc Savage, the Shadow, the Spider, and the Avenger.  He’s just a man in a costume equipped with some ahead of the times (1940s) technology that’s really cool.  We don’t even know his secret identity, which is a riff right out of the Shadow.  For years those fans didn’t know who the Shadow was because Lamont Cranston was just a false face the Shadow wore.The first adventure really sets the tone as the Black Beetle goes up against Nazi soldiers trying to steal a mysterious lizard statue from the local museum.  Of course, there’s a beautiful young archeologist already working on the statue when they break in.  Truthfully, that whole episode smacked of an Indiana Jones adventure and I loved it for that.  But it did lead me to believe that the Black Beetle was simply interested in archeological things and fighting Nazis.  That’s not true.The Mafia is also one of the Black Beetle’s targets, so he goes after all the bad guys.  In the 1940s, with World War II in full bloom and lots of national crime in the United States, there’s a lot of crime to go around.One of the neat things Francavilla does is show us the Black Beetle’s unmasked faces.  We get to see him, more or less, but it doesn’t matter because we still don’t know who we’re looking at so the secret identity remains intact.The thing I love most of all, though, is Francavilla’s artwork.  The look of the 1940s, of the sewers, of the museum and the artifacts contained there, the style and dress of the people, the speakeasy the Black Beetle drops into to get information, all of these places could have come from film noir.  Francavilla loves American pop culture and it shows.The Black Beetle also goes up against his own costumed foe, and the battle of wits is well done.  The final revelation, when the pieces all come together, is revealed cinematically too.  The puzzle pieces behind the headshots of the Black Beetle and his nemesis are corny in one respect, but man do they fit the overall tone of the book!Francavilla’s added materials in the back of the book are awesome as well.  I loved the ashcans.  They were like looking at advertising materials back from the heyday of Hollywood.I’ve been won over by this book.  It doesn’t break any new ground, it doesn’t go anywhere other books have not gone.  The beauty is that it’s so familiar, like an old hoodie you pull on to lounge around it.  This is comfort reading for pulp and comics and movie enthusiasts.  Pick up a copy and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHHLJ6UUYCKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD65FTE#wasThisHelpful","RZHHLJ6UUYCKM","A1U360OMVQRPUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U360OMVQRPUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 StarsJessie Constable is in her 30's, childless, loveless, and has a mother who is completely off her rocker and pretty much evil.  Due to experiences in her past she has Pteronophobia, a fear of feathers.  Yes, a fear of feathers.  She happens to be somewhat minding her own business one afternoon at the grocery store, well no, she went out of her way to spy on a guy that she has crossed paths with a few times here and there.  He confesses to her that his wife, Becky, has left him, and once Jessie offers to buy some items for the daughter by his side, he suddenly realizes that his son may be left alone at his house and he urgently needs a ride.Being the ever helpful person that she is, Jessie piles them in her car and she is really taken for a ride herself.  They soon learn that his wife ran her car off of the road in an apparent suicide and she somehow takes over the role of being a care-giver for his children.Okay, I was torn with this book.  There were so many reasons why I enjoyed this read and so many reasons why I thought the main character was a bit naive perhaps, but I did like her.  For instance, she just takes off with this guy (Gus King) and his daughter and although he acts bizarre and very rude at times toward her, she puts up with it and starts taking over the role of the children's mother, yes, the one who just died.  His wife just died and he starts coming on to Jessie and I just can't understand why she didn't find that odd in the beginning.  So many strange and quite suspicious scenarios surround her and yet she convinces herself that it isn't what it seems and is always making excuses for him.  I feel that if you just met someone and don't know them, these suspensions would be huge red flags and a reason to get out of there, but when she overlooks them or falls for a man who yells at her quite a bit, it comes across as Jessie is desperate and has no self-respect.Jessie does, however, have a likability to her and therefore I kept reading.  The novel is very well-written and contains the level of suspense that keeps you hanging on for more.  I feel that this book is very original in every sense of the word and the various subplots weave together effortlessly.I would recommend this one for those of you who enjoy suspense and a well constructed novel.  Although I struggled and shouted at the main character when she would do things to disappoint me, it only made me realize that I was completely invested in her story.I received this book through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUS2L0W8UH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMJJX4O#wasThisHelpful","R2WUS2L0W8UH4","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a while since I have found a book that I wanted to read slowly so that I could soak in every detail in hopes that the last page seems to never come.When reading the synopsis of this novel, I never imagined that I would feel so connected to a book where one of the main characters is blind and the other a brilliant young German orphan who was chosen to attend a brutal military academy under Hitler's power using his innate engineering skills.This novel was so much more than the above states.  The idiosyncrasies of each individual character are so well defined and expressed in such ways that come across the page almost lyrically.  I was invited into the pages and could not only imagine the atmosphere, but all of my senses were collectively enticed from the very first page until the last.I was so amazed with the way that the author was able to heighten all my senses in a way that I felt like I knew what it was like to be blind.  In most well-written books you get of a sense of what the characters look like and follow them throughout the book almost as if you are on a voyage, but with this novel, I could imagine what it was like to be in Marie-Laure's shoes.  The descriptives were so beautifully intricate that I could imagine the atmosphere through touch and sound.  It was amazing, really.There were so many different aspects of the book that are lived out in separate moments and in different countries that find a way to unite in the end.  What impressed me most was that I could have never predicted the outcome.  It was as though all cliches were off the table and real life was set in motion.  Life outside of books can be very messy and the author stayed true to life but in a magical and symbolic way.I have said in other reviews that just when I think that I have read my last book centered around the Second World War, another seems to pop up.  I should emphasize that this book created an image of war in a way that I have never imagined before.  I truly got a sense of what it must have been like for children who lived a happy life and then suddenly were on curfew and barely had food to eat.  It also showed the side of young children who are basically brainwashed by Nazi leaders and made into animals who seem to make choices that they normally wouldn't in order to survive.  And by survive, I mean dodging severe abuse by their own colleagues.This book may haunt me for some time.  I can't express enough how beautifully written the pages are.  I highly recommend this read as it is my favorite so far for 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KSJJKOZU1VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7TIG#wasThisHelpful","R20KSJJKOZU1VA","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jersey’s life is flipped upside down, literally, when a massive tornado rips the foundation of her family home in more ways than one. She is left to find a new path in life and with the support (or lack thereof) from complete strangers who happen to be related to her. In this journey, Jersey comes to terms with her life and the role that she has played within it.  Before it is all over, she is then introduced to the other side of her family, still strangers to her, and it is there that she makes a huge transition and learns to accept the life that she has been dealt as well as learning to forgive.I found this book to be very engrossing and definitely worth reading if only to get a realistic glimpse at what life is like in the aftermath of a massive tornado, long after the news cameras stop rolling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7OO1NKUMFFI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXTQSVO#wasThisHelpful","R7OO1NKUMFFI3","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"June: Protagonist and told from her point-of-view is a teenager in the mid-eighties. She struggles to understand her relationship with her gay uncle, who is slowly dying from AIDS. He is her godfather and the apple of his eye. She is confused about her feelings toward him and whether they are even healthy or normal. They both present a unity that is so magnetic that they can basically communicate without saying a word.Greta: June's older sister feels that her uncle, Finn, takes away from the closeness that she and her sister once had. Instead of voicing this, she lets her jealousy boil under the surface and it comes across as resentful, detestable, and detached. She feels pressure from her mother to be the perfect child. Without anyone to lean on, she is falling apart and develops a nasty alcohol habit.Finn: Although he isn't alive through most of this novel, he plays a huge role throughout the entire book. It is basically everyone's relationship with Finn that develops the story.Toby: Is Finn's partner of 9 years until Finn's death. June doesn't even know that he exists purely because her mother is jealous of him as she believes that if it weren't for him that she would still be close with her brother. Toby is the one who gets blamed for so much when he is just trying to get by day-to-day. Although he presents himself as nothing much in life, I find him to be one of the most compelling characters. He takes the brunt of Finn's family issues with AIDS, purely because of his love for Finn. I feel that he is so endearing and treats June with so much love and tenderness and always offering support that he nestled his way into my heart.When June's uncle Finn dies, she learns of Toby's existence. Finn left a note for her to take care of Toby and also told Toby to care for June. Although, at times, June is jealous of Toby's relationship with her uncle she has to learn to accept things the way that they are. They also discover how their time together has slowly helped them through their grieving process. June also discovers that although she had never met Toby before, she really had a connection with him after all and didn't even no it at the time.The title of the book is based on a portrait that Finn painted of June and Greta. As time goes by, just about everyone adds a little something to the painting, and I truly think Finn would have liked it that way since he wanted to portray everyone to their core and not superficially.This is basically a story about jealousy, grief, and overcoming deep wounds to see what is really below the strong emotions. It is also a story about healing and forgiveness. I don't know if it is because I would basically be the same age as June in the 80's, but I really connected to June's character.The characters of this novel are wonderfully developed and I felt as though I knew each character individually and could list off every individual idiosyncrasy of their personalities. I was deeply touched by this book and would say that it is definitely one of my favorites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UK3CFQQIB6O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QPI9ZW#wasThisHelpful","R1UK3CFQQIB6O4","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a small area, on the Eastern side of Texas, there is a town(ship) named Liberty, but don’t let the name fool you, for this town is filled with enough oppression that the name Liberty may seem totally unconceivable. The oppression is not only contrived from the segregation and fear that the “Whites” uphold toward this “Colored” section of Liberty, but the town seems to be possessed by creatures of the evil kind, as the town has voodoo flowing through its veins.Fortunately, there is one man who seems to be a quiet force that others take for cowardice, but he seems to have more bravery to overcome just about anything for a beautiful woman he has loved since he was a child. As an adult she has lost her luster and all remains of any self-respect, for she has been victim of this town’s black magic and sexual explotation for practically her entire life. She knows that she's lost her way, but struggles to find the courage to stand up for her self and other’s that she loves.This is my first giveaway book that I have received and I am so glad that I won it. I was sucked in almost immediately because the characters were so riveting and their situations were so unique that I kept wanting more. I lost track of time the first night that I read this book because I was so wrapped up in this story.“Ruby” moves along at a perfect pace and situations in the book seem to fall into place when I least expected them to, and I love being surprised before I even try to figure things out on my own. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the whole book and how it was able to transport me to another place causing me to lose track of time while reading.The only hang ups that I would have would be that there were several times in the book where people weren’t made clear and there was the use of ‘he’ and ‘she’, and I couldn’t tell who the person was…if I am making sense here myself. And other parts where things jumped around and I got a bit lost and would have to go back to see where it lost me because I felt some things weren’t always very clear.I also was confused how the children were given small dolls to ward off the evil spirits in the beginning and how when Ephram was carrying it to Ruby as an adult and dropped it and it was dusted over by soil. It seemed to be an important part of the story, but then that was it. It wasn’t found or even talked about, so I kind of found that the dolls didn’t add anything to the story but only made me wonder about them the whole time because it was such a focus of the story in the beginning of the book. But these were minor issues compared to the totality of the book.I really enjoyed this read and was sad to see it end. This gets my recommendation all around just for the fact that it held my total attention through the entire read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3T6ORTZCZC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEYN1PM#wasThisHelpful","RU3T6ORTZCZC9","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been bombarded lately with books on war and horror novels that are extremely long, therefore it was refreshing to dive into a comedy with just the right amount of pages so as to not overwhelm. Having lived in Los Angeles at one time, I could relate to the truth underneath all the satire and this, at times, created very hearty laughs from me.Babe Walker is a rich and narcissistic socialite-type who really has nothing better to do with her time but complain about how life is so cruel to her. Just released from Cirque, a rehab facility, she is absolutely sure of one thing and that is living a life of complete Zen (or at least her interpretation of it, which I found rather hilarious).Babe is aware that she has an alter ego who is completely nuts and goes by the name of Babette. She realizes that when she is in the presence of the love of her life, Robert, Babette always makes an unwelcomed appearance. She believes that she could never have a true relationship with Robert like she so desperately wants because she cannot control the other entity that becomes overcommitted and basically psycho.Not long after Babe's return home from her rehab stint, she starts receiving stalker-type messages written in black lipstick on various items. Naturally she is disturbed by this and decides to take a trip to Europe to escape her threatened demise. Unfortunately for Babe, this stalker doesn't give up so easy and seems to always be lurking around the corner. But who could it be?? Well, of course, you have to read the book to find out.This is a book that follows another and I am guessing the previous one included her whole rehab fiasco, but all-in-all this was perfectly fine as a stand alone since most of her past that relates to the present time is recapped.Being satire in nature, of course there were times when I thought, Oh my God, give me a break! and then there were times that I nearly chocked from laughter. There was a balance of both for me so the good and the bad didn't lean one way more than the other really, well until the end, but I will get to that.If you are easily offended by vulgar language or sex related issues told in all bluntness then you will have to steer clear of this one. I am not sensitive to either of those things and at times I would even think, Did she really just say that? Throughout the book, I seriously kept envisioning the MC as being either Paris Hilton or Cher Holowitz from the movie ""Clueless"". I would compare this book's type of satire to ""Clueless"" just to give you an idea of what type of characters that you would read about in this book. Actually I feel that the main character has a little Bridgette Jones naivety to her as well (although it would be the X-rated version).I nearly gave this one a strong 4 stars, merely because it generated so much laughter and shock from me, but there is a part at the end that I was not too keen about. Unfortunately since it is the end and this does have that bit of ""who done it"" involved, I can't divulge too much information. But I will say that I don't like tricky scenarios.Other than that, I enjoyed this book very much for exactly what it was. The over-the-top situations were a nice change from the serious novels I have been reading lately. If you are in need of a good laugh and are not easily offended then this is a must read for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHV1GSRCF1F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7VMU#wasThisHelpful","R3AHV1GSRCF1F4","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It wasn't until I began reading this book that I sincerely thought about life in America during the second World War (outside of school). Automatically when hearing about this period during the second war, my mind goes directly to Europe and the suffering and cruelty that so many people were forced to endure. It's unfathomable, really.But never has my mind been directed to my own homeland, unless discussing the events of Pearl Harbor. Not long after diving into this novel, I spend at least an hour or so zoning out and thinking about how life in America truly was.Of course slavery had been abolished, thank God, but the tensions in the deep south seems so frightful to me. There were black men who were forced to serve in the army to defend a country that would disgrace them and their family and drive fear into their home so that they never truly felt safe. They weren't allowed to be officers and were segregated in the military as well.My mind was spinning with sadness for the human race. Here, we are allies and helping other countries abolish a war of genocide toward the Jewish, while in our own country (our free country), a blind eye was turned when a black person was beaten for the color of their skin. Then of course my mind went to the whole Tuskegee experiment and at some point, I had to put the book down and stop my mind from spinning. Not many books can spark this emotional train-reaction of ideas from my mind very easily.This novel is mostly based around Morris, a white man who served in the war at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked. It was a black man who saved his life and he later discovered that this man (Robert) had perished. Morris was so overcome with grief that he made it his mission to find his family and share with them that their son was a hero.Morris was married and had a child, but he never made plans like the ordinary married man to see his wife and children and seemed, though very slightly obvious, to have resentment toward his wife for getting pregnant and the result being their marriage.His wife, Agnes, wanted nothing but to please her husband and spent many years and many tears trying to pull love from him. She sacrificed her own happiness to try to make his life easy and enjoyable.His lover, Beatrice, was Robert's sister (the war hero Robert). She was black and he was white and society would not allow such things so this was very much a secret. They fell in love when he came to tell the news of her brother being a hero. Beatrice had always lived a life by the standards of the church and seemed to sacrifice herself for the care others, but obviously fell way off that track when she started an affair with Morris.This sounds like a great book, right? I thought so too and it sparked a lot of emotion from me very naturally, but I struggled with this one. I thought that the writing was great and the whole premise, but I absolutely could not connect with anyone in the book.I felt that Morris was with his wife for convienence and should have left her so that she could find a happier life instead of watching her suffer. He literally watched her from his car one night wait for him to arrive for dinner and ultimately fall apart when he didn't show up. Then he was in love with Beatrice, and instead of leaving her alone every time she said that she didn't want to have an affair anymore and allow her to find her own life, he would just show up at her house and pull her right back in. He just came across as stalker-ish to me. It was great that Morris was more progressive in the fact of not seeing someone for their race, but other than that I just felt that he came across as flat and selfish.We all connect to characters differently so this may be my own issue so I definitely would not turn anyone away from reading any book. I just wasn't very invested personally, but I was quite intrigued with their social settings and the background of the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD302UED5KE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8EK9JO#wasThisHelpful","R2SD302UED5KE9","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just when I think I've read enough novels that take place during World War II, another just seems to pop up on the radar.  I am always skeptical because I fear that I've read every single angle of life during this horrific period.Snow on the Tulips, takes place in the Netherlands during the war once the Gestapo have taken over Netherlands passive Dutch army.  There are many men in hiding from being forced to go on work detail and everyone lives in fear, waiting for the Allies to save them.Cornelia's world, bound by fear, is suddenly shaken when she is left to decide the fate of Gerrit Laninga (a Dutch Resistance member) once his execution is botched and he is on the run from the Nazi's.  She has to make the conscious decision to care for and hide this man or send him out the door to face his inevitable death.I enjoyed this book immensely.  I felt drawn into the life of Cornelia, her family, and Gerrit.  The only reason why I didn't give this novel five stars is because I was left with wanting more and not really feeling like the book was final.  But then again, anytime I read a good novel, I am always left wanting more!  ""Snow on the Tulips"" is satisfying as a whole and I highly recommend this historical fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWOFTE3AENK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7QRBD0#wasThisHelpful","R3AWOFTE3AENK","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ben is living the dream of most thirteen-year-old boys. His babysitter (although he realizes that he doesn’t need one) who is four years his senior, seems to be showering him with attention since the death of his best friend and also the death of his tormentor. (The deaths should probably be omitted from that dream I just mentioned)I have been on a kick this year to read books that frighten me. I guess I need a little excitement in my life or something. Although I wouldn’t consider this read to be frightening, it is dark. And that is plenty of excitement for me.I find it challenging to write reviews for novella’s as they are short and it’s hard to give hearty feedback without giving it all away. What I can say is that this piece was very well-written. I felt engaged with the main character and could really get a sense of the turmoil and confusion that he was dealing with. This story was well-crafted and I recommend for those looking for that dark, coming-of-age type of read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODLAQFBZD26Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8V114C#wasThisHelpful","R2ODLAQFBZD26Y","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can you imagine being in such a frightful shock that you don’t know who you are or where you came from?  Now imagine that scenario as an orphaned 7-year-old indentured servant, with an Irish accent unlike the thick southern one that you can barely understand that surrounds you.This is the terrifying realization for Lavinia, who was thrust to work the house kitchen with other slaves in the late 1700’s in Virginia.  Feeling isolated and confused, her fellow slaves open there arms to this sad girl, when she is ready, and take her in as though she were one of their own.In time she comes to accept them, but she is constantly put in the middle of deciding to choose her new family and being indentured for the rest of her life or for education and freedom.  One would think education and freedom, but with that come other costs.  Once a free white woman she would not be able to share the family bond that she so cherished with her fellow slaves, at least not openly.I had a hard time putting this one down and its story has remained with me since finishing.  The characters were so tangible for me that I honestly had the most realistic dream last night that I was there and I loved these people.  I litereally felt like I was a part of the book, stuck in the pages and living the life of Lavinia.  The characters had so much depth that they just took me along with them.The only downside for me was I had a hard time understanding one of the characters.  He seemed to have been traumatized as a child but the situations surrounding him were not very clear nor were his motives.  But I will say that it didn’t take away from the intensity of the book for me.  I had absolutely no problems looking over this bit of confusion and just came up with my own ideas.  This can be seen as a positive, however, because it intensified my engagement toward the book.I feel like I am better for having read this novel and that is pretty miraculous in itself.  I highly recommend this exceptional book about love, acceptance, and loyalty.  Yes, there was also deceit, hate, and fear, but that wasn’t the focus for me nor do I think that it was intended for that purpose.  I feel the negativity in this story was strong in exposing how love conquers all the nasty emotions.  This one softened that part of my heart that can sometimes become a bit hard and for that I am forever grateful for having read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I4EQ0V4K8AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034DGPEU#wasThisHelpful","R37I4EQ0V4K8AR","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I so much enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  I would definitely recommend this book for those who enjoy historical fiction and connecting with the character.In this book, the main character wants to live a glamorous life yet still provide for her family back home.  She, as well as the rest of her family, are not very good at budgeting money and she is always on the hunt to be a kept woman, yet she struggled to be free.The story begins with the main character, whom went by many aliases, going to court from a close girlfriend who felt that she was taken advantage of and stripped of all of her savings.  It switches back and forth from the court room to her telling the true story of her life in first person.  Although she is basically a money grubbing woman who uses her looks to get what she wants, she manages to suck you into her story so that you find yourself rooting for her and wanting her to get it together and find some luck.  You can't help but feel that she really is trying to live a good life, but as soon as she settles into a good life, there is an investigator who steps in and shames her into leaving.  And because of these instances ruining her chances of living a good life, she ends up going back to her gold-digging ways.I was pleased to find out after reading the book that the main character was a real person which somehow makes the book even better for me because I feel like I really connected with her and wanted her to make it in life, fair and square.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMYH0F4L985I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QLXPXY#wasThisHelpful","RMMYH0F4L985I","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I feel that I knew these characters well and had a hard time forgetting them after I finished the book.The Interestings is based mainly on a girl who came from a middle class life who, through a scholarship, is emerged in the life of the very wealthy, by friendships.  She is welcomed into a group of six and learns to deal with life as a meager middle class citizen is close friends with a very wealthy couple.  She struggles with jealously, sometimes regret, and wondering if she is really a vital person in an on-going friendship or if she is just being strung along like a puppet for her best friends needs.I gave this book four stars not for the plot so much but mainly for character development as I felt very connected to each of the main characters of the book.  I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys connecting to characters and likes getting lost in their world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLUHXLVSZ2POD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U4HH54#wasThisHelpful","RLUHXLVSZ2POD","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am editing this review because I have had plenty of time to use this product.  I have to say that I wish that I held out for a different keyboard because I have found that sometimes the keyboard lagss and then types double letters like it just did when I typed the word lags.  But in more casses then not it doubles up more letters in a row.  Sso, there you go you cann see it for yoursellf how my keyboard works.  I either gott a lemon forr a keyboard or the productt all together is bad.I like the feel of the keyboard and once I got used to the mechanics of propping it at the right angle I was very happy.  The main problem that I have is the arrow keys don't work with any of my apps.  I use my Kindle app a lot or iBooks and I can't even turn the pages with the arrows so I have to touch the screen which really makes the keyboard pointless.  I can't scroll up and down in my other apps and it is sooo frustrating!!  Are the arrow keys just for looks, I don't get it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR58NTQSMZHIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET9YYS2#wasThisHelpful","RR58NTQSMZHIA","A3GAXYEFLAKGH6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GAXYEFLAKGH6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an extremely versatile light that can be used as a headlamp or clipped directly onto your body for other uses. It's small, similar to a black diamond touch-on headlamp, but uses physical buttons. The light is not suitable for hiking, but is perfect for working on tasks close up, as the light is not overpoweringly bright, but is still enough to see clearly.The best part about the lamp is that it is rechargeable via usb cable, which means I can charge it on the go as I have an external battery, and not have to carry spare batteries everywhere. The battery life is very decent as well, I've used this on numerous tasks in the garage and under the sink for long periods of time for my winterization prep without any issues.The order is shipped with a cable and USB charging port, both separate from the actual Nitecore headlamp by the seller.I received a discounted price on this in exchange for an unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJMYX5XMO234/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DDCFNW#wasThisHelpful","R2QJMYX5XMO234","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great kitchen clean-up towels. A 13 pack will last me two weeks for constantly cleaning up in the kitchen for food prep, spills, general cleaning and wipe-down after a day's worth of cooking meals. The towels are no-frills, large towels that can wipe down and hold up to some serious use on a constant basis. I keep a small bin to toss the used towels in, and wash them on warm/cold cycles with bleach before drying on low heat for a half cycle and hanging for the rest to prevent shrinkage over time.

"I didn't use this for a SUP, but rather a wave cresting kayak design from the early 90's during a refit project.My kayak has no trekking fins, and so it tends to spin around if you're not paying careful attention to your strokes. To fix this, I purchased this single fin, and cut it down significantly (about 4 inches remaining) into a stubby fin. I added a connection platform to easily insert and remove the fin from the boat for transportation ease and the whole thing treks much more solidly now when in the water.This is good, dense and non-brittle plastic that can take a beating against rocks, sand and pebbles easily.

"This is an interesting pair of shears that we've been using to trim our apple trees before the winter.The premise is that you cut through chunk by chunk with a ratchet style shear, meaning each time it clicks and you reset the blade, you're getting more leverage out of the strength you put into the squeeze.Think of it like riding a single speed bike versus a bike with several gears. The bike with more gears is more versatile because it lets you bike up hills more easily. This is the same idea with these shears. It really did make things easier to cut, though getting used to the ratcheting portion took a while. After about a month of using them, they are still holding up well. The blades do dull quickly, so I've had to sharpen several times, but otherwise they work well for medium-duty pruning jobs, up to one inch in diameter.I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35M53RMWMZW54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH9TS9G#wasThisHelpful","R35M53RMWMZW54","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had originally used it temporarily as a gaming mouse at home, but ended up bringing it to the office to replace my wired Logitech mouse that was starting to show its age. This has held up wonderfully, and after several weeks I have also noticed the clicking is softer and the wheel movement much more smooth.This is basically a logitech mouse design with a smaller profile, wireless and lightweight.

"This is a simple, nearly universal and robust design that can fit nearly any toilet in just a few minutes. Make sure you have a wrench to unscrew the nuts, and secure it properly again after installing.The anchor point that goes below the seat is much thicker than I had anticipated, as a result my toilet seat sits at a slightly obtrusive angle. I may purchase mounts so it sits evenly again, but for now it's not too bad.The spray is activated by the knob on the side, working like a spigot. Turn it to open and the water comes through and does its job. When you're satisfied with the care, you shut it off again and the spray springs back into its closure. Very hygienic and very easy to use.While I do like this unit and think it works admirably well, I did have to remove a star due to the thick mounting plate.

The previous owner of my house owned a cat, and we found old stains related to her cat vomiting or other random oddities. While gross, we used bacterial cleansers on those areas (and to our horror saw they were completely ineffective).I did have a dog at one point, and the areas he peed by accident definitely get picked up by this light.

The cutting action is SMOOTH. Scissors are razor sharp, and you can adjust the speed they cut at with a turning knob on the side. Right means more pressure and slower cut, left opens it up for quick snips.I wipe down with a damp towel, then buff with a clean towel after to keep it in good shape.

"Good, musky beard oil that comes with a dropper. I can't tell you how important it is to have a dropper when it comes to oil products! Everything is so much cleaner, and you can be precise with your usage.This bottle will last you a long time, depending on how big your beard is. The dropper lets you limit your use, and that's good because the oil IS scented, and you don't want to to be overpowering to yourself and others. I think it works well, it does not gum up like some other oils, and lasts the full day, washes out well and is generally very little hassle.

You can even store food in this and hoist it up in the air to protect from wildlife. I have a similar bag by Sea to Summit that is nearly the exact same quality, but you can bet the price was much higher, with the difference of only a few hard sealed hardpoints for attachments.The bag rolls up via friction clamping, so air leaks out a little over time, but it is hard for water to leak in. This bag can easily take on rain, is submersible at times and will float indefinitely, the seams are sealed tight, and the bag is THICK. You can throw tools in this thing without buffers and it wouldn't mind (though I don't recommend it due to longevity fears). The yellow is great for locating in the dark.

"I was ecstatic to be able to purchase this for my friend, who is just about five months pregnant. She had originally purchased a tiny one since she has a petite frame, however it quickly became obvious that it was not good enough for her - it was literally a kid's sized pillow. This one is full size, capable of probably comfortably fitting someone up to 5'10"" comfortably on it with its many uses.The pillow DOES come with a case, a zipper style that opens up a very large opening, which is perfect for those who will bother washing the outside for the drool and oils that deposit themselves each night. Not sure why they decided to make the pillows white, but whatever.The pillows DO arrive completely smashed into a tiny box- open it up, fluff it up and pay special attention to the center, where it's completely crushed in. After a few hours of rest the pillow should be at its full size.My friend really does like this, she sleeps with her head in one of the nooks, her back to the long portion (to keep her from shifting onto her back, this was a huge issue for her) and the bottom loop between her legs for support.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6VB6IHKH0BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153X1M14#wasThisHelpful","RP6VB6IHKH0BY","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm disappointed in the knife, and Kershaw in general. The photos are not particularly accurate - the handle is more brightly teal in person than compared to the photos, and feels very brittle and cheaply molded. My knife had a substantial burr of plastic sticking out on the locking mechanism that I had to shave away before I could even close the knife without it cutting into my finger. I would have liked this better if the handles were slightly rubberized.The blade itself is okay - it's sharp, but nothing stunningly so. Paper does not slice cleanly out of the box, and so to achieve the razor sharpness, a run through another sharpener would be required.I decided to return the knife back after only a day; this knife is not up to par with Kershaw's usual quality. I have a Ken Onion and Skyline to my name, and they are much better quality than the Shuffle. Then again, this blade is under $20, so I understand that corners had to be cut.

"I gave this set to my parents to use as they've gone almost a full decade without a decent paring knife, and their peelers are laughably ancient. The difference it makes for their food prep is astonishing. I no longer have to worry that they'll cut themselves doing fine work on their food prep with large and dull, unwieldy stamped knives, compared to the sharpness of ceramic knives.A quick warning about ceramic wares, NEVER use the flat side of the blade (eg crushing garlic), NEVER reuse the knife if it drops to the floor, even if it looks okay. Microfractures can occur, and a catastrophic failure in the knife can happen at any time while in use, causing the knife to shatter. That's the last thing you want to happen while cutting veggies.The quality of both knife and peeler are good. The handles are cheapish plastic, but the ceramic blades are sharp, well polished and sell formed. The knife cuts through vegetables and fruits cleanly and effortlessly, and the fruit peeler can get through apples and potatoes really fast. Both are easy to wash, even in the dishwasher (but rinse them first to remove solid residues, those tend to like to stick to ceramic)I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KSD2LE3MDU4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Q70AHM#wasThisHelpful","R2KSD2LE3MDU4B","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used Shibari, or better yet, Liquid Silk in the past but was offered to try out the Luxx Beauty lubricant.The immediate difference between this is that it is more 'runny' initially compared to Shibari, which has a more silky, grippy texture. This changes quickly as it goes from liquidy to tacky after just a few minutes, as though it is absorbing and just leaving behind the rest of the ingredients. No reapplication was required, however I felt more friction than I was accustomed to compared to LS or Shibari.While LS is unavailable cheaply in the US still, I think I still prefer Shibari over the Luxxx.One nice thing to note, while Shibari always arrives leaking, this one arrived completely dry with no issues. It is also more discrete than shibari or LS, so I'm not as concerned with its storage.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDAVZ9PM1AG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YSPGNS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDAVZ9PM1AG9","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent product. It's hard to switch back between one or another quickly, as the entry-ways close up quick. In terms of lubrication retention, the ribbed interrior does help keep lube in place, but near the entrance starts to get clingy only after a few minutes, requiring re-lube which takes away from the act.In terms of comfort, I would say this is average or below, I am still a fan of the Tenga flips, as nothing else so far has compared to them so far.

"This is a very cheap and disappointing product. The design and concept is great - a joystick and pad that can switch from game mode to regular pointer mode.

"I received the queen sized gray sheets, and holy crap. Out of the bag they were incredibly soft, but I still went ahead to wash them on cold, and tumble dry on low heat for 40 minutes with wool balls. When they came out, they were even softer and a little ""fluffy"" feeling. The fit was fine (I have a 6 inch mattress with a 2 inch memory foam pad) with the fitted sheet, my pillows (bamboo covered shredded foam) are standard size, so they actually were a little dwarfed by the pillow case. As a reminder, you only get TWO pillow cases. Not sure why the photo shows four. You will get a fitted sheet, standard sheet and two pillow cases in the package.Sleeping in this is crazy luxurious. I did not have super high expectations, so this was beyond what I was expecting. My previous sheets are from Target, and now I'm considering getting a second one two swap around with. These are cool initially, but become appreciably warm after you've settled in, which will be much enjoyed during the winter. I think the gray color looks really urban and modern.

"It's taken me a while (a long while) but I've finally found an external battery pack that actually charges to full capacity in a reasonable amount of time.Most other external batteries do NOT charge fully, and their charging indicators flash for hours at a time. The EasyAcc battery here arrived full, and after discharging it across my devices (simultaneously charging a OnePlus One, Nexus 7 2nd Gen and Fire Phone!) it charged up in a few hours to full capacity again. Not bad at all.The batteries in this are flat pack li-ions, a higher quality than stuffing in several 18650 cells into an enclosure with a board and calling it a day, this is an actual quality external battery pack.There is only one button to press, which shows the charge on a very small set of LED lights. Apart from that, the entire thing is just smooth plastic (which scuffs easily, mind you, and I doubt if it has ANY IPX rating) which is sleek new, but has gathered quite a bit of minor scuffing from going in and out of my backpack and one overnight trip so far. This will replace my Sentey 20800mah battery, as it is lighter by about 30% and has a smaller footprint, with a still-respectable battery capacity, which will easily last a weekend of hiking.

"Everyone already knows the pro's to this monitor. I know them very well, as I am using it right now. It's a beautiful monitor, and while I was hesitant about the price, what with all prices falling quickly for non-freesync variants, I think it is well worth it.That said, let me outline issues people may/will encounter using this monitor. For reference, I am on Windows 10, Radeon HD7950 (upgrading to R9 390 for freesync!)1 - If you have a 79xx GPU, freesync will NOT work. You will need to either downgrade or upgrade to a compatible card. Freesync is only compatible with those cards for video playback, gaming will not work. Learned this the hard way, to read better.2 - When my computer goes to sleep, all the windows resize to around 800x600 resolution and get jammed up into the top left. Not sure why this happens. The monitor also starts searching for an active input, which could explain the issues. I have not yet looked to see if I can disable auto-scan functions.3 - Loud humming noise in game mode, or other variants. The monitor makes a concerning humming noise when I switch into game mode. I switched out quickly, and will troubleshoot this further to see if it's just a glitch or a defect.4 - The stand is huge. I have almost 10 inches of space between the back of the monitor and my wall. My desk is shallow, so it takes up a lot of my available space.5 - If you don't sit at a perfect distance, the edge pixels actually overlay the bezel, from the curve. It's a weird and disorienting sensation.That said, I absolutely LOVE this monitor in spite of all the imperfections. I am coming from 3x 26.5"" 1200p monitors, and this feels so much cleaner on my desk. It's an absolute beauty, and the real estate is fantastic. Gaming has never been as beautiful to me as it is using this monitor. I used my 3x monitor setup since 2008, who knows how long I'll keep this one? It's certainly the holy grail of monitors right now, unless you're an nvidia card user, in which case you should look at the ROG G-sync tech instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TGB15TNZLC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111MRT90#wasThisHelpful","R26TGB15TNZLC9","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my first aid kit to keep in my car. We tested it out several times on ourselves with decent results. The build quality itself is nothing particularly special- in fact, the unit feels incredibly cheap, and opening the clamp makes me worried the whole thing will fall apart. That said, it did NOT fall apart, and the readings were accurate enough for the unit to qualify going into my car's med kit. It IS larger than I had anticipated, especially with the silicon cover, however I had the space, so there it goes.The LED screen is crisp, though the ""waves"" at the bottom almost seem gimmicky, I suppose it's more of just a visual cue for patterns than anything else.

"Solid oil diffuser. One common misconception is that the steam is all oil - this is untrue, and if you think otherwise, make sure you read the instructions prior to use, or you'll likely destroy your diffuser in one go.The light diffuser stands out from others in that it can change colors, is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and has a built in timer, letting you control how long it should run for, and what ""mood"" to set with the lights. I thought it would be gimmicky, but being able to switch from soft yellow to cool blue (I don't care much for the other colors) is really nice. The aroma was able to waft through an entire room (helped by people passing through the area to blow the scent around). The smell disappears quickly enough, though I make sure to air out the floor before the end of the day so there's no residue left.A BIG warning, do NOT use this on top of fabric or wood. You will damage it via moisture. Instead, elevate it on a plate, piece of tile, or put it on plastic/glass/tile counters. Do NOT use it near walls or under cabinets.

"KEEP MOIST!That's the key to keeping this towel working. I use it to pat down my car after washing, before I do my wax. This towel will become dry and brittle if you do not keep it lightly moistened. For storing, I highly suggest wringing it out gently, then folding it back up and inserting into the storage container and closing it tightly. This will prevent the towel from drying out, and will lock in the moisture.I am able to pat down my entire car (Audi Q5) with only one stop to wring the towel. This thing can soak up a ridiculous mount of water. I don't use it for any other purpose than to PAT down my car, so it stays relatively clean, and does not require any cleaning.

"First things first - this is nothing more than an air spray with a hissing adapter stuffed into the nozzle. Yes, the hissing is loud, but it's nothing particularly special, and sounds nothing like what an animal would do to hiss. If anything, it's the high pitched and suddenly loud noise that gets the animal's attention, coupled by the knowledge that it was caught that will prevent the animal from continuing its behavior.That said, this was completely ineffective against my sister's British shorthair, one year of age. He jumped up onto the counter (a big no-no in their house) so they tried the hissing noise - he looked up briefly, bored, before resuming his adventure on the table. We were eventually forced to get up and forcibly remove him by hand. We tried twice more, spaced out in intervals, and the last one he hardly even looked back at us with the hisser.This product seems to have worked for a lot of people, but it did not work at all for me. If your pet is jumpy or easily startled, I guess it might work for you, otherwise don't bother.

"The pictures for these things don't show just how versatile these nanogrids are. I purchased my set from REI during a garage sale, and am absolutely blown away at how useful they are. Granted, I have  plenty of misgivings, but the product itself is really great, and I'm surprised there aren't as many reviews for this product right now. I will break it up into a review about the lantern, and then a review about the puck lights.LANTERN:This is a good, solid lantern with full 360 degree lighting capability, hanging, and a dual-LED flashlight beam. The color is slightly warmer (not as warm as SnowPeak's lanterns but still pleasant to sit under at night) and extremely bright. You can control the brightness by pressing and holding the proper button. There are several buttons you can use to control it - lantern, flashlight, auxiliary lights, and toggle all. The toggle also acts as a full-stop and lock button, you can turn off everything by pressing it, and lock the lamp by holding for several seconds to conserve battery and prevent accidentally turning the light on.The flaps that cover the USB and auxiliary power ports have issues. Over time, the port cover for the auxiliary lights comes loose, and does not close over the port properly. It also is at great risk of short circuiting if it rains, so make sure you take it down if clouds start coming up, and beware of condensation if you plan to leave it up overnight while camping.THE PUCKS:You receive two pucks, that close up together using magnets and anchor points. Each puck comes with 20 feet of cable, and you can string them out. There is a little wire clip attached to the wires where you can build anchor points and loop points. the puck also comes with a cut-out to insert the wire, allowing you to hang them like ceiling lights, either at an angle or straight down (there are cutouts showing you where to insert the wire to to achieve these effects). They're really well thought-out. You can add up to four pucks without degrading the battery life of the lantern, which is really impressive as the light output is significant. My only gripe about these is that the light is much colder, pure white than the original lamp. Would have liked consistent lighting across all three lights.OVERALL:The battery life is really great. There's a 4,200mah capacity within this lamp (I'm assuming by the shape it's 2x 18650 batteries inside the lamp), and I am able to run all three lights concurrently at 18 hours nonstop, which is more than enough charge to last you a weekend of camping. You can even charge the lamp with an external battery concurrently, at approximately 225mAh per hour runtime. So say if you have a standard 6,000mah external battery plugged into this thing at max charge, you could potentially get 18 hours internal + 26 additional hours from the external battery. That's a LOT of light.The lamp is compact, against my Rayovac, my black diamonds and colemans, my chinese generics and so forth, but is easily more versatile than any of them put together. Hopefully BioLite will continue the development of this system and come out with a more polished product in the near future. This is a great start to a really interesting product, but should by no means be considered the zenith of its capability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8WZPS0XDPGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCE7Y1C#wasThisHelpful","R2A8WZPS0XDPGO","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this to replace our ailing 7 year old water boiler. Zojirushi water heaters are the best in terms of performance and longevity, with due care of course. This model brings water up to 208 degrees in just a few minutes after pouting in 3 liters of water. It announces that it is complete with a quick song, which can be disabled (we disabled it after the first day..)You have two methods of pouring. One is regular, the other is slow. This lets you get out a pot of hot water in seconds, or just enough to measure out specific amounts. You can also change the temperature on the fly, or temporarily turn off the heating elements (Eg overnight) to save power.This is truly a staple in my household now, as I've had one since my early college days.Just a note, make sure you keep the unit filled at all times when it's on.

"This seat cushion brings new life to my office chair. It's ridiculously plush yet firm, and after settling down in it, I find myself perfectly comfortable at my desk. I also no longer slide along the seat into a horrible slouching position over time, which is a good bonus (though now I just slouch towards the screen in a slow hunching motion). I chose not to get the lighter color, so it would last longer against messes and be easier to clean/maintain, and when I'm not at my desk it's hard to notice it's even there.This is my second seat cushion. The first one I did not maintain as well, and so the foam finally gave up the ghost and began sagging into oblivion. To improve the lifespan of memory foam, be sure to fluff it up every few days to push fresh air into the foam again, otherwise the internal structure begins to collapse and stick to one another, losing the fluffiness of the foam.

"Excellent sunshade, privacy screen and heat/light reflector all in one.The sunshade fits my Audi Q5 easily. It comes packed in a tiny carry sack, and instantly unfurls into a double circle reflector. It is black on the other side. The top corners tend to sag, so you have to press the material into the glass and push into the corners. Takes a little work and you'll need to have someone in the passenger side do theirs, or go there yourself. The material does not harm my leather dash, though after a full day in the sun the car can use some airing out. Not a big deal, as the smell does not stick.Folding up is also easy, and the carry sack not so ridiculously small that you can't put the folded up screen back in.This is much more preferable than the accordian style sunshades. For one thing, those ones do not fit flush up against the windshield, take up a lot of space, and are hard to secure. This one uses tension from the windshield border to stay held up against the car, is super light and can even fit in larger glove boxes if need be. The light and heat reflection efficiency is great.

"After an unfortunate incident of losing my gym bag, I was forced to pick up another one of these jump ropes. I was offered another for free in exchange for a review, and was excited to take them up on the offer. Up to date, the gyrating portion of the handle was always plastic, and this one appeared to be made of steel, which is more durable and would offer less resistance while spinning.Performance ended up being the same upon arrival - quick successive double-unders with no issues. This one came with a very nice carry bag that I could wind up the cabling and toss into here without it unspooling all over the inside of my bag. Handles continue to be small, but it's not an issue since not much grip is necessary given how smoothly the cable rotates in the bearings.Out of all the ropes I have reviewed, this one is likely my favorite. The build quality and attention to detail is great, the bag is just the perfect fit (though you have to make sure you know the coil size or it'll end up not fitting well) and the included cable is generous enough to let taller people use it (and is easily cut down for shorter people to use).I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199F7FP9LUWB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIQ3VWM#wasThisHelpful","R199F7FP9LUWB1","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good, solid shemagh scarf. I wouldn't say that it's on the edge of 'tactical' in terms of durability, but for every day use or light camping, it will do well.I'm only giving this scarf four stars, as several of the knots on mine arrived undone, and the scarf had frayed at the edges as a result. I had to cut off the excess and retie it all. This is not such a big deal if you're a patient person, but can be irksome nonetheless.The color I got was Black/Tan, and it looked exactly like the photo. It's VERY large sheet you receive - over 40 inches to a side. Other reviewers confirm the same thing, this is fairly large, and lightweight to boot.Another thing, if you're using this with a tactical backpack with lots of velcro, be careful as this scarf will stick to the adhesive side and pull threads unless you're very careful.I used this for camping, both to keep mosquitoes off my head, and then lightly over my face to keep it warm while I was in my sleeping bag. Because it's such a thin cloth, there was no condensation, but it kept in warm air from my breath while I slept, without being cloying like a blanket or ruining my hair like a beanie. Was a good experience being able to utilize something with so many functions.I may also use this as a simple ground cover on grass next spring, but I am not yet sure how well it will hold up to a wash.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KGNFVZLA4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UMO3A6#wasThisHelpful","R11KGNFVZLA4G","A1MFVAHTT2BHM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFVAHTT2BHM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I was saving money by buying the store brand lens cleaner for years.  After all they have the same active ingredients...right?  Wrong!  After a case of blepharitis, I decided to do some research.  All cleaners are NOT created equal.

"I just bought another of these condos and was so impressed that I ordered another.  Was disappointed right away when we took it out of the box because the carpet is totally different than the other one I got.  My cat noticed too and doesn't want anything to do with it.  That's OK with me too because the second stair is defective in the front and carpet doesn't meet together right.  If she liked it I would probably have cut it off but was hesitant to do that for fear of ruining it because it would have also needing some gluing involved.  Anyway, Abby did fit on the top stair the one time she checked it out but she is small at only 6# 11 oz's.  Not sure about a big cat? I wish the carpet would have been the same type though because she goes to the other tree and immediately starts scratching it...not this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CS0D737878TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBBPKJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2CS0D737878TK","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do have to admit that I am super picky, almost as much as my diva kitty, when it comes to pet supplies.  This tree meets my expectations.  It is solid and well made and Abigail started checking it out as soon as I pulled it out of the box.  By the way, also loved that it was completely assembled!  The carpet isn't as thick as ones I had bought previously from Dr. Foster and Smith, but those ones are double the price too.  Also it is the perfect window height for my fur baby to watch the birds at our many birdhouses in our backyard.  A total winner here.  I ordered another one with a little different configuration that is coming tomorrow for our living room.  Yes, it looks that nice. Yea!!!  She is scratching the carpet on the posts!!!!  Up til now, it has been our carpet or the furniture.  She let me know she was not going to scratch cardboard or even sisel so this is perfect.  Love it and worth every penny!  OMG! I just looked at her and she is on one of the cradles.  How cute is that?!UPDATE: I had to come back and change my review.  Initially I had given this 5 stars but it is 8-31-15 now and the posts are falling apart with only one little kitty that doesn't scratch nearly as powerful as other cats we have had.  Never have we had one fall apart like this!  Never.  I contacted the company and heard back from Robert right away, at first but now nothing.  Very disappointed in this tree and would definitely not recommend it.  Go to Drs Foster and smith and get a better one that lasts for years.UPDATE: 9-2 I heard back from Robert again and they are sending me a replacement tree so I was happy with that.  Hopefully the new one will wear better than this last one.  Just in the week or so since I have written to the company, there are more holes in the carpet and exposed wood.  I did up the stars to 3 since the customer service is good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCG6QKJX3MEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBBP0O8#wasThisHelpful","R2VCG6QKJX3MEK","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The top has the holes in it so she would not be able to sit on it and scratch without her leg going through.

Today I used this for the first time and I almost forgot to use lotion after my shower!  Plus, I have used other soaps or gels that seem creamy, although not like this, but left a film in the shower which means it did on my skin as well.

Amazon made it right for me and I tossed the whole ziplock of bags.  I will never order this brand of tea again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KR3SI5WS7TRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00542YNOI#wasThisHelpful","R2KR3SI5WS7TRJ","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got this and started it yesterday.  You simply can't go wrong with a Wysocki puzzle.  Always quality and pictures are fun to work.  Nice thickness in pieces that stay together and lay flat until you are ready to take it apart.  Love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IG7MQ8R05EI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMYDUVK#wasThisHelpful","R3IG7MQ8R05EI8","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
