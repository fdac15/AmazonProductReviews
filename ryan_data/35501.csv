"This comprehensive 3 CD collection of Gerry Rafferty recordings should not leave any doubt in the listener that Rafferty was very fine songwriter; who at times wrote some great outstanding songs. The reason he never reached sustained star status,  may be due to his vocals which often appear a little too ""nice"" and rarely come out daring or just slightly provocative. He voice is by no means weak or bad and it can recall both Emitt Rhodes and Rick Nelson to your mind. Rafferty's personal image was in many ways reminiscent  of his vocal; the nice and comfy. Paradoxically, when you consider that Rafferty private life often was marked by major personal problems.Rafferty's first golden period was with the group Stealers Wheel with whom he released three albums. Logically, this CD collection leaves room for this period with six songs from the excellent debut album, especially remembered for ""Stuck in the Middle"" and ""Late Again"". The also excellent second album ""Ferguslie Park"" contributes five songs while the last, and slightly paler album, ""Right or Wrong"" makes do with three songs.From Rafferty's long solo career much emphasis is put on the classic and well-rounded album ""City to City"", which even contains the classic ""Baker Street"". There are fine songs on all Rafferty's other albums, but the only threat for the title of the best must be ""North and South"" from 1988, which also contributes with six tracks.Among the later and lesser-known albums ""Over My Head"" is also worth noting; not least because of the Marshall Crenshaw like ""The Girl's Got No Confidence"".The earliest songs recorded with the group ""Humblebums"" are quite good, but may appear a little fresh and unfinished; Rafferty also chose to re-record several of these songs for later albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IW1P1EMUKV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K9HIZ2#wasThisHelpful","R11IW1P1EMUKV3","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new 5 CD box with the Kinks covers only their Pye period from 1964 to 1971. Many may wonder how there may be need for yet another compilation/box with the Kinks. The answer to this question I will leave up to the individual music listener, and simply note that I personally am very pleased with the release. As other reviewers have noted, the packaging is not particularly convenient for keeping the CDs ngood shape, but it is quite handy and containing a nice colorful book with important information about the individual tracks.To protect CDs from the very narrow cardboard pockets, I recommend that you get for them five seperate jewel-cases.The music is, of course, excellent, and many tracks are found in new clearer mixes giving them a more open sound.There are several previously unreleased tracks and various other rarities distributed over all five CDs which are chronologically set up.For me, the biggest scoops are ""Pictures in the Sand"" for the first time here on CD in the vocal version. Also 'Till Death Us Do Part' has not previously been released on CD. Most tracks from the legendary collection ""The Great Lost Kinks""are incidentally included. Also ""Did You See His Name"" from ""The Kinks Kronikles"" is here with an alternative ending.Some tracks contain a little studio chatter, and there is an interview with the group from 1964 and one with Ray Davies from 1968, where he talks about ""The Village Green Preservation Society"".For new fans of the group, this must be a treasure trove of fine music, from one of the greatest acts of the 1960s; I will not hesitate to equate them with the Beatles, while connoisseurs of the group will be able to enjoy the previously mentioned rarities while getting an opportunity to re-consult the many great songs Ray Davies wrote during this incredibly creative period of his career.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYV4X8ABDO3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJADEJ2#wasThisHelpful","RQYV4X8ABDO3V","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first impression of ""Ghost Stories"" was that it was actuall a very nice album, but also a little uninteresting. Besides the single ""Magic"", which I had heard a few times before, there were not really any songs that really hit me. But, as is so often the case with Coldplay's music, the songs grow on closer acquaintance.Without being right up the side of the group's greatest albums ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" and ""Viva la Vida"" this is still a very nice and also a rather subdued album. The album starts off nicely with four strong songs with ""Ink"" as my immediate favorite. After these the albud loses the a little momentum and it not until ""A Sky Full Of Stars"" that it for a short while regains power. So, granted; a few numbers are actually a little boring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Y447S47XVBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQE4NUK#wasThisHelpful","R18Y447S47XVBU","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the American version of The Small Faces' first Immediate album. As was often the practice at thetime, the precaution was taken in America to ensure that the artists’  singles were includes on the albums and moreover there were often fewer numbers on these albums. This meant that in several cases more albums could be released than in Europe. This phenomenon is known from many of the greatest acts of the time like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Kinks. Whether there was similar ulterior motives behind this Small Faces release is uncertain;  in any case, there were no extra Small Faces albums released, although actually only 12 tracks were put on ""There Are But Four Small Faces"" and seven tracks from the European version were omitted.At any rate, ""There Are But Four Small Faces"" is a great album; one of the greats of this era. The three singles ""Tin Soldier"", ""Here Come the Nice"" and ""Itchycoo Park"" are great classics, and the two B-sides ""I'm Only Dreaming"" and ""I Feel Much Better"", which were not included on the European version, are both charming psych-pop mixed with a good portion soul. This applies by the way to the whole album, where no tracks fall through.But is there really a need for this release when now all tracks are also found on the deluxe edition of the European album. Maybe not – but personally as a big fan of the group, I think it is fine and lovely addition to the music collection and to a very reasonable price.  Some bonus tracks are previously unreleased versions or at least hard to find.There are both a stereo and mono CD, and in some case there are quite marked differences between the two versions. Also a fine booklet with relevant and interesting information. And yes, the music some great – as crystal clear as it gets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P1VKCU1B0T3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJX4GB4#wasThisHelpful","R2P1VKCU1B0T3K","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a longtime fan of Leonard Cohen and his songs, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with his 2012 album ""Old Ideas"" - not that it was any direct weak album, but it somehow lacked something – perhaps there were too few really memorable songs.  So, my expectations for the sequel ""Popular Problems"" were not the greatest.Fortunately, there was no new disappointment.  With his latest album Cohen delivers a fine little album with good songs delivered in tasteful arrangements by Patrick Leonard. The counterpoint between Cohen's deep and somewhat worn vocals, and the beautiful female voices is one of the characteristics that I have always greatly appreciated.Sharon Robinson, who played a key role on many of the previous albums, both vocally and in her songwriting, is not credited with any involvement this time. In return, we get fine vocals from Charlean Carmon, Dana Glover and Donna Delory. The reason I feel the urge to highlight the female vocals is obviously recognizing that without these a Cohen album would hardly work - his voice is simply not what it once was.""Popular Problems"" is a cozy, sounding album with catchy songs, which can be enjoyed many times without becoming tedious. It can be difficult to highlight individual songs, as most of them are really good; maybe if I must I'd pick ""You Got Me Singing"", ""Slow"" and ""A Street""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFKBMGTOCYWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJJ37BE#wasThisHelpful","R3VFKBMGTOCYWG","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was, of course, due to the contribution from Clarence White that made me buy this obscure live CD with the group Nashville West. In addition to the five original members Clarence White must be the most prominent personality who came into the Byrds during the many line-up changes of the band.Both his brilliant guitar playing, which is very easily recognised, and his also very distinctive vocals were important ingredients in the group from 1968 until the its dissolution in 1973.I seems obvious that these live recordings were hardly conceived as sanything worthy of commercial release; the sound is not very good, and had it not been for Clarence White, they probably would never have been released.In spite of the below sonics, it is possible rejoice White’s fine and always inventive playing. Unfortunately, we do not hear much to his vocals, which for me was something of a disappointment. The lead-singer Gib Guilbeau is at best ordinary and even though the rhythm section sounds experienced, it is never really exciting.This is obviously a release that appeals mostly to fans of Clarence White. Best tracks are ""Sweet Susannah,"" ""Ode to Billy Joe,"" ""Sing Me Back Home"", ""Louisiana Rain"" and of course White's own ""Nashville West""","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8J6OWLKWZPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000004B0N#wasThisHelpful","R2K8J6OWLKWZPC","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apart from the movie soundtrack ""Percy""  which I would call a solid 4 star album, I won’t hesitate to rate all the Kinks's Pye albums for sure 5 star albums. ""Lola Versus Powerman & the Moneygoround"" may not be in the category of  ""The Village Green Preservation Society"" , but it has more than enough to deserve all five stars.Like its predecessor, ""Arthur"" the album is  a concept album with a critical focus on the music industry. But the important thing is that the album contains a wealth of fine songs. In addition to the two classic hits ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" you will find the very beautiful ""Get Back in the Line"", which was regular on the group's repertoire in the 1970’s. Also, ""This Time Tomorrow"" and the ballad ""A Long Way From Home"" are personal favorites. Among the more thematic songs ""The Moneygoround"" is both funny and biting. Dave Davies delivers one of his very best songs, ""Strangers"", which both musically and lyrically is simply great.Among the bonus tracks the two ""new"" songs are surprisingly good and sound pretty finished. They may not add anything decisively new, and it easy to understand that they were not selected in the first place; both numbers, though,  could easily have lifted on the sequel ""Percy"". The slightly pompous ballad ""Anytime"" is not bad, while ""The Good Life"" is more like a classic Kinks rocker.""Percy"", which in this deluxe version of the ""Lola"" functions as bonus CD, is in itself an excellent album which, however, is weakened by some uninteresting instrumentals; particularly the version of ""Lola"" is somewhat annoying.Otherwise, I prefer to focus on the marvelous songs ""God's Children"", ""Moments"" and ""The Way Love Used to Be"". Also ""Dreams"" belongs in the fine end. ""Animals in the Zoo"" with its Bo Diddley beat, also works fine while ""Willesden Green"", sung by John Dalton, is a good song that might mostly have been recorded for fun.Among the lesser-known tracks the waltzy ""Just Friends"" is a typical soundtrack number. ""Completely"" sounds almost like a ""Fleetwood Mac"" instrumental, while ""Helga"" really is both melodic and catchy.As a whole, this release is really a scoop with alternative single versions of familiar songs and a few outtakes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P24XG647C3MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYX2TMY#wasThisHelpful","R2P24XG647C3MQ","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second album from ""The Incredible String Band"" is often categorized as psychelic folk. Apart from the interesting album-cover, I think probably that there is more folk than psychedelia on this album. Also, you don't sense a clear focus or direction of where the duo is headed.The group is at this time was reduced to the duo Heron and Williamson, who, as the debut  share the songwriting equally between them. As with its predecessor, it is clearly Heron’s songs that appeal most to me, and I will among those I will highlight ""Chinese White"", ""Painting Box"" and ""Little Cloud"". Part of his songs suffer somewhat from being exposed to pretty messy arrangements; with weird conga beats and guitars working in different directions.Most of Williamson's songs seem sketchy; some almost unfinished; Only in a few cases, you sense a clear and tight melody. His greatest contribution is probably ""The First Girl I Loved"", which has a fine chorus.As a whole, I think the album is disappointing. Very much a time-piece; sounds to me very dated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGNOTRX9KH3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026G3D#wasThisHelpful","R3VGNOTRX9KH3C","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I do not have any big picture of the career of The Incredible String Band's career or of the group's many albums. However, I have over the years been presented to quite a few songs by the group and I have always felt that the music just lacked the last bit. Having recently re-listened to Mike Heron's two fine albums ""Smiling With med Bad Reputation"" and ""Mike Heron's Reputation"", I thought I’d give the group the ""serious"" new chance. I felt it natural to start from the beginning with the group's first selftitled album from 1966.I hardly know what to think; the album is pretty pure folk, with some inspiration from traditional music and artists like Woody Guthrie.It’s Mike Heron's songs that hit my taste in music the most with ""Maybe Someday"", ""When the music Stars to Play"" and ""How happy I am"" as some of the best. Robin Williamson's songs are also quite good; especially ""October Song"" and ""Dandelion Blues"", but I have a preference for Heron's; not least because of his much more interesting and personal vocals.The group was at this time a trio with banjo-player Clive Palmer as the third man; but the two main members Heron and Robinson are obviously the driving forces.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q23JZJ9SP0PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037TRVCG#wasThisHelpful","R1Q23JZJ9SP0PY","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mike Heron's second solo album from 1975 is not to the same degree as his debut ""Smiling Men With Bad Reputation"" characterized by many prominent guest appearances.On ""Mike Heron's Reputation"" the list of musicians is equally long, only many of these are less known than people like Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, John Cale , Richard Thompson and several others who contribute on the first album.Richard Thompson appears here only on a single track ""Down on My Knees"", which in turn is one of the highlights. Mike Heron's songwriting is generally fine and inspired; interesting that he on several numbers, both vocally and in his songwriting is similar to Cat Stevens. This goes, for my ears at least, for ""Down on My Knees,"" ""Angels in Disguise"" (my favorite) and the equally fine ""Meanwhile the Rain"".Style-wise, Heron spreds over several genres and the folk-roots he is known for with The Incredible String Band is only obvious to a modest degree.Besides the already mentioned songs, the ballads ""Evie"" and ""One of the Finest"" should be highlighted. Basically ""Mike Heron's Reputation"" is a fine little album without direct weak or filler songs.Vocally Heron is nicely backed up on several songs by Linda Thompson, while teammate Robin Williamson is in the backing vocals choir on two songs. An interesting, but unfortunately not very significant Melanie, is also in the choir on two tracks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZAJRLLV6INK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L1MPOK#wasThisHelpful","R1NZAJRLLV6INK","A1XP7P3X9MRE5H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XP7P3X9MRE5H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these after I got the purple ones and had lived with them a couple of weeks.The strips of water hyacinth look sort of like super thin pieces of bamboo woven with the colored threads.They lie nice and flat and don't have any bumps or bits that make plates feel wobbly,They spot clean very nicely ( dabbing gently with cool water on drips ) and don't show any stains or water marks.My set's color is pretty true to what is shown here; it's a very pretty turquoise and I love 'em!I plan to also get a set in red when they're back in stock.The thinness comes in handy when storing them in kitchen drawer; and they look really nice on my dark brown wood table.It's a good natural look which is right up my alley; I recommend them to anyone seeking a set of mats that are easy to clean, easy to store and VERY easy on the eyes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7TDKJL0TU76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEXF83C#wasThisHelpful","RO7TDKJL0TU76","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this seasoning but it wasn't what I was hoping for.What I've been seeking is the old McCormick Vegetable Supreme. That seasoning got my picky hubby to actually like asparagus and broccoli!That had sesame seeds and a more buttery flavor than this; but I'm not saying this is bad.This is just different and not exactly what I was looking for.This has red bell pepper bits and no sesame seeds and it doesn't have the buttery flavor, but that's easy to compensate for by adding a dab of butter to the cooked veggies.I guess it's more like a blend of finely minced dried vegetables instead of something meant to enhance veggie flavor.My hubby still eats his veggies when I use this so I'll stick with it and look forward to trying it with different things, not just veggies.I think it's worth a try if you're seeking a flavorful seasoning for veggies or maybe chicken or fish.

"These placemats are even better than I expected.The water hyacinth gives them a look and feel almost as if they'd used very thin pieces of bamboo interwoven with the colored thread.The color of the mats I received is true to the photo.

It gives it a very nice natural vibe.They lay nice and flat and there aren't any lumps or bumps that make plates, etc feel wobbly.I also like that since they're thin, they don't take up much room in my drawer. Makes it easier to order more colors ;-)I've been using this set for about 2 1/2 weeks now and they spot clean very well so far. The drips I've had to clean come right off and there aren't any obviously ""dabbed at"" marks. No water stain visible.And in 30+ years of marriage this is the ONLY set of placemats my hubby has commented on without my prompting!

"IMHO this is the best reusable water bottle EVER! At least in my experience of trying many, many reusable bottles and I've tried lots; including other stainless steel ones. Knocks plastic ones out of the game.It doesn't sweat, it doesn't leak if it gets knocked over; it truly does keep cold beverages cold as long as it says; ditto for warm beverages.It's very easy to wash and keep clean and the only reusable bottle I've had that doesn't develop that funky stale odor/taste that some made of other materials do after a while.To top it off the design is so cool!

"My hubby received one of these as part of a holiday gift bag from a TV show he works for, with the show's logo on it so that was cool.It's the best reusable water bottle I've ever seen! I don't know how many stainless steel and plastic bottles I've purchased over the last few years and they all were disappointing in many ways. Even the insulated bottles I bought wouldn't keep water cold in my car on a hot day for an hour. Almost all of them would sweat, even some of the insulated bottles. And after a few hours the water would taste stale or with some of the plastic bottles, it would get that funny ""plasticky"" taste. I wasn't thrilled with how well they washed either; some got nice and clean but others had spouts or other bits that were really hard to get to.This bottle doesn't have any of the above problems! And I recently discovered a great use for it.I got bitten by an evil flu bug and was running a fairly high fever so I was drinking a lot of water. After a few hours my hubby got tired of bringing me a fresh glass every hour or so, so I told him ""break out that fancy new bottle you got and let's give it a try"".He filled it with chilled, filtered water and boy did that bottle work great! I set it on the floor beside my bed and used it to refill my glass all night long. I didn't want to drink directly from the bottle since I was sick. Every glass was fresh and cold and tasted like it had NOT been sitting in a bottle. Since it was on the floor my cats knocked it over a time or two and not once did it leak even a tiny bit.It was so much better than having a carafe of water on my nightstand and not nearly as messy.I'm thrilled to find it on Amazon and plan to purchase at least one more so we each have one. IMHO it would also make a nice gift for just about anyone, not just fitness buffs. I'm hoping that it won't be long before Amazon has it available in more colors; I see them available from other sites but will wait to use my Amazon Smile account.Oh and I wanted to mention that the finish is nice and smooth but not shiny. It's a matte finish. The bottle my hubby got is much darker brown than this one and the wood grain stands out nicely; just enough to look almost real.All in all I highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWJ7UWKOIHOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M00OPZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2VWJ7UWKOIHOT","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't believe I'm giving this only 4 stars.As a long time hardcore Stephen King fan, and a more recent fan of Joe Hill's I really looked forward to this.However, in the spirit of honesty I have to say this read like a Children of the Corn redux. It's not identical but anyone who's read The Children Of The Corn will recognize many elements.I got the Kindle version and I'm glad I did.Sadly I have to say if I'd paid more I'd have struggled between 3 and 4 stars...I'm giving 4 in part to the e-book savings.If you're new to SK and haven't read Children of the Corn yet, you'll probably get a nice creepy thrill from this story.But I doubt I'm the only old-time SK fan who would love to see a more creative and fresh collaboration from him and Joe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2EO4LLHM46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X6TP1I#wasThisHelpful","R2F2EO4LLHM46","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am absolutely thrilled with this lamp!The pictures don't do it justice; when it's lit the intricacies of the metalwork really show. The hummingbirds' wings especially show off just how nice it is...they almost look like filigree. The glass behind the wings and in other trim is clearer than the moderately opaque quality of the other...the contrast is lovely.The colors are spectacular and the glasswork very well done. This isn't a cheap plastic wanna-be but a true work of art that should delight you for a long time.The shade is real metalwork and glass; not some cheap piece churned out by the thousands. I don't know enough about stained glass to determine if this was handmade but IMHO it sure seems that way. Someone somewhere had to put all the pieces together.One note; it says it recommends 60 watt bulbs but the lamp I received has 3-way ability. I started out with a 60 watt incandescent bulb but after trying the switch a couple times I realized it just might be 3 way! YAY I love it even more! I currently have a 3 way CFL bulb in it. It's the equivalent of a 30-70-100 and it works great.The light from the lamp is so warm and adds such a lovely feel to my living room.Honestly I didn't expect it to be so beautiful and of such high quality; only because the photos don't really show the detail and how well it's built. I also had a great experience with customer service. Prior to purchase I asked a question about the lamp and got email notification of a reply in less than 15 minutes! That's a first!The lamp does need to be assembled but it's super easy to do and it's very sturdy. The base is nice heavy metal; the deep bronze finish is so much prettier than the photo shows.I've been pleasantly surprised before on Amazon but this seller has set a very high bar with their combo of excellent service and a superior quality product.I've wanted a really nice Tiffany style lamp since I was old enough to know what a Tiffany lamp is. This lamp lives up to my dream and at a much more affordable price!And no I don't work for the company yada yada yada....I'm truly an over-the-moon customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHH5TF6Y02HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCG1S2U#wasThisHelpful","RHHH5TF6Y02HV","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margaret's story overlaps other books Philippa Gregory has written about this time period but she gives it a fresh point of view.Speaking as a fan of Philippa's other books about the Cousins War and the Tudors I really enjoyed ""hearing"" Margaret Pole's voice.She endured so much and sacrificed so many loved ones in her effort to keep her family line alive...her efforts simply to survive were amazing and she deserved a better end.Her courage and discretion and strength in face of so many foes is admirable.Even if you've read ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" or ""The White Queen"" or ""The Red Queen""  or ""The Constant Princess"" you'll enjoy Lady Stanley's life story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKH9VZOLSCVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451626118#wasThisHelpful","R3PKH9VZOLSCVG","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a lovely cotton blanket; super soft and not too heavy, not too light for my needs.I live in So Cal so wanted something for those cool nights when you don't want a heavy comforter or a wooly blanket but want more than a sheet.The thickness is comparable to an unlined knit fabric; kind of like a woven non-fleecy sweatshirt I guess. If that makes sense...LOL!I ordered the light blue and in reality it's a little more on the aqua side but it's still beautiful.It comes in a plastic zipper bag and when I first removed the blanket it had a funny smell.  But it went away after I left the folded blanket on a shelf overnight.I ordered a queen size and it's perfect for my Tempurpedic mattress which is thicker than some, so yeah it works great on deeper mattresses.All in all I'm really very happy with my purchase and just might get one in green, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQAT0BEXBQBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N24NY90#wasThisHelpful","R2YQAT0BEXBQBW","A2337ZUNGE90FH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2337ZUNGE90FH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one mess of a textbook.  It stands as evidence that, if someone prostitutes their intellectual services for a dumbed-down product and do so cheaply, then big-industry will repay in nepotism and continued royalties via numerous editions.  This is certainly a book that should not have made it to a first edition, let alone a sixth.The objective of such a book is impossible to say: it’s supposed to posture as some kind of introduction, yet what student will take away is minimal, if anything at all.  I have a good example from the first chapter.  Without even giving a reasonable introduction as to who Plato is and what his philosophical project entailed (and its objectives), Palmer goes into talking about how scholars have noticed a way of breaking down Plato’s dialogues into three parts.  Who cares?  The book certainly hasn’t established a reason for caring about this information at this point; they don’t even know who Plato was!What is the books objective?  Apparently, it is supposed to be an unimposing introduction to philosophy that is not imposing.  However, the author doesn’t develop much in the way of context when dropping little –very little– bits of information.  The book is set up as an amazingly superficial introduction topics, though it does get (too) convoluted and nuanced on topics that the author probably holds near and dear.  To be clear, the author does not develop a sense of what philosophical argumentation is, he doesn’t establish a strong historical thread (actually, he likes to revisit Greece in just about every chapter, as if he’s established ancient Greek philosophy as a basis for perspective and context), and he impotently presents philosophical issues.The book is written with cartoons smattered throughout, which makes for a lot less actual room for text.  You think your students are getting 300 pages of philosophy text, but you are getting slightly better than half that page count.  Finally, the book reads like mix between a comic book, a newspaper, and a scholarly work, often times chameleonically switching styles.  This book gives every bit of a feeling that the author went away to a country home in the summer, wrote continuously for 30 days, without much reflection about the product, and then sent it in to the publisher.  What’s more, being in the sixth edition, I expect that the project is too much of a mess to improve, so they probably make minor alterations semi-annually, so that they can continue to profit off of students.For professors (or students, for personal use) seeking an historical introduction to philosophy, I can recommend Enoch Stumpf’s text.

It stands as evidence that, if someone prostitutes their intellectual services for a dumbed-down product and do so cheaply, then big-industry will repay in nepotism and continued royalties via numerous editions.  This is certainly a book that should not have made it to a first edition, let alone a sixth.The objective of such a book is impossible to say: it’s supposed to posture as some kind of introduction, yet what student will take away is minimal, if anything at all.  I have a good example from the first chapter.  Without even giving a reasonable introduction as to who Plato is and what his philosophical project entailed (and its objectives), Palmer goes into talking about how scholars have noticed a way of breaking down Plato’s dialogues into three parts.  Who cares?  The book certainly hasn’t established a reason for caring about this information at this point; they don’t even know who Plato was!What is the books objective?  Apparently, it is supposed to be an unimposing introduction to philosophy that is not imposing.  However, the author doesn’t develop much in the way of context when dropping little –very little– bits of information.  The book is set up as an amazingly superficial introduction topics, though it does get (too) convoluted and nuanced on topics that the author probably holds near and dear.  To be clear, the author does not develop a sense of what philosophical argumentation is, he doesn’t establish a strong historical thread (actually, he likes to revisit Greece in just about every chapter, as if he’s established ancient Greek philosophy as a basis for perspective and context), and he impotently presents philosophical issues.The book is written with cartoons smattered throughout, which makes for a lot less actual room for text.  You think your students are getting 300 pages of philosophy text, but you are getting slightly better than half that page count.  Finally, the book reads like mix between a comic book, a newspaper, and a scholarly work, often times chameleonically switching styles.  This book gives every bit of a feeling that the author went away to a country home in the summer, wrote continuously for 30 days, without much reflection about the product, and then sent it in to the publisher.  What’s more, being in the sixth edition, I expect that the project is too much of a mess to improve, so they probably make minor alterations semi-annually, so that they can continue to profit off of students.For professors (or students, for personal use) seeking an historical introduction to philosophy, I can recommend Enoch Stumpf’s text.  If a topic-based approach to the introduction of philosophy is the goal, then I can recommend Rauhut’s text.  These texts are probably not the best, but they are far-and-away better than Palmer’s text, here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3407WQHMPCKMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0073535753#wasThisHelpful","R3407WQHMPCKMB","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed this book from the library, thinking that it would be a suitable read while pedaling on the recumbent bike at the gym.  I thought this because I am reasonably obsessed with chess –“reasonable,” in the sense that I don’t have chess piece soap or chess underwear, or anything crazy like that; you understand if you are familiar with the USCF tournament scene.  The book turned out to be a massive dud.  Many would dislike the academic manner of writing that Fine uses, though I actually enjoy the precision of this manner of writing.  However, the glaring problem is in the function of the book, i.e., what it intends to do.  My impression when grabbing it was that it is a book on how chess builds culture, in a value-oriented sense.  That is not so.  The book discusses how chess builds a chess culture, in an anthropological sense.  Though this approach would interest me slightly less, the idea of the project is still fairly interesting.  The problem, beyond that, is that book is horribly organized.  The book feels like a smattering of thoughts that were written down as notes, and then Fine left himself to write a book much later, but could not organize the information.  I doubt anthropological method dictates this kind of “organization.”  Worst of all, much of the book is a trite collection of anecdotes, quotes, and so forth –all of which are more than familiar to anyone involved in the spoken-of chess culture; and it is painfully obvious that the author really isn’t a part of this culture.The writing is not interesting, the function is dubious (i.e., I don’t know what the book truly intends to achieve or who the audience is supposed to be, considering the lack of academic polish), and the organization was plain bad.  There was a little bit of interest to me that I found in this book, which is the reason for two stars.  However, I can’t recommend this book to anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6PO742MD5GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022626498X#wasThisHelpful","R1I6PO742MD5GW","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this device as a gift long before I ever took up chess. What's most impressive to me is that more than 10 years later, this gizmo still functions as well as it ever did. I have no clue what the other reviewer is talking about, whenever he says the pieces are shoddy. The only problem I've had with the pieces, or the game in general, is that the magnet in the bottom of the pieces sometimes come unattached. However, a little dab of crazy glue has held the two (of thirty-two) in without fail. The pieces are very hard plastic, which have not cracked. My USCF tournament set has only last 3 years by comparison; so the Excalibur set is really remarkably well put together.One con to the product is that it is significantly smaller than a tournament board. (Note: a USCF tournament is designed to stretch across the entirety of most 2-person table spaces, while Excalibur is designed to sit comfortably in one's lap.) So if you want big pieces, this isn't the set for you. However, a major pro is that it is small, and since the piece are strongly magnetic, I have been able to us the board while on a Greyhound bus, sitting in the passenger seat of a car, and in a hammock.The playing strength of the set ranges from 1600-1900, but I'd say 1700 is a good estimate. If you are casual player and don't know what this means, take it to mean that the board's playing ability is much greater than yours.Excellent product.

"This book is just bad.  I think it may only be acceptable to a casual player, but the problem with saying that is that I know better books for casual players looking to get some broad and general exposure in one book.  Examples of much better books for casual players have been written by authors like Pandolfini, Alburt, and Reinfeld.  I would say that the other negative reviews are right on.  This book is a rambling collection of games and fragments with no overarching purpose.  It’s not a step-by-step process, as the title suggests.  I didn’t even see many (any, possibly, because I can’t recall one) general nuggets of information to help one on the quest from casual player to mid-level Class player, let alone Master.Forget this book.  If you want legitimate suggestions, and you are a Class player already, look at Soltis’ “What It Takes to Become a Master.”  If you are a casual player, look at books by the authors I have mentioned above, as well as other titles that have “complete chess course” or similar in the title.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VF3YNRTU1CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580420508#wasThisHelpful","R38VF3YNRTU1CG","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Silman’s Complete Endgame Course” is easily the best, most pedagogically sound, and systematic approach to endgame study.  What’s more, it is effective for any player at any level, save GM.  My first introduction to endgames were Reuben Fine (a good book, but not a good first book) and Pandolfini’s book on edings (a good book, but not a great first book).  Silman very mindfully made the necessary adjustment to the arrangement of content, which is the primary failing of these other books I’ve mentioned, namely, that most books are just compilations based on type of endings (e.g., pawn endings, minor piece endings, etc.), not differentiated on the basis of difficulty and relevance.  I can’t tell you how many endings in Pandolfini’s endgame book I’ve never seen, or Fine’s, for that matter.  I went through Silman’s manual, first as a 1400, and I was seeing endings I had actually lost in USCF tournament games!  This is because he’s broken the chapters down into classes (Master [2200-2399], Expert [2000-2199], A-Class [1800-1999], B-Class [1600-1799], C-Class [1400-1599], D-Class [1200-1399], and so on).  In addition to that, not only does he give the most commonly seen and necessary(!) for a given strength, but he also has a pedagogical mind towards building knowledge systematically.  He first teaches the Philidor position in one section, then in a much later section (Expert, I think), he explains how to still achieve a draw when the Philidor position wasn’t quite possible to set up.  He also has this brilliant idea of “flow chart” thinking –and I mean this is just BRILLIANT!  In this kind of thinking, he takes a super complex position, even one that is still in the middle game, and asks you to imagine types of endings that might arise out of it, what forcing exchanges might move into that ending, and then explains how to put all the basic known endings into perspective with respect to the complex position.  I gained so much out of this that it is unreal!Another item I must comment upon is the tidbits of advice that Silman gives, which might cost someone hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in one-on-one coaching time.  For instance, Silman says that, in his experience, he’s only had one time in which a game has resulted in a K, N, & B vs. a K, and most players never learn how to mate with just a N and B; so, if in dire straits, it could be a strategy to force a much stronger opponent into an ending of that kind.  I used this strategy, and it’s worked out twice!!  If you look at my USCF statistics, I drew a 1914-rated player as a 1445 player, and I drew a 1983-rated player (almost Expert!) as a 1526 player.  Both told me something like, “eh, I sort of know how to do it, and I thought I could do it if I needed, but obviously I couldn’t get the mate.”  These nuggets are strewn throughout the book.I should say something about the limitations of the book.  If you had to get one endgame book only, this is it.  However, I highly recommend supplementing it with “Practical Chess Endings” by Keres and “100 Endgames You Must Know” by de la Villa.  The reason is that there are important endings that are not covered by Silman, and he gives you some advice as to what you want to look for –he’s very, very aware of what he’s doing as a teacher, and the holes in his text are noted, as well as the reasoning for the existence of those holes.  For instance, he thinks the payoff for learning certain rook-and-pawn endings is too little for the amount of effort that would go into learning them; but he tells you what they are, which is of immense value.  He says the same of mating with a B & N.  In my experience, which is somewhat extensive in endings, the two books I mentioned are the best supplements to this text.In short, if there are only 10 books a Class player (1999 and lower USCF rating) could ever afford or own, Silman’s manual would be on my list of must-haves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUSTMOMYQBUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVNBN8E#wasThisHelpful","R1NUSTMOMYQBUK","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can’t tell you how many endings in Pandolfini’s endgame book I’ve never seen, or Fine’s, for that matter.  I went through Silman’s manual, first as a 1400, and I was seeing endings I had actually lost in USCF tournament games!  This is because he’s broken the chapters down into classes (Master [2200-2399], Expert [2000-2199], A-Class [1800-1999], B-Class [1600-1799], C-Class [1400-1599], D-Class [1200-1399], and so on).  In addition to that, not only does he give the most commonly seen and necessary(!) for a given strength, but he also has a pedagogical mind towards building knowledge systematically.  He first teaches the Philidor position in one section, then in a much later section (Expert, I think), he explains how to still achieve a draw when the Philidor position wasn’t quite possible to set up.  He also has this brilliant idea of “flow chart” thinking –and I mean this is just BRILLIANT!  In this kind of thinking, he takes a super complex position, even one that is still in the middle game, and asks you to imagine types of endings that might arise out of it, what forcing exchanges might move into that ending, and then explains how to put all the basic known endings into perspective with respect to the complex position.  I gained so much out of this that it is unreal!Another item I must comment upon is the tidbits of advice that Silman gives, which might cost someone hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in one-on-one coaching time.  For instance, Silman says that, in his experience, he’s only had one time in which a game has resulted in a K, N, & B vs. a K, and most players never learn how to mate with just a N and B; so, if in dire straits, it could be a strategy to force a much stronger opponent into an ending of that kind.  I used this strategy, and it’s worked out twice!!  If you look at my USCF statistics, I drew a 1914-rated player as a 1445 player, and I drew a 1983-rated player (almost Expert!) as a 1526 player.  Both told me something like, “eh, I sort of know how to do it, and I thought I could do it if I needed, but obviously I couldn’t get the mate.”  These nuggets are strewn throughout the book.I should say something about the limitations of the book.  If you had to get one endgame book only, this is it.  However, I highly recommend supplementing it with “Practical Chess Endings” by Keres and “100 Endgames You Must Know” by de la Villa.  The reason is that there are important endings that are not covered by Silman, and he gives you some advice as to what you want to look for –he’s very, very aware of what he’s doing as a teacher, and the holes in his text are noted, as well as the reasoning for the existence of those holes.  For instance, he thinks the payoff for learning certain rook-and-pawn endings is too little for the amount of effort that would go into learning them; but he tells you what they are, which is of immense value.  He says the same of mating with a B & N.  In my experience, which is somewhat extensive in endings, the two books I mentioned are the best supplements to this text.In short, if there are only 10 books a Class player (1999 and lower USCF rating) could ever afford or own, Silman’s manual would be on my list of must-haves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BTYLB7QAAY44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5FDEDG#wasThisHelpful","R3BTYLB7QAAY44","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Silman’s Complete Endgame Course” is easily the best, most pedagogically sound, and systematic approach to endgame study.  What’s more, it is effective for any player at any level, save GM.

"The only negative things I have to say about this book are: 1) the organization is bizarre as heck; and 2) I don’t think Yusupov has a very good sense of what is and what is not difficult.  The first point is more of an oddity than it is a serious detractor.  Each lesson is internally complete, so it is just weird that one finds the collection of topics in this book that one does.  As far as content, this is probably the most important content one needs at the high intermediate level to improve.  On the second point, Yusupov gives many reasonable problems, but I don’t think the exercises are always given the correct number of difficulty stars.  Some of the 3-star problems deserved 4, and some of the 2-star problems deserved 3.  There were also a number of 4- and 3-star problems that I thought should have been a star (or 2) less in rating.The book is all around exceptional.  The most important thing to know when considering this text is that it is difficult, and that I’m not sure that the intended audience is really the audience that should seek this book out.  I’m not sure what my USCF strength is (officially, my rating peaked at 1608, but I am very likely much stronger), but among myself and two friends --one rated 1660, the other 1780--, both of them had difficulty solving the average problem, while I was occasionally stumped.  If this book is intended to move players from 1500-1800, then it has a bizarre quality of being extremely difficult for players that are just about there and who are on the way.  The topics, themselves, are not out of the ordinary of what you’d expect for 1500-1800.  However, the degree of difficult makes me believe that the end goal of this first series of “1800” might be FIDE, not USCF; or maybe the end goal of this series is really 1850 FIDE, i.e., approx. 1950 USCF.  These are certainly not complaints, but clarifications for potential buyers and readers.  Let me be clear: this is the best system I have come across, and it is the most information dense.  I only wish to provide a caveat lector and caveat emptor, because I’ve spoken with players in the 1400’s and 1500’s (USCF) who said this book was horribly difficult, and they scored 3pts out of 22 on the sections with exercises (e.g., the book rates results as: 12 pts is “pass,” 16 pts “good,” 19pts is “excellent,” and these vary among chapters).The book includes content, as I said, that seems basic in name, but Yusupov makes it quite complex, rich, and sophisticated.  These areas included are tactical motifs, opening principles, Steintz’ strategic principles, and endgame concepts.  I really can’t believe I got so much out of this book, looking at some of the lesson titles, but I did.  I think that’s a testament to this book’s quality in developing sound fundamentals, even in advanced players.  About the only complaint I have on the content is that Yusupov claims that forced moves are the same as combinations.  While this is true for a professional player, I think the distinction has pedagogical value, and so it is legitimately a downside of this book.  That aside, this book is endlessly informative, and very deserving of the Bolaslavski Book Award –and it should be noted that Yusupov beat out some of the biggest names in chess teaching for the award, e.g. Dvoretsky.All in all, I have to recommend this to anyone around USCF 1500.  Despite the fact that much of it is easy for me, I see rapid improvement in my game, and I can only conclude that this system is shoring up my holes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q9615TCDN6JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906552010#wasThisHelpful","R2Q9615TCDN6JA","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent book.  The EDITION, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF, receives four stars instead of five because of the fact that I can’t stand the descriptive notation and Keres seems to be equally inefficient in the notation, give all of the errors in the text, which is the major reason I could not give the text five stars.Keres does a great job of supplying rules and theory, then giving concrete and very practical games where the theory and rules are applicable.  I think this is one of three books you need if you are U2200, the others being Silman’s “Complete Endgame Course” and “100 Endgames You Must Know” by de la Villa.  (Reuben Fine’s book might be added.)  The strength of this book is that it has a lot of the most important content that Silman and de la Villa are missing, but that is needed as a basis of endgame knowledge.  I have played countless decent club players (USCF 1500), who were able to play very savvy middlegames, and then not know that the middlegame was either drawn or lost for them.  This book rectifies those issues of basic knowledge.  I highly advise doing Silman’s manual, then doing de la Villa and Keres simultaneously.  Silman’s manual explains why this book is not as effect on its own, stating in his introduction that grouping all pawn endings and all rook endings, etc., is not very effective, because you are lumping all sorts of levels of information together, some remedial, some very complex, when doing so.All in all, I think this is one of the must-have/must-read texts.  I only wish they’d come out with a new edition.  Great book, sub-mediocre edition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLHQTNOM3LS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4871875091#wasThisHelpful","R1MLHQTNOM3LS2","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reviews commenting on the numerous errors in this book are accurate.  However, I think there are plenty of positions in this book that are worth trying to work out.  If you can get this book for shipping costs only, then I recommend it.  If spending a buck or two won’t bother you, then you can go ahead and buy it for $2 or less but no more.One of the good aspects about this book is that the authors have a very good sense about how strong a player should be in order to correctly answer these problems.  There are three primary tactics sections (chapters) with increasingly difficult problems.  At the beginning of each, they let you know how many problems an advanced beginner, intermediate, and tournament player should get correct.  When I first went through this book in the December of 2007, I had learned how the pieces move two or three months prior, and I was able to hit just below the marks that the authors gave.  For example, an advanced beginner, for the first and easiest section, should be able to solve 64 out of 100 problems.  I solved about 20, indicating that I wasn’t an advanced beginner –and I wasn’t my USCF strength was about 1000.  Two years later, when I made it to 1600, I scored 80 out of 100, which is what they deem an intermediate player capable of.  Their “tournament player” strength distinction is probably in the A-class to Expert range (USCF 1800-2199), since I have been able to get just about 100 out of 100 on all three sections 5 years after the second attempt.  It’s difficult finding books with accurately rated tactics sets, so I think this is a very good book in that respect.Additionally, there are a few brief chapters on interesting topics like defense.  They are anything but comprehensive, but many might find that they add a little value to the book.Overall, the errors in solutions are a shame, especially considering that Mensa was willing to put their name on it.  In fact, some of the problems have better defenses that the authors did not see.  I would say that about 8% of this book has errors, to give you some idea.  For weaker players, this will be frustrating.  However, stronger players who are looking for a text to slowly work through and calculate might find it beneficial to examine whether the authors are wrong in some cases.  “Is there a better defense?” has been the question that I have asked on this last pass through the book, and I think it has helped me develop better defensive analysis.  All in all, reader beware.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HW4T352YY4OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080692733X#wasThisHelpful","R1HW4T352YY4OG","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a love-hate relationship with this book.  I love it because it is far-and-away the single best strategy and position-assessment book I have read.  I hate it because it could have been so much better, and Grooten is certainly good enough to have made it better in the ways that I think it could have been better.  Since the review is 5-stars, you can stop here and consider my recommendation for this book superlative.  However, I am going to start out by saying what was wrong with the book, after which I will talk about what’s so great.The negative comments made in some of the other reviews are spot on, such as the lack of organization of the book.  I really felt like some publisher or editor saw an instant classic in the works and rushed it to sale for the sake of dollar signs.  The biggest substantial problem with the book, which truly indicates to me that it was either rushed by an editor/published or for the sake of winning a chess book of the year award is that there are many, many critical places in the text where Grooten doesn’t answer this simple question: why?  I don’t think there’s a chapter where Grooten says something, makes some assessment, or the like, and takes the reasoning as tacit.  I’m becoming very strong amateur player (officially USCF tournament peak of 1608, and probably getting close to A-class or Expert strength), and I’ve absolutely never had this problem before.  This problem isn’t so chronic that it ruins the book.  Grooten is definitely teaching a great many things, but the punch line from a number of mini-lessons is simply missing.  I’ve been training with a GM, so he’s been able to fill me in on what Grooten was trying to say.  I think this all could have been avoided by having an A-class or Expert read the book, so that he or she could let him know that there was some critical piece of explanation missing.  There is a general explanatory problem in a couple of his chapters, such as the one on piece harmony, in which case a little bit more detail was needed on a few points; but this is not as big a concern as the previous concern.  Another big issue with the book is that some of Grooten’s examples have multiple themes working, not just the one that is being emphasized.  In fact, sometimes the emphasized theme isn’t the most important aspect of the example.  This could have been rectified by picking less complex examples where the theme is exhibited in greater isolation –and this can be a problem very easily, given the holistic nature of chess, with all the intertangled themes in so many positions.  Grooten also contradicts some notable authors on a few things, and probably didn’t realize it, and so he never explained.  For example, in the chapter on passed-pawns, he talks about the side with the passed-pawn wanting to exchange the minor pieces.  What?  Lev Alburt and Jeremy Silman both said that minor piece push and halt passed-pawns, so keep them on the board!  I did not think for a minute that Grooten was wrong, but that there was something different about Grooten’s examples and those of Alburt and Silman’s.  The difference was how advanced the pawns are.  With a space advantaged generated by a far passed-pawns, activity of the opposing pieces are reduced if those pieces are rooks rather than knights and bishops.  (Notice how I’ve just mentioned that space and activity are thematic in this chapter, though it is supposed to be about the passed-pawn.)  It took me and my coach about an hour to examine Grooten’s, Silman’s, and Alburt’s examples to figure out what the deal was.  All of the other issues I had with the book are much less than these.What’s great about the book?  The book is structure around Steinitz’ elements; which is to say, the objective and idea behind the book is really solid, and it lends to the effectiveness of the text.  I also think that the book is enjoyably written –Grooten is anything but a boring writer, so that should not be a concern.  I’ve read a number of strategy and position-assessment books, and this is by far the best.  This area of chess is lacking in quantity and quality literature.  In a space almost exclusively dominated by a few classics, this book is the most in-depth and expansive book I have come across.  The amount of quality ideas and content this book contains is unreal; it really is.  Not only that, I think it serves a large field of readers.  Ideally, I think the book is best for 1600-2200, but it is very easily accessible to any player under 800.  Even at a USCF rating of 800, a great many of the concepts this book teaches can be assimilated.  The thing is that, as with all classics, the book requires reading and re-reading.  I am very confident that, with each pass through this book, I will develop much more knowledge than I previously possessed.  For the unclarity that some parts of Grooten’s text suffers in some places, it more than makes up for in other places.  That’s why I am disappointed in some regards, because most of the book is simple exceptional and crystal clear.  To give you some idea, if you thought “Chess for Post-Beginners” by Srokovsky was good, this one is world’s better.  In fact, that book purports to be aimed at players 1400-2200 (and it’s received rave reviews), yet the analysis in this book is much deeper, more thorough, and the explanations a bit lengthier for clarity.One thing that should be noted is that this is a difficult book in a number of ways.  Grooten even says that the reader should not sweat it if he or she does not get the solutions to exercises.  One friend, a very positional 1500-level USCF player, said that the book was tough but manageable.  A very tactical player (1850’s USCF) and friend, who is weak positionally, said that the book was extremely tough.  For me, I thought the book was challenging because Grooten sometimes assumes that you see the tactics that are forcing situations.  Finding the tactics, whenever he doesn’t fill in the details, can be seen as a tactics puzzle.  You can tell that this text is fairly high-level, because positional strength and weakness is tied in very closely with the tactics and threats required to achieve strategies; again, chess has a kind of holism at work.Excellent book.  I recommend it to any player under 2200.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HY8I8B1QRPP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00POFNOFO#wasThisHelpful","R2HY8I8B1QRPP5","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since the review is 5-stars, you can stop here and consider my recommendation for this book superlative.  However, I am going to start out by saying what was wrong with the book, after which I will talk about what’s so great.The negative comments made in some of the other reviews are spot on, such as the lack of organization of the book.  I really felt like some publisher or editor saw an instant classic in the works and rushed it to sale for the sake of dollar signs.  The biggest substantial problem with the book, which truly indicates to me that it was either rushed by an editor/published or for the sake of winning a chess book of the year award is that there are many, many critical places in the text where Grooten doesn’t answer this simple question: why?  I don’t think there’s a chapter where Grooten says something, makes some assessment, or the like, and takes the reasoning as tacit.  I’m becoming very strong amateur player (officially USCF tournament peak of 1608, and probably getting close to A-class or Expert strength), and I’ve absolutely never had this problem before.  This problem isn’t so chronic that it ruins the book.  Grooten is definitely teaching a great many things, but the punch line from a number of mini-lessons is simply missing.  I’ve been training with a GM, so he’s been able to fill me in on what Grooten was trying to say.  I think this all could have been avoided by having an A-class or Expert read the book, so that he or she could let him know that there was some critical piece of explanation missing.  There is a general explanatory problem in a couple of his chapters, such as the one on piece harmony, in which case a little bit more detail was needed on a few points; but this is not as big a concern as the previous concern.  Another big issue with the book is that some of Grooten’s examples have multiple themes working, not just the one that is being emphasized.  In fact, sometimes the emphasized theme isn’t the most important aspect of the example.  This could have been rectified by picking less complex examples where the theme is exhibited in greater isolation –and this can be a problem very easily, given the holistic nature of chess, with all the intertangled themes in so many positions.  Grooten also contradicts some notable authors on a few things, and probably didn’t realize it, and so he never explained.  For example, in the chapter on passed-pawns, he talks about the side with the passed-pawn wanting to exchange the minor pieces.  What?  Lev Alburt and Jeremy Silman both said that minor piece push and halt passed-pawns, so keep them on the board!  I did not think for a minute that Grooten was wrong, but that there was something different about Grooten’s examples and those of Alburt and Silman’s.  The difference was how advanced the pawns are.  With a space advantaged generated by a far passed-pawns, activity of the opposing pieces are reduced if those pieces are rooks rather than knights and bishops.  (Notice how I’ve just mentioned that space and activity are thematic in this chapter, though it is supposed to be about the passed-pawn.)  It took me and my coach about an hour to examine Grooten’s, Silman’s, and Alburt’s examples to figure out what the deal was.  All of the other issues I had with the book are much less than these.What’s great about the book?  The book is structure around Steinitz’ elements; which is to say, the objective and idea behind the book is really solid, and it lends to the effectiveness of the text.  I also think that the book is enjoyably written –Grooten is anything but a boring writer, so that should not be a concern.  I’ve read a number of strategy and position-assessment books, and this is by far the best.  This area of chess is lacking in quantity and quality literature.  In a space almost exclusively dominated by a few classics, this book is the most in-depth and expansive book I have come across.  The amount of quality ideas and content this book contains is unreal; it really is.  Not only that, I think it serves a large field of readers.  Ideally, I think the book is best for 1600-2200, but it is very easily accessible to any player under 800.  Even at a USCF rating of 800, a great many of the concepts this book teaches can be assimilated.  The thing is that, as with all classics, the book requires reading and re-reading.  I am very confident that, with each pass through this book, I will develop much more knowledge than I previously possessed.  For the unclarity that some parts of Grooten’s text suffers in some places, it more than makes up for in other places.  That’s why I am disappointed in some regards, because most of the book is simple exceptional and crystal clear.  To give you some idea, if you thought “Chess for Post-Beginners” by Srokovsky was good, this one is world’s better.  In fact, that book purports to be aimed at players 1400-2200 (and it’s received rave reviews), yet the analysis in this book is much deeper, more thorough, and the explanations a bit lengthier for clarity.One thing that should be noted is that this is a difficult book in a number of ways.  Grooten even says that the reader should not sweat it if he or she does not get the solutions to exercises.  One friend, a very positional 1500-level USCF player, said that the book was tough but manageable.  A very tactical player (1850’s USCF) and friend, who is weak positionally, said that the book was extremely tough.  For me, I thought the book was challenging because Grooten sometimes assumes that you see the tactics that are forcing situations.  Finding the tactics, whenever he doesn’t fill in the details, can be seen as a tactics puzzle.  You can tell that this text is fairly high-level, because positional strength and weakness is tied in very closely with the tactics and threats required to achieve strategies; again, chess has a kind of holism at work.Excellent book.

A very tactical player (1850’s USCF) and friend, who is weak positionally, said that the book was extremely tough.  For me, I thought the book was challenging because Grooten sometimes assumes that you see the tactics that are forcing situations.  Finding the tactics, whenever he doesn’t fill in the details, can be seen as a tactics puzzle.  You can tell that this text is fairly high-level, because positional strength and weakness is tied in very closely with the tactics and threats required to achieve strategies; again, chess has a kind of holism at work.Excellent book.  I recommend it to any player under 2200.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GJO3RN6JKMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056912682#wasThisHelpful","R37GJO3RN6JKMB","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent book, and I’d like to start by addressing one of the nonsense reviews for this book.  A one-star review notes that the publisher chose the “wrong” author to write this book.  The reasoning was that this player doesn’t believe in the Caro-Kann.  If there’s anyone who you want to write a book on an opening, it’s either an expert who plays that opening or someone who is an expert in busting it –and who, therefore, does not believe in the opening.  When you got the a book on the Caro-Kann or any opening, I hope the reader is seeking out the theory of how to play against it as much as play it.  These are separate theories, but are one single theory, where black tries to defeat white strategies, white trying to bust black’s.  Claiming that Gallagher is the “wrong” author is flat out moronic, and it also demonstrates the lack of so much as one iota of understanding about chess.  If anything, as a starting out player, I want to know how I can expect to be busted so that I can work against those ideas over the board.  If anything, an author like Gallagher is a plus for a starting out book.  I no longer play the Caro-Kann as balck, but this book’s content is still with me, as I have become a strong player against the Caro-Kann.  I score exceptionally well on both sides, and I’ve never looked at another Caro-Kann source, so I think it is safe to say that this book did the trick for me.  On to the content of this book.I absolutely love the “Starting Out” series.  I really don’t think it is worth the time for players under 2000 to look at openings much, but some superficial knowledge, mostly in the form of ideas for strategic purposes, can go a long way.  This was my first opening book.  When starting out as a 1000-level player, avoiding the tricks and traps of other weak players can be a nightmare.  Learning the ideas and basic moves of this opening helped me get into a middle game where it was simply my playing ability against the others’.  This book has the mainline theory at the start of each chapter, a breakdown of ideas and possibilities, and then it gives practical applications of those ideas in the form of practical games.  This is the layout for most all of the “Starting Out” books, and I think it is a recipe for success.This book should be for any player USCF rated under 2000, but I know all too many booked-up A-class players, so I will simply say that this book geared toward those who have no grounding or formal familiarity with the Caro-Kann.  I played the first 3 Lopez moves for quite some time before learning any of the opening’s ideas, learning some of the ideas on my own, but this book kicked me into a state of solid, basic theoretical understanding of the opening.  This series’ recipe certainly works for me, and I expect it will work for players who aren’t booked-up class players, but are similar players who have focused on tactics, positional play, strategy, endings, and so forth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKB9BXOFPLQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857443039#wasThisHelpful","R1FKB9BXOFPLQ5","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In preparing for a particular Expert level player (I was only 1477), I needed some ideas for the white side of the Lopez, and this book gave me everything I needed to get a draw (USCF rated G/120) –a fine result, given the rating disparity.

"Still one of my favorite books.  I read this book when I was a 1000-level player.  I had read the first few pages of Silman’s “Amateur’s Mind,” and I learned that it is very important to annotate games that have already been annotated by a National Master, International Master, or Grandmaster.  Chernev’s book is fantastic for that, especially for the simple fact that it annotates every move of every game.  (If you want to use Chernev’s book for this, cover up subsequent moves, try to decide the reason for the first move, decide upon plans and candidate moves, then see what the text move was; then try to figure out why it differed from your candidate moves or choice before looking at Chernev’s annotation.)  I’m not sure what Chernev’s background is, but he most certainly has a love for pedagogy, so he may have been a teacher, professor, or chess trainer.  His games all have some very isolated, very interesting and valuable lesson.  Some of the games have a couple of important themes, which Chernev makes clear, such as the weakening of a square, followed by a well-layed out explanation of the tactical pressure that it creates, and then the interesting endgame part of the lesson.  The clarity of Chernev’s ideas and discussion is really remarkable.  I found this book to be so worthwhile that I devoured it within a very short time, and I saw the benefits in my own game and an increase in my USCF rating.As I return to the book officially rated 600 pts higher (and probably with an unofficial strength of 1000 points greater), I come to the same games with positional and tactical knowledge that I didn’t have before, and I am finding that there are still concepts I can glean from Chernev’s book.  I can’t go as far as to say that players in the USCF 2000-2200 (1900-2100 FIDE) range will get too much out of this text, but it certainly is an enjoyable text, even if you haven’t much to gain.  Since the games are classics and some of the lesser known classics, it’s a great collection, regardless of whether you are looking for annotation or a collection of interesting classic games.  Players under 1700 will get the most out of this book.Note to Experts, 2000+ USCF and 1900+ FIDE: the annotations are not the typical of the depth you are looking for.  All of the relevant sidelines are not examined, only the major variations which a club player would probably find, as well as some of the more important (i.e., critical) lines.Note to players closer to beginner level: As I said, these games are classics, so don’t get too hung up on the openings, trying to learn opening theory from this.  The opening moves are logical, but most of them are no longer played, or at least have some variation upon the ones in this book.  Therefore, this book is great for learning opening principles, but forget about trying to memorize the moves for your own games, unless you play casually and not very competitively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNNKUMZPSR2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0713484640#wasThisHelpful","R1CNNKUMZPSR2N","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pages are nice to look at, they have clear printing, and make use of different colors in text and in the diagrams to highlight and emphasis different ideas or key things to pay attention to.  If you are familiar with the aesthetically pleasing nature of Lev Alburt’s later books, and you like those, then it is worth knowing that these volumes are on about the same par.  My only complaint with the text is that the authors denote where every piece is coming from in addition to where it is going.  For example, the first two moves for white in the Sicilian are written as “e2-e4” and “Ng1-f3.”  I found this horribly annoying and distracting, sometimes making the wrong piece moves on the board or in my head, because I tend to glance at the book to determine move orders. I imagine that they’ve done this to better serve the beginner, causal, and weaker club players, because the cost of the extra ink must have been noticeable in their bottom line.In short, the set is a good companion for studying openings for USCF/FIDE tournament play, but it could be a good one-stop-shop for beginners and casual players who seek less explanation than upper-level club and advanced players desire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGS8FA4VPU0IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWUAYMA#wasThisHelpful","RGS8FA4VPU0IU","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really teetered between four and five stars for this book, and I just can’t give it five.  The deciding factor is that I think Emms is a little bit unclear in his writing in some places, dropping a misplaced pronoun with sentences like “And he’s fine.”  There wasn’t anyone being talked about, in particular, previously, so who is “he.”  I haven’t had this problem with the other “Starting Out” books (Ruy Lopez, Caro-Kann, and Dutch), so it’s certainly not me.  This happens in in a few places in the text, but it isn’t rampant or anything.  The major reason the book pushed me on the side of 4 stars is that I think it is a monumental task to put this book kind of general introduction to the Sicilian together, and it is an achievement just doing so, as John Watson’s blurb says, but it is nearly impossible to do a great job with this project.  I felt some of the lines of discussion that were given on lines was a bit too much and overly complicated for a “Starting Out” book.  Compare this to others in the “Starting Out” series, and I think you’ll come away from each variation with the key ideas, objectives, and popular mentalities that go into plan construction for that variation.  In Emms’ book, my take away was decent, but much vaguer in some cases.  Finally, the minor detraction I haven’t mentioned is that Emms includes games that do not represent the latest in theory, but that are, as he says, some of the funner games.  That’s okay, but the idea of including practical games as concrete examples is to show the execution of ideas mentioned in the body of the chapter.  Therefore, not only are the ideas in a variation sometimes vague in a section or chapter, but the practical games don’t serve as a presentation for the ideas.Aside from these downsides, I think this is a good book to launch yourself into play against the Sicilian or to employ the Sicilian.  Everyman has an excellent recipe in this “Starting Out” series, and they are typical so good as a first introduction to an opening that I think it is nearly a waste of time to habitually remark on all of the positives, but I’ll list a few.  The books in this series, Emms’ included, are well organized, the diagram choices are exceptions, the content is relevant to popularly played club games AND to the international scene, the lightbulb indicators (symbols used in the text) are usually extremely helpful, as are the boldfaced notices for dangers, and the books are reasonably sturdy.  I haven’t found a better first-introduction to the Sicilian, and I trust “Starting Out” by name.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQS3WQQFL224/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056913409#wasThisHelpful","R3TQS3WQQFL224","A3VXVH4P85N73K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VXVH4P85N73K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this book when it first came out in the nineties and am so glad I was able to purchase it in e-reader form so I could enjoy it all over again.  Jackson Rule spent fifteen years in prison for killing his abusive father. His sister is in a mental facility because of it. Now he's looking to reconnect with her, pick up the pieces of his life, and start over. First he has to find a place to live and get a job. Finding an apartment doesn't take long when it's in a bad part of town.  Employment, on the other hand? No one wants to hire an ex-con.  No one until Rebecca, that is. She needs help with her nursery. Her assistant, Pete, is slowing down, not in the best shape, so when Jackson comes in looking for work she decides to give him a shot. Pete is against it as is Rebecca's father, the Reverand.  Even so,  the fact Jackson served time doesn't bother her as much as the old scars criss-crossing his back. She has a feeling there's more to the story than what he's telling.Their love story was one I thoroughly enjoyed reading and the fact she took time to build the relationship between them made for a refreshing change from some of the books nowadays where the couple is in bed together at the drop of a hat.  This also had a big twist at the end I wasn't expecting the first time I read it and had forgotten about until I read it again.

The building was in horrible condition and Mara didn't have the money to fix it up.  He was hoping she'd simply relocate. However, he didn't count on her stubbornness or the sentimentality she attached to the place.  When the two of them get involved it complicates things until Mara almost loses her life in a fire. Jason's solution is to move her into his guest house. Now, if he can somehow overcome his past, they might have a future.A good addition to the author's billionaire series.

"The author has cemented a place in my heart and on my book shelf as I find myself totally engrossed in her work. And she keeps getting better with each new book she writes.To give you a little background, Nan Vining is a detective with the Pasadena Police Department.  A couple of years prior to this story, she was ambushed, stabbed and left to die. She actually flatlined for two minutes before she was revived.  Her attacker was never found.  However, she believes he was the one who sent her a pearl necklace and a card offering his congratulations after she was involved in a high profile shooting.  I won't go into detail here but suffice it to say that she's done some digging on her own and come up with another case similar to hers, also involving a female police officer.  Unlike Nan, however, the other officer didn't survive.That said, when this particular story opens, Nan and her partner, Jim Kissick are in the middle of a lover's' tryst when they're both called out to a homicide. A man dressed as a clown was gunned down while spray painting gangland graffiti on a mosaic at a construction site. The tag reads China Dog 187.  According to California's Penal Code a 187 is a murder so the graffiti would be understood to mean Death to China Dog.  When their gangbanger' s tattoos reveal him to be a former member of the Latin Kings they are puzzled as to why he would be threatening China Dog? As far as they knew the Kings weren't at was with any Chinese gangs.  However, Nan is quick to point out that the writing on the wall looks familiar. It reminds her of her attacker's handwriting, looks the same as the card he sent with the necklace. Was this killing the guy's way of sending a message to Nan? When she mentions it in front of her co-workers they think she's imagining things. Even Kissick seems skeptical so Nan drops it. For one thing, Kissick doesn't know all Nan does about her case. Nor is he aware she obtained information as well as evidence illegally, something that could cost her not only her job but her relationship with him as well.As they settle into the case, Nan is surprised when she is suddenly put in charge. It seems Kissick has a new lead on Nan' s case so he's been assigned to look into it while Nan handles the murder.This one kept my interest from start to finish. I couldn't read fast enough, I so wanted to discover what happened in the end.  And let me tell you, it came as a shock to me! Didn't see it coming at all!  I also enjoyed the way Nan' s relationship with Kissick progressed.  She wants to keep it quiet, he doesn't care who knows so when he goes out of his way to protect her from ridicule by another officer, she gets upset.  She's his partner, yes, but also her lover, and he's having a hard time separating the two.  I also like the fact Nan is tough while on the job yet still plagued privately by insecurity stemming from her attack. Little things, for instance, can trigger a panic attack. The scars on her neck and hand make her oftentimes feel self-conscious.  The author did a great job creating the characters. Even Nan' s daughter, Emily, adds to the appeal of the story having suffered right along with her mother as they tried to pick up the pieces of their lives and move forward after the attack.There's plenty of suspense, action and danger, along with a little romance on the side. Definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQKLVL1QSNZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S59CO6#wasThisHelpful","R1FQKLVL1QSNZL","A3JVICFD5REACI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVICFD5REACI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kade went to the airport to pick up their new ranch hand. It would be good to have another single guy around. All his brothers had found their soul mates, gotten married and started having babies. And they were constantly razzing him about being the only one yet to find a wife.  He didn't think his chances were very good considering the family ranch was out in the middle of nowhere. The closest town had one blinking light, a gas station convenience store, and not a whole lot else.Ryan worked harder than any man on her family ranch, putting in long hours and loving every minute of it.

"Aroostine and husband Joe, are on a sort of celebratory getaway.  After being separated, on the verge of divorce, Joe was almost killed because of a case Aroostine got involved in because of her job as an assistant United States attorney.  While away, she gets a call from her former boss asking if she can contact a potential witness in an embezzling case. It seems the guy has gotten cold feet about testifying and isn't returning their calls.  Put out because he's contacting her during her time off but knowing it will help her career if she does it , she reluctantly agrees. Joe isn't at all happy when he finds out she's gone to talk to the guy and he's dead!  Once again they are placed in danger and have to run for their lives.What makes these books even more intriguing is Aroostine' s Native American heritage and the culture included in the story.

A very wise man, she begins to recall things he told her that actually help on her case.I would definitely recommend this book, especially to all mystery and suspense fans who like a bit of a different twist to their stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHIGC6NYFKPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KPY6U#wasThisHelpful","R1KHIGC6NYFKPV","A3JVICFD5REACI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVICFD5REACI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second book in the Nan Vining series was a good one.  The detective and her partner, Jim Kissick, are called to the scene of a brutal double murder. A local businessman and his girlfriend were the victims.  He was dismembered and her neck was broken, their bodies posed in a macabre fashion.  There's a bloody footprint obviously made by a woman's high heels.  Problem is, the size is more in keeping with what a man would wear. A cross dressing killer?As their investigation progresses, we are also brought up to date on Nan' s attempt to find the man who ambushed her, stabbed her, and left her bleeding out on the kitchen floor.  He sent her a necklace and a note once she'd recovered. The same type of necklace he sent to the husband of another murdered police officer who'd been ambushed. Now the guy is sending her notes about her daughter, tormenting her.  Determined to find him, she's looking on her own and keeping it a secret from her partner. He suspects something is going on and is determined to get to the bottom of it, even as he's doing his best to coax her back in his bed. Lovers before, she'd gotten scared and broke things off when he brought up the 'L' word.I love the characters in this series. Although Nan comes across as this tough as nails cop, she's still struggling with what happened to her.  She's also angry that her husband left her for his hairdresser, a younger woman, after having cheated on her. Now they live in a huge house with a pool, take vacations, and have a couple of kids while Nan struggles to pay the bills. She misses Kissick but is leery about resuming their affair. Kissick is equally interesting. Handsome, down to earth, he can be tough but caring, has a good sense of humor, and assuredly loves Nan.Can't wait to see what they get involved in next and whether Nan will catch up to her attacker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GH930R6NS9O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OLRMSW#wasThisHelpful","R1GH930R6NS9O6","A3JVICFD5REACI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVICFD5REACI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic debut! Miranda comes to Christmas, Tennessee, on the trail of a serial killer. Her brother was wrongly convicted of the crimes and is serving the time in prison. Determined to prove his innocence, she goes after the real villain, Father Peter Anatole. She knows he did it, she just has to find enough evidence to convince the police. Sheriff Tucker Ambrose finds Miranda attractive but he's got enough experience under his belt to know when someone is lying and he's sure she isn't telling him her real reason for being in his town.  When she's caught breaking into the Catholic church he demands answers to his questions.  Unfortunately, he's not happy about it, not when a dead body turns up and all the evidence seems to support her suspicions.  Still, it could be a copycat. After all, a jury found Miranda' s brother guilty so the police had enough information to put him away, even though she claims he was framed by Father Anatole!  Tucker promises he'll keep an open mind. If her theory is correct and whoever is doing this is fulfilling the sacraments, then there will be more dead bodies before they are through. And when the killer comes after Miranda, she could end up being dead too!This one kept me turning the pages and had me guessing until the end.  While at first Miranda seemed rather annoying,  I quickly came to like her as she fought to get her brother out of jail.  It was evident the author did her research on police procedure and investigations as she paid close attention to detail and did an excellent job of bringing the book to its satisfactory conclusion.

"Olivia Chandler is starting life over. After being wrongly accused of her ex-husband's murder, she jumps bail, gets a new identity and heads to Alaska to hide from the hit man hired to take her out. After two attempts on her life she's not about to hang around and wait for him to try again.  Now she owns a diner, has a guard dog who's been expertly trained, and is slowly beginning to make friends in her new locale.Rafe Brodie owns a trio of charter boats and makes regular stops at Liv' s diner. All the women have the hots for him in spite of the fact he has no plans to settle down and commit himself to any one person.  Olivia goes out of her way to avoid him. She's attracted to him, yes, but knows he's nothing but trouble given her circumstances. She's just beginning to get her life back together. The last thing she needs is a guy to complicate the situation even further. However, Rafe is a hard man to resist, especially when he wants something and he wants Olivia in the worst way.When a mutual friend is murdered, the two of them work together to try and find the man's killer. What they stumble across in the process puts them both in danger and threatens the very town they've come to love.Once I started this I couldn't put it down. It kept me turning the pages, anxious to find out what happens. There is plenty of action and suspense, a wide variety of characters that you quickly become involved with, and a hot, steamy romance that is sure to satisfy any dedicated reader of the genre. In my opinion, this was the best Brodie book yet.  Kat Martin pulled out all the stops in taking you on a wild ride from the opening murder scene to the end of the book where you are sitting on pins and needles, waiting to see how the author is going to resolve Olivia' s situation once her secrets are exposed.

"Jessi Brand was all grown up. She'd graduated college, was officially a licensed veterinarian, and ready to make her mark on the world. She was also in love with Lash Monroe. He was a drifter helping her brothers  on their ranch.  While Lash finds her tempting as all get out, there's no way he's getting involved. She's his boss's sister for one thing and while Garrett could be a formidable foe, he's got four brothers to back him up.  They'd probably kill him and feed his body to the wolves if they found out he'd been eyeing their baby sister. Even so, when Jessi insists on throwing herself at him, Lash finds it impossible to say no.  When he finds out she's a virgin and he was her first, he feels so guilty he tells her they need to get married.  Only he m akes it sound like marrying her was a punishment for his sins!  It seems like things can't get any worse when someone from Lash' s past puts Jessi's life in danger.  That's when it really gets interesting. A very enjoyable read.

I loved Justin's geeky character and the way he was so into Raney from the start but a misunderstanding has him thinking she'd never be interested in his type of guy.  As a result he comes across as cold and distant, convincing her he doesn't like her.

"I thought this book was good when I started reading it but then it seemed like it was going to end much too soon and I just wasn't satisfied.  All of a sudden there was this unexpected twist to the story I didn't expect and pretty soon I was quickly turning pages, anxious to discover what happened.  Thankfully everything was brought to a satisfying conclusion and left room for future books in the series.  I found the heroine in the story totally likeable with a mind of her own and a refusal to be what society and others dictated she be. Claudia was stubborn, independent, and had a heart of gold. She was perfect for Micah.  He came to Washington D. C. looking for his sister.  He'd had a vision of her in danger and he was determined to save her.

"This was one of the best Intrigues I've ever read. Noelle worked with a covert group of operatives, but on this particular mission she was paired with Thomas. He was tall, dark and Dangerous with a capital D.  The were going after a Senator they believed had tried to destroy the EOD where they worked. Several years earlier, Noelle had been kidnapped but she'd managed to get out alive. Unfortunately, her memories of the event escaped her. So why was working with Thomas all of a sudden causing her to remember bits and pieces of that time? What she doesn't realize is that Thomas is a man with secrets, one of them being that he's loved Noelle ever since he found her running in the forest, fleeing from her captor. He was after a terrorist cell and couldn't blow his cover. What he did back then could destroy any chance he might have with her. He knew his day of reckoning was coming. First, however, they needed to take down the Senator and then subsequently the killer tied to Noelle' s kidnapping. As they work together to do so, Noelle realizes there's a lot more to her partner than what she's been led to believe and despite her attraction to him, what she discovers might ruin their relationship forever. So many twists and turns, an evil villain that's bent on getting to Noelle, and a hero that will do anything to protect her, even if it means dying for her. Excellent read. Couldn't put it down.

"This was a fantastic read, giving the reader a glimpse into a modern day high school and the dangers lurking there for both teachers and students alike. This book is well-researched and based primarily on fact. Susanna is principal at Fairholm High. When the Superintendent informs her two Secret Service agents are going undercover at the school because it's been deemed a high risk for violence, she isn't happy about it. She's always believed in a policy of honesty and integrity for staff and students both and to deceive everyone goes against the grain. Given no choice in the matter, she has to agree to Joe coming on as a counselor while his partner, Luke, goes undercover as a student. Joe's niece was the victim of a school shooter so he has first hand experience in this type of thing.  While working to discover potential risks and threats involved there's a nice attraction developing between Joe and Susanna while Luke struggles to remain in character when he's more that attracted to one of the teachers. Plenty of suspense involved and just enough romance to add to the story's appeal. Really enjoyed this one.

If you  are like me you sit there wondering why? What made the book so enjoyable?  In this case I'm sure the subject matter played a part. Military men, especially damaged ones have a way of getting to you.  Then there's the author's writing style. I haven't read one book of hers I haven't enjoyed.  She has a way of using her characters to draw you into the story and I loved Cat and Harper.  Cat was a very strong woman and there was no doubting she loved Harper. When he's wounded and near death she arrives at the hospital much to the surprise of his team. They didn't know he was married or that he had two kids.  The fact Cat hadn't seen him for a year and a half should have made things awkward for them but Harper was glad she'd come. He'd missed her terribly and needed her calm demeanor in the midst of his current storm.  He'd left his family because after his last deployment he'd been paranoid and feared he'd hurt one of them.  Employment at LNF and his visits to a counselor have helped but he wasn't sure if he was ready for them all to be together again.  Cat came prepared to fight for her marriage but she also carried divorce papers in her purse. This was her last stand. No more separation, no more battling his fears alone. She'd spent seventy-five percent of her married life alone and it was too much for her and the kids to take.  The feelings these two people had for one another were real but you felt Harper's pain and understood his indecisiveness.  His leaving had been all about getting himself right, healing, so they could be a family unit again and while he knew he was better, he still hadn't completely conquered his fears.  You also felt Cat's pain and her desire to be with her husband again. They'd been married fourteen years and in spite of their time apart she still loved him like she did the day they'd met","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VAPSK6CQZFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VCGC266#wasThisHelpful","R17VAPSK6CQZFB","A3JVICFD5REACI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVICFD5REACI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I was getting a romance novel when in truth I got a sex manual. Seriously, if you are looking for a book with a plot this isn't the one for you.  Maggie had never had an orgasm so when a friend tells her about the ""service"" she got at the tattoo parlor down the street, Maggie decides that's the answer to her problem. She schedules an appointment with Eduardo but when she throws herself at him she discovers its actually his twin, Rafel.  While he turns her away, he can't help but be intrigued so he makes her his project of sorts. He teases and torments her, driving her crazy and leaving her hanging on the verge for days while he goes home and jerks off in the shower. (Not making this up) When he decides to forego seeing her for a few days, sure this is the only way to make her come, she takes matters into her own hands and hunts him down. After calling him names and telling him off, he once again overwhelms her with his sexual prowess and she FINALLY achieves her goal, an orgasm with a capital O!  By now, she is crazy for him but when she asks where the relationship is going, he balks.  Of course, predictably, he's miserable without her so he looks her up and she once again falls into his arms. By this time I'm wondering how much more of this I have to take. I actually did last to the end, wading through Rafel' s one true love coming back on the scene declaring she wants him again which almost sends Maggie packing. But all's well that ends well and Rafel realizes he loves Maggie and wants to be with her. I gave this two stars because I kind of liked the characters even if I found the book's premise bordering on ridiculous and the writing wasn't bad all things considered. It was my first time reading the author and unfortunately probably my last.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0QS2TW2A0IQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPRP39I#wasThisHelpful","R1L0QS2TW2A0IQ","A3JVICFD5REACI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVICFD5REACI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The printer arrived undamaged and unpacked fairly easily. The wireless setup for computers downstairs and one upstairs was quick and effortless, printing test sheets from both the second floor and on street level with no problem.I have owned several Canon printers and recommend them.  I like their text printing and the color photo printing too. This printer printed an 8x10” color photo clearly on Canon’s Photo Paper Plus Glossy II and with good color reproduction, as good as my MX922 (I printed the same photo a second time on the same paper from the MX922 for comparison)—but not quite as sharp as the photo appeared on my computer screen.Some disappointments. (1) The MX922 has an automatically opening paper tray door, but with this printer you have to open two paper tray doors manually before printing. For me, this means when I’m ready to print, going downstairs to turn on the printer and to open the paper tray doors (there are two doors to open for the one tray) and check that the right paper is in place. (2) That brings me to the next disappointment: only one paper tray.  So, for example, if I want to switch from letter size document printing to a 4x6” photo, I have to go downstairs again, pull out the letter-sized paper, adjust the printer tray lever for the smaller paper and put it in the tray. Then return upstairs to give the print command. (3) Also, the one-and-only paper tray holds a fairly small amount of paper. Its front door will not close if there is too much paper in the tray since the paper bends upward with the closing of the door. These are not major problems but are minor inconveniences.We also printed from an iPhone. The first iPhone didn’t seem to want to recognize the printer, so we tried another iPhone (same make and model—5C) and it connected with this printer immediately with no problem. We printed a photo on plain paper, large size, 8 x 10.5”, and the printing was excellent.Recommended for those who do not mind the inconvenience noted above with the paper tray and its doors and especially for those who are looking for a printer that accommodates wireless devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2J15BXC9Z12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZCCU#wasThisHelpful","R2A2J15BXC9Z12","A1NS6O584WD5FJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NS6O584WD5FJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We mounted this on the wall behind my desk. I have two monitors, and now my monitor on the right swings outward to the right as well as turning to the right (revolving) so that I can use it for photos I want to refer to while painting (my painting table and easel are to the right of my computer desk).Packaging was fine, so it arrived without any damage, and the package was fairly easy to open.The only difficulty in mounting was finding the studs in the wall to screw the large screws into. The monitor plate has holes that fit perfectly to the back of the monitor. So once the wall mount was attached to the wall and the plate to the monitor, it was just a matter of a few seconds to assemble the arm--super easy--and it functioned perfectly. I can rotate the monitor (landscape to portrait position), easily swing it left or right, up, and push it back to close to flush with the wall.Note: I would consider carefully whether you want to mount its base on a wall (that is with the base positioned vertically) or flat on a surface like a desk and make sure you purchase the correct version. The Arms and the hardware of the two versions differ.Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MF43K7IGJF8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QZCT5W#wasThisHelpful","R3MF43K7IGJF8M","A1NS6O584WD5FJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NS6O584WD5FJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked these especially for storing odds and ends and small writing tools like pens and pencils for transport to the field for sketching. Also, I will use them for some foods, not all. Here's why: (1) a rather small opening for inserting food, especially when using a spoon (the zipper and its stops at each end make the opening smaller). (2) The ad boasts ""Storage Slider bags feature patented MaxLock Track to ensure a secure seal."" I tested this  with water in a bag half-full, I closed it and held the bag upside down, and water leaked out. So I do not recommend storing liquids in these bags.On  the positive side, other then noted above, the bags seem well-made and are economically priced. They do close easily and are good for storage of some items. I do not recommend using these a freezer bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPCKY6352LR4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMVYPEG#wasThisHelpful","RPCKY6352LR4G","A1NS6O584WD5FJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NS6O584WD5FJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well-made and nice-looking camera bag. It is a compromise between storage capacity and size. You can have a lot of storage in a bag, but it can easily become a bulky bag awkward to tote around with you. So the result here is a medium-sized bag that is fairly sleek but not with a lot of storage--but probably enough for photographers willing to pack carefully.There are two noteworthy features: (1) The add says, ""Water-resistant Dura Base offers protection and stability from the ground up."" It does offer stability and probably is waterproof (though I haven't tested it yet).  (2 The ad also says, ""Innovative hammock system suspends camera body for superior impact protection""--this means that your camera sits in this hammock with the lens facing down toward the padded bottom of the case. The distance from where the camera body's front sits in the hammock to the bottom of the case is about 4"". The width of the hammock opening where your camera lens slides through is also about 4"" (maximum). Both the hammock and the padding are attached with Velcro can can be removed or their position adjusted some (See the second photo below that shows the inside of the main compartment with the  hammock on the left and the padding on the right. The top of the photo also shows an inside accessories pocket.The first photo below shows one of the two side pockets and the rear pocket both open.I have had good luck with Case Logic products, and I expect this one to work well and be durable.So if you are looking for a medium-sized camera bag that will hold and protect a small to medium DSLR camera and some accessories, I would check out this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HMYX0UHW3S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRMS#wasThisHelpful","R31HMYX0UHW3S8","A1NS6O584WD5FJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NS6O584WD5FJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a rather elegant looking dispenser. It certainly looks better that a bottle of mouthwash on the bathroom sink. The pump works well, bringing up mouthwash into the top pouring area a  little at a time. I need to pump twice to get the amount I usually use (which is not a lot, say about the amount in a shot glass). To fill this dispenser you unscrew the bottom section, pour in the mouthwash, then screw it  back together snugly.The brushed nickel, silicon and plastic parts seem well-made, so I expect it to be durable. It measures 9"" from top to bottom, with the cup in place on top, and just under 3"" in diameter at the bottom.Two negative aspects: (1) It doesn't hold a lot of mouthwash, about a drinking-glass amount or a little less. Also (2) it doesn't pour cleanly. It dribbles down its side when you pour (I tried this more than once to check it), and hence leaves a small amount of mouthwash on the sink as well as the side of the dispenser, requiring cleaning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5I9TWV9HLR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZA1HBO#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5I9TWV9HLR5","A1NS6O584WD5FJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NS6O584WD5FJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Cicadas Cry was another beautiful love story by this wonderful author. Here Ms. Miller yet again creates the kind of characters I so very much love from her books; genuine, humble, and heartwarming characters that captivate with the simplest of words because you just feel them speaking from the heart. Something else I love about this author, which was beautifully portrayed in this book as well, it's how she can so easily make my heart melt over and over again with just two people falling in love with each other. I think that's a very unique attribute to this author and the reason why I keep going back to her stories for more of that heartfelt romance.“In the next heartbeat, her light green eyes are on me, and then before too long, all I feel is a smile pushin’ up my face. And it’s funny, but I swear the world just stops, like literally, just freezes on its axis, just so we can have our moment—a private moment, where we say everything and nothin’ at all. And I can’t be sure what she’s sayin’, but I know what I’m sayin’. I’m sayin’: I like you; I think you might like me, at least a little; and I don’t want this conversation to end; and I, sure as hell, don’t want this night to end.”This story takes place in a small town in Missouri and it begins when town boy meets city girl. When Remington sees Ashley for the first time he's completely taken by her. Her beauty, her playfulness, and her curious personality were all like a straight arrow to Rem's heart. That's why after that meeting he feels like he has to know her and find out if she could ever feel the same way about him. Well, fortunately for Rem the same happens to Ashley. She also gets completely smitten by his charms, persistence, and attractiveness even at a time in her life where she wasn't exactly looking for love but couldn't help but fall for Rem.“For the first time in a really long time, I feel as if it might not be so bad to fall head over heels for a beautiful stranger. And maybe it's because he doesn't feel like a stranger at all, really.”But as soon as you feel the love and tenderness getting a hold of the characters that's when the plot in the story starts to spin. With chapters that alternate between past and present, Rem and Ashley's story is told from a past where they're in love to a present where they're brokenhearted and apart. So the big question is what happened? Well, that's the emotional journey these characters take you on and it's not a perfect one. It's a journey of love, faith, and the precious moments that make all the difference.“Why does it have to hurt so much?” I ask. Her smile fades a little.“It’s not supposed to be painless, Rem. It’s supposed to be worth it.”Again, something this author does wonderfully is making the characters fall deeply in love and I absolutely love that about her stories. Even when the 'falling in love' is a process, I can always see and feel it happening in the perfect moments she creates with all the firsts between the characters and how magical those moments truly feel to me. So yes, I looove romance and I was very happy to have found it again in When Cicadas Cry. This story sure delivered on it with a heartfelt story about faith, strength, and a beautiful message about how love isn't always painless but definitely worth everything to keep it. ♥“Real love bleeds. That’s how you know it’s real.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SU0HR7GI3QP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y5PCXS8#wasThisHelpful","R2SU0HR7GI3QP4","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love how an author can create a hero so set in his ways that you think it would be impossible for him to change but then he does and what happens then it's amazing. Sustained was that kind of story and Jake Becker was exactly that kind of hero; a successful defense attorney and a womanizer that in a million years would have thought that his life would change completely for one single woman and her six kids.“I can’t think of anything I wouldn’t do for you.”At thirty years old, Jake has a set plan for his life: keep being the best at this job and always keep it strictly casual with the ladies. That's all he wants for his present and foreseeable future and he couldn't be more content with the idea. However, after a recent scare he realizes that nameless one-night-stands might not be the best option for him anymore so he decides to give dating a try even against his better judgement. It's during that time when he meets Chelsea McQuaid, a twenty-six-years old single, gorgeous, and enchanting woman that couldn't make him hotter even if she tried. The problem is that she's a package deal with being the guardian of her six orphaned nieces and nephews and a situation that couldn't be farthest from simple. So as expected, Chelsea and the kids are an immediate red-flag for Jake because again, the man is too set in his ways to even contemplate getting into that messy situation. Or so he thought. . .“I don’t know if it’s because I have a hard-on for his aunt or because he reminds me so much of myself, but if anyone wants a piece of that kid they’ll have to come through me first.”And that's when the magic of this book starts and what made it totally swoony for me. Seeing Jake give in little by little regardless of everything he'd planned before was so heart-melting, funny, and irresistible. This is a man that wasn't supposed to be the the touchy-feely kind of guy, oh no, instead he wanted to feel indifferent and tried not to let himself get bothered by the new feelings for this Chelsea and the kids. Yet this story shows how life can change in a blink of an eye when he let himself love and be loved. ♥ I have to emphasize once again how heart-melting and swoony this book was so picture this: six kids from ages of six-months to fourteen-years old who are a little bit of trouble makers but are as sweet as they come and a stubborn Jake that tries his hardest but can't help to fall in love with every single one of them. That plus Jake's connection with the kindhearted and sweet Chelsea were all really a beautiful and stellar love story to read.“Their joy, their laughter, their love. I want to come home to it, bask in it, be the reason for it. But even more than that, I want to deserve them.”I loved everything about this book: the excellent humor throughout the story, the chemistry between Jake and Chelsea, the sweet innocence of the kids, and the connections they all made. But within all those great times what I loved the most about this book has to be the little moments. You know, those moments where with just a word or a touch the characters make your heart swell with emotions? Yeah, that's what I'm talking about and there several of those in this book which I thought made all the difference for me making this story that much more heartfelt and wonderful. So for that I totally recommend this book if you enjoy heartwarming, sweet, and fun romances. This story will definitely make you smile from ear to ear, I'm telling you! Sustained can be read as a standalone so you can jump right into it. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5K93PO94CL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R2L5K93PO94CL8","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story was really something. It was funny as I expected since I'm very familiar with this author's magical humor but what I didn't anticipate was its surprising plot. Here the author introduces the hero and the story of his first love which then almost drives the whole book and I found that a little risky. Risky because I usually like to connect both my hero and heroine romantically right away and with too much of their past histories that can make it kind of difficult. Fortunately, I did connect them and felt connected to them at the end as the hero made me laugh even at times when I wanted to slap him into his senses, hehe. ;)Stanton Shaw is a successful twenty-eight-years old defense attorney who lives a carefree life. Based in D.C. he makes sure he never gets attached to any woman other than the two he has in Missouri, his precious ten-year old daughter and high school sweetheart Jenny. Oh don't panic, no cheating in this story at all. You see, Stanton and Jenny have an arrangement that while apart they can live their lives freely but always keeping other relationships casual. That's how it's always been for them since Stanton moved out for college and law school and after their daughter was born. So of course with that arrangement, it's perfectly fine for Stanton to have his fun in D.C. and he currently has it with Sofia Santos, his dear friend and lawyer colleague.“With a sharp grin and an almost evil spark in her eye, she grips my tie and pulls me back in for a kiss.”Since day one Sofia has known about Stanton's past, his current situation in Missouri, and how their relationship could only be strictly casual sex. She's been totally fine with the arrangement and has been enjoying it just as much as him. However, when Stanton gets a very unexpected invitation to Jenny's wedding and he drags her there to help him stop the wedding, she soon starts to feel something more for her so called ""friend with benefits.""“What we have—what he and I do together—is fun. Physical and convenient. And above all else, it was supposed to be simple. But the sick feeling in my stomach, the tinge of sour jealousy on my tongue—there’s nothing simple about that.”Once they head to Missouri this story goes completely nuts and I loved it. There's crazy family members, tension, regrets, competition, and lots of confusion. During all that again, I did feel like slapping Stanton so he would wake up and make up his mind but it was also too funny to see him struggle in the mess he was in. Moreover, while him and Sofia took their time to realize their true feelings for each other and figuring out their situation, they had me laughing in the madness that was Missouri and everybody in there. Not to mention, I felt that their connection kept getting stronger with every chapter so it was very clear for me who was my heroine and what love story I was supposed to be cheering for. Yeah, when that switch finally happened it was perfect. ♥“Darlin’, you have me. By the heart, by the balls, and any other way you want.”I found this book sexy, funny and unexpected. I really enjoyed it. The humor, sexiness, and characters in the story really made me a fan of the series. Now I'm very curious to see what Ms. Chase has up her sleeve for the stories of Stanton's friends Jake (Sustained) and Brent (Appealed)! :D","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16N6PLVCWR4KP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK394JI#wasThisHelpful","R16N6PLVCWR4KP","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a sweet love story, I loved Matt and Grace. Their story was the kind of romance is only found once in a lifetime and so no matter life choices, timing, and/or the circumstances, it's the kind of love the heart can never let go.“You can’t re-create the first time you promise to love someone or the first time you feel loved by another. You cannot relive the sensation of fear, admiration, self-consciousness, passion, and desire all mixed into one because it never happens twice. You chase it like the first high for the rest of your life.”These two characters meet during college, a time where both of them didn't know what the future held. Yet, it was also a time full of many possibilities so between the attraction and strong connection they first shared, Grace and Matt immediately became ""fast friends."" I really loved how their romance began, it was carefree, authentic, and fun. Just two best friends falling in love with each other, sharing every moment, and taking it all into memory. Oh that was so special to their story, the memories. How Matt as a photography major was always taking pictures and capturing all those precious moments with Grace. And her, the talented music major, so passionate about creating music with her cello and sharing it all with Matt. The two of them were just in a high-paced college romance that even though it had a lot of reality to it, they always managed to make it special and worth it.“You called us fast friends. I like to think it was more.”But even with that tender love and all the good intensions, they couldn't stop life from happening to them and so they're forced to make some tough decisions that soon enough take over their present and future. It's until fifteen-years later that they find each other once again and the way that happens was really unique and heartfelt, I loved it. From the very beginning I could feel the magic between these two characters so when they reconnect again, it truly made me happy. However, reconnecting was just the start of their story. The plot soon reveals that there were too many loose ends, unanswered questions, and two broken hearts that needed healing for the story to yet come full circle. So I was excited and anxious to know what happened to their story but thankfully, the author surprised me in such a delightful way. She not only made me love this second chance romance more by the end with how she reconnects two true soul mates, but also by beautifully amending their imperfect and broken love story. Because Matt and Grace were always a love meant to be and their story proved that against all the odds and missed connections.“Weren’t we though? Timeless? Nothing could change what we’d had all those years before, even if the idea of what might’ve been lingered between us.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CB8F00ML8XO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65X7MI#wasThisHelpful","R2CB8F00ML8XO7","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this fifth installment might just be the darkest and most powerful yet in this series. Seriously, this book had me on the edge of suspense and it made my skin crawl more than a few times. Yeah, I gasped and cringed for my dear characters but everything they go through was so precisely elaborated that the experiences gave them that much needed courage and strength and I loved them getting stronger. Not to mention that darkness in the story was so thrilling to read as it made me FEEL so much.""Live for me. Breathe for me. Come back to life for me.""I can truly say this book has prepared me for the big finale. Oh yes, I'm so pumped for retribution and justice to happen in this story that's not even a joke. I can't wait for Nila and Jethro's last chapter because thanks to the Fourth Debt I know is going to be of epic proportions where definitely good will win over evil.""It was me versus them now. I wouldn't back down again. I'm done being tortured. It was their turn.""I have loved the incredible ride these characters have taken me and this book was another amazing breakthrough. Here's where the strength an faith of Nila and Jethro are really put to the test and as terrifying as it was to see them endure so much, it was also exhilarating to see how mentally powerful they've have become. Witnessing that growth in them did wonders for me but I have to say, what I loved the most about this book was how the author manipulated my emotions so intensively. Ms. Winters has not only made me passionate about the good feelings (love, faith, forgiveness) in this story, no, she has also achieved to make me feel strongly passionate about the not so good feelings too (revenge, hate) and all on behalf of my two dear characters. That really goes far to say how extremely invested I feel about this whole story no matter where it takes me. ♥""Fear was a strong emotion, but it had nothing on love.""So kudos to Ms. Winters again, this is the fifth book in this series that I loved and devoured with pleasure. This story has been just amazing and for that I cannot wait for Final Debt and see how the final punch is delivered. I know one thing though, it's going to be EPIC fore sure! :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E99R4VQ1LOVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6BY24Q#wasThisHelpful","R3E99R4VQ1LOVT","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's truly amazing to me the talent of this author. Since book one in this Indebted series I felt this story was going to be something to behold but now after this book I can totally say what an understatement that was. After four books with the same characters Ms. Winters continues to engage me, truly captivate me, and surprise me with how she can manipulate a story and keep making it more brilliant. So brilliant that there's never been a dull moment in this series for me, oh no, there's always been something remarkable with each book and that something this time with Third Debt was the empowering love.“Death had tried to claim me only for love to save me instead.”In this fourth installment the plot is at its peak. Emotions, regrets, and fears are all over the place and these two passionate characters just keep trying to assimilate their torturous fucked-up reality and finally accept the truth. That is, the truth about their intense feelings for each other and how they no longer can suppress them. It's until then that their love really becomes that empowering love the two of them so desperately needed and the way that finally happens is truly breathtaking.“I don’t want to win or lose anymore. I just want you.”I found this book perfect. It gave me the romance I so much crave for, kept me in such suspense, and the development/growth of the characters made me love them even more. Oh yes, I can't say it enough, Nila Weaver is a magnificent heroine. This woman continues to amaze me with her strength/courage and captivate me with her unconditional love for Jethro. She's just incredible and with every book she becomes more and more a powerful and unforgettable character to me. Now, Jethro's evolution hasn't been as straightforward as Nila's, no, his been more complex and I've loved it. There's so many layers to what makes him the character that he is that his transformation couldn't be easy but the results have truly been mind-blowing particularly in this book.“I wished she would stay away. Her concern might be a blanket, but her love… S***, her love was a blade slicing me into pieces.”I adore these characters both individually and together. Oh together, these two set the book on fire. Their passion and longing for each other was so consuming and exquisite that I felt it all from beginning to end. Loved this book, Third Debt is yet another favorite for me in this series. So GOOD!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15HLM7RIJVHNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0RJ7F0#wasThisHelpful","R15HLM7RIJVHNK","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**REVIEW OF THE COMPLETE SERIAL**Wow. Just. Wow. This book was amazing, I FLOVED IT!! Such strong, memorable, and exceptional characters with a story that was incredibly addictive and sexy. So much so that I devoured it too quickly and I couldn't get enough of it by the end. And that was all Andrew Hamilton's fault because who in their right mind could ever get enough of him? Nobody, that's who! ;D“You know,” she went on, “for a high profile lawyer, you have a pretty dirty mouth.”“You’d be surprised how much filthier it can get.”“Filthier than what I’ve already experienced?”“Much filthier.”So who's Andrew Hamilton? Well, after reading this book I discovered he's the a**hole of my dreams. LOL. Yes, Andrew is an a**hole in this story and I loved him for it because that's exactly what made him HIM, so unique, and irresistible. He's a crude, condescending, and arrogant bastard who's all about what he wants which is usually just straight up sex. Being a very successful lawyer, he's used to getting his way but even sometimes he has to work a little harder to make it clear to women that all he's looking for is: ""One dinner. One night. No repeats."" It's during one of those ""hard-working"" times of his that Aubrey Everhart enters his life as one of the interns in his law firm. The attraction is unstoppable and he feels completely drawn to her gorgeousness; however, almost immediately he realizes that they already know each other and so their ""professional"" relationship begins on heated tension and lies...“There was no justification for what she’d done, but before I cut her off, I needed to make her pay for lying to me, and I needed to figure out how.”These two were incredible together! Andrew and his a**hole-ways really had no limits so he constantly had me gasping and laughing so hard at the many inappropriate things that would come out of his mouth. I absolutely loved his confidence and how he never gave a damn about he would be perceived. He only cared about getting his point across as rude as they sounded. So with a hero like him, a heroine with a strong backbone was needed and I was so happy to see that this story totally got it. Yes, Aubrey was awesome! She wouldn't take Andrew's s**t so easily, she would give as much as she would get from him even when she couldn't resist him most of the time. And that challenging personality of hers was just one more reason he couldn't stay away from her making him break his self-imposed rules.“I was completely insatiable when it came to Aubrey, and being around her for more than five seconds was enough to send me over the edge.”Their relationship was fiery, dysfunctional, and so intense that I couldn't get enough of it. That plus the humor and the layers of secrets they shared, made this story beyond amazing to me. Reasonable Doubt has to be one of the BEST books I've read this year for sure and even though I wish I had read it sooner, I'm more ecstatic I finally read it regardless. This erotic, succulent, and highly addictive story is without a doubt a must-read from me. If you've been waiting to start this serial or are just finding out about it, please do me a favor and read it. You'll thank me later! ;)“Andrew was the epitome of what it meant to be an a**hole, a shining example of what that word stood for, but no matter how pissed I was, I hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EW474I4MF4DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1WNV5A#wasThisHelpful","R2EW474I4MF4DZ","AE4QS28WAKVQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE4QS28WAKVQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow. Just. Wow. This book was amazing, I FLOVED IT!! Such strong, memorable, and exceptional characters with a story that was incredibly addictive and sexy. So much so that I devoured it too quickly and I couldn't get enough of it by the end. And that was all Andrew Hamilton's fault because who in their right mind could ever get enough of him? Nobody, that's who! ;D“You know,” she went on, “for a high profile lawyer, you have a pretty dirty mouth.”“You’d be surprised how much filthier it can get.”“Filthier than what I’ve already experienced?”“Much filthier.”So who's Andrew Hamilton? Well, after reading this book I discovered he's the a**hole of my dreams. LOL. Yes, Andrew is an a**hole in this story and I loved him for it because that's exactly what made him HIM, so unique, and irresistible. He's a crude, condescending, and arrogant bastard who's all about what he wants which is usually just straight up sex. Being a very successful lawyer, he's used to getting his way but even sometimes he has to work a little harder to make it clear to women that all he's looking for is: ""One dinner. One night. No repeats."" It's during one of those ""hard-working"" times of his that Aubrey Everhart enters his life as one of the interns in his law firm. The attraction is unstoppable and he feels completely drawn to her gorgeousness; however, almost immediately he realizes that they already know each other and so their ""professional"" relationship begins on heated tension and lies...“There was no justification for what she’d done, but before I cut her off, I needed to make her pay for lying to me, and I needed to figure out how.”These two were incredible together! Andrew and his a**hole-ways really had no limits so he constantly had me gasping and laughing so hard at the many inappropriate things that would come out of his mouth. I absolutely loved his confidence and how he never gave a damn about he would be perceived. He only cared about getting his point across as rude as he sounded. So with a hero like him, a heroine with a strong backbone was needed and I was so happy to see that this story totally got it. Yes, Aubrey was awesome! She wouldn't take Andrew's s**t so easily, she would give as much as she would get from him even when she couldn't resist him most of the time. And that challenging personality of hers was just one more reason he couldn't stay away from her making him break his self-imposed rules.“I was completely insatiable when it came to Aubrey, and being around her for more than five seconds was enough to send me over the edge.”Their relationship was fiery, dysfunctional, and so intense that I couldn't get enough of it.

"Ram Dass says that Swami Muktananda used to eat from 24 carat gold plates and drink from solid gold goblets.Being enlightened, Swami Muktananda was above even gold. Swami Muktananda must have ordered his devotees to go out into the world to get the solid gold wears to place on his table, so he could show people that he saw gold and mud, and the world, with One vision.When Ram Dass told this story, I thought, where the hell do you find 24 carat gold goblets in Southern India?Ram Dass probably made it all up.Anyway, people report powers coming out of the Swami Muktananda and this is what this book is all about. The Swami spills the beans, as it where.. They say Adi Da Samraj also had the power, so even if it isn't enlightenment, it is still a sort of magic that we in the west don't know about.It's hard to feel shakti from Swami Muktananda by looking at his picture. Many people in the book claim that they do. Maybe you had to be in His presence first for the link to happen like in quantum none-locality where you touch a person and you are forever linked. Well I can't get it from staring at His photograph so maybe this is the case.Its also hard to tell charisma coming out of the picture of a charismatic person. We've all met super charismatic people but if we take their picture, the charisma isn't in the photograph. This is why you have to stand next to the guru to feel the power.In this book, there is much guru worship going on but I'm not one to judge.Swami Muktananda gave Franklin Jones (Adi Da) his terrifying shakti powers and look how powerful Jones became? Many attest to the power of Swami Miktananda. There was mayhem and madness in the circus concerning the swami.Even if he wasn't enlightened, there is some heavy mystery surrounding the man. The answers he gives are educational and you can chew over what he says for ages. This is hardcore guru devotion so be prepared. However, this isn't a book that will inspire you to be your own guru.The book itself is printed on quality pages and you have over 500 pages of Swami Muktananda, so I'm glad I ordered it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYYSFTXH8H7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914602276#wasThisHelpful","R1EYYSFTXH8H7B","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ronald Regan was also seen as an insignificant puppet of the Zionist Overloads, like Tony Blair, but look how they promote the legend of Regan? Thatcher was also a puppet, but not of Zion, rather, of the Bilderberg gang, before the Zionists took it over in the 1990's.There is a video on You Tube, Ken Clark is being grilled in parliament and Ken admits he's been a member of Bilderberg for years, as have most ministers, and Clarke even names a few politicians on the opposite bench. You couldn't make it up!Anyway, even when I watch Thacher on You Tube I'm amazed how stupid and slow she was. At least Tony Blair was a fast talker. Just watch Thatcher. This woman was not articulate. They say that her handlers told her to speak slow so as not to seem too threatening. But you can't act stupid and slow for a decade. Thatcher was really slow!

"Roman and Teuton is surprisingly very picturesque and brilliant. Here we have a writer, rather than an academic, so the story telling is very whimsical, with references to fairies, trolls and other tolkienesque moffits and, of course, teutons, the new kids on the block, so to speak.The man of olden times is Rome, the master for whom the Teuton will eventually replace with his mighty arms of youth.The Romans and the Teuton was written for the lecture hall so the writing is very rich in character, because it is directed at an audience, filled with dramatic tension and even if it is, what we call today, 'politically incorrect', this shows that it is us who are living in a mental straight jacket and not the Victorians.Tolkein was steeped in Medieval literature and Edward Gibbon and it shows in his books and this is what Roman and Teuton feels like.Kingsley sounds over the top in his descriptions, like a novelist, of fierce but beautiful Teutons rampaging over Rome and breeding fresh life into a dying world, but he knows the primary sources and he isn't an academic so he let's his hair down, so to speak.A word of warning, Kingsley is a Christian and they don't really exist in England anymore but that isn't a problem for me. I will rather have God in here that bloody Allah, any day of the week!Charles Kingsley was also a childrens book writer and these lectures far outweigh the scribbling of the devastatingly dry academic, choked by careerism, pseudo objectivity and relativism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLYGD47O1A2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N3RKB8#wasThisHelpful","RVLYGD47O1A2Z","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the scene where Miguel Serrano is in an ancient part of india, probably Westernised by now, where, Serrano writes, a cow is walking along the pavement, head held high, owning the way as the people move, and some even bow. Serrano comments that this snap-shot, so to speak, is the last of a 10 thousand year link where the cow is equal to man. The link is now gone.Miguel Serrano is very lucky to have witnessed this amazing miracle of a scene. As we 'progress', we will never see this scene again. There were once sages and heroes who's mannerisms were just as alien as this scene, to which the bowing to the cow is a last remnant of a vanished psyche. He wasn't to know, but on seeing the indians act this way, Miguel Serrano was transported to the age of Odysseus.It is written in the Vedas that the house cow was to give her calf the milk before the rest of the human family. I once came upon a cow on a farm path and her eyes showed deep intelligence. I can't explain, but the cow looked deeper than the stupid dog or the milky cat. There was something there that I couldn't dismiss. It seems today that many are blind. The definition of the kali-yuga is that humans lose the link and turn to weights and measures for their 'spirituality'. Only those with the link can see the cow in her splendid majesty.Serrano witnessed the last of the humans bowing to the sacred cow, before McDonalds moved in for the kill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZEG7UUA3S6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00161D3HO#wasThisHelpful","R3MZEG7UUA3S6S","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The age of chivalry is gone.

Never in history has the petty thirst for blood be so pronounced and yet so normalized by a docile population, propagandized from cradle to grave to go along with the crowd.On February 10, 1944 the Yalta Conference ended, where Mr. Roosevelt, in private conversation with Stalin, had said he was feeling ""more bloodthirsty"" than before about the Germans.In 1944, Germany was a cinder, except for the ancient city of Dresden. Dresden, with her many churches, will be a refuge.The trembling women and children flocked together in the streets, like a herd of timid animals, as if the accumulated weakness could be productive of strength, or in the vein hope that amid the crowd each individual might be safe and invisible.From every point of the city the bombers flew over, like in the Pink Floyd video where the fascist eagle overshadows the city and the hammers march down the street, and in the space of an hour, those women and children were burnt in the Hell fires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6IGKBFSM4U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0958760217#wasThisHelpful","R2O6IGKBFSM4U7","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FH Bradley wrote a letter to Bertrand Russel explaining that, as he ages, he finds refuge more and more 'in the unknown and the unknowable'.Bertrand Russel didn't reply.This is the difference between East and West.Surely, Russel must have thought, the unknown is by definition void? This is logical.Why is Bradley claiming to be living in void?In India, the philosophical method of Bradley is jnana yoga. Indians claim that the path of knowledge can lead to enlightenment. But only the highly gifted philosopher can transcend.  The unknown and unknowable are known only to the jnani. So FH Bradley was really experiencing the state of the Buddha, a state beyond description, like the way a Bach melody is beyond description, not because it is impossible, but because it is of a higher magnitude of ponderance than that of logic. The Absolute is lost to Bertrand Russel because a giant can never fit into the shoes of a dwarf.This explains the cryptic statement of FH Bradley.As you can see, FH Bradley was born on the wrong continent.FH Bradley was ahead of his time. His meditations on the Absolute were lampooned by philosophers like Bertrand Russell but the terrestrial logical mind, forever in the dark, can only snigger like a Monty Python actor because, as Goethe wrote.""I see the learning in what you say.What you don't touch, for you lies miles awayWhat you don't grasp, is wholly lost to youWhat you don't reckon, you believe not trueWhat you don't weigh, this has for you no weightWhat you don't count, you're sure is counterfeit"".Goethe is describing the mentality of Bertrand Russel.Why else is idealism lampooned in the academy and not taken seriously?

"At the end of Elementary Particles, the scene set in the future, an exhausted human race embraces technological nihilism. To be sheeple, forever herded by robots, was Michel Houellebecq's brilliant answer to nihilism. The singularitarian movement is based on nihilism. God is dead but we'll invent our own Gods! In other words, the true meaning, we cancel ourselves out, to be replaced by the void.Many transhumanists philosophers are so clever that they can paint the crazier ideas as life embracing. You don't get cleverer that Michel Houellebecq.In Submission, Islam is the answer. They say Michel Houellebecq was on the run because he was critical of Islam. That's marketing.The idea of artificial intelligence and robots is old hat. What isn't old hat is muslim demographics. Islam is the next big thing and the non muslim the birthrate has collapse anyway, and nihilism has crept into materialism, so why not?In all honesty, an Islamic France, and Europe, won't be all that bad and Submission is as realistic as you can get. I mean, it's not like modern materialism makes people happy.Houellebecq writes, in the form of the character 'Rediger', so why not a return to God? The family is broken anyway, Rediger argues, and the reason for the collapsing birthrate is that women have become slaves for the hourly wage. Who has time to make babies anyway?In the modern world, couples both work like dogs, until, like lead, they return home, almost dead! At least Islam embraces family values. Islam is a revolt against the modern world. The modern world being materialism, the slave mentality of the female, the corporate suite, the destroyer of the family.Michel Houellebecq explains all this very well.The last 40 pages is a philosophical treasure trove of high flying philosophy. Michel Houellebecq is a philosopher of the highest order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7T6TJBPSY1NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374271577#wasThisHelpful","R7T6TJBPSY1NB","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Kurt Godel saw the same sloppy thinking when it came to mind.See Rudy Rucker 4th Dimension.

"Terence McKenna said that DMT is the doorway to the post-death state. When you smoke DMT, you rip through to the ecology of souls. The post-death reality for which this apparent living world we now inhabit is but a shadow, is revealed, at last, by DMT. Those who've never dried DMT live in the shadows all of their lives, not noticing the reality there but hidden by the optical illusion of the consensus trance.The Catholics tried to ban Galileo's telescope to keep power. Today, the reason for the worldwide DMT ban is that the world government wants us to remain permanently in financial turmoil, like slaves on a wheel, shopping for the sake of shopping, eating burgers and sports, with nothing higher to strive for. For with nothing to strive for but mortgage payments, the modern human is getting more stuck to the forces of bondage. DMT will be the antidote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULS9GE36NM9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583947914#wasThisHelpful","R2ULS9GE36NM9G","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find little transcendental quality in reading the Quran. Much may be lost in translation, but I can't detect the creator of the universe inside this book. What I find is an Arabian Spirit, somewhat similar to the Spirit of the burning bush; an agitated, terrestrial spirit, far removed from the transcendental God of the Christian or the Indian.Even the description of the muslim paradise is merely a mirror of primitive human desires. Only in the Quran does God himself describe heaven. No other religion does this. But the description doesn't sound like what God would say.I can see why a paradise filled with running water and dancing girls will be luxurious to a seventh century desert tribesman, but coming from the lips of God himself, this is worrying! You will expect God himself to say more than big breasted girls in heaven, with you sat on a splendid jewelled couch, with fresh water to drink.The God in the Quran feels like the God of the Arabian man, living and fighting and riding camels, rather than the God who caused the big bang and who made the milky way.The women issue always comes up but the Arabian man has some sound wisdom concerning girls, no sarcasm intended. It does say that women must be treated with respect and dignity. Women are not equal in Islam but western feminists seem to agree!However, the imagination of the Arabian man falls down when it comes to paradise for women.Why isn't there a description of the female paradise? Maybe so the muslim husband won't get jealous? But what about the muslim wife? She's being told by Allah that her husband, if he's a good muslim, won't be forever faithful to her in heaven, and even if she loves her husband dearly, and he loves her, it doesn't matter anyway. There is no marriage in the Muslim paradise.Islam on Earth does have good points but it isn't convincing as the final word of God. To be honest, the quran is not as violent as they say it is. islam does help the poor and God commands men to show women more respect that, say, the Jews. Women are invisible in judaism. The wife beating is also in the Quran but there are many positive commands about treating women nicely. Indeed, conquered people are to be shown mercy too.In the Koran, Allah commands the conquered people to either convert or pay the tax and they'll be left alive.In the Hebrew Bible, YHWE commands that after you conquer the city, all the men, women and children must be killed on the spot, no mercy! Luckily for all of us, that isn't from the lips of God either.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CZ1UKBI81M5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1853267821#wasThisHelpful","R16CZ1UKBI81M5","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wittgenstein's said that philosophy is something like a disease and the job of the philosopher is to study philosophy as the doctor studies malaria, not to pass it on but rather to cure people of it.I never understood why Ludwig Wittgenstein called philosophy a disease. Bertrand Russell, who loved Wittgenstein, is also dismissive of philosophy, and even more so than Wittgenstein.Russell dismissively said that philosophy is what we don't know and science is what we do know. But when you read his History of Western Philosophy, you know he's calling philosophy primitive science.Scientists say that quantum physics is what we don't know and Newtonian-Einsteinian physics is what we can know.But scientists only admit their quantum ignorance because they are in awe of quantum physics. Bohr's 'shut up and calculate' comes from this early excitement over the uncovering of the tremendous mystery. There is no mystery in Russell.We all know what quantum physics is bigger than the macto universe, and as there is no time, space or causation in the quantum thing, it is eternity, but our ipads and lasers come out of this eternity. If follows, therefore, that if we are also made of the same stuff as this eternity, does this mean a part of us is eternal? This is why there is mystery.But Bertrand Russell didn't mean that philosophy is a profound mystery also, like quantum physics is, and that we can only tease out glimpses, rather, when you read the words of Bertrand Russell, he's dismissive of all mystery, like his finger tips are the peak of metaphysical speculation and there's nothing outside the 3 dimensional universe.Brian Magee writes in his autobiography that Bertrand Russell told him that he regretted getting into philosophy and he wished he did physics instead. Magee interpreted this as meaning that the great Bertrand Russell peaked in philosophy and wished now to do the same in physics. What hubris!So Bertrand Russell reckons he would have come up with his own Schrodinger equation or baffle top Nobel Laureates like Paul Dirac did? I doubt it.I'm reading a book by one Rudy Rucker: The Fourth Dimension: Towards a Geometry of Higher Reality. This is how one should mix philosophy and mathematics.I'm reading this guy and I know I'm in the presence of a genius. I don't get this from Russell nor Wittgenstein. Interestingly, Rucker's great great great grandfather is Hegel!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26H561RNNEXMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415472385#wasThisHelpful","R26H561RNNEXMK","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before my quick review, I just realized that the word 'Jew' or 'Zion' isn't mentioned that much, which is weird and rather than being a pointing ones finger at the Jew; these protocols are saying that the Jews are like the Gods in the Iliad; that is, Omnipotent genius' looking down on you and me! So if it is a forgery, its a pro Jew one!Anyway, the Protocols are always mentioned in films and documentaries and so it is inevitable that we will want to see what all the fuss is about.And as for this antisemitic thing, well people who throw out labels are doing themselves a big disservice because if the label doesn't stick, then they have explaining to do because they have exposed a big weakness in their position. It is far safer, and less embarrassing, to engage in debate than it is to name call.Who decided to diagnose people with this psychological-syndrome in the first place?Surely one isn't beyond redemption by studying a controversial topic? Personally, I am not an anti this or pro that and I don't think you are either, it isn't illegal to read this book, yet!The comedian, Doug Stanhope, has a routine where he jokes that the Jews are forever reminding us of their Holocaust (spelt with a capital H) but we are not allowed to remind them that they are not like Tibetan Buddhists. If we do point out that the Jews are not helpless Tibetans, then we are diagnosed as antisemitic and thrown in the dark room of guilt and ridicule!Personally, I ordered this book out of a curiosity and, I have to admit this, my guilty pleasure is conspiracy theories, and what a bigger conspiracy than this! I read that this book has been banned in a few countries. This is interesting. They say that much of what is contained in the Protocols have come true. Indeed, whilst reading, I thought 'so what', then I realized that it was published before the obvious stuff inside happened!Therefore, I am amazed that what is in here has all come true. It was apparently written 10 years before the First World War. This was years before the death of Christianity in Europe, the promotion of narcissism in the culture and the dumbing down of kids (and their parents). Who could have predicted all that 10 years before the Great War?Europe was a different place back then. In Vienna at the turn of the 20th Century, tramps would go watch a Wagner opera and in England, school examinations, for 11 year olds were on the level as today's Oxford examinations (for 21 year olds)!!! So we have become dumbed down then.If it is forged, then the guy who forged it was a genius who could predict the future. No one has pointed this amazing fact out! Who was this genius forgery guy who knew the future then?Now there is one other possible explanation. Maybe it is the modern versions that are re-written so they will fit the 20th Century. This is possible, tho never suggested by anybody. I reckon it is very possible indeed.Think about it this way... This is such a hot topic and we live in the digital age and so it is very easy to re-write a document. I won't check the original. Will you be motivated to find an original copy? Let us try!The only way to see who's lying is to find an old copy from 100 years ago and if the original copy is the same as this version, then hold on to your hats because we are in for a very bumpy ride","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A9DYS7UMDW7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEUVHC8#wasThisHelpful","R1A9DYS7UMDW7H","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mephistopheles, ""I am planning a bonfire"".Krishna, ""I will send you an Avarata to kick your ass!In the year 1300, on the banks of the Rhine, the Christian sage, Meister Eckhart said, ""I am unborn""!In the 20th Century, in Bombay, Nisargadatta Maharaj said, ""I am unborn""!This isn't some sort of searching for parallels. When we study the philosophy,both sages mean exactly the same thing, hundreds of years apart, on separate parts of the world.Only the Germans and the indians worked out the Atman doctrine.During the 19th Century, the Germans were driven mad by the system of idealism which expounded the truth of the illusion of the world. The world is an illusion, or, to modernise the wording, a hologram. But what is real? The Atman is real, or the 'I'. Hence, I am unborn.The French, British and everywhere else, adopted materialism. Only German philosophy was in unison with India.There are many other parallels that confirm the twin brothers of Meister Eckhart and Hinduism, or Germany and India.Atman manifests in the trinity of sat chit ananda. Eckharts is godhead god logos. Both trinity's match exactly.So what is the point? Well Meister Eckhart,the German who saw Brahman everywhere, was the favourite philosopher of all the Nazi's!Martin Heidegger, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Alfred Rosenberg say as worshipped Meister Eckhart.Alfred Rosenberg even quotes the 'I am unborn' statement in his Myth. But Rosenberg couldn't see past his own nose, so he couldnt grock the true message of Meister Eckhart, and neither could Chamberlain. Heidegger did better but stopped at Japanese Zen.Anyway, here we find a lind between India and Germany. A spiritual link through time and space, held together by the Swastika.The way Meister Eckhart was unaware of Nisargadatta Maharaj but he spoke the same truth, the National socialists were not aware of the indian stream flowing through the German psyche. Struggling to find their feet, obsessed with Norse mythology, runes and opera singers with big pointy tits, the Germans adopted an Indian symbol rather than a symbol from their obsessions.Many amateurs argue that you find swastikas in Europe. But those are either half swastikas, pseudo swastikas or mere pretty patterns. Adolf Hitler was shown a celtic swastika, like the one in the entrance to his school, but he still used the Indian, angled, swastika. Adolf Hitler was obsessed with Wagner, but there are no swastikas in Wagner.The force behind Eckhart also moulded the German psyche to adopt the swastika. The sign of India was to be a damn, to stop the howling waves which will drown Orthodox Russia and engulf Germany.That phalanx of mediocrity, the academic, who can't see anything, argue that the Nazi's stole the swastika and reversed the symbol, for EVIL!But if we switch to the evidence, rather than the mundane, then it is clear that Germans became Hindus, and unbeknown to the Nazi's themselves, the same force which guiding Arjuna on the battle field, also guided the National Socialist Party to adopt the swastika.Adolf Hitler writes that the swastika was designed to counter the Marxist Hammer and Sickle. This is the political reason, as Adolf Hitler writes in Mein Kampf, but the real reason is that Krishna, the Divine Personality of Godhead, who guided the Germans from the time of Meister Eckhart, to the birth of Adolf Hitler, created the swastika as the symbol for the only dam capable of withstanding and thrusting back the threatening tide of Karl Marx, whose rise is, in this as in every Time-cycle, the increasingly tragic sign of an advanced stage of the Dark Age.Krishna was there with Meister Eckhart on the Rhine, Mephastopheles was there with Karl Marx, in the library, and, so, Germany was destined to be the only damn capable of thrusting back Karl Marx and of carrying, beyond its defeat, (and its destruction, at the very end of the Age of Gloom) the treasure of god-like life into the glory of the new Beginning.This is the real reason why the Swaztika emerged out of Germany.So Krishna is in the room on the night Adolf Hitler got the idea of the swastika. This is the highest truth the historian, the mere historian, is blind to.So Germany became Hindu, with an avatar, and a moustache because Krishna decided to battle Mephistopheles, the bringer of Marxism, the illuminated one. Karl Marx will destroy the world, the avatar is to stop the lightning from burning the world.An avatar is one who comes to Earth to restore the harmony of the land. The terror which had broken Russia and was eating away at Germany was Marxism. Adolf Hitler writes that he was born to fight this enemy. Marxism was the paranormal force happening to Earth around the time Adolf Hitler was born.Adolf Hitler writes that if Karl Marx succeeds, then the planet Earth will again become a desolate wasteland, floating in deep space, as is was millions of years ago.When Hitler wrote those words, a billion workers were hypnotised by the hammer and sickle and Germany was red with the flag of Marxism.Let's use a time viewer and travel to Europe of 1889. In this age, the human psyche stands as a nation. A Russian was a Russian, an English was an English, a German was a German. This is the psyche which existed since the times of Charlemagne.Let's zoom out, as we zoom out of Google Earth, to take a higher vantage point, like Gods, we notice the green fields, the mountains, the globe, we see things we could never imagine on the ground. This higher point is only possible because we are high. Only Buddha's are able of floating so high.Now we move through time, to 1919. Here human psyche has changed forever. Like the zombie film, humanity is infected. A German is no longer a German. Most Germans have a psyche which belongs to Russia! The German foot is still on German soil, but the psyche of the German is Russian, and Russia is also infected with a different psyche. This psyche is 'marxism'. Marxism infected the Russian and the planet is soon to experience the deluge.How did this happen?In the British library, 1870, sits an unknown and unloved intellectual by the name of Karl Marx; writing his masterpiece, Das kapital.Some 80 odd years later, a third of the human race is ruled by regimes that follow Karl Marx as their guiding light! This is unprecedented!No other historical character has had that much influence on the human race, let alone in such a short span of time. It feels like magic. They say that Adolf Hitler is unique, but if Karl Marx wasn't born, there would be no Hitler, no Stalin, no Mao, no First World War and no Elvis.Miguel Serrano writes that the number 3 appears in the communist trinity of Marx, Engels and Lenin, just like it appeared in the holy trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost and the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, all for one difference. The apparent communist trinity was in reality, One, a Monism. The Jewish One replaced the trinity, with Karl Marx at the centre, as the Messiah of the ages.Did Mephistopheles approached Karl Marx in the British library and did they strike a deal?Did Mephistopheles show Karl Marx images of a world with Marx, instead of Jesus, on the throne? The visions flip to the Russian empire, laid waste and conquered by people who call themselves, 'Marxists', and the icon of Karl Marx replaces the the Mother of God as the state religion! The devil takes karl Marx by the hand and the 20th Century is in sight. This is why Adolf Hitler was born. He came to stop Karl Marx.At first, this may sound, well, religious, and we know from the writings of Karl marx that he hated religion and superstition, but dialectical materialism was the religion that change the world.So it is true, Karl Marx hated religion, but not in a Richard Darkins way. Dawkins will be forgotten the week he dies. This didn't happen to Karl Marx. And the success of Karl Marx has a supernatural element to it. More humans died under communism than under the Nazi's. So if Karl Marx wasn't sent by God, then it must be Satan.Richard Wurmbrand wrote a book called 'Marx and Satan' where he supplies plenty of quotes from admires and foes alike, and even from Karl Marx himself, that lend credence to his theory of Satanic influence.What other man was capable of starting a mass religion like Marxism? Karl Marx really was bigger than Jesus!Every scrap of writing, every utterance, the word of prophet Karl Marx had such weight for the believer, that when the Bolshevics got into power, they searched for Marx's opinion concerning the peasants. They found that Karl Marx hated peasants, so the Bolshevics exterminated about 50 million peasants!As for Karl Marx's hatred of Christ and religion, the Bolshevics knocked down the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the biggest Orthodox cathedral in the world, because this is the logic of Marx's 'opiate of the masses'. Adolf Hitler therefore was sent to restore Christianity to Russia.Karl Marx, who, remember, was sitting in the British library, only 80 years earlier, conquered China in spirit after death. What other man is capable on sitting in a library and influencing China a few decades earlier? This is supernatural.The Chinese had an agrarian society for thousands of years and they lived happily. China was a bread basket. Sadly, when the Chinese Marxist's took power, they followed the command of Karl Mark to industrialize the country. The Chinese starved more peasants than the Bolshevics! Some numbers are close to 100 million.Miguel Serrano writes that Adolf Hitler was an avatar and A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada also said that Hitler was an Avatar.Miguel Serrano didn't know about Meister Eckhart and he doesn't make it clear where she got her information from. Miguel Serrano hated Christianity but for the idea of an avatar, who returns to restore the dharma, you need a big destroyer, like another individual. Karl Marx is the best candidate.Adolf Hitler writes that he was sent by providence to fight Karl Marx. He was right","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGRHOPVH0XFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692375686#wasThisHelpful","R2NGRHOPVH0XFW","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Evola writes that life has a worrier spirit and a financial spirit. Like the charge of positive and negative electrons, which support and oppose each other, until death, the financial spirit and the fighting spirit are starkly recognised in the relation to death.If we focus on the meat, this contrast is, financial death and warrior death, a split which Oswald Spengler calls 'hunger death' and 'hero death'.The hungry human, in a 9 to 5 existence is threatened, dishonoured, and debased by financial worry and the fear of mental starving, which stunts possibilities, chokes consciousness, produces darkness and pressure not less than starvation in the literal sense. You can lose your whole life-will through the gaping wretchedness of living in the modern world of debt and work. The tragedy is that in the modern world, you die of something (starvation, disease, bordom) and not for something (death by action).In waring and fighting, you sacrifice for higher policies, you can die for something higher, you full for a metaphysics, a mode of consciousness higher than your meat body. On the other hand, economic life merely waste you away. Spengler writes, ""War is the creature, hunger the destroyer, of all things"".In war life is elevated by death, often to the point of irresistible force whose mere existence guarantees victory. But in the economic life hunger awakens the ugly, the vulgar, and wholly unmetaphysical form of fearfulness for one's life under which the higher form of being a human miserably collapses and the naked struggle for survival of the human beast begins.By the warrior, Evola isn't writing about what Henry Kissinger called ""dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy"".  Evola's metaphysical fighter need no longer be a Viking or a Helene, like king Ragnar or Achilles. That world has vanished. The modern soldier has no metaphysics.  Evola writes about the struggle within. It is within where the struggle for essence takes place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MU7HSL19ZM0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190716636X#wasThisHelpful","R2MU7HSL19ZM0B","AEGLLY9CXWXX3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEGLLY9CXWXX3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 7:33 Mins I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review, Now this is a really fun product and to start the fun either scan bar-code on product box or goto your playstore or itunes app on device and  download CHSsmartbulb app so that's out of the way then just screw in 1byone Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker Smart LED Night Light Bulb into lamp socket and turn on light so now you can pair lightbulb to device and in Bluetooth choices look for ""1byone"" and pair, now the fun begins. This  light is not a average size bulb so keep that in mind but its bigger for a reason. On the app on device is where you control everything from on/off switch to your music and in video i will cover all these options and there is alot of options. Bluetooth 4.0 drives this bulb and 7 main colors-over 16 million supported colors plus warm and cool white will mean hours of fun and your favorite music playing from your lamp is priceless. Product Power: LED 6W, AMP 3W and Working Voltage:AC 100V-240V.

" 4:54 Mins This TURATA Hard Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is exactly what i was looking for as its very professional looking but still protects your s6 edge perfect. Its very Form-fitting and im a stickler about my volume/power buttons being covered and this case has all buttons NOT covered which i really like and also a few s6 edge cases i own have a camera issue where case covers camera a tiny bit but shows in pictures but with this case my pictures are perfect. Also i don't see in product details but this case also comes with a screen protector and a burlap type material bag and the box is like a gift box so all ready to give as a gift. Overall its a great case that provides fall protection and looks expensive with its leather exterior,interior and four sides and a matte-finish provides grip. 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGSAV249REJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015814EVQ#wasThisHelpful","RAGSAV249REJP","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:21 Mins This AIKELIDA Universal Waterproof Case Bag does exactly what it says, keep your phone/ipod ect. safe from water while at the beach/pool or in the rain. My review was done using one of the biggest phones made (nexus 6) and it fits perfectly in this see through waterproof bag. A big selling point for me was your able to still use your phone while it the pouch and its IPX8 Certified: Fully submersible so no need to worry if you (like me) and forget your using the provided carrying lanyard and jump in the pool. Pouch is clear plastic so you can easily see your display and stay on top of any information on display. Pouch is made of Heavy duty premium grade TPU for extreme conditions and it's eco-friendly so mother nature will be happy too. If you like me and near water more than you should be with a $800 plus phone this is a perfect product for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ5R192UOB2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01590KDH0#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ5R192UOB2Q","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:02 Mins If you want more safety while riding your bicycle this is a great product. I live on a main street and in my town there is a law where you need safety lights on your bicycle and these Meilan X5 Safety Bike Tail LED Light exceed what is needed but you never can be too safe. A written review does this product no justice so please view my video as there's so many options and reasons to buy its better to see them in action. Wireless Control is simple to install on handlebar (my case) and very easy to operate but in sunlight its hard to see buttons but thats not really a issue as the buttons you use in daylight are easy to remember such as right/left turns since buttons correspond same order on unit.  I also liked the 3 lighting modes:Flash, Cross-Flash, Steady and the 2 lazer modes: Steady and Flash and my favorite is the Laser beams that basically surrounds both sides of bike while riding for much needed safety as it really alerts drivers your on the road.Another great feature as im not very good at installing these types of products is this unit is ""Tools-Free Install"".The rechargeable battery is  2200mAh which is a really nice size battery giving you hours of safety and worry free riding day or especially at night.As for durability its a very thick/strong plastic and its even waterproof and a feature i didnt know about till using unit is it has ""smart light"" which turns the unit on automatically in day/night environment. Im not sure what more you could want in a bicycle safety unit as this product does it all. i was sent this product at a discount for a honest review but i plan to buy another for my wife so its 5 stars from me. Package Includes:1*Rear light/1*Remote/1*Light holder/1*USB cord/1*Rubber fender/1*User Manual and a rubber bandAMAZON please leave my pictures along with video, i keep posting pictures but you keep removing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7TF07HY4R0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4E496K#wasThisHelpful","RS7TF07HY4R0J","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:57 Mins This is a amazing case in many ways starting with the price and i own several Folio cases but all cost more and some a lot more. This case also fits my needs as it also acts as a stand and one of my favorite features is the Auto Sleep/Wake Function. The fit is perfect and ultra slim and the bottom plastic shell is very tough feeling and all the corners are well protected and all cutouts for camera ect are spot on. The raised bezel keeps my screen safe even if not using the fake leather cover and the folding stand works very well for watching movies.

" 5:09 Mins First add- on i wanted for my iPhone 6s was a case so when ANKER asked me to review this case for a fair and honest review i was happy, i have a lot of ANKER products and love them all so i knew this would be a great case. I was sent the clear white case and it looked better than i expected as the translucent polyurethane is very soft and has a anti-stretch TPE  built inside to help further protect your device. The case is rebuilt from the ground up just for the 6s and it shows, Im very picky about my cases and specifically volume buttons being covered because with other cases i have used using volume buttons seems limited when covered but not with this case and the camera cutout is perfect which is another issue i have with some case as the case can be seen when taking pictures but ANKER has no such issue and even has a anti-glare camera guard for added quality to your picture taking experience.This case also has a raised bezel that really helps with protection and i do not use screen protectors so this is a great feature for me and another small feature i liked a lot is ANKER does not put there name all over this case and its barely visible on the side of case which is genius really since people look at my phone and ""ask who makes the case"" so i tell them ANKER but its nice to use such a clean looking case. Putting the case on was simple and  i have had no slipping and cleaning the case is very easy with a mild detergent and air drying. Anker is such a trusted name in this industry and giving a Lifetime Warranty is just another reason why, 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I0XXTH0C96V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG2S58O#wasThisHelpful","R32I0XXTH0C96V","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:16 Mins These pliers from booms are a great tool not only for fishing but just to keep in your pocket or as i do with this tool you can use provided Belt Holder Sheath and never leave home without it. As for fishing its a must have and if your familiar with a ""leatherman""tool this is the same concept without the high price. I love this tool for removing hook most of all, i was never good at removing hooks but this tool makes it simple and safe.Each of the handles have multiple tools built in from a saw, knife, screwdriver, bottle opener ect. Video will show these tools better but its a great tool for any handyman or outdoors man. The Stainless Steel construction makes them perfect for a long life and a easy cleanup plus ABS plastic handle equals comfort while using these pliers. If that's not enough reason to buy these there's also a Lifetime Guarantee and 100% Money Back Guarantee so great to see a company stand by there product.

" 4:32 Mins I wanted these pliers for Lure/Hook Remove but they surprised me at just how many uses they have. I also reviewed Braided Line from booms fishing and use these pliers for cutting that line as when the pliers are open there's a cutting area and in video i will show this and more useful tools and 2 i didn't know were even included was bin each handle are tools, a scaling knife and a nice cutting blade. Like i said i mainly wanted these for hook removal which is made easy with the slight hook of the pliers on the ends and these make hook removal so easy and safe. Pliers have Stainless steel tips and ABS plastic handle so cleanup and longevity of these should last many years and there's even a Belt Holder Sheath for carrying. I even use them for stripping wire and other tasks regular pliers handle so ya there also not just for fishing but they do there best work fishing. i received these pliers at a discount for a honest review and these earned 5 stars from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOUJD10YPX19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z441OO#wasThisHelpful","RMOUJD10YPX19","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Im not the best at casting but this line has made my casting my better and over other lines i have used this line effortlessly spins off  your reel. I have used 30lb test before but never a line that is this durable and i see no signs of wear after weeks of fishing and the 150yard size is just perfect. i received product at a discount for honest review but after 1st week of use i purchased another line so yes i highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZMLSJ78OOK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZP87HN0#wasThisHelpful","RVZMLSJ78OOK3","A1T4SP880XEFB3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T4SP880XEFB3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These LLCJ 2 x Super Bright Car Light were provided for a honest review which i give on all reviews and i was very interested in these for a replacement back up light for safety reasons at night. I park in a alley and only way out is to back out so these were perfect for my situation as there super bright (approx 800 lumen) and cast a very bright ""blueish"" light way better than my cars original lights. I did not use these for any other replacements such as brake ect but im sure the will look just as good/bright and add more safety to driving because there so bright. There a great buy for many safety reasons but also use less power consumption and claim to last 20000 working hours so great lifespan also.

I'm sure you could come up with something worse (i.e. higher risk) to test your bags with, but for me it's easy to judge vacuum-bag-quality based on how onion-y things smell after you seal up a nice freshly chopped white onion.  Let me tell you, this one does the trick.  A bit expensive, but the quality is there - nothing worse than backpacking and realizing after three days that your smoked salmon has an air leak.  These are thick and beefy (and by beefy I mean thick, not ""like beef"").  They come pre-sealed on the opposite side and they'll probably work well for other challenging items.

The problem is that not all projectors will have their center of mass directly under the plate, meaning that a residual torque will always be present about the ball joint to which the plate attaches.  This results in one applying copious amounts of torque to the thumb screws to get the plate to stay level at the prescribed adjustment point, which is exceptionally challenging given the amount of play in the telescoping tube and the remainder of the mount (it's at least a 2mm difference in diameter -- the whole thing rattles like your grandma's lawn chair).  Ultimately one will discover -- when the ball joint has been tightened to its extreme -- that a failure mode exists where the ball joint steel stud is pressed into the plate.  Note I said pressed -- not threaded and screwed as far as I can tell -- your umpteen thousand dollar projector is being held in by what is essentially friction.  Given sufficient mangling to make up for the free play in the mount orientation, you're sure to break that off as well.  I'm just waiting to go and find my projector laying on the floor in pieces after enough thermal cycles (warm day, cold day) cause that thing to loosen up and eject its unwanted companion.I'm faced with a dilemma.  For what I paid, and having written this review, taking it down (in its haphazard configuration), packing it up, and returning it isn't worth the time.  Maybe I'll try and make some shims to rigidize the structure and tack weld the joint on so it doesn't sag in its mount orientation and/or give up the projector all of a sudden.*** Update 1/20/2014 ***I am pleased to report that just a few hours after this review was written, I was contacted by Cheetah customer service (via comment) as they were concerned about my product experience given the negative review that I posted.  A few hours after that, I was contacted via phone (a voicemail was left), and then a follow-up e-mail.  I figured this was quite a bit of persistence for an inexpensive product, but I respect good customer service, so I gave them a call back.  Apparently they have a relatively well-staffed customer support department (whether contracted or in-house) and someone picked up immediately at 6:30 ET.  The CSR inquired as to my dissatisfaction with this mount and then informed me that the subject plate is being redesigned ""due to customer feedback"" or something along those lines.  The CSR then offered me a full refund (which is commendable, thank you) as well as any other product in their Amazon catalog for free (which is also commendable, but unfortunately I have no need for other products).  It probably would have been helpful to send me a mount to replace the one I bought, or maybe a replacement plate only, but I was informed that no such mount was available (although all 30+ other products sold through Amazon are).The CSR encouraged me to reconsider my review given my experience with customer service (which I have).  I was sent a follow-up e-mail including step-by-step instructions as to how to log in to Amazon, find my review, and delete or edit it.Now, I realize that I've already spent more than $25 of my time and definitely more than $25 worth of Cheetah's time working on a review for the benefit of the Amazon buying community.  My purchase dilemma has expanded to a moral dilemma.  Reviews, insofar as they are objective and honest, provide a real value to Amazon and I rely on them extensively for purchasing decisions.  Cheetah obviously relies heavily on Amazon as a seller, and has a vested interest in maintaining their product image.  Honestly, it would probably be to Cheetah's advantage to invest less in their customer support and more in their product design and test.  I do appreciate the refund (although I wonder if it gives Cheetah the ability to demote my ""Amazon verified purchase"" status). However, lacking concrete evidence to suggest that the design has changed and the product quality has markedly increased, my recommendation remains to avoid this product and consider something else. At least be aware that the quality is commensurate with the price.  Also rest assured that in the event this product doesn't work out for you, a refund may be an option and their customer service is accessible.  In fact, they'll call you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39EYU25HL9BD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00892RUTA#wasThisHelpful","R39EYU25HL9BD0","AQT8UH90YBR5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQT8UH90YBR5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Original elements mingle with traditional myths and plot devices in a lively contemporary fantasy. The depiction of social dynamics at school are spot on. The voice includes welcome humor as well as tension and mystery. Two girls and a boy are equal partners in the adventure, so a thread of female empowerment runs through the story. The adult population is unbalanced, though; the women are caring and helpful while the men are either weak or evil.My biggest problem with the book has to do with the writing.

"What a shame! This could have been a good story, if the author had a grasp of the art of writing a novel. Yes, I see she has received scholarships and awards. I also see that she doesn't understand such elements as point of view, voice, or character development. The style is rambling and disjointed, as if this were the author's rough notes for a novel rather than a finished book. Characters are ""introduced"" by paragraphs telling about them, resulting in flat cardboard figures rather than living, believable people a reader can care about. The clumsy attempts at POV increase the alienation, skipping randomly from character to character (sometimes in mid-paragraph) and even offering mass descriptions such as ""the men thought ..."" or ""the women felt ..."" I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but no luck. This is a dramatic story and works as a dramatic movie.

"Sometimes a writer is so wrapped up in teaching a ""lesson"" that she loses sight of what else children may internalize from her story. Normally Lester and Munsinger are right on target, but this time they unintentionally (yes, I'll give the benefit of the doubt) reinforced some dangerous misconceptions. A parrot is not a feathered tape recorder. The parrot in this story would never have repeated Penelope's abusive language because it would have been dead long before the prince arrived on the scene. Little children won't even recognize the way she treats the parrot as abuse because it's presented as funny. A cage so small the parrot cannot even open its wings? Dragging the cage across the floor with the parrot falling off its perch inside? A ball and chain on the parrot's leg? So ridiculous it's laughable, right? No, wrong. At the end, the princess loses the prince because of her bad language, but she's never challenged for the way she has treated the parrot -- who is so objectified it doesn't even have a name. And children don't know that having the parrot fly away is not a happy ending (prince or no prince). Releasing a caged bird outside is cruel. Very few escaped cage birds survive.Once upon a time it was considered funny when comics such as the Three Stooges hit each other over the head with cast iron skillets and poked each other in the eyes. I doubt many parents today want their children to think such behavior is funny. I hope parents, writers, illustrators, publishers will soon come to recognize that animal abuse isn't funny either.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLTCSHD84ESV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618138455#wasThisHelpful","R3LLTCSHD84ESV","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Eight decades of memories! Even as a child, Willie had what he called ""a natural and familiar relationship with music."" In his musical family and his hymn-singing church, he absorbed the rhythms, the language, and the heart of music. At age 6 he received his first guitar as a gift. At 10 he took his first job playing music in a beer joint . . . and he's been traveling to make music ever since.Although the book is arranged more or less chronologically, the narrative skips back and forth in time when it's appropriate. Basically, this is a series of anecdotes, free-flowing but linked together in a kind of natural logic. The first-person account is plainspoken, told in language that is both blunt and beautiful, just like his songs.I was particularly struck by Willie's generosity of spirit. He's known and performed with and befriended some of the greatest people of twentieth-century American music, across a wide range of genres, yet I never felt that he was ""name-dropping."" He pays tribute to how these musicians influenced him, sharing what he learned from each. That's right, he kept listening and learning all his life, even in what some would call his old age.When he describes actually writing specific songs, the song lyrics are interwoven into the narrative of the book. Each song is in some way grounded in truth. It's a fascinating look into the power of creativity.The 400 pages sped by, and I was sorry when the book ended. Willie describes himself as a troubadour, a wandering musician who tells stories through his songs. As he says, ""this book is a history of my heart -- and especially the ways in which my heart has been shaped by music.""  Good story.

"iPad at Work for DummiesAlthough this book contains a ton of useful information, it's not an introduction to the iPad. It assumes you already know what an iPad is and how to use it. That's to the good, because it gets down to business right away.The first three chapters do give the basics of setting up an iPad for professional use (as opposed to entertainment such as playing games, surfing the web, or sending emails). I recommend reading these three chapters straight through to help make the initial choices that will facilitate your work load later. Check out chapter 3 in particular, because that's all about security. If you're carrying around financials and other sensitive info on your iPad, you sure don't want it hacked somewhere!Once you get past these three chapters, the rest of the book is pretty much a buffet. Pick the parts that pertain to your business. For example, I skipped the whole section on Office 365, because I use iWork. On the other hand, I found the chapter on the Cloud to be very valuable because of all the practical details. In fact, the whole section on sharing is highly useful for what I do (working remotely with people all over the country). I've had some frustrating experiences trying to do presentations from a laptop, and this book gives clear, step by step directions for giving a successful presentation from my iPad instead.Two strong features of the book: the index and the table of contents. That's right, a user manual is no good at all if you can't find what you want. The index sends me to the exact page if I know the name of what I need to read. But if I don't, the detailed table of contents lets me search by subject, because I can see at a glance what's in each chapter and get a good idea where to start looking.I'll be using this as a reference and probably carrying it with me on trips. It's a big book but printed on a lightweight paper so it's not too heavy for a weekender travel bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZRVMLKRLYIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118949285#wasThisHelpful","R11ZRVMLKRLYIR","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title, Paper Things, refers to the paper dolls and accessories that fifth-grader Arianna has cut out of catalogs and carries everywhere in her backpack. This paper family provides the only stability in her uncertain life.When Ari's widowed mother dies, leaving Ari and her brother Gage with an old friend they don't even know, things go downhill fast. Gage, who is 19, tells the friend he can take care of Ari himself, and the two set out together. But Gage is ill-equipped to care for his little sister, and the two of them are soon sofa-surfing with friends, sneaking into shelters (because Ari is technically too young), even sleeping in a parked car.This somber story shows the heavy effects of homelessness on a child. An honor student before her mother died, Ari sees her grades slip because she has no place to do homework. Her appearance suffers from not having the facilities to wash her hair or do laundry. She loses her friends, who think she's snubbing them because she never calls or invites them over anymore. She begins to feel invisible.The picture is not totally bleak. Ari volunteers after school at a local Head Start, where the children love her no matter what. She makes a new friend at school, someone who doesn't care what people think about him. A homeless veteran teaches her to make wishes on paper airplanes.The narrative voice is believable and the tone sympathetic. My main complaint about the book is the pacing. A mystery is involved, a family secret (beyond the deaths of their parents) that contributes to Ari and Gage's problem. But Ari doesn't find the first clue until page 224--which I consider much too late for a book to change from straightforward narrative into a mystery.Paper Things is likely to elicit one of two reader reactions: judgement or compassion. As an adult reader, I could see that the children's plight was exacerbated by choices they made. But I could also see that in their desperate situation, they did not know how to make things better. A reader may think, ""Tough; it's their own fault."" Or a reader may wonder, ""How could I help someone like this?"" Whether or not you like this book depends on which reader you are.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP1GRF27W0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663239#wasThisHelpful","R3GP1GRF27W0F","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ours is a family of storytellers,"" claims Boyd Varty in sharing his family's four generations on a plot of ""lowveld"" (wasteland) 400 miles from Johannesburg, South Africa. Growing up in this natural setting, Boyd not only knew a wealth of stories about the land itself and his parents', grandparents', and great-grandparents' adventures there, but also had amazing adventures of his own to add to the saga.Once a failed cattle farm, the wild grounds were a place where the author's great-grandfather and grandfather hunted big game. In his father's generation, the family's focus shifted away from hunting, and the land is now the Londolozi Game Reserve. ""Londolozi"" is Zulu for ""protector of all living things."" This transformation came before conservation was a popular movement, and many people thought the family was crazy, but Londolozi became a blueprint for modern-day conservation efforts.The narrative resonates with respect for the land, animals, and people of South Africa. Some anecdotes are humble, such as ten-year-old Boyd carrying catfish, one by one, from a drying pond to release in a river. Others are terrifying, as Boyd's narrow escape when a crocodile clamped its jaws on his leg and dragged him into a river. And some episodes are awesome. When a national park in Africa was culling elephants, Boyd's father and uncle devised an ingenious plan to move several of the doomed elephants to Londolozi: the first live moving of elephants ever undertaken.Some of the stories are painful. The author does not shrink from revealing the terrible residue that remained even after apartheid was officially ended. Humans, he says, can be the most dangerous predators. Yet even here there is hope. Especially memorable is the chapter on Nelson Mandela; when Mandela was released after 27 years in prison, Londolozi was the place he came to recover and to restore his spirit.I was amazed when I realized how young the author is. ""Cathedral of the Wild"" is a mature and beautiful memoir, by turns wise, humorous, philosophical, outrageous, or barely believable, bound together by a rich reverence for life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B8TYEM894N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069858#wasThisHelpful","R13B8TYEM894N5","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Office laminators I've used at work were clunky and caused wrinkles and tended to jam. This little home-use laminator has them beat hands down.First, I was amazed at how quickly it heats up. The ""ready"" beep went off in just a minute, while I was still gathering my papers together. I noticed a slight ""hot"" odor, but nothing offensive or troubling.It's very easy to feed the pouch into the laminator using the entry markings on the machine.The instructions say to be sure document is centered up against the leading edge, so I do that for single pages. However, I wanted to laminate several smaller items and didn't want to waste a whole pouch on each one (I only have the letter-size pouches on hand) so I v-e-r-y carefully placed three cards in one pouch, spacing them apart, and then v-e-r-y carefully fed the pouch into the laminator. Success! No wrinkles, no bubbles, they didn't slip, and I could trim them apart after the pouch cooled. I even had two different thicknesses: one was regular 20-pound paper and two were heavier cardstock. The laminator sealed all three neatly at their edges. (The manufacturer probably would not endorse this, but it worked for me.)So far I've only used the 3 mil weight pouches, and they've been fine for everything I wanted to do. Perhaps I'd go heavier for a sign to be used outdoors or something that will be handled roughly, but the 3 mil is good protection for things that will receive average everyday use.The laminator is lightweight and has a small footprint on my work table, which I appreciate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUF7NEMVEZ6V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OILZNIG#wasThisHelpful","RUF7NEMVEZ6V2","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noted theologian Leonard Sweet here offers his perspective on what he identifies as ""three of the most intractable issues of past half-century."" He contends that seeing them as ""issues"" is part of the problem, since these are not either-or questions but aspects of life that need to be integrated into what he calls a ""house and garden"" spirituality--that is, both interior and exterior.The writing style is conversational, including the redundancies of natural speech. This friendly if repetitive text is enhanced by a generous number of quotes from classic and contemporary theologians and philosophers, set as call-outs on the pages. The book's end notes provide not only sources but also interesting comments on the text.In place of today's individualism, Sweet urges a ""me/we"" social gospel that embraces both the value of the individual and the necessity of relationships. ""Jesus does not subordinate the individual to the community nor the community to the individual. Rather, Jesus understood every community to be comprised of uniquely important individuals"" (page 25).Sweet addresses racism by going back to the Creation Story, then tracing the light/dark dichotomy through history and culture to show that black and white have no intrinsic moral implications and have picked up the ""good/bad"" connotations through usage.The section on consumerism is by its nature the most concrete of the three, since money and possessions are things that can be assigned concrete (economic) value, but Sweet addresses the more intangible environmental concerns as well. Here he takes on consumption, greed, envy, environmental repercussions, war and strife, power, distribution of resources -- you get the idea. He challenges readers first to recognize that we are all consumers, then to respond to consumerism with creativity.The minister looking for sermon quotes will find this a treasure trove. Sweet is a master of the neat turn of phrase that would work well as a sound bite or a bumper sticker. He bases his social gospel ""not on kingdom-building but on kingdom-living."" Regarding consumerism he says, ""The issue is not the amount of our spending. The issue is the account of our spending"" and ""The empire of goods has become the empire of our gods."" The section headed ""Relationships Are Not Black and White"" comprises long strings of anecdotes related to black/white, dark/light, as if he knew all these good stories and couldn't bear to leave out even one.As a work intended to make readers start thinking, the book fulfills its purpose. It makes clear that we live between God's ideal and the human reality, that there is work to be done, and that individually we share communal responsibility.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8B2WM1SVWDAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142675776X#wasThisHelpful","R8B2WM1SVWDAO","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book blurb gives the basic outline -- a fairy tale opening, then the stories of three different realistic children in three different mid-twentieth-century settings -- so I won't rehash the plot details here. Each of the stories is independent of the other two and could almost stand alone, except that after drawing the reader into a fascinating piece of someone's life at a clearly defined point in history, each narrative ends abruptly and without closure. Of course, the abrupt break is not the end of each story.The common element from story to story is the harmonica that is owned successively by each of the three main characters. The harmonica is not central, however; there is a deeper theme connected to the harmonica that runs through the three stories. The key to the theme is given in the opening fairy tale, but so cleverly woven into the narrative that it may be missed until it reappears and is emphasized in the conclusion. The ending brings closure to each story, ties the three together, and connects back to the beginning. I debated with myself about identifying the theme here, but that would be a spoiler. You'll enjoy the book more if you're allowed to discover it for yourself.While the transition from the fantasy of the opening to the realism of the central stories is jarring at first, I quickly became engaged in Friedrich's life and accepted the new situation. That meant I was ready for the jump to Mike's, then to Ivy Maria's separate stories. If I have one quibble with the book, it's that the concluding epilogue was entirely too much explaining. It was almost as if the author was checking off a list of all the things that happened to each child after his or her story ended. Hence my four stars instead of five.Despite my mild disappointment with the way the ending was so drawn out, I consider Echo an outstanding achievement that will undoubtedly be a contender for some major awards this year.

"The art for this block set is absolutely charming, with balanced numbers of boy and girl figures from diverse ethnic backgrounds. A nice touch is there's a boy pirate captain, plus a long-haired pirate captain that reads (to me) like a girl wearing a beard, so very much gender-equal! Lots of props and creatures as well, though a mermaid character figure might have made a nice addition. (The figurehead of the pirate ship is a mermaid.)I like that a small desert island (for buried treasure) is included. A large shark and large octopus dwarf the small, 2-piece (head and tail) sea serpent, but perhaps the serpent is only to be glimpsed mysteriously in the distance?The PIRATES! picture book is a board book format and serves more as a suggestion on how the blocks might be set up for play. The story itself is fairly generic.My only negative comment is that while most of the smaller pieces are two-sided, the thicker pieces comprising the ship have art only on one side, so the ship can only ""sail"" right to left.Set fits into a dovetailed box without a lid, and could serve as a puzzle as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTEHUMEFXGWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085309DM#wasThisHelpful","R2KTEHUMEFXGWA","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like biographies. I like historical fiction. I expected to like this book--but I didn't. So why not?This novel was an ambitious undertaking, and it's clear the author has done her research. An author's note describes what she found as fact and what she created. The back matter includes 10 pages of endnotes plus a selected bibliography.I never warmed up to either of the protagonists, not the fictional archivist Anna Roth nor the historical figure Adelle Godel, wife of the famous logician. (Although this has been described elsewhere as a fictional biography of Kurt Godel, he remains a background figure to the two women who dominate the novel.) Alternating chapters set in the past and the fictional present follow Adele's experiences as Kurt's wife and Anna's visits to the widowed Adele in a nursing home. The chapters set in the nursing home also show the growing bond between the two women.The book begins well but becomes tedious as it goes on. While this is a translation into English from French, I don't think the monotony can be entirely the fault of the translator. At first Adele seems to be a character I could care about. She never quite comes to life, though. Somewhere about 200 pages into the novel she starts to show a little of the original promise, but it's too little, too late. Anna is a troubled person right from the start who fades in and out of focus. Fortunately, she does seem to end the novel a stronger person than she began.Kurt regarded Adele as stupid and avoided telling her anything about his work, but occasional visitors would provide tidbits in a very simplified format. The mathematical and philosophical content is therefore accessible to readers who have not studied in these areas. It was fun to glimpse other famous mathematicians and philosophers in a fictional setting--the Godels were friends with Einstein, Oppenheimer, Morgenstern, Russell, and other great minds of the twentieth century.I grew weary of talking heads: pages and pages and pages of unattributed dialogue that sounds more like narrative in quotation marks than like real people talking. Some of the dialogue was interesting, some of it was informative, but much of it was repetitious or trivial, and very little of it engaged me.I just stopped to look at some of the other reviews and see that quite a few readers loved the book. I wish I could say the same. Since I can't agree, I'd prefer to say nothing--but this is a Vine book and I'm required to post an honest review.

"What begins as black comedy moves into creepy mystery, shifts into high gear with suspense, and at the end offers hope, inviting the reader to meditate on what it means to be truly alive. Sound muddled? Not at all! The transitions are subtle and logical in the development of the troubled main character, Aaron Rowe. Although Aaron is high school age, his school counselor has placed him in a trial position working full-time for funeral director John Barton.The story starts on Aaron's first day at work, a day that includes two pickups. The grim humor (including a corpulent corpse that they manage to drop on the floor) is not something you'd want to read if you've had a recent death in the family. In contrast to this macabre on-the-job training, Aaron meets John Barton's cheerful family: motherly, be-aproned Delia, who makes pretty little finger sandwiches for lunch; sassy 11-year-old Skye, who immediately names Aaron ""Robot""; and the ancient, incontinent cat Moggy. At the end of the day, Aaron goes home to the house-trailer where he lives with his grandmother, Mum, who shows symptoms of advanced dementia. As if these diverse elements weren't enough to build a complex plot, Aaron also suffers from horrific nightmare and walks in his sleep, sometimes for miles.Despite these bizarre juxtapositions, I found the book oddly endearing. Let me share just one sample. After a gristly motorcycle-truck crash, the police and funeral home folks have to pick up the pieces, literally. Aaron finds the cyclist's helmet with head still in it and picks it up by the chin strap ""like an odd valise."" After tucking it into the hearse, he muses, ""although we'd been conducting the same search, the policemen and I had been looking for different things and for different reasons. They were hunting mortal remains to finish a job; I was hunting the still countenance of someone's son, perhaps a brother, maybe even a father, to bring him a final grace. By giving him grace, I found some of my own. The police protected the living, ambulance officers protected the injured, as we protected the dead. All as it should be.""An unexpectedly beautiful book.Note: reviewed from uncorrected galleys; the above quote might not be exactly the same in the final published book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LATNNWX5LRMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544232747#wasThisHelpful","R3LATNNWX5LRMB","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Siobhan's name is pronounced SHI-vawn, which she shortens to Shiv. As the book opens, her father is driving 15-year-old Shiv to an exclusive mental health clinic for two months of residential treatment. Shiv blames herself for her younger brother Declan's recent death and believes her grief and guilt will be neverending.I really liked Martyn Bedford's book Flip and was eager to read another YA novel by him. I was not disappointed. Neverending is completely different, yet equally engrossing.Chapters alternate between the cheerless Korsakoff Clinic, with its unorthodox methods of treatment, and flashbacks to the happy weeks Shiv and her family spent vacationing in a villa on a sunny Greek island. Because the narrative begins with Shiv's ambivalence about entering the clinic, which she does voluntarily but out of desperation, a sense of foreboding shadows the vacation scenes even though the characters are unaware of the tragedy that's about to happen. Bedford builds this tension skillfully. At the clinic, Shiv struggles with her guilt and grief without revealing how her brother died -- and why she thinks she killed him -- until the very end of her two-month stay.Meanwhile, she meets other teens who are also at the clinic to wrestle with their own demons of guilt and grief. The focus remains on Shiv, where it belongs. The book is written in third person but the viewpoint is Shiv's. The reader gets to know the other characters only as much as Shiv does -- which means some of them are well developed, others remain background figures. The people who are important to Shiv, both in the clinic and on the Greek island, come to life as real.This is a book of many contrasts, which the author uses effectively. There's humor and fear; warmth and anger; family affection and sibling arguments. The methods at the clinic strike me as ""kill or cure."" Teens in a fragile psychological and emotional state could be helped or could be driven round the bend. Until the very end, I was never quite sure which way Shiv would go. And I honestly cared. That's a good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LACTND4AHS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385739915#wasThisHelpful","R7LACTND4AHS3","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's supposed to promote a healthy immune system and digestive balance, but how do you measure that? I'm never sick and don't take any other supplements (not even vitamins), so there's no measuring stick for feeling ""better."" However, I took this Metabolic daily for three weeks, and I must say I felt fine.Then here's the interesting part: I stopped taking it, and I had stomach aches for a couple of days.

"* part pulse-pounding action adventure* part graphic novel* part intense psychological thrillerThese three elements are braided together into one story.I'd heard of freerunning, but I had no idea what it would feel like to run through a city this way until I read this book. I could almost see these three teenagers running across roofs and vaulting over fences, doing flips and handstands and twists. Exciting!Then comes the shooting. After they get out of the hospital, the two survivors aren't running for joy anymore, they're running in desperation. Running to forget what they can't forget. Running to fix what they can't fix.The narrative parts are mostly real life. When it gets too intense to say in words, the story jumps to graphics to show what it can't tell. Very effective.Two of the teens are a Chicago cop's kids. The third one is Indian, and there's some interesting Hindu mythology woven into the story.Friendship and loyalty are big themes in this book. The story doesn't end the way I wanted it to. It ends the way it had to. I finished it a couple of days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it.

"Plan on reading slowly; you won't want to miss any of the beautiful, frightful details in this tightly-woven novel. Ostensibly this is a murder mystery. Two children find a dead body on the third page and, in satisfying symmetry, the killer is revealed on the third-from-last page. Between these two bookends, so many other things happen that at times it's possible almost to forget that a murder has taken place. Individual events seem unrelated, yet on a deep level they interconnect, affecting and influencing each other.While the book opens and closes with 14-year-old Frederika, who recently arrived in 18th century Swedish Lapland with her parents and little sister from Finland, she is not the only focal character. Indeed, there are no minor characters in this story. As in real life, every person has secrets. Every person has a past. The narrative moves from person to person, and in each viewpoint the reader knows only what that character knows. Yet we see tantalizing glimpses of each soul, and by the end even seemingly isolated characters have been significant in some way.The plot has more turns than a labyrinth; every time you think you know who the killer is, some new discovery twists the path in a new direction. The community is still a scattering of settlers, not yet a village. Christianity dominates, but hints of witchery linger. Frederika and her mother Maija both (at different times) see things that may or may not be there. The murdered man returns to talk with Frederika--or does he?The language is richly layered, evoking the almost unendurable conditions in this arctic region and the determination of its inhabitants to survive. The reader can feel the numbing wind and snow. Underlying tension between Finns and Lapps adds psychological coldness to the freezing environment. And in the background, heard howling, sometimes seen, always sensed, are the wild wolves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBT4DE546THR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862524#wasThisHelpful","R1WBT4DE546THR","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been a fan of Slimfast bars for a long time. Unfortunately, they've discontinued several flavors recently, including my favorite, so I've been searching for a replacement. I was afraid that Greek yogurt and honey would be weird but took a chance on a sample package and was pleasantly surprised. These rather remind me of the lemon bars I used to love at PTA bake sales. There's no lemon listed in the ingredients, but they have the same combination of sweetness and tartness. Plus, the texture is lighter than most snack bars, so this really does feel like a treat, not a diet bar.If you're limiting sugars, be aware that each bar has 12 g sugars in it. That doesn't bother me because I don't eat a lot of sweets, so my overall sugar intake is moderate. The size of the bar is pretty small compared to a regular candy bar, about the same as other Slimfast snack bars. I was satisfied with just one and didn't get hungry again for a couple of hours.

"The author has given herself an ambitious project indeed: write a mystery from the viewpoint of someone sliding into senility. The missing Elizabeth is Maud's best friend. Because of Maud's dementia, the reader has to wonder: is Elizabeth really missing? Or moved to a nursing home? Or has she died and Maud doesn't remember the funeral? Maud's confused yet urgent thoughts become tangled with other mysteries from her past, including the disappearance of her beloved older sister a half century earlier.The strength of this novel is how well the author shows the inexorable progression of senility. Maud narrates her own story in first person, even as her memory is slowly slipping away. Having lived through my own mother's descent into senile dementia, I can testify that the narrative perfectly captures the combination of compassion and frustration involved. That is, I could relate to Maud's distress (yes, she knows that she's losing her memory and tries to fight the loss) while feeling frustrated at the unclear communication, the rambling and the repetition.The beginning of the book spends a little too long establishing Maud's memory problems, and I found my attention wandering. The same effect could have been accomplished in half the pages.The middle of the book is the best part. Maud narrates her current experiences without fully understanding them, and at any moment a random word or sound or image may send her mind into the past, which to Maud is much more clear than the present. I particularly enjoyed these smooth transitions; they seem almost effortless. This is excellent writing.The conclusion does a good job of showing the solution to a genuine mystery even though Maud doesn't quite understand what has happened. Unfortunately it strained my credulity that Maud's narrative could reproduce so much dialogue by other characters. And I wondered if the apparent holes in the plot were actual plotting flaws or simply incomplete reporting due to Maud's dementia. The solution is shrewd but somehow disappointing at the same time.Readers touched by Maud's inexorable descent into dementia will also be interested in Thomas DeBarrio's honest memoir Losing My Mind, an author's journal documenting his own Alzheimers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162DS5C8CVR4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062309668#wasThisHelpful","R162DS5C8CVR4Q","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story told in letters is an ingenious variation on the diary-style or correspondence-based novel. Rather than letters addressed to a diary (such as Anne Frank) or to a single individual (Dear Mister Henshaw and many others), these letters are written to a wide variety of individuals--all deceased, most under tragic circumstances.The intricate plot is not at all what I expected--it's much better. Laurel is starting high school without her older sister May, whom she worshipped. May died the previous spring, and the girls' parents moved Laurel to a new school thinking it would be less painful than going where everyone knew the talented and popular May. Laurel's new English teacher assigns her class to write a letter to a dead person, and Laurel quickly discovers that this provides a release for feelings she can't say out loud. She writes to an eclectic mix of famous people including film stars such as Judy Garland, River Phoenix, and Heath Ledger; rock stars from Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison to Amy Winehouse; poets John Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, and e. e. cummings; aviator Amelia Earhart; and even Allan Lane, the voice of Mister Ed. Note that she never writes to May. She also never turns in the assignment, which is too personal to share with the teacher.The narrative voice is pitch-perfect. It's touching to watch Laurel's letters move from Dear Mr. Cobain to Dear Kurt Cobain to Dear Kurt, as she slowly reveals thoughts that are more and more personal. At one point she begins a letter with the heartfelt plea, ""Dear Kurt, Judy, Elizabeth, Amelia, River, Janis, Jim, Amy, Allan, E.E., and John, I hope one of you hears me. Because the world seems like a tunnel of silence."" Gradually we learn the events surrounding May's death--events Laurel had blocked from her memory that return bit by bit--and with Laurel we wonder if she was responsible.There is of course a boy Laurel begins to like at the new school, and a tentative romance. Startling plot twists keep readers from guessing the ending. The conclusion does not resolve every question, yet provides both healing and closure.Highly recommended for teens and also for adults who appreciate a well written, compelling YA novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQJ16GVY24F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374346674#wasThisHelpful","R2LQJ16GVY24F4","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered two flavors so that I could compare them. The one called Icy Fresh has the tag line ""cool fresh mint,"" which is pretty accurate, and Enamel White has the tag line ""luminous mint,"" whatever that means. Both tasted clean and minty, with Icy Fresh slightly stronger. I don't have a preference; guess that would be an individual thing for other users.The toothpaste is pretty dense, so I use less than I did with my previous brands. (It's also messier to clean up if you spill it on the sink or counter.)What about the whitening? The package says ""whiter teeth in 1 week."" I have a small enamel-colored filling between front teeth that matched my teeth when I got it. After a week my teeth were slightly whiter than the filling. I've been using the toothpaste for nearly a month now, and I haven't seen a lot of change since the first week, but I'm still pleased with the improvement.What I notice most about the Optic White toothpaste is neither the taste nor the whitening, it's how my teeth feel now.

"This novel won't be published until September--I'm reviewing an advance copy--but given the author's name plus the marketing campaign, I'm sure it's slated to be a best-seller. The idea is sound: a coming-of-age story enlivened by ghosts, mystery, family secrets, and paranormal activity, not to mention a discreetly off-stage homosexual affair. Lush descriptions of the setting show a wonderfully decrepit old mansion replete with secret passages and hidden rooms, surrounded by forest primeval on a high bluff overlooking Puget Sound. I recognize echoes of Gothic classics in a successful modern setting. All of this is a formula for success.Unfortunately, the compelling material is often undermined by clumsy writing. The narrative includes pages and pages of talking heads. The story is related in first person by the protagonist, alternating between himself as 14-year-old boy and as retrospective adult. The two voices are not differentiated; Trevor at 14 sounds just like the grown-up Trevor except that the grownup keeps saying ""I remember."" When the narrator pauses the story to explain background, such as his own father's childhood, it's hard to know which Trevor is talking. The dialogue has a little too much preaching for my taste, with several characters offering opinions on everything from environmentalism to original sin. If you're so inclined, you'll find plenty of places to pause and ponder ideas such as the good of the few vs. the good of the many or the high cost of promises or the tangled web woven by deceit.In the haunted mansion, and also in a nearby abandoned cabin, Trevor finds trunks filled with hundred-year-old journals. Each time he picks up a journal, he reads an entry that is relevant to the current story. These convenient journals are filled with dialogue and description in much the same style as the main narrative, except that the journal entries add words like ""dalliance"" and ""patriarch"" and are printed in italic. Trevor's other sources of information include daytime eavesdropping and nightly supernatural dreams in which he seems to participate in events from the mansion's past.The characters did grow on me, but they contain just enough caricature that I was always aware they weren't real. At the big climax, when I think the reader is supposed to be surprised to learn who the true villain is, I already knew. The solution had been telegraphed early in the novel.I'm aware that I'm in the minority here, and most reviews will be glowing. That's okay. I do recommend the book to readers who like generational ghost/mystery stories with lots of threads to untangle. Let yourself be pulled along by the plot, and don't spend too much time looking for deeper meaning. Even though the writing is not up to the level of the concept, this is still an energetic and engaging story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TQ8TIWZG0BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439187037#wasThisHelpful","R17TQ8TIWZG0BI","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stereotypes. Appearances. Expectations. They blind us to each other and skew communication in so many ways. Each member of the Lee family sees the world through his or her own experiences and cannot understand how this affects others. Nothing unusual here--we all have our viewpoints and unintentional blinders. What sets Everything I Never Told You apart and makes the book special is twofold: beautiful plotting and beautiful writing.The plot is a graceful blending of present and past. Page one reveals that sixteen-year-old Lydia Lee is dead, but she comes to life for the reader when Chapter Two asks ""How had it begun?"" The answer travels back two generations, revealing dreams and disappointments of her parents, grandparents, older brother and younger sister, while also showing the actions and reactions of her family in the aftermath of her death. Each family member has a different thought about what happened to Lydia, and we don't learn the truth until the very end. In this regard, it's a successful mystery. But it's also much more.Lydia's Chinese father, James, has felt defined by racial stereotypes all his life. Lydia's caucasian mother, Marilyn, has been governed by her own mother's need to maintain proper appearances. The unrealistic expectations James and Marilyn place on their own children have molded Lydia and her siblings, Nathan and Hannah.The writing is nuanced and gentle. No sledgehammers here--the reader is allowed to knit together the pieces of the individual characters' stories to see a bigger picture. These are people who are trying to do the right thing from their own perspective, and their conflicts come about because they don't realize that situations look completely different to someone else. Although the characters are all flawed, they are presented in a nonjudgmental way that lets the reader care about their struggles and their sincerity. Since different readers will bring different expectations and experiences to the story, it's safe to say the novel will be slightly different for each one.This story is haunting but it's not a ghost story, even though the main character is dead. Instead, it's haunting in the sense that it stayed with me after I had closed the cover. The beauty of the writing lingered, as did the spirits of the characters.Readers looking for a lively action-adventure or police-procedural mystery will be disappointed. Those who like a thoughtful, well-written, character-driven novel built around a central mysterious event will enjoy Everything I Never Told You.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25X6H2CBRHX4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420571X#wasThisHelpful","R25X6H2CBRHX4L","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the description, I thought this product would replace the five or six separate graters and slicers in different sizes that I currently use. The Cuisipro is versatile, but it has some drawbacks.First, the packaging lost a lot of points with me. I had to fight my way into the hard clamshell, and then the labels were practically cemented onto the food platform of the mandoline. It took me three cycles of GooGone, Scotchbrite, Bon Ami, and elbow grease to get them off, and now the finish is permanently stained. (I took a picture for this review, but Amazon's web form won't let me attach it.)I started with something simple: grating carrots. The hand guard has four spikes to hold the food, so I stuck a chunk of carrot on each one and grated four at once, which went pretty quickly. (Wish I could attach another picture I took!) The hand guard fits over raised edges on the mandoline, and it has a plunger to push the food down the spikes. The plunger fit my hand comfortably, but I found it awkward to support the mandoline, keep the guard on track, and apply the right amount of pressure, all at the same time. The hand guard kept slipping off the track.It's convenient to have all the blades stored in the main unit. Changing them is scary, though, because they fit really tightly in their storage spaces. It took me a lot of tugging to get them out, and when I did, they came suddenly. I don't like being surprised when I'm handling sharp objects.On a different day, I tried making crinkle, waffle, and julienne veggies to dress up a salad. The adjustable thickness settings worked just fine, although I had the same difficulty changing blades. The results were attractive, particularly the waffle cut.It's nice to have so much variety available with a single tool. Using this on a daily basis would be a nuisance, though. I'll probably continue using my old graters and cutters unless I'm doing something really fancy for company.

"Layer upon layer of secrets are tucked into this intriguing and intimate middle-grade novel. Twelve-year-old Jewel was born on the day her brother died, and her grandfather has not spoken a word since then. Jewel's parents, too, are locked in their own worlds that Jewel cannot enter. Lonely and confused, she yearns for someone who will talk with her. When she befriends a new boy in her small town in Iowa, she is surprised by her grandfather's immediate dislike of the newcomer, her first friend.Jewel is a thoughtful child. In the absence of information from the adults around her, she is left to her imagination as she tries to understand the world. The family is a mix of Jamaican, Mexican, and Midwestern cultures, and this sometimes raises difficult questions for her. Her new friend is also of mixed heritage, a black child living with white relatives. Jewel is drawn to geology, seeing it as a fascinating foundation: ""millions upon millions of years of earth were holding us."" In contrast, her friend wants to be an astronaut, leaving the earth and its troubles behind and going far, far away.When I read a book to review, I jot down page numbers of things that particularly strike me: lyrical language or new insights or ideas to ponder. My list quickly filled my sheet of paper--too many to mention in one review. I can't resist sharing one excerpt. After a family crisis, Jewel's grandfather comes to her room. Although he is silent, she says, ""hearts don't speak with words like how we think they do in movies or in songs; I think they need a lot more space than that. Anyway, all I really knew was that my heart had an awful, raging fever that day, and in the silence, Grandpa brought with him the cooling rain.""The plot is intricately woven, deftly handling a profusion of complications without ever losing the forward momentum of the story.

"Shelly Maddox is shot by the sniper who on August 1, 1966, killed 17 people on the campus of University of Texas at Austin. Badly wounded, she is rescued by cousins Jack Stone and Wyatt Calvert. Jack is also shot and maimed; Wyatt is not physically injured but has what would be called PTSD if that diagnosis had existed in 1966. (PTSD was first recognized as a disorder around 1980.)In the opening chapter, as Shelly and Wyatt huddle beneath the gunman's tower, in the scant protection of a flagpole's base, his hand tightly gripping what remains of her breast to keep her from bleeding to death, the reader knows their lives will be linked forever. The rest of the book simply fills in the details. But there's nothing simple about it. We follow Shelly and Wyatt and Jack for forty years, along with their spouses, children, and eventually grandchildren. The tower casts a long shadow.This is a difficult book to review. Before ordering it I read the free sample on Kindle and was engrossed by the opening chapters, which are rich with description, emotion, and action. But 30 pages into the physical book, the writing style went from lyrical to labored; the plot began to plod painfully, with way too many paragraphs, even whole pages, of unnecessary explanations that failed to hold my interest. At times the writing style slipped into a bad Hemingway imitation. It was as if the middle of the story was written by a completely different author. At 336 pages, the book felt twice that long, and the only reason I finished it is that I was committed to write a review.There are some nice spots. Wyatt is an artist, and in places art becomes a metaphor for life. His paintings are ""almost as much about what you don't see, as what you do."" At the end [mild spoiler ahead!] Shelly returns to the tower and muses on how everyone's lives were changed by one random act. Overall, however, my impression is that this novel is as endless -- and as shallow -- as a soap opera.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EB8Z3GGOFAWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374228825#wasThisHelpful","R1EB8Z3GGOFAWC","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world's ""most watchable animals"" are introduced here with a focus on their behaviors. Whether you're on a round-the-world safari or visiting the nearest zoo, this book tells what you may see and what it means. General arrangement is by the aniimals' natural habitat, with sections for African jungles, plains, and waterways; Asian forests; warm oceans; North America; and the Poles. To my disappointment, this omits all the amazing tropical birds in South America, but the book is already close to 500 pages long and something had to be left out.Despite its somewhat scholarly appearance (and its heft!), this book is very readable. The writing style is friendly and inviting, with scientific terms limited to the sidebars. Browsers can pick out individual chapters to explore in any order, while a reader with a serious interest in animal behavior will find plenty of meat when reading from cover to cover.Each animal description starts with an explanation of basic behaviors, such as how the animal gets around, eats, plays, grooms, sleeps. Next come social habits, which include friendly, sexual, parenting, and conflict behaviors. Boxed sidebars include a page on human interactions with the kind of animal and a checklist of behaviors to watch for in the wild or in a zoo. Where appropriate, another box headed ""which behavior is it?"" gives further detail on observations that may be hard to differentiate.The illustrations in the book are particularly valuable. Elegant sepia drawings go into fine detail, with at least one full-page illustration per animal plus a generous number of spot illustrations showing specific expressions. For example, one page shows six different wolf faces, distinguishing between stare, threat, play, and so on, as well as five sketches showing what different tail positions mean.Unique or interesting aspects of each kind of animal add to the appeal. The peacock chapter has a brief but charming description of communal roosting. For crocodiles, one paragraph tells how these creatures with ""the lungs of a landlubber"" manage their breathing. Under komodo dragons is a paragraph headed ""rolling in smelly stuff.""The final chapter, ""Zoo Critique,"" addresses the question of how to tell a good zoo from a bad one, with checklists and a section on ""How You Can Improve Your Zoo."" A 12-page index provides access to the contents.I suspect this is a book I'll enjoy returning to repeatedly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X8ORD0QHAS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579129684#wasThisHelpful","R10X8ORD0QHAS9","A334U1TZFY6SNO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334U1TZFY6SNO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 8:32 MinsIf you're looking for VERY comfortable headphones that pack plenty of Bass and get SUPER loud, then the Photive X-Bass headphones might be just what you're looking for.FEATURES & ACCESSORIESThese headphones come with a user guide, micro USB charger and a 3.5mm audio cable. This cable allows you to use the Photives as wired headphones (which means you don't need to battery charged to use them).These Photives also fold up so they can fit in the included hard shell ballistic nylon case. There are only three buttons on these headphones which means you'll be using two buttons for both the volume and track advancing when in Bluetooth mode.COMFORTThese one of the most comfortable headphones I've worn compared to other headphones under $100 as well as many headphones costing two to three times as much. You can definitely wear these all day long.SOUND ISOLATIONSound isolation is good. These will definitely block out quite a bit of noise while you're using these. The louder the volume, the harder it will be to hear anything going on around you. However, as you crank up the volume these will start to leak some sound.  If you've had headphones in the past that didn't get loud enough then I think you'll really enjoy these. I wasn't able to include the sound leak test and volume demonstration due to time constraints but you can view that here youtu.be/_oLTp5985MUSOUND QUALITYThe strength of these headphones is definitely the bass. You get a strong emphasis on the low end which sound really nice when listening to genres of music such as: dance, hip-hop, rap, electronic, house, etc. You can use these to listen to other genres of music but the mids aren't as detailed and the highs are a bit rolled off compared to other more balanced headphones.COMPARISON to PHOTIVE BTH3The Photive BTH3 are more balanced and have a slightly better sound stage. However, the Photive X-Bass definitely brings more pounding bass, are more comfortable and definitely get louder. So if you liked the BTH3's but wished they had more bass and got louder then you'll probably love these.BOTTOM LINEIf you're looking for a Bluetooth headphone that gets nice and loud, has great bass and is so comfortable you can wear them all day long then the X-Bass by Photive is a very good choice. Otherwise if you're after a more balanced, neutral sounding headphone you'll want to consider something else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGCM3ZP1ATTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4C5QQE#wasThisHelpful","R1HGCM3ZP1ATTT","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:40 MinsThere are so many choices when it comes to Bluetooth headphones that it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. These headphones by August definitely stand out both in terms of sound quality and comfort.FEATURESYou can use these as wired headphones which is great. There are plenty of Bluetooth headphones that cost two and three times as much that don't offer that as a feature. Batter life is up to 10 hours but I found 8 to 8.5 hrs to be more realistic. Bluetooth range is 10 meters or 30 feet which is about right. These headphones do fold up which makes them great for portable use. You can also use these to make and receive phone calls. Call quality is good and you can easily hear whoever you're talking with. However, the person on the other line might hear a few pauses or a few muffled words. So this feature works great but it's just not crystal clear all the time.COMFORTOne of the best features of these headphones is how comfortable they are. I've personally tested and used about 50 different headphones so I have a real good idea of what to expect comfort wise at different price points. These are one of the most comfortable headphones I've worn for the under $100 category and they're actually quite a bit more comfortable then many headphones I've used that cost three times as much and more!You do get some heat build up around the ears but not to the point of getting sweaty.GYM USEI found these do work good for gym use but they're just not as light on the head as dedicated sport Bluetooth headphones. But they bring such energy and life to your music that these headphones definitely help you to push your workouts harder!SOUND QUALITYThese sound incredible considering they're less than $50. The thing to keep in mind is that they bring extra bass to your music and movies. If you're after a more natural sounding headphone then you'd want to consider something else. However, if you don't mind extra bass or better yet, prefer it then you'll love these!Genres of music that sound amazing on these would be anything along the lines of rap, hip-hop, dance, techno, house, electronic and so on.I wasn't able to include the sound leak test here because of time constraints but you can view the original here youtu.be/cd6Ih-fyQ1oVOLUMEThese should be loud enough for most people but if you need extra loud headphones they these might not be loud enough. The volume also can get louder using these as wired headphones instead of Bluetooth.SOUND ISOLATIONThese do a really nice job of blocking out surrounding noise, especially the louder you have your music. These work well on an airplane but especially on bus trips, or for use around an office. Just be careful because if you have your music turned up you may not be able to hear people that are trying to get your attention :)RECOMMENDATIONThese are one of the best headphones I've used under $50. They are easily more comfortable then many headphones costing twice as much or more. If you like having the presence of more bass in your music then you'll love these. Unless you have to have a brand name showing on your headphones, these are an incredible value that will bring a smile to your face over and over again :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IPR1U96WOKGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMKRQO8#wasThisHelpful","R3IPR1U96WOKGD","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:06 MinsWhat stood out to me most about this Bluetooth speaker by Mipow is the design. It's no surprise it won the ""Good Design Award"" in 2013 as it looks really cool in person. However, the sound quality isn't as impressive as other Bluetooth speakers in this price range.FEATURESBesides being a Bluetooth speaker, you can also use this as a wired speaker (using the included 3.5mm cable) for non-Bluetooth devices. The handle is removable (as shown in the video) which gives in a more sleek look when not attached. You can also use this speaker for phone calls and it does a good job, though people can tell you're not on your phone.There are three buttons on the top of the speaker which you use to control the speaker. They work fine but it can be cumbersome at times when you want to advance several tracks and have to hold a button down for a few seconds each time. There's also a pretty loud 'beep' every time you press the button which I found a bit annoying (as demonstrated in the video).SOUND QUALITYNow I've listened to lots and lots of different Bluetooth speakers as well as headphones (over 50 now) so I have a really good idea of what you can expect quality wise at different price points.The sound quality of the BOOMAX is just ok and there is really isn't any bass to speak. The volume gets loud enough to hear but if you want to blast your music or really crank up the volume then you'll want to consider something else. In terms of sound quality, there are better sounding speakers for the money but it certainly does a nice job of providing music for a room, office or even using outside.RECOMMENDATIONIf you're primary concern is getting the best sound quality for the money then you'll want to consider something else. But, if you are looking for something that has a very cool design, that's distinctive and attractive to have in your room, office, etc. then this could be an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NST32ZIIZHEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZJQVG4#wasThisHelpful","R2NST32ZIIZHEU","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:19 MinsIf you're looking for a simple to use portable charger, this Power Tube charger by Mipow works very well.FEATURESYou have a USB output as well as a micro USB connector. This gives you a lot of options when charging different types of devices. I like that you can charge two devices at once. Although if you're charging a tablet, it works best to just charge it by itself.EFFECTIVENESSFor phones I found you're able to get at least one full charge, up to 3 charges depending on the phone. For the Kind Fire HD, you can get about two full charges. For tablets, you'll get about one full charge or just under or just over one full charge (depending on the tablet). What's great is the Mipow will charge your device at basically the same speed as using your normal standard charging process.I also like that the Mipow Power Tube holds a charge for a long, long time. So even if you don't use this for a while, you don't have to worry about it loosing it's charge.OVERALL IMPRESSIONI really like this device and use it for my kids all the time now. There are a few reasons you may want to consider something else though. If you want something you can put in your pocket you might find the size and weight of this is just a little too big. Also, I would prefer if they had used a design that didn't require a separate cable to charge the device. Although I don't find it a problem when charging it at home, I don't like having to keep track of another cable when traveling. Otherwise, this portable charger works very well and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.Please feel free to ask any questions or leave a comment here youtu.be/Q-T4RCFVr_o and I'll do my best to answer.Thanks for watching and I hope this was helpful! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15S4YGXX2B3T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6KQ2GC#wasThisHelpful","R15S4YGXX2B3T4","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:50 MinsThese aren't headphones I'd recommend for everyone, but if you're looking for Bluetooth headphones that give you lots of thumping bass and can get plenty loud, then these might be just what you're looking for.FEATURESThese headphones come with a 3.5mm cable which allows you to use them as wired headphones. I love this feature b/c it means you can use these headphones even if the rechargeable battery runs out or if you just want to use them with a device that's not Bluetooth compatible.You can use these to talk on the phone and conversations are crisp and clear.The battery life is around 10 hours when fully charged and I found this varies depending on how loud like you to listen to your music.You use a swiping motion on the outside earcup to adjust the volume or advance a track forward or backward. This works well as long as you're pressing firmly enough. These aren't as sensitive as other touch control headphones but the upside is you aren't accidentally increasing the volume or advancing a track when you didn't mean to.These headphones also come with a hard shell case, cleaning cloth and micro USB charger. These headphones collapse (as shown in the video) so they work well as a portable headphone.COMFORTThe headband and earpads are super comfy. They give a nice plush feeling when wearing these. I found they did start to get a bit uncomfortable after several hours of use b/c my ears didn't entirely fit inside the earcups. So the outside of my ears were being pressed against and again, after a while that started to become uncomfortable.If you're a younger person or have smaller ears then these might work perfectly as a true over ear headphone. For me it was mostly over ear, but a little bit on-ear.Either way, I think anyone would find these quite comfortable to wear at least for a while. But if you're planning on wearing these all day it might start to get uncomfortable depending on your head and ear size.SOUND QUALITYWhat sets these headphones a part from other headphones in this price range is the amount of bass these provide. To get the most out of these headphones I'd recommend listening to genres of music like: rap, hip hop, techno, house, trance, urban, electronic, etc... anything that has a strong beat to it will sound awesome.However, because of the extra emphasis in the bass department I found the mid can become a bit muddy and vocals can sound congested. Particularly when listening to music that doesn't have have as much emphasis on bass. They still sound nice, but they're just not as balanced or natural sounding compared to other headphones in this price range.If you like headphones that get loud, these are some of the loudest bluetooth headphones I've used in the under $100 category. At full volume I could only stand to listen to these for a few seconds.VOLUMEThese get LOUD! In fact, these are one of the loudest Bluetooth headphones I've used in the under $100 category. I wasn't able to include the sound leak test in this video do to time constraints but you can view that here if interested youtu.be/0qTVf5m-UpESOUND ISOLATIONThese do a great job of blocking out noise from your environment. You could use these on an airplane, commute to work or anywhere that's noisy and still be able to hear your music or listen to a movie.BOTTOM LINEIf you're looking for headphones that give you lots of extra bass and can get plenty loud then these might be just what you're looking for. They're also very comfortable to wear though anyone with larger ears might find they're not as comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. If you find that most of the music you're listening to has a good beat to it and you want to feel the bass a lot more then these would be an excellent value and a very good choice for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCXBEGW1KAHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EN06C14#wasThisHelpful","R3PCXBEGW1KAHT","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:20 MinsSo far, this is the best multifunction Bluetooth speaker I have come across for the price. There are 8 different functions or features included with this Bluetooth speaker:WIRELESS BLUETOOTH SPEAKERThe range is 10 meters or about 30 feet. I found this to be accurate and it's pretty much the norm for Bluetooth speakers. It holds a Bluetooth connection well though occasionally I did get a few pauses will listening to music.STEREO AUDIO SPEAKERSThe sound quality is satisfactory but nothing exciting. The bass is barely noticeable but there's just enough to round out the sound a bit. The sound experience is definitely better than sound coming from your tablet, phone, ipod touch, etc. It also gets loud enough to watch movies with a friend (as I demonstrate in the video) or listen to music.However, if you're expecting more thump to your music or movies or if you want a more engaging sound experience then you'll want to consider more of a dedicated speaker system.BUILT IN MICAs I demonstrate in the video, the call quality is good. You can definitely have a clear conversation with someone. The quality isn't quite as good as a dedicated device for making phone calls but it still does a very good job.ALARM CLOCKYou can set the alarm clock for one time (as opposed to having more than one alarm set to wake you up). For me the alarm is plenty loud but if you need a super loud alarm to wake you up you might need to consider using something else.LED TIME AND DATE DISPLAYI love the way the LED looks as it shows through the wood. It's bright enough to see during the day but not too bright at night. I also found it makes a nice conversation piece as everyone who saw it sitting on my desk wanted to check it out. It has that ""cool"" factor just because of it's clean and distinctive look.Also, the whenever you turn the clock on it finds the time automatically. I find it's very accurate to within a minute.THERMOMETERThere is a build in thermometer which you can set to Fahrenheit or Celsius. It's very accurate and personally I love being able to know the temperate of the room.2.1A USB CHARGING PORTAnother feature I love is that you have a universal USB charging port on the back of the device. Because it's 2.1 amps you can charge tablets as well. It also charges devices faster than 1 amp charging ports.There is a competing product out by GoGroove that only provides a 1 amp charging port so SoundBot definitely did a nicer job here.3.5mm AUDIO PORTOn the back of the speaker you have an audio port which has universal compatibility for your PC, computer, laptop or non-Bluetooth device.For example, if you have an older tablet that doesn't have Bluetooth then you could connect it via the audio port (and supplied cable) to watch movies or listen to music.BOTTOM LINEThis is a great product that gives you a lot of value for the money. Each of the features works really well and it makes this speaker a very versatile unit. I love the presentation and look as it adds a bit of class to any desk, room or wherever you place it. One thing to consider is that if you need a super loud alarm to wake you up or if you need multiple alarms then you might want to consider something else or just get a separate alarm clock for that. Otherwise, this Bluetooth speaker is a great value and I highly recommend it!Please feel free to ask any questions or leave a comment here youtu.be/HQniQdgCsqU and I'll do my best to answer.Thanks for watching and I hope this was helpful! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCSASTEZPBQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1YE5BI#wasThisHelpful","R2JCSASTEZPBQB","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:24 MinsI've tested and used a LOT of sport headphones and these have now quickly become one of my favorite sport headphones to use!FEATURESThese have the latest technology such as Bluetooth 4.0 and APTX which helps give you CD like quality to your music (even via a wireless signal). The battery life is 10 hours (which is pretty accurate) and you have 250 hours of standby time. Charging is done via a micro USB cable. The bluetooth range is 30 feet which is pretty standard for bluetooth headphones.DURABILITYI contacted the company and found out that the ear pads are specifically designed to handle sweat. Although these aren't water resistant, they can definitely handle a workout (just don't go jogging in the rain with these).CALL QUALITYI've made several phone calls with these, both personal and professional and conversations sound great. You get a crisp, clean conversation. The other person can hear you just fine and can't tell your using headphones.NOISE ISOLATIONThese headphones allow you to still hear what's going on around you. I find this helpful for a sport headphone so that if you're going jogging or riding your bike through an urban area you can still hear enough of what's going on in your surrounding environment.SOUND QUALITYThese have above average sound quality for bluetooth sport headphones in this price range. The bass does feel a bit soft, but again that's not a surprise given the style and size of these headphones. But the mids and highs come through nicely and give you good detail in your music.In my opinion these sound better then the SoundBots and Kinivo's which are in a similar price range but sound about the same as the Motorola S305.These also get very loud. I wasn't able to include the sound leak test and demonstration in this video due to time contraints so you can view that here if interested: youtu.be/GxntpedUqJkCOMFORTThis is what makes these really stand out in my opinion, is that these are the most comfortable sport headphones I've worn using the around-the-neck style of headband. However, after an hour or two of use I do start to feel some discomfort at the tops of my years where the neckband sits.Still, I find these to be much more comfortable when lying down whether doing something like a bench press or just lying in bed listening to music or watching a movie. The neck band doesn't push up on the ear pads the way the Knivo's, SoundBot's and Motorola's do.BOTTOM LINEI'd highly recommend these for anyone looking for a light-weight pair of sport bluetooth headphones. You won't break the bank buying these but you'll definitely have a nicer sounding and more comfortable pair of headphones compared to many of the cheaper options out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAANH5WD61X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWV1LP6#wasThisHelpful","R2EAANH5WD61X","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:20 MinsI recently learned about Acoustibuds and from all the great reviews I was curious to try these for myself and see how well they really worked.HOW THEY WORKThey basically attach to the end of your earbuds or earphones (include some bluetooth headsets) and provide two main benefits. You get MUCH better sound isolation and Acoustibuds help your earbuds, etc. stay in your ear and not fall out.DO THEY WORK?Absolutely! I was impressed with how comfortable these are. I was surprised by this b/c initially I though there's no way sticking these in my ear will feel good. I was wrong, they not only provide a really snug fit so your earbuds, etc. won't fall out but I found it was more comfortable to use these over longer periods of time then just the earbuds, etc. by themselves.PRACTICAL BENEFITSOne of the things I really like about using these is they give you a LOT more sound isolation. If you're ever tried using earbuds, or earphones on a plane or in any noisy environment it can be almost impossible to hear anything. However, these give such great sound isolation (by blocking outside noise) that you can actually hear your music or movie even when there's lots of noise around you.Using these also makes earpods, etc. much better for working out. I love using earphones for going for a walk or job b/c they're so light but I hate how they easily they fall out or start to slip out of your ear while going for a walk, jog, etc. The Acoustibuds keep your earbuds, etc. pretty well glued in your ear so they are going anywhere.Also, I noticed that because of the better sound isolation and the way the music is directed into your ears with these on that your earpods, etc. will actually sound better. Not only that but you'll use less battery power b/c you won't need to have the volume turned up as loud.RECOMMENDATIONI highly recommend these. They're a great value, they're easy to clean (with soap and water) and they do what they say they'll do. Just be sure to try the different sizes to find the one that fits best for you. I found the smallest size (size 4) worked best for me. I imagine most people would use a size 4 or 5. However, if you have larger ears you might want to try the size 6.Please feel free to ask any questions or leave a comment here youtu.be/-G56TPT9fXU and I'll do my best to answer.Thanks for watching and I hope this was helpful! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5HD2152MWJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9AU6KE#wasThisHelpful","RX5HD2152MWJ3","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:56 MinsIn the quest to find a nice pair of headphones for my daughter, I came across LilGadgets headphones. There's a lot to like about these headphones.FEATURESOne of the first things I look for now with bluetooth headphones is to see whether they give you the option of using these as wired headphones... and I'm happy to say these definitely do that. This means you can use these headphones when the battery is dead or to save your battery life for when you'll really need it.The headphones come with a very soft feeling carrying bag which you can also use to clean off your tablet screen, etc. from all the finger prints and smudges that so easily build up.Battery life is 10 hours and you get 180 hours of standby time. There is an auto-shut off feature that will kick in just in case you forget to turn them off.The bluetooth range is 30ft which I found to be very accurate. My daughter was able to run all around and we never had a problem with these loosing their connection or skipping, pausing, etc.I also like how the track advance and volume switch is easy for kids to access and use (definitely made for littler fingers).The headband is also made of a mesh that is designed to be easier to clean if kids get it dirty.You also can choose between a few different colors.COMFORTThese are designed for smaller heads but when I fully adjusted the headphone headband I was able to actually wear these. The padding on the ear cups is very comfortable and my daughter has been comfortably using these all day which no problem. She absolutely loves wearing these. They're also pretty light as far as headphones go so if you end up packing them up with you they won't add much weight.SOUND ISOLATIONThese do a nice job of isolation sound so that your child can use these on an airplane or in any noisy environment. While they're not active noise cancellating headphones, they still do a noticeably good job of passively blocking out sound.They also leak a bit of sound, particularly at louder volumes so that you can tell if your child is starting to play their music too loudly.SOUND QUALITYThese really shine as being a nicely balanced headphone. You can hear the lows, mids and highs without one dominating the other. Vocals sounds wonderful on these and there's plenty of detail so that your child will get to hear all the things in their music that they'd probably been missing before.My daughter loved how these sounded so much that she started listening to all her favorite music all over again because of how good it sounded to her.BOTTOM LINEEven though these cost a bit more then some cheaper $10 or $20 headphones, you're definitely getting your money's worth. Having a quality pair of bluetooth headphones (which can also be used as wired headphones) that are comfortable enough for your child to wear all day, as well as allowing your child to start to enjoy their favorite movies and music with more detail and clarity is a worthwhile investment. And these headphones were definitely designed with kids in mind. I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a great pair of bluetooth headphones for their child.**UPDATE 2/24/2015**So my daughter STILL loves these and they've held up great!Also, I wanted to mention that these are volume limited without the need of a special adapter, and volume limiting is important to help protect your child's ears.  So when you're not in the same room and your child cranks up the volume (whether intentionally or accidentally) you don't have to worry about the volume getting too loud and potentially damaging their hearing.Bottom line, just a really great pair of headphones. Of course I'm happy my daughter loves them and i think it's great the company is consciously trying to do things on a technical side to protect our kids hearing as well :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275I1AI9ZLBS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX0RTN6#wasThisHelpful","R275I1AI9ZLBS0","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:36 MinsThis is a video review from my YouTube ChannelFirst to give you some context, I have tested and listened to many, different brand of headphones around this price point such as Sennhesier, Sony, Creative and so on so I have a very good idea of what you can get quality, comfort and sound wise at different price points. I am also very familiar with the ATH-M50's which I already own as well.These are impressive! They have that same wonderful sound signature of the ATH-M50's (though not quite as good) but at much lower cost. You get the great detail, clarity and imagery that the ATH-M50's are known for.In my video review I cover:1. Why these make great DJ headphones2. Durability & Build Quality3. Comfort4. Sound QualityIf you want to see the sound leak test then refer to my original YouTube video [...] as I wasn't able to keep the full length here.One thing to note is that these have a straight cable whereas the previous model (ATH-M20) has a coiled cable. Also the ATH-M20x is lighter at 190 grams compared to the previous version the ATH-M20 which is 320 grams. It's very comfortable to wear these headphones whether around your neck or on you head. The fact that they're lighter then the previous version makes them that much better in my opinion :)These are the perfect budget friendly pair of headphones. Whether you're looking for a budget friendly pair of headphones or something that you can use for any genre of music to hear all the wonderful details your music provided, then these are about as good as it gets at this price point.ENJOY the video!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYP7TY4N9KW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLUR18#wasThisHelpful","R2RYP7TY4N9KW9","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 9:59 MinsThis is a video review from my YouTube ChannelThis is such a great product and a fantastic value!I've tested and reviewed over a dozen bluetooth headphones and these have earned a spot as one of the best! They strike a great balance of awesome sound quality, great sounding phone calls, and function very well as a sport use headphone. The Motorola S305 are great sport headphones but they don't sound as good as these. The Creative WP-350's do sound a little better but you really can't use those for sport use, running or working out like you can with these. These are very similar to the GoGroove Bluetooth Headphones but I find these to be more comfortable because the earpads swivel on these, whereas the ones on GoGroove are fixed in place.In my video review you'll see me talk about:1.

"I didn't realize how much more I'd like these over the other wood kitchen utensils I have. They're light and easy to use but also surprisingly easy to clean! I guess having good bamboo products make all the difference :)I read reviews about other similar types of products where people complained about harmful lacquers and such being used on their bamboo utensils but these look completely fine to me. As far as smoothness goes they are almost perfect. There are a few spots where it was just slightly rough but it's not a big deal.

"I was impressed when I first got these. The carrying bag was great, which included straps to help hold everything in place on the inside (so things don't slide around so much). The assembly was fairly straight forward but I did have to consult an online video to figure it out. But once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to setup and take apart.Problem:The problem though was that only one of the softboxes worked. I tried all the usual things like trying different outlets and exchanging out the bulb but it was dead on arrival (just like the other review here mentioned). Also, I couldn't help but notice that the cable looked a little worn/used... it just struck me as odd in that it didn't look brand new. Either way this was quite bothersome as rarely do I ever get something brand-new that doesn't work when you first get it. This concerned me b/c if there are a couple of us now having this problem, does that reflect the longevity of these? Meaning, even if they are working when they arrive, maybe 9 months one of them will die (or both!).UsabilityFor the one that did work, it was great! It's easy to adjust the height and the front screen is VERY easy to attach or remove. The hold setup is light and easy to move around.LightingThe big question on my mind was how bright will these actually be? If you go in with the right expectation I think you'll love these. If you have a room that has a decent amount of light but you want to boost it up, these will work great. I wanted to use these for shooting video so the one that worked definitely helped (and having two working lights would really help).If you're shooting still photography and you can afford the luxury of a slower shutter speed then you could use these in lower light situations. But for shooting video, you'll want to have decent light in the room already.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY60E6X10HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R6NSQG#wasThisHelpful","R1TY60E6X10HD","A3015P48ABE85D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3015P48ABE85D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love scrubbing my face. Pads, beady washes, skin shavers, washcloths; anything I can get my hands on. I do so much to exfoliate my skin and can always use more. It was fun and a little icky to see the flakes fall from my face when I used this. It is meant for stimulation like you would do in dry body brushing and it does that without being too rough. There seem to be a couple of bristles that are a bit stiffer and more rough than I would prefer but altogether it is just what I wanted.

"I have to say; this is one of my favorite purchases recently, because it has been such a no-fuss everyday piece. It is simple, yet elegant and on-trend. When I received it about 2 weeks ago, I put it on and went straight to a week long vendor event during which time I was incredibly busy and didn't take the time to remove it at night. I continued to wear it throughout the week. during showers and bathing the kids. I kind of knew in the back of my head that I was taking a risk by putting it through the wringer, so to speak, but I didn't want to take the time to get acquainted with the latch and frankly; it was just easier to keep wearing it. I enjoy the simple design and I like to think of the word ""love"" as a verb so it was a reminder to do more of it every day. I just took it off last night for no other reason than we had gotten a new kitten and it had scratched my wrist in the area so I wanted to rinse the area with peroxide to clean the cuts and I didn't want to take that risk with it. It still looks great and although it has a tiny place above the letters that look like the finish it changing; it gives it character.As I was studying it after I squeezed the band to remove it, I was thinking about what I would say in my review and how I would rate it - I realized that I only love it more for that little spot that is different because it is quite symbolic of life and relationships.

"I've gotten so many compliments on this piece by visitors - everyone just loves it.From the ooh's and ahh's to the ""we need one of those""; they all have something to say about it. It's one of those products that everyone wants for themselves or a friend.What I love the most is that it can move with us if we should have to sell our current home; and while that isn't a particular desire right now, I like knowing that I won't have to make the difficult decision to cut out a door frame or say goodbye to the memories. It isn't even a particularly large piece, since you mount it a couple of feet off of the floor and it grows with them to about 5ft. Four inches later is when I stopped growing anyway. It comes ready to use right out of the box and can be mounted or hung. It was folded flat for storage and packaged well with the mounting hardware and plenty of foam to protect it. I would definitely buy this again as a gift - it would be a beautiful reveal during a baby shower!I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XT8SXV1XWEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVKECZ4#wasThisHelpful","R11XT8SXV1XWEZ","A2HI6D4K9WR01F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HI6D4K9WR01F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a lifelong cookbook collector. One of my favorite ""me moments"" involves settling down in my reading spot with a fresh cup of coffee and a good cookbook. ""Twenty Dinners"" by Ithai Schori, Chris Taylor, and Rachel Holtzman is a wonderful read, full of deliciousness, and it took me out of my normal ""cookbook zone"". The relaxed look and feel of the book, with its lovely photos and simple layout, is a perfect accompaniment to the varied dishes and drinks presented page-by-page. Chris Taylor learned to cook from his mother, and as he travels with his band, ""Grizzly Bear"", coming home to cook great meals with friends is a necessary comfort. Ithai Schori, a photographer and former restaurant cook, is in his element when cooking is ""messy & satisfying"", but he has learned to simplify with the best ingredients and techniques for the best results. ""Twenty Dinners"" is arranged by season, augmented with knowledgeable contributions on consumables, and stuffed full of helpful and interesting tasty tidbits. Here's a sampling of their tempting recipes: ""Roast Chicken""; ""Maple Panna Cotta with Candied Almonds and Buttered Bread Crumbs""; ""Spiced Red Wine-Poached Pears""; ""Butternut Squash Puree""; ""Wild Rice with Celery and Pecans""; ""Lemon Verbena Tart""; ""Rib Eye Steaks Seared, Roasted, and Basted in Butter""; ""Meatballs (and Spaghetti)""; ""Smoked Earl Grey Hot Toddy""; ""Radicchio Salad with Pears, Bleu Cheese, and Bacon""; ""Pork Chops and Charred Applesauce""; ""Lillie's Sticky Toffee Pudding""; ""Tal's Potato Salad""; and ""Tomato and Sweet Corn Salad"".

"I am going to eat all the candies in my little bag of Werther's Sugar Free Chewy Caramels, and I am going to enjoy them. However, I won't be purchasing them or recommending them due to all the warnings of possible side-effects listed on the back label of the package. The packaging states that these candies are sugar-free and gluten-free, and the calorie count is about 20 per piece. The caramels are soft and chewy and kind of sticky like salt water taffy. The taste is pretty good, with only a very slight aftertaste. What about those warnings? Sugar alcohols that may elevate blood glucose levels. Milk and soybeans that may cause allergic reactions. ""Excess consumption may have a laxative effect"". Is this Ex-Lax or Werther's Caramels? Don't leave these around where children can find them!

"I have always loved trying different hair and bath products, and I often find that shampoos, washes, and soaps made for babies and children are also fun and useful for adults. The Natures Baby Organics Shampoo and Body Wash, Coconut Pineapple, 16 Fluid Ounce, is a quality product that performs well, but for me, the price is prohibitive. It smells great in the bottle, definitely coconut-pineapple, but that scent fades when you actually use the product. The scent left on your skin is a combination of coconut, other oils, and shea butter. It's not an intrusive scent, and it does diminish within an hour, but it's not as pretty as coconut-pineapple. The liquid itself is silky and pearly, but it is thin--squeeze the bottle lightly to avoid using too much product. This is a shampoo and body wash, so I used it from head to toe. I experienced no irritation, and my skin and hair was soft and very clean. This product is called ""organic, vegan and hypoallergenic"", with the label telling you all the good stuff inside and all the bad stuff that was left out.

"A cookbook from entertainer and Food Network star Trisha Yearwood is always a treat. Like most of her readers and viewers, Trisha is a cook, not a trained chef. Her childhood experiences blended with her career highlights and the camaraderie of her family and friends blend well with a love of cooking and sharing good food with good people. I am a longtime fan of Trisha's music, and I also greatly enjoy watching ""Trisha's Southern Kitchen"" on TV. Her latest cookbook, ""Trisha's Table"" reflects her traditional Southern cooking roots along with her new ""80/20"" food philosophy: 80 percent sensible & 20 percent splurge. While keeping with her Georgia born & raised food favorites, she has reinvented and reimagined many recipes--this book has a very fresh look and feeling to it. Trisha is married to singing star Garth Brooks, whom she says is also a very good cook. Her sister, Beth, along with other family members, frequently guests on the show. I really like the sisters in the kitchen together--they make great food and have a great time. As well as working on a healthier approach to eating, Trisha has been working out, and she looks fabulous! While Trisha is not a dietitian, and there are no nutritional breakdowns for the recipes, ""Trisha's Table"" may just kick-start your own new approach to a healthier lifestyle. Here are some wonderful recipes that offer ""food for thought"": ""Cran-Apple Crisp""; ""Spinach Frittata""; ""Power Balls""; ""Black Bean Chili and Rice""; ""Tortellini Soup""; ""Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup""; ""Pork Tenderloin with Honey Mustard Glaze""; ""Tofu Ricotta Lasagna""; ""Spinach Stuffed Shells""; ""Chickless Pot Pie""; ""Grits-and-Greens Casserole""; ""Chocolate Orange Cake""; ""Hawaiian Cake""; ""Key Lime Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce""; and ""No-Bake Peanut Butter Pretzel Squares"".

"I am a lifetime coffee drinker, starting with childhood cups of ""coffee"" that were more milk and sugar than coffee. I love all varieties of hot and cold coffee beverages, and my favorite flavor of ice cream is...coffee. However, for me, the all-time best way to enjoy coffee is the most basic: hot, freshly-brewed, aromatherapeutic, restorative coffee with a touch of cream and sugar. As a matter of fact, I am drinking a cup right now! The Mr. Coffee SK13 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker is a great, reliable way to enjoy the unbeatable experience of a hot, freshly-brewed, classic cuppa joe. It's the same model that we used at work for years, until someone decided to replace it with a fancy, pricier model by a different manufacturer. Not a good idea--the new coffeemaker not only leaked, but it didn't keep the coffee nice and hot. We had to toss it and use our old standby Mr. Coffee until we could replace it with a newer version of the same model. When my own coffeemaker at home quit working--I was given the old Mr. Coffee unit to use until I could get a new coffeemaker. While years of use and abuse have dimmed its luster, it still makes a great cup of coffee, and it remains at my workplace as a backup for extra duty. This model offers brewing pause & serve, which lets you pour a cup of coffee while the coffeemaker is still brewing. However, it does not offer the automatic 2-hour shut-off feature. It stays on, and stays hot, until you turn it off. Brewed coffee is not only a terrific beverage, it's also a wonderful addition to many recipes. Here's a recipe that I am sure you will enjoy--it's even better served with a cup of coffee!Midnight Mocha Cake2 cups sugar1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 cup cocoa powder2 teaspoons baking soda1 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1 cup buttermilk or sour milk1 cup strong black coffee, cooled1 stick real butter (1/2 cup), melted1 tablespoon vanilla extractPreheat oven to 350F.

"A very nice quality mat, the  STAINMASTER Trusoft Lattice Design Bath Rug feels ""cushy"" to bare feet. This 100% nylon pile rug is made in the USA, and it does not have a strong chemical or dye odor. It absorbs well and dries quickly.

Most important, the rubberized backing is flexible, so it has some ""grip"", and stays in place. STAINMASTER Trusoft bath rugs are stain-resistant, and the company recommends machine wash cold and tumble dry low. I was so pleased by the look and feel of this product, as well as the lack of odor, that I checked out other products in this line here on the Amazon website. The larger area rugs are gorgeous!

"""Blue Stars"", from author Emily Gray Tedrowe, picks the scabs from the ugly wounds of war and its festering, widespread devastation. A compelling storyline combines the horrors of combat for our armed forces with the stateside survivorship of their family and friends. Two very different women find their lives are changed forever when each must face the care and rehabilitation of their gravely wounded returned soldiers. Ellen, a conservative professor, and Lacey, a restless personal trainer, are drawn together by their shared experiences as ""those who wait"" at the Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, DC. Although the characters are fictionalized, the story is inspired by the real-life 2007 housing scandal at Walter Reed. ""Blue Stars"" will open your eyes, permanently alter your perceptions of war and its home front consequences, and linger long in your thought processes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22VT9ZK2F9712/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052483#wasThisHelpful","R22VT9ZK2F9712","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author David Bez is a designer, not a chef, and he doesn't so much create recipes as he does combine marvelous mixes of ingredients to concoct sumptuous, satisfying salads. His gorgeous book, ""Salad Love"", has a clean, linear look that explodes with color from the beautiful salads featured on almost every page. Believe me, those food photos are fork-ready, and they are guaranteed to inspire you to think green and eat fresh. David wanted to incorporate food that is ""healthy, fresh, tasty, and quick"" into meals that would invigorate and energize him in body and mind.

"I have spent most of the day unpacking and carrying pieces of this 100-lb unit up the stairs to the room where it will be used. The ""Cosco The Avery Line 3-Drawer Classic Baby Changing Table, Dark Cherry Finish"" came unassembled in a flat box. The package was quite heavy, and it was difficult for me to even get it far enough into the house to allow me to shut the door. On my own, with arthritic hands, putting this unit together proved to be a formidable task. I am usually able to assemble just about anything for the home, but this was a challenge. Let me say this: ""How could something so heavy, with this price tag, have such cheap parts?"". The image of the piece was promising, with the idea that this would be an attractive, useful piece of furniture which could be used not just for babies and children, but also for teens and adults--something that was made to last and was worth passing on to family members. The product info states that this changing table will hold a baby weighing up to 30 pounds. I would not feel comfortable using this unit to support a baby. The drawers don't seem as though they would hold anything but very lightweight items. I would not give this product as a gift to a mother to use for her baby, and I would not purchase another product from this company for my own use. I would say that this is a decorative rather than functional piece of furniture, but it was so heavy and so time-consuming to put together, at the end its looks had lost some of their appeal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YAUIFC0ABLR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O32ZX76#wasThisHelpful","R1YAUIFC0ABLR3","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With ""One Wish"", I had another lovely visit ""home"" to author Robyn Carr's fictional community of Thunder Point, Oregon. Amid the rugged coastal beauty of this charming little town and its surroundings, longtime residents and newcomers find friendship, a real sense of belonging, and sweetly sensual romance. ""One Wish"" tells the story of Grace Dillon, who moved to Thunder Point to leave behind a troubled past and make her way to a happier future. Unbeknownst to those in her adopted home place, Grace was once a championship figure skater. She walked away from the fame and glory at the height of her career, greatly disappointing her hard-driving mother, who had also been a renowned skater. Grace wanted more from life than the punishing hours of practice and personal sacrifices that came with being on top in her profession--she wanted a real life, a life that offered her the freedom of making her own personal choices. Troy Headly, a popular high school teacher, had come to Thunder Point because the teaching position offered him a chance to be close to the water, where he could pursue his love of the outdoors. Grace and Troy had a mutual friend, Iris, from whom Grace had purchased the flower shop which, although demanding, gave her such satisfaction. Grace had a serious crush on Troy, but he carried a torch for Iris, who married her childhood friend Seth. Things change, however, and as awareness of Graces grows on Troy, she hopes that she's not just a rebound romance. Grace, for all her former celebrity, actually has lived a very sheltered personal life. Troy treats her with respect and gentleness, bringing out her fun side and her great laugh. Grace already knows she's in deep water with her feelings, and Troy is trying to sort through all of his unexpected thoughts about a real relationship with Grace. The things you run from always run right beside you--you can never really leave them behind until you face them down. When the past finds Grace, will the companionship and attraction between them prove to be something much more? Will a future filled with loving joy be theirs for the taking? Come home with me to Thunder Point. I promise you will enjoy the journey, and it's one that you will want to make again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WIDJ3GAEKFUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317722#wasThisHelpful","R2WIDJ3GAEKFUO","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Assuming the position of Deputy Sheriff of Grimstad, Cassie faces the crimes and misdemeanors associated with the money, drugs, and power plays of the oil business. After two years of tracking, she will also come face-to-face with ""The Lizard King"", a heinous serial killer who used the miles and miles of endless asphalt as his own personal hunting ground. He had also murdered Cassie's partner, Cody Hoyt.

"Superlative storyteller Susan Wilson tells a compelling, poignant, and ultimately uplifting tale in ""The Dog Who Saved Me"". While the story does not flinch away from abuse, hardships, and tragedy, it also celebrates survivorship and the triumph of the spirit, both human and animal. At the heart of it all is an extremely well-written, well-paced police story. Cooper Harrison thought he had left his troubled youth behind when he moved from small-town Harmony Farms to become an officer in a Boston K-9 unit. Unable to overcome his grief when beloved canine partner Argos is killed in a bombing incident, Cooper tries to drink away his sorrow and come to grips with the physical limitations of his own injuries. When his marriage and career come to an end, a call from an old friend, now the police chief of Harmony Farms, offers Cooper a chance to start over. He never imagined he would end up as the Animal Control Officer back in his home town, but that's just where he lands. Now he has to face his father, Bull, known as the town drunk, and his older brother, Jimmy, fresh out of prison after serving time on drug charges. Cooper's work as an animal control officer is vastly different from his duties as K-9 unit officer. He's now a lawman, a handyman, a counselor, a psychologist--both for humans and animals, and he's a tracker, a super-sleuth, and much, much more. Along the way he begins a romance with lovely woman, Natalie, who rescues and rehabs horses and has her own set of emotional issues. Linking all of these people together, in ways never anticipated, is a yellow dog. Not just any dog, but a purebred yellow Lab, a victim of abuse, and a survivor of severe hardship. It will take all of Cooper's skill, intelligence, and innate compassion to capture and revitalize this dog, but eventually dog and man will offer to each other the gift of hope. The characters are beautifully-layered and shaded--definitely beyond stereotypes--and you may find yourself rethinking some of your own relationships with others. The storyline is so involving that it will keep you intrigued until the last page is turned, and you will be thinking about all you've read far beyond ""The End"". With ""The Dog Who Saved Me"" author Susan Wilson reminds us that while some people are habitually rotten, beneath the crust of the crustiest humans there beats a heart, and above that heart is brain with a surprising variety and depth of thoughts. A highly recommended read from a very gifted author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQA2YK0042YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250014344#wasThisHelpful","R3GQA2YK0042YF","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Black River"", with its immediate sense of place, compelling storyline, and memorable characters, is a remarkable debut work from author S.M. Hulse. Like the men before him in his family, Wes Carver was a correctional officer for the Montana State Prison, which was located not far from his small home town of Black River. During a prison riot, Wes was tortured and maimed, losing his ability to play his beloved fiddle. Wes and his wife Claire eventually moved from Black River, leaving behind not only the prison, but also Claire's troubled teenaged son, Dennis. Years later, just before Claire's death from leukemia, she requests to go home to Black River. Wes complies, but Claire passes away before they can make it, and Wes travels home with the silent companionship of Claire's ashes. A tense reunion with Dennis is compounded by the upcoming parole hearing for Bobby Williams, the man who had forever changed life for Wes and his family. Can Wes live with whatever the verdict may be, even if the outcome is the unthinkable? Will he find a way to begin healing himself and finding some sense of peace, or will the cycle of violence remain unbroken? ""Black River"" is a quick, involving read that will leave a lasting impression.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JM1FFSQSJLYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544309871#wasThisHelpful","R1JM1FFSQSJLYN","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richly-atmospheric, compellingly-detailed, and thoughtfully-characterized, ""Deepest Roots of the Heart"" is a splendid beginning to author Chautona Havig's ""Legacy of the Vines"" series. Set in the historic beauty of California's Napa Valley in the Post WWII Era, the story actually spans generations as the protagonist tells stories from the past while making plans for his future. Avelino Carrillo survived his horrific wartime experiences with the thought of returning to his family home, la Casa de los Suenos, as the guiding light to see him through. When he finally makes it home, he finds the house and property have been rented to Joe Kearns and his granddaughter, Amelia. Years ago, Avelino's older brother had borrowed money to keep the home, the land and the vineyards in the family. La Casa de los Suenos had been the collateral and the agreement with the money lender had allowed for tenants on the property. While Avelino is drawn to the lovely Amelia, he feels there are too many difference between them, and he most not be distracted from his quest to regain ownership of his ancestral home. However, the heart will have its way, and sometimes the heart is smarter than the mind. Will the growing love between Avelino and Amelia bloom into a harvest as rich and sweet as the fruit of the vineyard?

"""Bettyville"", a beautifully-written memoir from author George Hodgman, will gently break places in your heart, and then it will tenderly patch them back together with warmth and humor. George Hodgman becomes the care provider for his elderly mother, Betty, leaving his life in Manhattan behind and returning to his home town of Paris, Missouri. Having reached the age of ninety-something by living in her own indomitable manner, Betty will not go quietly into old-age oblivion. As issues such as dementia, cancer, and increasing physical frailty creep into the picture, Betty remains a force to be reckoned with. At the age of ninety-one, she chooses to fight her cancer, and begins radiation therapy. Throughout all of their rumblings and grumblings while reconnecting and acclimating to once again living in the same house, it becomes clear that there is a great love between mother and son. Seeing Betty struggle, yet refuse to surrender her spirit, leads George to discover his own personal strengths and gives him the courage to move forward with choices for his future. My own mother's name was Betty, and while our life situation was quite different from George and his mother, much of our circumstances were similar. While George left home and then came back, I stayed with my mother for almost fifty years. My Betty and I were separated only when she passed away. George and his Betty remain together. ""Bettyville"" is keenly-observed, poignant, and written with great heart. A recommended read for caregivers, but also for those who receive the care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZQHTJPU5VDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427201#wasThisHelpful","R2EZQHTJPU5VDT","AG4U11RFDY7LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4U11RFDY7LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty and practical little teapot makes a lovely cuppa...I truly believe that finding joy in simple pleasures is one of the keys to finding personal happiness. Taking time to do something nice for yourself is uplifting and encouraging. The Tea Beyond PINK Glass Teapot Butterfly 710ml 24 Oz Non Drip with Infuser is not only pretty and practical, but it also makes a lovely cuppa. Made of clear tempered glass with an etched design around the pot and a delicately beautiful pink butterfly on the lid, this little teapot adds much pleasure to the tea-drinking experience. Heat resistant glass, an anti-slip handle, and a non-drip spout add functionality to the aesthetic appeal. I always recommend filling a teapot with hot water and letting it sit while you are waiting for the water to boil. When the water has boiled, drain the teapot, fit in the infuser, and add your tea. Pour the boiling water over the tea in the infuser and allow your tea to brew, and in the case of the flowering and blooming teas, watch your tea blossom. To serve, hold the handle with one hand, and keep the lid in place with the other hand. I hand wash the teapot and handle it with care.

One day a week, each of the club members will prepare and distribute an edible blessing, and then they will be repaid in turn. The ideal of nurturing your family in body and soul, providing healthy, home-cooked food, and giving them the blessing of personal time spent together is often in great conflict with the pressures found in our contemporary society. Why not share your heartfelt goals with like-minded family and friends? ""The Soup Club Cookbook"" is filled with fabulous food, beautifully photographed in vivid color, and it offers ideas on how you can start your own ""Soup Club"".

"This book wasn't what I was expecting.  Its more a curiosity than anything else.  The spells are recipes that include real herbs, some dangerous, and then odd stuff that no one could be expected to be able to acquire (brains of an eagle?).  Some of the spells and listings are interesting, but I'd do more research before relying on them.  This seemed more a collection of the strange and spooky gleaned from other sources and then put together to appeal to the reader of the day...who expected icky, weird, dark spells and incenses and the like because isn't that what Witchcraft is all about?It makes a nice addition to the library as a look back at what was being published in the past, but I'd never recommend this book, especially not to a newbie to the Craft.  I've other books like this from that time period with the same focus.  This isn't a book about Witchcraft as a religion, but magical practices and, if you like collections of color associations, herbs, incense recipes (many of which you can't make) then you might like this book...but take much of it with a grain of salt.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJDO71NV4G3KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451168321#wasThisHelpful","RJDO71NV4G3KL","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not really Wicca, not really Traditional Witchcraft, this book sort of falls in-between and is a mix of the author's experiences over many years used to express gnosis he achieved on what he terms the Rose and Thorn Path.  The primary deity of this path is ""She of the Thorn-Blooded Rose,"" and he began with planting a rose bush on his land and then communing with it (with Her) and the Dingle, a nearby woods.  This all began he says in 2006 and he has been building on it ever since, this book being an off-shoot of the work.  As he puts it, this is not really new and not really old.  It is a new path, but one based on ancient ideas and with a framework that is recognizable to us today.The book includes rituals (some of which make use of names which are unknown and probably one of the things the author achieved through communion with the beings of this path), lists/attributes of plants, and tools.  One of the big differences immediately seen is the big use of the mortar and pestle as a tool.  Other tools are somewhat more familiar, including the stang from Trad Craft.  He also gives us a mythology (origin story) and talks about working with plants and the Faery.  He talks about how the center of the rose has 5 points and each of these points contributes to what makes a Witch, as well as how the ""X"" is the point where Witches and Faery meet and this point is the portal.  He also talks about starting by blood-sharing, drinking the ""green blood"" of the plant and offering some of your own blood to your rose bush.If this path appeals to the reader, I can see it as a good beginning.  It lays down a basic structure that you can build your own practice on.  It also can lend some ideas to you if this is not your path and so can be useful in that regard, such as making you think about adding the mortar and pestle to your work or working more closely with plants.  This path didn't jump up and make me feel its the right one for me, but that doesn't mean there aren't folks out there who will read it and find it calls to them.  Old paths can often re-appear through the gnosis and hard work of people who then find a means to put it on a basic structure that others can then take and run with.  This book is an example of that.  It has a familiar part-Wiccan, part-Trad Craft feel to it, mixed with something not before seen...something that has a ring of truth to it and, clearly, will work for those who are drawn to follow it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUIX427H2WS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1578635500#wasThisHelpful","R1JUIX427H2WS8","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these at the same time as I ordered ""Trailer Park Wars,"" because the reviews of the game said it would last longer if you had extra flamingos.

"Fun game that is not for the easily offended.  Trailer Park Wars involves you owning your own trailer park where you add amenities that are then worth points (the points being represented by tiny pink plastic flamingos, what else?) and good tenants who are worth points, while trying to give bad tenants to the other trailer park owners and make bad things happen to their trailer parks, like an alligator infestation, for example.  There are small cardboard name markers where you draw a 1, 2, and 3 to put together your trailer park name, then lay out your trailers that also have names and pictures ranging from nice trailers to rusting junks about to fall down.  You can have good folks in your trailer park or bad ones.  Some are worth more and some are worth less depending on your amenities and some of them can get ""hitched.""One thing I noticed was that, once you have your park going, you tend to get a lot of points per turn, hence having tons of flamingos all over the table.  Once all the flamingos are gone, the game is over.  I did buy the extra flamingos (because of the reviews here), but decided after playing the game to adjust it so that, instead of playing three cards per turn, you can only play one--thus having to decide if you want to improve your park or ding someone else's.  This results in less points per turn and so the flamingos last longer.  I'm also thinking of getting something else to represent, say, 10 flamingos so that you can turn in some and have something else sitting at your trailer park...such as a tiny garden gnome.I also think players should be allowed to use the 1-2-3 name cards to create their trailer park name or just make up their own.  You do get to add your own names to one set of the cards, which I did, but I think there is more room for creativity in allowing folks the pick of naming their own or using the name cards included.The instructions are pretty easy to figure out and anyone should enjoy this from those in their late teens to ?  Some might be a bit offended by it, but those people aren't my friends, that's for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJRPL6FY11QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CWMVC0#wasThisHelpful","R2DJRPL6FY11QP","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A brilliant movie that was as compelling as it was hard to watch at times.  Benedict Cumberbatch once again plays a mad genius wonderfully and Kiera Knightley was also terrific in this film.  The movie is based on the life of Alan Turing, a man called upon in WW2 to help break the German Enigma machine, the machine that they used to send all of their codes and that, if broken, could help win the war for the Allies.  He ends up working at Bletchley Park with other code breakers, where he alienates them due to his lack of social skills and his insistence that he work on his own machine to help them crack Enigma.  Joan Clarke is brought in to help out and she teaches Turing how to at least attempt to act more friendly to his co-workers and, together, they build his own machine...which turns out, as we suspect, to be the first computer off of which all our modern computers are based.The story takes place in the 1950's, where Turing is arrested for homosexuality (a crime in England at the time) with flashbacks to the 1940's and back to Turing's school days in the 1920's.  There are no easy answers in this film as, even if they break Enigma (which we all know they did from history) how and where should this information be used without giving away the game to the Germans?  Bittersweet at times, this movie was very well done and left me thinking how sad it was what happened to this man who helped save millions of lives in WW2 and why it took so long to acknowledge his contribution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9QQ0525IIJY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY85CQI#wasThisHelpful","R9QQ0525IIJY2","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally, I liked this book, most especially that after all of the chapters about how bad things are and how bad things can get if this pattern remains unopposed, the author gives some ideas about to get actively involved in protecting our rights as Americans.  The writing did seem to repeat itself and come across as ranting here and there, but I admire the author's passion in this undertaking.  The book is a pretty quick read and some of it is already a bit dated, but the general gist of the book is still relevant--that there are movements in this country, in particular with the Republican Party/Religious Right, to undermine the Constitutional rights granted to all citizens of this country.  Rights based off the secular common sense and reason of the Founding Fathers and not off one religion or one religious book.The book contains examples of where children have been hurt by laws not affecting religious run organizations, such as day cares, and how allowing parents to not take their children to doctors/hospital when they in need of medical attention has allowed them to suffer and even die.  I have no problem, personally, with the idea of faith-healing, but I also don't think it means  you can't take your children in for medical attention at the same time.  The book states that those fighting against organizations who are attempting to make this country a Christian theocracy spend too much time battling the small problems while letting the big ones slip on by...such as fighting over nativity scenes being displayed in public areas in small towns rather than letting the Texas Dept of Education dictate what can amount to false science or false history in the majority of textbooks here in the US.One chapter lists 50 politicians who are, to one extent or another, involved in putting their particular religious views into law and undermining the separation of Church and State that allows us Americans to have our freedom of religion in the first place.  The quotes at the beginnings of the chapters were also very telling...and scary.  As was the chapter where the author gave quotes from Jefferson and Madison and how they would be received today, even though they played a huge part in the founding of our country.  He also quotes from Abraham Lincoln and a treaty from the 1700's that directly states that the US is not a Christian country...a treaty that Pres George Washington also played a part in approving.This book needs to be read, no matter how hard the truths are that it contains.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13T2R0CXVSF0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKBT05E#wasThisHelpful","R13T2R0CXVSF0C","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark humor in the best British tradition, ""One Foot in the Grave"" is the sad tale of Victor and his long-suffering wife, Margaret.  Victor is between jobs and spends his time getting into spats with the neighbors and just about anyone else he comes across.  If anything can go wrong in his life...it will, and he will spend eternity grousing about it.  The shows are about a half hour long each and they pack a lot into them.  Another long-standing character who appears is Mrs Warboys, who also ends up with her life crumbling down as often as not.This season includes a dark (of course!) Christmas special that involves radioactive allotment dirt.  Another one is about a battle over garbage/littering, and another sees the Meldrew's burgled so that they end up sitting on lawn chairs in their living room staring at the place where their tv used to be.  Oh...and bird's nest dropping on Victor's head during a wedding video, and trying to get a man in to shave off the bottom of their doors so they will close over new carpet.One wonders how Margaret has put up with Victor for so long, but then an episode happens where you realize they are, quite honestly, made for each other.  You also can see that they honestly do care for each other...in those instances (rare, though they are) when Victor's kinder (gasp!) nature comes through, albeit ever so briefly.Don't expect a light-hearted slapstick romp through the daisies and you might enjoy this show.  Victor is hilarious to watch, but he is definitely not the guy you want living next door to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBB71SM7M9JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YRY7VM#wasThisHelpful","R2CBB71SM7M9JD","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This documentary revolves around three people who follow a mystical path--a member of the Spiritualist church, a Lakota man who Sundances, and a Witch who is part of the Feri Tradition.  It promised to be an interesting look at non-mainstream religions in America, but fell mostly flat.  The actual film quality was nicely done, but the documentary was way too slow and way too long.  How many times do we have to watch someone standing there looking out over the landscape while they play wind noises or some such?For someone who doesn't know much about the Spiritualist Church, the Lakota religion and modern Witchcraft, this documentary would have fallen short of imparting any kind of real understanding.  Perhaps, it would have been better to include a greater depth of background into the Spiritualist Church, Lakota ways and practices, and Feri Craft in order to really get where these people were coming from.  As it is, the documentary tried to tie all of this together in some way to comment on mysticism in America, but it was a very clumsy effort that didn't much succeed.  What was the real point of this documentary?  It seemed lost most of the time...If you wanted the documentary to be about mystic paths in America, there are many others out there besides these three, including more mainstream Christian religions that have mystical practices.  The same is true of Islam and Judaism.  But if the point was to look at less well known paths that the general population knows little if anything about, I would think this program would leave them more confused than anything.  It could also leave them thinking these people are just crazy.I can't recommend this documentary, both because it was too slow, too long, and way too pretentious and because its content didn't really leave you with a deeper comprehension of mysticism in modern America.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBHTKBP9NE11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7IC34Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UBHTKBP9NE11","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This soap came very quickly and was extremely well-packaged.  The bars are full-sized and have a nice floral rose scent to them, not too powerful, not too faint.

"This is a pretty good gluten free breakfast cereal.  If you're looking for something that will taste exactly like corn flakes, these are made of amaranth primarily and they do have a slightly different flavor to them.  They are crunchy and hold up in milk and aren't too sweet, as so many cereals tend to be.  This is not my absolute favorite gluten free cereal, but they are very good all the same.The best amaranth flakes I ever had actually were slightly blue in color and they definitely had a different taste to them, but I can't seem to find them anymore.

"I have tried out many many gluten free breads and found a few that are worth raving over, but most of them are still only really good for a day and then you have to put them in the freezer and toast them to make them work.  However, this bread is different.  Not only is it sealed up in a closed bag within the outer bag, but it is fresh and soft and tastes more like real bread than any other gluten free bread I have tried yet.  After I open it, I then keep it in the fridge and it stays fresh for several more days, before I finally put it in the freezer just in case.  But, like wow!!! that first day of fresh gluten free bread that tastes like real bread is wonderful...This bread is not only terrific for sandwiches (finally!), but its good toasted and to bake with.  I would not hesitate to use this bread for stuffings and bread puddings.  I've even used it to make French Toast.I have found it the store for about 5-6 dollars a loaf, but, that being said, I have a hard time finding it at most grocery stores at all.

"Overall, this was a good book and a decent thriller that kept me reading until the end.  But it wasn't a book that kept me so glued to it that I couldn't put it down.  The main characters were interesting and the plot was good, but there were just a few too many subplots that detracted from the main one and that we, honestly, didn't need.  It was like they were just there to make the book longer.Some spoilers.  Cam and Mike have broken up, but their teenage daughter Tess hasn't given up on them getting back together.  The main issue is Cam's broken home (her mom left when she was little and her sister committed suicide) and that her father is a drinker and that Cam has had visions of lost and hurt children for years...something she has kept from her husband and that drove her to drink, as well.  She thinks these visions are bad dreams, but it turns out she is actually psychic.  She and Tess go to their home on an island and, of course, that is the hunting ground of the serial killer in question.  Another psychic appears (this plot point seems forced) and Cam becomes involved with the police investigation for the various missing teenage girls and, no surprise, her own daughter also ends up missing.I did enjoy this book and would read another by this author, but she is no Mary Higgins Clark (much as the book blurbs try to make her out to be).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G2RIWN6DI8LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420101315#wasThisHelpful","R2G2RIWN6DI8LP","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was all set to like this book.  It had a great idea, but the actual writing and plot left a lot to be desired.  As a first time novel, this was a swing and a miss...maybe, the author needs to go back and take a few writing classes before their next attempt to undertake a novel.  Some of the plot went nowhere and were just dropped.  There were scenes that made no sense and didn't advance the plot.  Some of the descriptions were unnecessarily crude and offensive, especially anything to do with sex.Some spoilers ahead:  The plot was supposed to revolve around Conrad and his wife Joanna moving from LA to an old house in Wisconsin that used to be a ""birthing house,"" essentially a place where women came to have their kids.  The implication was that this included un-wed women.  Of course, the house is haunted and the former owner hands Conrad an old photo album where one of the women of the past looks just like his current wife.  However, this intriguing plot point never really turned into anything so it was pretty useless.  Conrad also begins to keep snakes--unbeknownst to  his wife--and one of them lays eggs without the help of a male and this seems to reflect in the women in this house getting pregnant.  However, the plot with the snake also ends up no where and its never really made clear if the women are getting pregnant without a male or with one?  The idea was that the house wants to ""birth"" things, I guess.In fact, I was guessing a lot with this story as it left out too much that was needed and put in things we didn't need, such as Conrad's obsession with iced tea (?) and with the pregnant teenage girl next door, Nadia, as he interfered between her and her boyfriend.  Also, ghost sex anyone?  Or was it ghost sex?  All of this was confused.  If the point was to confuse the plot as to whether Conrad was just going crackers or being influenced by the house or ghosts in the house, then that would have been a good story, but it was handled so clumsily that you couldn't tell...and, by the end, you didn't care.  This book needed more editing and a good, strong, serious re-write to fill in the plot holes, cut out the extraneous details, and make more cohesive sense.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAJLXI6WSIT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312624158#wasThisHelpful","R1QAJLXI6WSIT8","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely love this cookbook!  These are definitely ""Grandma"" recipes, and from Grandmas who could cook up a storm.  So far, all of the recipes I've tried have turned out great.  I can definitely recommend them, though this may not be a book for the beginner cook as some of the recipes instructions are fairly minimal as the cooks who wrote them down back in the day expected that anyone reading them would have a basic knowledge of what to do and when to do it.The book also contains histories of the grandmas that the recipes came from and other tidbits of information.  For example, one recipe for a date cake was such a favorite that they served it at a wedding and another that a recipe for a fruit and nut jumble (a kind of cookie) was passed along during the 1920's.  When I read this book, it's like I'm looking at the old recipes I inherited from my grandmas and they even included a couple of pages of copies of the actual hand-written recipes to look at.The only thing I would have liked to see included in this book were some photos, as I would have liked to see the grandmas in question, their farms, their kitchens.  Other than that, this is a fabulous book for those who enjoy trying out old recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7E82K52IS71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971845611#wasThisHelpful","R3A7E82K52IS71","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always worry about buying a perfume without being able to smell it first...but this one turned out to be a winner.  I am not into overly-floral scents since so many of them are too strongly sweet and some of them even smell more like a chemical replica of a floral scent than actual flowers, but this one was perfect.  I have tried Elizabeth Arden's regular Green Tea perfume and liked that one, too, but this one adds a slightly more flowery scent that still managed to remain subtle and light.  I'm not sure it really smells like honeysuckle, but it smells nice all the same.

"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I would have enjoyed it more if it had been cut by about 100 pages.  There was just too many characters who didn't have anything much to do with the plot and nothing really panned out in their stories that added enough to that main plot to make it worthwhile.  I must admit that I started skipping pages about half-way through when the focus was on these secondary characters so that I could stick with the much more interesting main story.Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather want to get their dream, a catering company in Dublin, off to a start.  They finally find a site and, despite hints of some dark past with the location, they acquire it and fix it all up and get their business going.  The stories about their trials with various customers and their parties and events is one of the best parts of the book.  But their focus on the new business is distracted by Cathy's problems with her husband, Neil, a lawyer who chases after every good cause, taking up all of his time, and Tom's issues with Marcella, who wants desperately to be a model.  Also, Cathy ends up taking charge of two children, relatives of her husbands, whose own parents can't take care of them for a while.  Simon and Maud are also one the best parts of the book as they struggle to become reasonable children and learn some actual manners.  I also enjoyed Cathy's parents, Lizzie (who used to work for Neil's mom, who never got over the fact that her darling son married the help's daughter) and Muttie, who is always hopeful that the next horse he bets on will be the big winner.When their business, the Scarlet Feather, is broken into and items are stolen and the rest destroyed...real trouble ensues.  Can they pull themselves together again or will they have to close the business with their dreams shattered and disappoint their friends-investors?  Who is behind this awful event?  What happens when the children's parents return and are still hopeless to take care of them?If this book had just focused on Cathy and Tom and their significant others, plus Lizzie and Muttie and the children...the main part of the family, who had issues enough between them, this would have been a book worth 4 or 5 stars.  But all the side characters just distracted and, honestly, weren't really important or needed.  Skip those bits and not only won't you miss anything, but its a far better story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT6NKXV0WRXIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451203771#wasThisHelpful","RT6NKXV0WRXIG","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I enjoyed this book and polished it off in just a few sittings.  What fascinating me the most were the glimpses into the main character's lifestyle as a big country music star and how that clashed with her small town upbringing and the life that her mother lives.  Tess (known as ""Mac"" to her fans) returns back to Wintergreen as she is guilted into going home to take care of her mother as she undergoes hip surgery.  One of her sisters is very nice and friendly, but the other is clearly jealous of her and causes trouble.  This could have been explained more and I would have preferred SOME resolution of this, but it didn't come as the focus of the story became the romance between Tess and Kenny, a former school-mate and former-nerd back in high school who had always had a thing for her.The interaction between Tess and her stubborn, practical mother was great...as Tess tries to persuade her that she can wear the nice clothing she has bought for her and that, yes indeed, she is rich enough to give her mother expensive things.  But her mother would, obviously and understandably, prefer to see Tess rather than get gifts.  The growing romance between Tess and Kenny was nice enough, though very predictable.  I also felt very bad for Faith, Kenny's girlfriend of nearly 10 years, and honestly what happened there made me not like Kenny very much.  Tess was also annoying at times as she made such a big deal out of not wanting to eat the food she grew  up with as she needed to remain skinny skinny for her business.  Yes, that makes sense, but she should have understood better that her mother showed her love with cooking and the book could have made one point about that and then let it go, but it kept showing up.The relationship between Tess and Kenny's talented daughter also was pretty predictable.  Of course, Tess needs a new back-up singer right at the same time she wants to bring Casey to Nashville.  It seemed just a bit too pat.Still and all, I did enjoy the book and the glimpse into the life of a country star and the interaction with where she grew up.  I just think the romance could have sparked more and been a little less contrived.  Not this author's best work, but I do enjoy all of her books and I did enjoy this one, but probably won't read it a second time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K89FFCEO1TI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425261174#wasThisHelpful","R1K89FFCEO1TI9","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I enjoyed the book and polished it off in two days in my spare time.  I enjoyed the description of the high-paced and crazy world of fashion and of the super-thin girls who think they are fat (shades of ""Top Model"") and how everyone in the world seems to think the editor of some fashion magazine is so important despite her horrible attitude, simply because she has an eye for fashion.That being said, I liked the movie way better than the book.  Andrea, the assistant to Miranda, is much more likeable in the movie and even Miranda is more likeable (slightly).  The movie also gives us more of an idea why Miranda acts the way she does.  As for the plot, Andrea becomes Miranda's assistant at ""Runway"" and Miranda treats her dreadfully, but Andrea is only in it for the ability to get promoted at the end of one year and wants to be a REAL writer and thinks fashion is essentially stupid.  The rest revolves around this and the trials it causes Andrea and how her relationships fall apart as Miranda becomes the center of her world.By the end of the book, no matter how entertaining it was at times, I felt let down--I didn't like Andrea, I didn't like Miranda, I didn't like Andrea's boyfriend (and can't even recall his name, if that gives any clue as to his non-entityhood) and I really really disliked Lily, Andrea's friend.  I also had lost interest in them by the end, because if you dislike a character but find them interesting that's still a good character in my book.Good for one read and funny enough and entertaining enough for 4 stars and I can definitely recommend it for anyone into fashion and drama and drama about fashion.  But don't expect to like anyone by the end and don't expect there to be any kind of resolution.  Watch the movie for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PF8A346PWII9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767914767#wasThisHelpful","R1PF8A346PWII9","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For some reason, I love this movie.  I have seen it multiple times now and it just captures me every time.  Perhaps, its the backdrop of the spectacular Niagara Falls.  Perhaps, its Marilyn.  Whatever it is, this thriller of jealousy and betrayal and murder is fascinating.Marilyn plays Rose, a beautiful woman married to George, who suffers from the after-effects of his time in WW2.  They are vacationing in Niagara Falls and end up bumping into another vacationing couple, Polly and Ray.  Turns out Rose is scheming to hook up with her secret lover and to have him murder her husband so they can run off together.  Polly gets wrapped up in their story as she helps George after a melt-down, and then becomes far more deeply involved as the plot unfolds.  You end up feeling bad for both George and Rose as they clash and, clearly, their marriage was doomed almost from the beginning.  One wonders why the seductive and clearly fun-loving Rose ever got hooked up with George in the first place.The vintage (now) clothing and vacation setting of Niagara Falls are fascinating.  Simpler times were never simply times.  The backdrop of the Falls is incredible and you almost feel like it reflects the inevitable destruction of both Rose and George Loomis.I bought a copy of this on Blue Ray and it was well worth it.  When you take an old movie and put it on Blue Ray, it can only get so much better, but it did make the colors pop more (can you say Marilyn's fabulous ever-red and always perfect lipstick) and sharpened up the picture a little, as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQD3YQUJNVWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JF5T5W#wasThisHelpful","RQQD3YQUJNVWA","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rough, lonesome at times landscapes and windswept shorelines and crags are some of the backdrop for this murder mystery series.  Equally rough around the edges, clearly lonely in her life, but dedicated to the core is the police detective that the show is named after, Vera.  She is certainly no Hollywood star as she slouches around in haphazard clothing with her hair needing a comb at times and a hat often pulled down low.  She also is very plain-spoken, even harsh at times, yet you can still see it is all a shell to hide how much she cares within.Vera is a fascinating character as she unravels various murder mysteries.  Unlike many other tv shows, you never know whodunit until near the end and, often, the ending has its own bittersweet flavor to it.  Yes, they find the killer(s), but it won't bring back the dead or stop the pain of those who lost their loved one.  There are really no ""happy"" endings in this show, but should there be when murder is involved?  This show tells it like it is more than most.  Vera is definitely, despite her bulldoggedness (or maybe because of it) just the kind of cop you'd want on the case.LOVE this British series.  Am haunted by the landscapes and the people who are a match for it, including Vera herself.

"I freely admit I read this book because I adored the movie.  It is one of my go-to movies to make me feel good, though I love the scenes with Julia better than the ones with Julie.  This should have been my first clue that I might not like the book ""Julie and Julia"" as much because the scenes in the movie re Julia and her husband in France where she learned to cook and the travails of getting the cookbook published as they moved from country to country and home to home didn't actually come out of this book, but was based on another book about Julia.I went back and forth between liking Julie in the movie and, as it turned out, I disliked her more in this book as we were exposed to more of her temper tantrums and hatred of where she worked (and Republicans) and issues with herself and her husband.  She came across as very immature at times, even insensitive in some ways...even as she was too sensitive in other ways.  Honestly, I didn't find the book funny and it was gross at times.  Did we really need that much detail about how nasty their plumbing was and how their lack of cleaning during her cooking project resulted in flies and worse?I think I like Julie better in the movie due to the sweet urchin appeal of the actress, not due to the character she is portraying.  I have no desire to read this author's second book or any blog by her.  Sorry to say, I love the idea of this book (loving cooking), but it pales in comparison to the movie that resulted.  Read ""My Life In France"" about Julia instead.  Maybe, if they hadn't made such a good movie I would have liked the book better.  I admire the author's willingness to put her life out for all to see, but I think a few more writing classes might have improved matters.  She has talent and a cook angle on incorporating cooking and life's lessons, but maybe needs to learn about what to leave out of a book as much as what to put in.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F13AG6GNY4L9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031604251X#wasThisHelpful","R2F13AG6GNY4L9","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is, hands down, my absolute favorite CD by Enigma.  I have all of their CD's and they all have a shared sense to them, a common rhythm even as times, so that they feel tied together...yet, each CD also has its own flavor if you will.  This CD draws from tribal music and the songs address native issues when another religion comes to destroy their own faith and take over (even destroy) their land ""in the name of God.""Favorite songs include ""Out From the Deep,"" ""Eyes of Truth"" and the title song ""Cross of Changes.""  This song hits you hard and lingers on long after the CD ends.  It seems to refer not just to the Christian Cross, but to bearing a cross (bearing hardships), and being on a crossroads between one world, one time, and another.  The drumming and the native singing are wonderful and fit in really well with the work Enigma does on this song, and the whole CD.If you want to own just ONE Enigma CD, this is the one I would suggest.  Though, their earlier CD with Gregorian chants interwoven is also great if you enjoy Gregorian chant.  Enigma is definitely not just some New Age group with sweet happy sounds mixed in with whale song and cricket noises.  Enigma is a delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR5ER8QZ3YUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002U6E#wasThisHelpful","RAR5ER8QZ3YUR","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still like more of the individual songs on ""El Camino"" better and that CD seemed to rock a bit more, but this CD has definitely gotten under my skin.  I now listen to it almost as often as ""El Camino.""  This CD definitely puts you into a certain headspace, something a bit dark and strange and wonderful and somewhat psychedelic.Favorite songs include Weight of Love and Fever, but really I listen to the whole CD as a single mood piece more than anything.

"This book kept me reading, but mostly to find out what happened to the two girls and who was behind it.  The story is told from alternating points of view and jumps around in time, but I found that distracting at times and began skimming some of the sections because it just wasn't as interesting as the plot re the two missing girls.  Calli and Petra are friends and Petra tries to speak for Calli as Calli has remained mute for many years.  No one knows why.  Calli's mother, Antonia, used to go with Louis, the local sheriff, but then (and this point was a bit silly, I though) they fell apart and she married the local bad boy, Griff.  Of course, Griff is an alcoholic and is abusive.The story revolves around Griff taking Calli off to the woods one morning when he was supposed to have gone fishing with his buddy.  The why of this was confusing and never really cleared up.  It didn't make much sense.  That same night, Petra goes missing from her bed.  The rest involves the search for the two girls and all sorts of accusations, some of which go back to the relationship between Antonia and Louis.  Some of the scenes felt muddled so you weren't quite sure what had happened or was happening, but it finally resolves itself and, yes, there is a mystery as to Petra's disappearance.Overall, a good effort.  I think less changes of view would have been better and, maybe, fewer flashbacks.  Some of the characters felt a bit flat at times.  I preferred her book ""Little Mercies"" much better.  Be warned, this is a dark story around child abuse and not an easy read at times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197RK3O7IURCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSX0L82#wasThisHelpful","R197RK3O7IURCR","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a series where normally the episodes are about a half hour long.  This DVD includes 2 episodes that are more like an hour long and includes the usual mix-ups, interweaving of odd plots and circumstances, and the familiar grouch who looks at the world with anything but rose-colored glasses, Victor.  He and his wife and their (poor) neighbors endure mishap after mishap, all of which leaves you laughing out loud.  Victor putters around and gets into trouble and you think you should dislike him--and probably would if he was actually your neighbor--but you really feel how much he loves his long-suffering wife.  These two episodes include such things as a supposedly haunted caravan, their neighbor's mother apparently being taken on trips by aliens, a mistake of identity that results in a supposed kidnapping, a man who takes up residence in their shed while they are gone who turns out to be something more than what they imagined...and Victor being cheerful, scary as that is!  And that's just for starters...  This is not a show for children, but for those who love British humor, ""One Foot in the Grave"" is well worth watching.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UU0MIPOYBD3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BIULN0#wasThisHelpful","R2UU0MIPOYBD3U","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It was well written, easy to read, and contained a wealth of information surrounding the general theme of Walpurgisnacht...May Eve for most of us.  Clearly, the author had done her research and the book talks about the origins of Walpurgisnacht, including info about St Walpurga (including the false story that she is the daughter of a king who lived hundreds of years after her, which the author thankfully points out, so kudos for that!), woodwives and wild women, the Valkyries, all sorts of kinds of old German Witches.  One of my favorites was the Mist Witch.  Another bit I enjoyed was the material surrounding the Brocken, the traditional Witches' Mountain of Germany.The history and folklore I loved, but I wasn't so much into the craft projects she included which seemed pretty simplistic.  As for the recipes...eh.  I could see the old German pancake one as pancakes have folkloric associations with Paganism and Fae, but a salad recipe that she called a Witchy Salad?  But the one that lost a star for this review was the section regarding old flying ointments with all of their dangerous psychoactive substances…and then the author included 2 recipes for what she called Flying Ointments that were essentially party dips.  Why?  Why not just talk seriously about flying ointments and leave it at that, rather than calling party dips flying ointments?  A lot of the other recipes didn’t seem to have much association with the topic either, such as linking a French toast recipe to the topic about hags and hedges.  I would have rather she stuck to the topic, have a few crafty items that could be tied to the season, maybe even a recipe or two that clearly can be linked to the topic—such as the traditional German May Wine—than add in all these things that have little to no association with the theme of the book.  It began to seem like filler after a while.  Still…a good book that I can recommend as being on a topic that needed more focus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHGGBSF19GPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738720585#wasThisHelpful","RBHGGBSF19GPJ","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The shirt was delivered quickly and came wrapped in an inner plastic bag with a cushioned outer bag.  The fabric is medium weight and hangs well and the hint of glitter on the bottom is very nice.  Love the soft green color and it fits perfectly, even the length of the sleeves.  This is dressy enough for work with a nice pair of pants or skirt and casual enough to wear out with jeans or leggings.  I've worn this to work and the long sleeves are a little short, but then I like sleeves that come down past my wrists so I imagine most will be okay with this.

"Absolutely fascinating and fabulous!  This show just keeps on getting better and better.  I find myself sitting down to watch one episode and then just keep going as I can't wait to see what happens next.  Action, betrayal, love, death, pain, plotting...this show is never ever boring and keeps you guessing.  No character is safe from death, as they keep proving.  The characters also are complex enough that I hated Jamie Lannister in the first season and now have grown to like him.  This season proves there are way worst families out there than the Lannisters (scary as that is).  My favorite story arcs from this season include Daenerys (as ever) with her growing ability to be a Queen and her focus on freeing all slaves.  Also, shockingly, the relationship between Arya and The Hound.  The introduction of Oberyn...I found him fascinating right off.  But the star of the show continues to be Tyrion and his trials (in this season, quite literally).

"I was hoping to fall in love with this show, but I didn't even finish off watching the season.  I just didn't care enough to see if any big reveal re Bo's parents was coming.  This show had some great potential, but the scripts...eh.  I liked Kenzi, the human sidekick of Bo, a Fae who didn't know she was Fae but know something was up as she kept sucking the life out of her sexual partners.  Kenzi was more interesting to me with her ability to speak Russian and her background in theft and strange cybergeek friends.  Bo, on the other hand, never seemed to change and everyone acted like she was a Big Deal, but I just never saw it.  The Light Fae and the Dark Fae didn't seem to have much difference between them and the plots ended up devolving into more of a monster-of-the-week format after a while.  I also never saw any real spark between Bo and Dyson, her wolf-shifting on and off boyfriend.  Maybe, this picked up in Season 2, but I'll never know because I didn't make it to the end of Season 1.  This could have been hot and full of strange fantastical plots, but it just fell a bit too flat for my tastes.

"I haven't read the book or books, didn't even know they existed.  I just picked this up because of the idea of a vampire school.  That being said, this obviously is an attempt to latch onto the vampire craze brought on by Twilight.  Rose is a half-human, half-vampire who is being trained to protect the ""good"" vampires, the Moroi.  In particular, she is attached to Lissa, a princess in the vampire world who has yet to declare her magical power (earth, air, fire or water) and who is clearly in danger, both without and within the school, the Vampire Academy.Everyone, generally, is young and pretty in this movie and its a combo of high school issues (like who likes who and who hates who) mixed up with a hint of more adult politics, but barely.  I liked the relationship between Rose and Lissa, but everything really was pretty predictible.

"This is a good adaptation, but I have to admit I still prefer the one for the stage.  Into the Woods is basically broken into two parts.  Part One is based on the standard fairytales of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Little Red Riding Hood.  Only, in this case, they are all intertwined as they take place in the same area and the characters run into each other and interact as they go ""into the woods"" to seek what they need.  The main driver is the story of the baker and his wife who have been cursed by their neighbor, the Witch, and have to seek out a series of items in order for the Witch to relent and uncurse them, allowing them to have a child.Part Two of the story involves what happens after Happily Ever After, when the consequences of all their actions in Part One come home to roost.  The songs are terrific (though, difficult to sing I've heard) and, in this case, we actually get special effects instead of stage effects (which can be funnier).  All in all, this isn’t quite as good as the stage version, so if you get a chance to see it…see it on stage.  This is NOT a children’s movie, as the stories are closer to the originals.  Streep does a great job as the Witch.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as the Wolf (definitely NOT for children).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZJNTMRD7NDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7WBGHG#wasThisHelpful","R3RZJNTMRD7NDW","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of this movie when it was in the theatre, but found it a good watch on DVD.  Dench is my favorite and she does a great job as Mrs Henderson, a rich widow who decides to splurge after her husband dies and buy a rundown old theatre, the Windmill.  She hires Van Damm (played by Hoskins) to manage the theatre and they have a sparring love-hate relationship that amuses them as much as those watching it.  At first, they decide to stand out by running their shows all the time, but when other theatres follow suit, Mrs Henderson has the idea to have nudes in their show.  This is a huge deal in the late 1930's and, fortunately, she knows the powers in govt and sweet talks them into seeing the nudes as art, so long as no one moves and the lighting shadows them tastefully.The move is based off the real story of the Windmill Theatre and the crew of regular English girls who agreed to pose nude--called the Millerettes--and the additions to the DVD include interviews with the remaining real Millerettes.  Set against pre-war England and WW2, this illuminates a story that few of us knew anything about.  Dench gives a wonderful performance and her speech about why the Windmill should remain open is very well done and quite touching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCHR0A1HBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETRCN0#wasThisHelpful","R2MCHR0A1HBH","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this movie way more than I expected to.  I got it  because I love Judy Dench and Maggie Smith, but the movie turned out to be chockful of familiar British actors...and Cher, of course.  Its set just before WW2 and through WW2, where some English ladies in Florence have formed a group around loving the arts, while Cher plays a wealthy American woman who comes to Europe to buy art, with Lily Tomlin as her pants-wearing would-be archeologist sidekick.  The group ends up taking in a young boy named Luca whose father can't acknowledge him and whose mother has died.  The war comes along, but the ladies refuse to leave their beloved Florence, as the Maggie Smith's character thinks highly of Mussolini and even once had tea with him (hence the title) and they think it will all just blow over.  The ladies end up pulling together to help each other during the hard times of the war and being imprisoned as enemy-aliens and, also, to help save the fabulous art of Florence.The oddball crew of English and American ladies in the movie really are the heart of the movie, with their story set against the greater backdrop of the day.

"This is a book that is sorely needed and one that I wish had been published like decades ago, for the same reasons.  The book is a series of articles (or blog postings) that have been put together in order to address the issues faced by pagan leaders, groups, and communities.  How to lead?  How not to lead?  What to do when there is a bad or abusive pagan leader in your community, including coming to understand that some things you just can’t do anything about.  This is the strongest message in the book—that there are just some people you can’t help and that you can’t fix, whether they are in your group or are leading a group.  As the author put it several times, some people are just above your “pay grade” and need professional help.The author talks about dealing with your own issues (your “shadow”) in order to be the best leader or the best member of a group you can be.  She recommends other books and courses in order to learn needed techniques of communication and handling group dynamics.  Much of what she says in this book can also be applied to non-pagan situations, such as jobs or families where there is a leader who is just not good in that role for whatever reason, from lack of training to the wrong sort of temperament to unaddressed personal issues to actual mental illness.She talks about learning how to say “no” when you are the kind of person who is driven to put on events or run a group, yet find yourself saying “yes” all the time to things that you really don’t have the time for.  She addresses the issues of “pagan standard time,” why it seems so hard to find pagans to step up to the plate and take charge and volunteer, and why most pagans find it hard to confront people in their group or running their group who are causing trouble.This book really covers a lot of territory and is very readable.  It gives some excellent advice and supplies additional resources to explore.  The biggest issue with the book is that it really could have done with a spot of editing, as the author repeats things several times in different chapters (occasionally word for word, so that it looked like the blogs/articles had been written at different times on a related topic and so overlapped here and there) and, sometimes, the structure of the writing got in the way of the message.  There were some sentences that were not well structured and there were some paragraphs that lacked spacing between them.  She throws out the names of other pagans, such as Selena Fox, with the assumption that her readers will just know who that is.  This is nothing that a bit more practice and a good editor/proofreader couldn’t fix.The only other issue I had with the book was the last part came across as a bit of a personal tirade, where she talked about how pagans say they are ecologically-minded, but consume much like everyone else.  Several times, she stated if someone handed her a paper or plastic cup during a ritual that she would refuse it and indicated that leaders who plan big rituals where liquids are handed out to everyone should be given glass cups or be asked to bring their own so they can be washed instead of being thrown out.  She also said we shouldn’t use wine or even fruit juice because not everyone can drink that kind of stuff and we shouldn’t use cookies or bread in ritual because of those who are vegan or gluten-free…instead, she says why can’t we just pour water over people’s hands and given them apples and celery sticks?  Of course, pouring water over people’s hands is NOT the same thing as offering them someone to drink and apples and celery are not the same as bread.  She didn’t seem to consider that is a change in symbology and meaning.  (Of course, you can make vegan and gluten-free cookies or bread for ritual.)  She also didn’t seem to consider—in her response to someone who said she can’t speak about the topic of being ecological if she uses toilet paper—that by using washable cloth for toilet paper instead of actual toilet paper that the carbon footprint from washing such cloth is greater than that of using toilet paper.  I agree that pagans (like everyone) should be mindful, but the last part of the book seemed to belong to another book or article than the first half of the book.Still, very much recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4Q6TOD3OZN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499154097#wasThisHelpful","R3U4Q6TOD3OZN5","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The landscape in this movie was lovely and the plot was intriguing.  It revolves around two Navaho tribal police officers named Leaphorn and Chee.  Leaphorn is the veteran who is on leave due to his wife’s health issues and, obviously, has a lot on his mind even as he is called back to investigate claims that an archeologist is illegally selling pots.  Chee, on the other hand, seems a rookie as he lets a backhoe get stolen and keeps driving vehicles into the ground as he chases his tail looking the for thieves.  He’s also very traditionalist and so very worried about this investigation as it brings him into burial grounds.  The two stories converge, of course, as the suspected archeologist goes missing, we find a local Christian Navaho preacher might be behind some of the pot selling (great job by a favorite of mine, Graham Greene), and what does this have to do with the ghosts of the dead and the mystery of the disappearance of the Anasazi anyway?I enjoyed the feel of the movie, especially the hint of supernatural, but when it eventually became pretty much a straightforward murder mystery story, I found it not quite as engaging as in the beginning.  I also thought the subplot of one of the suspect archeologists hitting on Leaphorn didn’t seem to add much to the overall story and was kind of annoying.  There also seemed to be a missing plot point as two murdered men were found, but (unless I missed it) they never told us the results of the autopsies and so what killed them, leaving their eyes dead-white.But, overall, this was a very engaging movie and I didn’t figure out who was behind it until the end, which is a plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W27UTRN0OP4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AXWHP8#wasThisHelpful","R1W27UTRN0OP4N","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admittedly, I only made it through half the shows before I shut it off.  I was expecting dark comedy and I normally enjoy dark comedy, but I was still waiting for the comedy when I gave it up.  Certainly, it was dark and gruesome at times, with odd turns such as the doctor running around with half his face shaved, and I could see an attempt to be funny, but I just never found it amusing.The premise is that a young doctor fresh from medical school goes off to some hospital in the middle of the frozen, ever-snowing Russian countryside back in the early 1900’s where he meets nurses who look down at him (favoring his dead predecessor at every chance), and other medical professionals (if you pardon the term) who don’t seem to have a clue half the time.  Supposedly, this young doctor got top marks in school, but he runs back to check his books every time a patient presents just about and is haunted by his older self, which is not explained and didn’t seem to add much to the story.The acting was great and the idea seemed good, so I’m not sure who to blame for the lack of humor.

Basically, Oren had lost his beloved wife and now is in the process of selling their home, but doesn’t want to reduce the price by even one penny from the 8 plus million dollar price tag.  It’s clear that it means more to him than just a home as it represents his once dream life with his wife.  In the meantime, he is hanging out in a small complex by the lake, offending everyone there as well, where he bumps into Leah, a woman who also has lost her husband.  You can see where this about to go…but it ends up a funny and touching romp all the same.What sparks the movie is Oren’s son having to go to jail and dropping Oren’s granddaughter into his lap to take care of in the meantime.  Leah ends up in the role of “grandma” to Sarah, even as Oren reluctantly (grouching the whole way) is drawn into caring both about Sarah and Leah.  He even ends up with a pet dog in the process, go figure!A movie about how redemption and romance can happen at any time and at any age.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVEUU0FF1MLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW6KQYE#wasThisHelpful","RFVEUU0FF1MLF","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely brilliant performance by Julianne Moore as Alice, a highly intelligent linguistics teacher who finds herself diagnosed with familial early-onset Alzheimers.  This is an incredible movie, but definitely not one that is easy to watch.  We go with Alice as she finds her greatest asset, her mind and memory, being stripped away from her.  We see the difficulties her husband and children face as the woman they knew and loved becomes more and more confused and lost.  I’m glad I saw this movie, but I doubt I could see it a second time—it’s just too real and too hard to watch—but it definitely made me much more aware of the pain and suffering of people who are going through what Alice in the movie was going through, and what their friends, family, and caregivers have to deal with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7Q9DELN9TWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSO6KU#wasThisHelpful","R3E7Q9DELN9TWR","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wasn't my absolute favorite of the seasons of Downton Abbey, but I'm still enjoying the ride.  A wonderful cast, great writing, interesting plots...it still has it all, even though this season didn't have as many of the highs and lows and great drama of some of the past seasons.  But I still love the characters, both upstairs and down, and will definitely be waiting now for the next season.Some Spoilers:  This season finds Mary still playing the field (and looking incredible in her new hair cut), Edith still dealing with the issues of her ""secret"" and her choices, Robert finding out that not only has he been taking Cora for granted, but that others definitely might not, and even the Dowager has some interesting details of her past come up, specifically a Russian Prince.  The Branson plot line seemed to be kind of blah, as its clear they are wrapping up his involvement in the show, Rose has met the young man of her life (and, again, shows that she doesn't give a fig about picking someone that society might frown upon), and the show ends with bang with a hunting party on the moor and, of course, our dear Christmas.I so love seeing the episodes with Christmas at Downton.Of course, the poor Bates family is still embroiled in issues from the last season and there are some twists there, most of which are not surprising, but I guess we'll have to wait until the next season to see them resolved.Cool note--having Mary use Thomas' nature to get back at someone who clearly needed it, hurrah!  Also, the developing relationships between our brusque butler and the head housekeeper and the caring between the head cook and sweet little Daisy.  Honestly, though, I was glad to see the back of Tom's sort of love interest, the local schoolteacher.Lovely scenery and clothes to die for!  Plus characters to fall in love with (or despise) and I honestly can say I laughed and cried, especially at the touching scene with Robert and Cora and Isis.  Hurray for Downton!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXN7L6YKQBQB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO21WUE#wasThisHelpful","RXN7L6YKQBQB2","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had trouble reading this book and finally ended up just skimming the last quarter of it.  Partially, it was because it simply didn't hold my interest and, partially, because the author ended up getting on my nerves with how he was telling his story.  This needed editing badly to make the timeline cohesive as the author kept skipping around.  In one chapter, he talks about breaking up with his girlfriend and in the next chapter, they are still together, so his timeline kept jumping around and it felt very jumbled.  Also, there wasn't much description of place in the story so you had a hard time picturing where they were, which I assume is because the author needs more practice or could have benefited from some writing classes before finishing this book.  One of the basics of good writing is ""show, don't tell,"" and this book was pretty much just telling.Whether you believe in evil or nasty spirits or not, this book left something to be desired, as the author's actions made little sense.  He relates how he as a child and his grandmother were accosted by some kind of evil spirit (they called it the Devil, but that's doubtful) in their home...but then he goes on to join up with some paranormal investigation group and go around poking at spirits in haunted inns and homes and graveyards.  Does this seem reasonable?  Not really...  The author is only in his early 20's during all of this, but suddenly decides he is being given signs from God that he is called to be some kind of ""demon-fighter"" and begins going around to people's  homes to bless them and drive out bad spirits.  Definitely, hints of an ego trip, especially since he had absolutely no training or mentoring in any of this.  Honstly, this is NOT the work for someone with no training or experience to undertake and this book makes it seem like you can have a feeling this is for you to do and you can just go and do it.  Of course, there are nasty consequences at times, but that's hardly surprising.The author is honest about his and his mother's drinking issues and his suicide attempts, but he attaches this to demonic activity...such as it was demons making him take sleeping pills and drink booze in order to die when he and his girlfriend break up.  He sends her a picture of the pills and the booze in order to get a reaction, but when there is no response, he tries to kill himself.  Please, this is a sign he needed counseling, not an exorcism.  Then, when he wakes  up in the hospital, and they want to send him to get professional mental help, one of his relatives says he didn't really mean it, so they just drop it.  This is highly unprofessional and also made no sense.The other strange story was when he and his paranormal crew went to this supposedly highly haunted cemetery and a car follows them in and they immediately think they are about to be murdered by Satanists and the author gets ready to rumble with them.  Only, it turns out the car is actually full of girls who also want to check out haunted stuff...this is just so paranoid and seems more like a bunch of teens and early twenty-something messing around with things and scaring themselves in the process.  It shows the mindset of the author and his friends that the first thing they think of when seeing a car near a haunted cemetary is that it must be full of Satanists out to kill people.  Really?  It couldn't just be the local cops out to keep teens and twenty-somethings from messing around in the cemetary and knocking over tombstones?  Or a bereaved relative?Of course, there is the proverbial we got a Ouija Board and something got into our house because of it...this urban legend has been around for years now, as much as the author insisting that even reading a book about demons and evil spirits will end up with one attaching itself to you.  (I guess no one should read this book then, either, or have the same happen to you...if you believe that sort of thing.)I can't recommend this book.  It really has no historical or folkloric value regarding the belief in demons or spirits, it misleads people into thinking they can mess around with bad spirits and ghosts with no experience or training in the matter, and it just wasn't even that interesting.  It read more like the kind of disjointed far-out stories that get told around the campfire to spook people.  The author implied this would be the first book in a series--I hope he gets in some writing classes before undertaking another book.  I would have enjoyed a good book about paranormal investigators, but this just wasn't it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6C94VV49FTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738736805#wasThisHelpful","R1W6C94VV49FTN","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Cherryholmes CD ""Black and White"" to pieces, so I thought I would order this one, as well.  Sadly, I ended up disappointed overall with the CD as it contains so many more quiet reflective ballad style pieces, some of them along a rather religious note.  The playing is still good and the voices and the lyrics have the general quality of the group, but it just seemed...well, more blah.  Pretty, but blah.I much more preferred the rousing harder-hitting tunes in the other CD.  I guess to each their own, but I can't recommend listening to this CD as a starting point to getting into this band.  I hope they go back to their older style in the next CD.  I'm not so turned off by this one not to buy another of their CD's, but when reaching for one of their CD's to listen to while on the road...""Black and White"" just jumps into my hand, but ""Don't Believe"" remains behind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3XQ7ZJ94VCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EC6JZI#wasThisHelpful","R2U3XQ7ZJ94VCD","AG8K92N37MT27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG8K92N37MT27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've really tried to appreciate the new chief detective Barnaby, but as the episodes go on the new guy just doesn't have the same interest as the old Tom Barnaby.  This set of stories were hit and miss, as the chess episode left me feeling flat, but the one centered around Midsomer's wonderful stinky cheese hit some of the old off the wall stride as the series is known for.  I expect Midsomer to have that hint of madness, of spookiness, and of not being able to figure out who the bad guy (or girl) is until near the very end.  I still love Ben Jones, but he can't hold this show all by his lonesome and the family of Tom and Joyce and Cully...well, I miss them more and more.

"I have recently learned to love headlamps. They are so useful in so many situations. My husband and son both have one and we use them all the time. It's an amazing way to have a lot of light but still keep my hands free. The Wolverine Headlamp is very comfortable to wear and easily adjustable. I can quickly go from my head to my son's with a slight adjustment. The straps are soft and don't dig into my head even after a long time of use. It's extremely lightweight so It can be worn for long periods of time without getting heavy or giving me a headache.The light is very bright and projects pretty far in the direction I'm looking. With three modes I can always find a light that  is appropriate for any situation. The flashing light is great for distress calls so this would be great for hunters to have. This one takes batteries where most I've seen are rechargeable. That could be useful when no electricity is available. But that also means you need to carry batteries around.The price is GREAT this would make a great gift for young boys just starting to explore.i received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3B0DFA67X80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R3S3B0DFA67X80","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always have tension in my neck and shoulders so when I saw these I was very excited to try them.  When I pulled them out my husband tried to squeeze them because he thought they were stress balls. So that is the best way to describe them only much harder so you can't squeeze them.The Therapy Balls are a nice size and I can comfortably hold only one in my hand.I used them on my husbands back and he immediately started to relax. He then took off his shirt and bent down so I could get the lower back as well. They really do feel amazing and are super easy to use. Just roll across the knotty part of the body and the motion starts to work out the knots.I toss them on the floor and rub your feet on them to give myself a foot massage.  That works great as well they are smooth and roll easily under my arch, heel, and ball so all I do is move.

"This pan was larger than I thought it would be which is always a nice surprise. The sides are very short to make it easier to flip the food.

The sides are high enough to keep the food from leaking everywhere so there is no need to worry.The pan is really lightweight which is AWESOME. I hate when my pans are heavy and clunky unless they are cast iron, then I get it. The heat does not transfer to the handle so it's not hot when I grab it.

"I have the most beautiful Aromatherapy necklace from ECOTT and I was very happy to see that refill pads were available. First of all that means I am no limited to the amount of fragrance I can use. Especially with 40 extra! But each color changes the look of the necklace slightly so now I have different colors to go with different outfits.These pads are small but thick enough to be a perfect fit for my necklace. They hold the scent for a long time and can be reused with the same fragrance. Or washed up to 6 times and used with different fragrances. So that's a LOT of use.I would highly recommend giving this/buying this set with the aromatherapy necklace.

"This blue is my new favorite color stone. I love the ocean every time I am reminded of looking deep into an ocean. The blue is stunning  and the shine is spectacular. This piece could easily worn by a bridesmaid or even a bride, since every bride needs something blue. But it's still good for everyday wear as well. The hearts are each a perfect shape they appear to vary in size from biggest int the middle to smallest at the end. I love that it's a bangle but it's ruined with a chain that needs to be fastened. The good part about the chain is the clasp is a lobster claw so it's not quiet as difficult to fasten by myself. I also feel more secure with a lobster claw because are not as easily opened as other type clasps. Keep in mind the bracelet does not give a lot so bigger wrist may have a hard time wear it.It seems well made and like it will last for a very long time.

"If you think this is pretty in pictures wait until you see it in person. It's an absolutely breath taking piece of jewelry. The stone is a great size to be an eye catcher and the silver snake/swirl like design really brings it out and makes it prettier. The chain is not a link design but more like a filigree instead. The pendant hangs from a beautiful silver clasps with the look of rhinestones on it.It's very lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The pendant is quite large but not gaudy or tacky looking. The color is stunning and an amazing shade of blue. The sparkle is quite stunning on both the pendant and the chain. The one complaint I have is the chain is not adjustable.

"I was a little afraid of this heated eyelash curler but overall I as intrigued. It was very unique and I  couldn't wait to review it. When I got it in I was very shocked (even with the pics) to see that is is charged by USB port. This is not what I would have expected from a beauty product. But I plugged it into my computer anyway.There's a red light that indicates it still need to charge that goes off when it's done. It was ready and fully charged in no time. The on/off button is a push button that works little pressure. It heats up in a few seconds and its ready to use. Now I'm pretty spastic so I was scared to put something really hot by my eyes. But I touched it and it's no a burning heat. It's the same heat you would achieve if you put your curler by the flat iron for a few.It's warm but not uncomfortable on my eyelashes so it's not one of those it's painful to beautiful products.I used it just like a mascara wand from base to tip motion but at a slower pace. I did it a couple of times and my lashes were slightly curled. BUT I have lashes that are straight. I kid you not they stick almost straight out. I'm not lucky enough to have long, lushes lashes with a natural curl. I would absolutely recommend this product. It's just one smaller way I can avoid the need to wear falsies.

"When I first saw this I new they were interesting and will save me a ton of headaches in the future. As if on queue to remind me I needed them, I dropped my phone in between my seat and console.  And fight began, of course my hand is way too big to fit in there. It was too far back so moving the seat did not help at all. After a lot of fussing and cursing I eventually got my phone.That evening I took out my Smart Catch Caddy and was in the car installing them. I say installing it really is more like putting them in place. And that is super easy to do.  They are way different than I expected. They are both just little squishy oblong caddies. The material gives a lot which made it much easier to put in between the seat and console where it belongs.On the passenger side it is squished together more than the driver's side. So I think the position of the seats will have something to do with the way it fits. What I really like is It's not only practical to catch falling things, it can be used a storage. I tossed the napkins we keep in the car and a few other things in ours.

"I have tons of makeup brushes. I think I use 5 sets but each one has something different that I really enjoy using. Perfect example, this set is very nice and concentrates more on face makeup than the eyeshadow but there are a few shadow brushes included. If you do not have a Kabuki Brush you are missing out. That is the brush that smooths the makeup after you're done blending. It's sort of a finishing touch and even though this is a mini Kabuki brush it still works great. Just blend with sponge (ooh added bonus one is included) then go over with the Kabuki.The shape of the foundation brush is great too because it gets in the creased under the eyes and around the nose with no problems. And with this type of foundation brush it doesn't' take a lot of foundation to create perfect coverage.The Powder brush is perfect for loose or pressed powder and it a great size. It's pretty fluffy and covers a great size area on my face. With loose powder be careful because the brush makes it easy to pick up way too much.Set comes in a small draw string bag for storage.  The string doubles for a handle so it's easy to carry with you. Overall great set with lots of very nice brushes. The price is unbeatable. I would by this for my daughter if she was old enough or give this to a friend/family member as a gift.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSU7GW5R3T9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XI6NZO#wasThisHelpful","R2TSU7GW5R3T9U","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew this would be a beautiful bracelet when I saw it. The style is right on point with with I like to wear that I knew it would be amazing to add to my collection.  When I got it in I was not disappointed. The bracelet has beautiful silver shine and is very well made. It has a little give to help it slide on my wrist but is very sturdy. It will not bend with normal wear and tear or if it gets hit on a desk or two.The mesh inside is slightly twisted to give the bracelet dimension.  The bracelet fits beautifully on my wrist and can be worn with any outfit from casual to dressy.  I LOVE that the material doesn't tarnish but it looks identical to silver. I have many nice pieces of jewelry that tarnished even after I took precautions.This would make an amazing gift ( I know I would be happy to get one) and it comes in a pretty red box that can be gift wrapped or a toss a bow on top and it's ready.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEN2SDNLL23E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017OBZTZI#wasThisHelpful","R3HEN2SDNLL23E","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dress is SO beautiful. It's old world meet new style. There is a zipper closure on the back which opens pretty far down. There is also a small part of stretchy material on the back so I thought for sure the XL would fit me. The material is great it's not too thin but still cool to wear which is always a plus.The band is built in which I LOVE because it is not a sash or ribbon to keep track of. The front is scalloped and has a small dip in the front but it's not low cut. The straps tie in the back and they are thick and long so that gives a ton of leeway in how the front fits.  I am a DD cup and I had a VERY hard time getting this dress over my breast. I had to tug and pull so it was a little uncomfortable to put on. But once done the dresses usually fit beautifully. But with this one I had a very hard time getting the dress zipped. It was not a one man job!  I think that has a lot to do with being a side zipper instead of in the back. I have other dresses from this company and have never had any problems. I would suggest trying one size up just to avoid the hassle.  The polka dots are small and very cute. The blue is amazing. I'm not a huge blue fan but this one immediately caught my eyes.This dress is great for any occasion whether it's a night out or a day in church or work. Throw a shawl over it and it would be great for fall.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D30YE8T7YYRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CDX8JE#wasThisHelpful","R1D30YE8T7YYRM","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a lot of of other LED lights but this one really impressed me. It moves 360 ° so there is no position that is off limits. To make things better It moves smoothly and effortlessly. There is an on off switch so you are in control.  It runs off of AA batteries (which are not included) so you may want to preserve the batteries on days when you feel it's not needed.It is very bright and covers a decent amount of area but only in an close circle.  This a great light to use in a shed or barn that does not have electricity. It would detour thieves and if not it would make you aware when the are around. The motion detection is quite sensitive so it won't miss anything. It's very easy to install with no tools required.Only complaint I have is it's not weather proof so I have to find  a spot where it will not be exposed to rain.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115KDNOC28JF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWTR0K6#wasThisHelpful","R115KDNOC28JF9","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so surprised how amazing this bracelet is for the price. Each separate charm is beautiful in it's own way. The white gold charms shine bright and demand attention. The clasp is so adorable with the heart at the bottom. The charms are uniform on both sides but there is enough contrast for the bracelet to really pop. Very well made and the clasp is very secure and it's easy to put on without help.  The charms are free moving but there is not a lot of room on either side of the bracelet so they they don't move too much.Over all adorable for all ages.

"This scarf is amazing. The color is beautiful and will go with a lot of my outfits. The material is very soft and not irritating or scratchy to wear. I love the infinity look but I hate having to pull it on and off over my head. Now don't let the picture fool you it is a lot longer than it looks. It's also very lightweight and comfortable to wear.

"Most people (including myself) never look for fiber until they are having problems. But I find it next to impossible to get enough fiber in my food and when I do it seems to upset my stomach. So we purchased some powder fiber and I hardly ever took it unless I felt it was a NECESSITY. It wasn't hard and didn't taste horrible but just a hassle. So when I was given the chance to review these I was very excited.To start I love that all I have to do is pop two gummies in my mouth every day. I don't' have to pour and mix powder. The gummies taste great and they are easy to chew. The gummies are thick so I find it takes a little while to chew them but they are still not hard to chew.I can't believe how much better I feel taking these everyday. I don't feel like I'm hungry all the time like I used to. My husband made the comment that eating fiber everyday would have me on the toilet 24/7 and I was a little worried. But I'm pretty sure that's a misconception.

"Trash  bags are one thing I can never stock up enough on. We use at least 5 trash bags a day with the small garbage cans and the kitchen one filling up once if not twice a day. We are a family of 8 with numerous animals so it's only fitting that we create a lot trash. I have tried many brands/off brands trying to save a buck here and there. Some, not all, but some of the off brands are so thin that we use double the amount because they can't be stuffed or the might rip.These bags are very tough I tried to stick my finger though the material and could not. Now a few complaints are there are no twist ties proved, nor do they have tie handles. So the bag cannot be completely full to leave space for the top to tie. Then the size is odd my cans are 4 or 13 gallons but these make great outside bags. I love the colors just a small tweek on a necessarily item.

"I have a purse obsession so I can never have too many. When I saw this one I couldn't' wait to get it in. I was a little iffy about the front material when I ordered it.  But once I took the purse out of the box it's awesome. The front is a little more cushiony than the back and it's a very cute design. The entire purse is a smooth soft leather. It's well made and the seems are very nicely sown.  The handles are metal at the ends so they are reinforced and won't rip with normal wear and tear. The gold metal also make the purse pop a little more. It's a snap open front that opens and closes easily.The inside is lined with a beautiful soft material and there are three separate pockets, one zips closed. All zippers open and close smoothly without getting snagged. It's a very roomy purse and will fit everything I carry with ease. The handles are not as long as I would like but they are long enough to carry the purse comfortably. Oh and I should mention the color is BEAUTIFUL. It's not a bright red but a winter  a deeper red that is perfect for fall or winter. I LOVE this purse and it looks like it will be around for a long time.

"I would have never known that something like this was needed but man it makes a lot of sense with the left that happens. This is a simple easy way to protect your laptop.

It's four feet so it has some wiggle for you to be able to lock it in place but still move it where it's comfortable for you.It's a combination lock that moves smoothly without getting hung up.

"My husband loved these shorts. He was so excited when he saw all the pockets. I count 8 functional pockets. The 4 cargo pockets are snap close so what you are carrying in them will not fall out. The snaps open and close with ease.  The material is really nice and thick so it will withstand lots of use. There is a cotton belt included with the shorts. They are a good quality and sown nicely. The hems are reinforced. The only thing is the main button looks fragile. It may not withstand a lot of wear.The shorts are visually appealing and comfortable with a good fit.

"This keyboard and mouse set is so adorable. It's much more fun than traditional, boring black keyboards. I was very surprised at how well made this keyboard is. I thought it was more of a novelty than a functional keyboard but I was very wrong. The keys are a silicone material but are very smooth and easy to use. I love that it's wireless because my wires get caught in the sliding shelf.  The keyboard is compact but still the buttons are comfortable to use. I can use the home keys and not peck like I have to do with laptop keyboards.  This one is actually longer than the keyboard I'm using on my computer. (my husband said I can't have the pink one until I get my own computer)  The one thing  I'm not fond of is the keyboard and mouse are run by batteries. Although batteries are included, I would rather if they were rechargeable.The mouse is very nice. Rolls smoothly and feels comfortable in my hand. It's sleek and very cute with the pink accents.

"I was very happy to try this when there was a sample available. I have a problem with my forehead getting shiny mid-day so I was hoping this could help. The first time I used it the color threw me off because it is a silverish color, my camera could not capture it enough for me to show you.  I put a small amount on my finger and started to lather it. The smell is very light but very pleasant and it lathers wonderfully. After creating a great lather I lightly scrubbed then rinsed my face. The first night I noticed that my face didn't feel dried out like it did sometimes after I washed my face with my previous facial soap. After using for a few days I grew to love the Shine, Shine go away, my face has never felt fresher, or cleaner. I follow it with my moisturizer and my face feels amazingly soft and smooth.

"When I opened the Kiss lashes I saw a difference immediately, they were not super thick and coarse nor did they have that super noticeable band at the top like some lashes I have tried in the past. These lashes are also curled more than others which better matches the natural shape of your lashes. Which in turn makes them look and feel more natural.Vamp was perfect for me just enough to give a my lashes a little oomph without going overboard. If I set them perfectly it is reasonable to believe nobody would know they are fake.The glue is included so all you need to do is measure, cut the excess (I didn't need to cut one of them), apply glue and put into place. Despite being a skeptic I am very pleased with these lashes and I will wear them again on special occasions.They are very easy to apply with a few tips I learned from as Kiss Video. 1) let the glue dry for a few seconds before applying. That way it will get tacky and stick better. I remember placing lashes having them slide because the glue was still wet.2) try to shape the lashes first by running them back and forth like a slinky. That will loosen them and make them conform to the eye better.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6M24X1KJCS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQN7W96#wasThisHelpful","R2W6M24X1KJCS5","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never had the need for press on nails. I have always thought they were super cute but my nails are long and normally they don't fit.When I noticed on the pack it said medium and was hopeful so I opened the package and started measuring. As you can see they are pretty long. To my surprise I found nails to fit all of my fingers. They also come in different sizes if these are too long for your taste. I was very happy because I love French manicures. As much as I love wild and crazy colors/mani there is something classy and eloquent about a French manicure. It's perfect for weddings, job interviews, you name it you can wear a French mani with confidence.The Kiss Everlasting nails are VERY easy to use. There really is no guess work clean your nails, apply glue to the nail that fits that finger, and stick. That's easier than painting any day. Then once applied all of your nails are the same length and shape. That NEVER happens naturally for me. I try but like everyone my nails break and grow at different times.No need to wait for your nails to dry. I don't have time to go to the salon and sit under the lamps. The only time I went to nail shop for a French Mani I left and obviously my nails were not completely dry so they chipped on the way home. I was NOT happy about that. Kiss says these will not chip, crack, or wear away for 7 days of normal wear. I don't know what they call normal wear around my house there is lots of dishes and chores.These look very natural and are very comfortable to wear. It didn't feel like I was wearing fake nails at all. The didn't rub or get caught on anything. My husband who looked at them before I put them on and said ""eww fake nails, those look horrible."" Then after I put them on he said ""Oh those look nice, they don't look fake at all""So how did they hold up? Sorry to report they only lasted a few hours. I lost one doing one of my chores so I took the rest off. The other may have held up but one of my animals was chewing on the one I lost so I figured I should be safe and remove them all. They are very easy to remove, just cut a small section and they pop right off. DO NOT try to pull them off without cutting them. This will cause unnecessary pain.there are some perks to them. they are much less expensive than getting your nails done and they look salon professional.  Not to mention the time saved.

"Having the right tools always makes a job so much easier. I know this and yet I was cutting my dogs' hair with our scissors. So when i was able to review this set I was very excited.. The set has one straight pair, one thinning pair, and one curved pair so there is a pair for every job.I have two Shih Tzus and they have TONS of hair, I mean tons . Neither of them want to be PrimaDonnas with clean long beautiful flowing hair. They would rather be nasty and roll in what ever stinky spot they can find. That is NOT what I wanted in a dog that is why I have ShihTzus I'm thinking how cute the little mops would be running around. But you take what you get and work with it so my babies fur stays very short.We were using a groomer but that can get very costly so I decided give it a try myself. Like I mentioned I was using our scissors and there is something terrifying about going at a dog's eye with a sharp pair of scissors.My dogs never kept still and when I was nervous they felt it and became uncomfortable too. Then the job got stressful and we both were aggravated for nothing because I can't finish.With these I was very surprised how comfortable I felt cutting my dog's face. I used the curved pair. It was so easy to go around his eyes and cut those stubborn hairs that usually irritate him. He flinched a couple of times but he let me keep cutting. Even my blind dog didn't mind me cutting his  eyelashes. I was done in no time. Then I used the thinning scissors for his beard and head. Those are so easy to use and they are blunt so I wasn't afraid of them either. Then the regular cutting pair doesn't have an extremely long sharp tip so those aren't any danger either.The handles are easy to grip and the finger holes are very comfortable to hold. They also change positions easily and comfortably.The price of these is steal too. That's less than half of what I pay every 6 weeks to have my dogs trimmed. I would recommend these for anyone that grooms a dog or wants to try grooming their dog.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMBLDP8G7L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4CGVU8#wasThisHelpful","R3RMBLDP8G7L4","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it's always a good idea to carry a first aid kit.  I'll admit I'm pretty clumsy and cut myself often. But with 6 children somebody is always have one booboo or another. They are always pointing to minuet cuts are scraps and hoping for a bandaid. But on occasion they really do need one.This kit goes way beyond bandaids, it has lots of things you need in the event of an emergency. Some you probably would have never thought to buy yourself.It's all packed neatly into zipped bag with two separate Velcro closed pouches. The bag is a great waterproof material that is very easy to clean so it can go any where with us. We are going to bring it along in the boat for our fishing trips. Since the bag is pretty compact it will slide right under the boat's steering wheel.  It would also comfortably slide under the car seat if you choose to put it there. It has  two handles on top to make it easy to carry. The zippers are easy to open and close without getting snagged.  All of the emergency supplies are individually wrapped so they will stay good longer.Overall great first aid kit at a great price. You can always refill what is empty without having to purchase another kit too.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I7IZ342BAGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EBQQUY#wasThisHelpful","R12I7IZ342BAGQ","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has to be the most adorable toy I've ever seen. I've been looking for a vanity to get my girls because I have one and they are always try to ""play"" on mine. Of course mine is filled with real makeup that makes real messes so I try to keep them away as much as possible.I was happy to see this vanity did not require a ton of assembly and it was very easy to put together.The set comes with everything my girls needed to get started and playing like the princess they think they are. Okay so i made them little princesses but I don't mind. I still play with makeup and hair styling products.As you can see this vanity is pinked out. There are so many various shades pink that it works without being too much pink.The little hair dryer actually sounds like it's working. The vanity mirror lights up which is super cute. I love the little stool it's the perfect height for this vanity.  There is an entire set of makeup and jewelry to get dressed with and it all stores neatly in the little drawer in front of the vanity.Overall I love this, if I had something like this when I was a child I don't think I would have left the bench.  this would make an amazing present for  any little princess in your life.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5FORELHTLYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012P9PTEA#wasThisHelpful","R1H5FORELHTLYL","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am terrible about not drinking enough water it was so bad at one time i Water is  boring to me. So I tried other water enhancers and some taste great but had a lot of sugar or calories.So I decided to give  Dasani Flavor Enhancer Drop in pink lemonade. I have tried other pink lemonade and they were so sour or fake.  This one is not sour and has a great flavor. I don't know how they pack so much flavor in two little squirts. The best part is they have 0 calories, 0 fat, and 0 sugars. Now I can drink all the pink lemonade I want and not have the calories or sugars to worry about.

"I really hate to wash my hair sometimes. I'm not sure why it's not like it takes that long or is even hard to do.  But truthfully some nights I'm just too lazy to wash my hairI'm sure you can figure I never have a good hair day if I don't wash my hair the night before. It never looks fresh it's oily and lays flat.  Even knowing that I don't wash my hair every night so a few days a week are always ponytail, bun, or clip days. I have tried baby powered and the rest of the antidotes with no success. With baby powder I had white oily hair. That was very unattractive and  embarrassing so I only did that once.When I got to try Not Your Mother's Clean Freak I was so excited. I never tried a dry shampoo before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It didn't take long before I needed it so I grabbed the can. It's so easy to use, I just sprayed it all over my roots and brushed my hair. This is not a powder and it doesn't turn into powder so there is no mess! The smell does remind me of baby powder so it is pleasant.Then my hair went from greasy to looking freshly washed in a few minutes.  I didn't need a ponytail or bun even after one day of not washing my hair. There was no residue and my hair didn't feel sticky. It is very lightweight after I used it my hair still had bounce and a little extra volume.

"I haven't been this excited about a new beauty product in a long time. This is the product I've been wanting forever. Its really NOT a self tanner,  It is more of a leg make up.. I hate my legs. No matter how tan I get i can't get rid of my scars and odd coloring. So when I was younger I would wear stockings under shorts.  That worked my legs looked flawless but they also looked like well, I was wearing stockings. And in 100 degree weather nobody LIKES to wear stockings. This stuff is great! I got the light and it blends in perfectly with my leg color. My legs are not the whitest of the white but they're not Hawaiian tropic material either.  But I you want to look like you have a tan grab a darker shade, I'm thinking about doing that next time I buy a refill.It's very similar to foundation but it's a thick consistency and waterproof. YES -- I can wear it to the beach, a pool party and nobody will know my legs aren't amazing on their own. Sorry, off track, it goes on extremely smooth but I recommend taking the same precautions that are for self tanner. I use a glove and a tanning mitt worked great.Make sure to blend well so there are no streaks and viola' you have flawless legs. Truly my legs look amazing and it lasts all day long.  So I use this EVERY time I'm going somewhere. It covers my minor scares and camouflages some of the worse ones.I'm definitely trying the one for the face because that may save me from having to photo shop pictures!I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all mine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8TBQKLKRR3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R2IGEC#wasThisHelpful","R1B8TBQKLKRR3E","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always use lip balm so I keep one in my purse, desk, and nights stand because I HATE when my lips feel dry or cracked.  So, as you can imagine I have tried a lot of lip balms, Carmex works but is super sticky after a little while and I have to wipe it off. I can't stand that sticky goop on my mouth. It is red in color but it's not a lot of color just a pretty tint that leaves a nice shine on your lips. I love that is smells a little like candy and it goes on smooth and it doesn't leave that nasty sticky residue. Although a color to my lip balm was never a necessity it's a nice touch.Plus it's cute, isn't it?With key ingredients such as Trio of Shea Butter, Jojoba and Avocado Oil my lips felt smoother and softer the first time I used it. I use my Applelicious lip balm all day even though it's tinted I still find myself putting it on before I go to bed.

"I was very excited to try these because mid-day my forehead starts to shine almost as bright as a light bulb. I apply powder but it never makes it go away. I can't stand that oily look so this was something that I thought would be very useful and I couldn't wait to try them.﻿The towelette is nice size, it also is pretty thick and with it being individually wrapped it stays very moist. Witch Hazel can be used in so many different ways I wasn't sure how to work the towelettes into my skin care regimen.  I started using them in the afternoon after my toner and on lazy days I used them as a make-up remover wipe.  Then I followed with my regular moisturizer and eye cream.  I have seen where others replaced their toner with these wipes. I'm sure there is no wrong way to use them, whatever fits your lifestyle best. They are great to bring with you to the beach, gym, or on your morning run to refresh your face.When I first open the wipes the smell was not my favorite but after a few uses I started to get used to it.  I love the way it makes my face feel cool after using it reminds me of an old toner I used when I was a teenager. After a few uses I saw the bags and dark circles under my eyes starting to go away and my face did not shine like a light bulb mid-day.These towelettes make my face feel cool and refreshed, they have lessened the appearance of the bags and dark circles under my eyes, they have stopped the mid-day light bulb on my forehead, and they are very portable. The only con is the smell but I got over that quickly.  Plus Pintrest has tons of great uses for witch hazel, it's good for sunburn, diaper rashes, and insect bites.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2GH4612QCIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MB8KNC#wasThisHelpful","R3F2GH4612QCIS","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I pulled this out I thought WOW that's a grill brush. It's really big and has an extremely long handle.  Which I figure is great. One the bigger the brush, the larger area it will cover. Two the longer the handle the easier it will be to get to the back of the grill without getting burned or dirty.  There is three rows of very sturdy, heavy duty wire brushes that leave no particles behind. The grill can be cleaned quickly and almost effortlessly. This brush takes very little elbow grease to work because it's so sturdy. There is no bending or giving with the brush or bristles.These bristles look like they will last a long time too. They are not the flimsy ones that will start shedding and raveling after a few uses. There is a plastic storage bag included for the head so the bristles don't scratch anything. Plus there is a cloth bag to store the entire brush. As an added bonus it comes with a basting brush that can stand up to the heat of the grill.

We have also done a good bit of ""research"" one the subject. So when I was able to review this rope I figured why not.  I will say when I first saw the pictures of this rope I thought, nobody is bonding me with that harsh scratchy rope. But it's not harsh at all, it very soft despite it's looks. There is plenty of rope in the package so I will have more than enough. The rope is very tightly woven and has silver caps to prevent raveling at the ends.

"Vicks made this thermometer for moms like me. I have six children and if they are all sick I have a very hard time keeping track of everybody's temp. I can write it down but those little papers fly away and get lost somewhere in oblivion. Now there's an app for that. AT first that statement was a huge joke but I don't know what I would do without some apps.This thermometer is small and easy to use. Tip is smooth and comfortable under the tongue (yes i used it myself) It's easy to turn on with the push of a button and there is a green light that comes on when it's powered up.  It only takes seconds for the temperature to read. Which anybody who has fought with a child to keep their mouth shut for a temperature reading knows that is a huge PLUS.One complaint is it cannot be used without the app as there is no temperature reading on the thermometer itself. I know it would be hard to keep track without the app but sometimes I may need a quick temp reading even if I dont' have my phone.; Vicks should have an option to use it without the app and this would be the best thermometer ever.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLHGW4WMGFQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410Z22U#wasThisHelpful","RPLHGW4WMGFQ9","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tired plenty of Waist trimmers so I know they are not all the same. But I wasn't expecting such a big difference from this one. To start when I opened the package the top material is super soft. The inside is the same as majority of the waist trimmers on the market.  Another thing that is different is it's thin, and not bulky. It was folded so compactly and neatly in the package. Which made me think how neatly it will fold in my gym bag and not take up too much room.It's really wide which I like because it covers majority of my lower stomach and upper abs. That way i don't have to choose which one I want to train that day. They both need trimming so I usually alternate with the smaller waist trainers.It's very easy to wear and has enough stretch to fit a variety of sizes but still hold in my stomach where I feel a difference. It stretches easily too. It's very comfortable to wear and although I feel the support I do not feel like my stomach is being squeezed.  I wore the belt for hours with no discomfort.When I took it off it was full of sweat. And that was just around my house. Imagine when I go to the gym how much more I will sweat. It wasn't dripping sweat which is a huge plus. I have a waist trainer that drips and that's embarrassing.  It also dries very quickly. The underside is easy to clean with a wipe or wet towel.I can say without a doubt waist trainers work and this is one of the best I have used. If you are in the market for one, this is your best bet.

"We have two dogs that we bring with us everywhere. Partially because we don't ant to bother anybody but then again why not? So we still take them camping all the time. These bowls are perfect for us to take with us anytime we travel.  As flat as the bowls arrived I was not expecting them to open so nicely and actually stand up on their own but they did. They  made a prefect bowl.The material is great for all terrain it can be put in the mud and wiped with a warm towel.  Once up they don't collapse into themselves unless you fold them.  They are clearly marked food and water. Why is that important? Well I have a bad habit of not being able to tell the difference when the bowls are empty and so does my son. That makes for soggy food if there is just a slight bit of water residue at the bottom that we missed. My dogs won't eat it soggy so that's wasted food.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VY0V1H3FK6W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F51XBO#wasThisHelpful","R2VY0V1H3FK6W7","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to review this product. I saw a chiropractor for a few months and I remember a very similar machine vividly It was on of the things I looked forward to at my visit. I mean nobody likes all that pulling and cracking after a while it just gets uncomfortable. But not this machine, Sure it took a while to get used to but after that, it was amazing. So needless to say I had HIGH hopes for this little sucker.The day I got it ripped open the package and got ready to use it. I was thinking it would be technical and difficult to put together but it was very simple. If you can plug in earphones, you can use this machine.  There is literally 2 steps before using, ""snap"" the sticky pad to the wire, plug the wire into the unit. That simple, I promise.The unit is very compact so there's no bulky machine to store. The buttons are clearly marked and self explanatory so the unit is very easy to control.The pad that go to the skin are sticky but gel like but they don't leave nasty residue.  You stick the pads on you trouble area.  you can use up to four pads at a time but I only used two for my first try.  Besides they cover a decent amount of area so that was all I needed on my shoulder.  I'll admit I was a little nervous because I remember if they went too high at the chiropractor it was slightly uncomfortable. But this one starts off very soft and YOU work up to the number that is most comfortable.  The minute you think it's too much, click the down arrow and it's back to a comfortable number. I was so happy when I saw there is a storage piece included that you stick the pads to when not in use. That means I don't have to worry about the pads getting dirty and full of debris then stop sticking.This unit is JUST like what my chiropractor had. It relieves pain and leaves my muscles relaxed and I feel relaxed after as well. I would recommend this to any one who has occasional muscle pain. It feels amazing and it's much more personal plus cheaper than an office visit.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDC3ZSY5SUX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQIEKHC#wasThisHelpful","R2SDC3ZSY5SUX7","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always like to decorate for the holidays I have a tote or two in the addict for every occasion. These lights however had no specific destination. They can be used for Halloween, Easter, ,Christmas you name it. They have 7 different colors plus you can choose for them to be solid or flicker. That means 14 different looks.I love that these are individual and not strung on a string. They can be put any place at any distance from each other. I am in complete control with nothing limiting me. Another thing I love is the removable clips, that was a genius move.  They can stand free or be clipped to say a garland or rail. That also makes them easy to hang if I want. Controlling them is super easy with the push button, color coded remote.They are a great similarity to a real candle, down to the wax drip but MUCH safer. I would never clip a real candle and burn it in my Christmas tree or wreath, nobody would. That's asking for a fire to start.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCAP4CE588NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01197VXQC#wasThisHelpful","R1OCAP4CE588NS","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I took the projector out of the box it really didn't look too interesting but when I plugged it in that 's when the magic happened.  This projector turned a portion of my boring white ceiling into an ocean floor, that I couldn't stop watching. My husband was out so I picked it up. The next day I couldn't wait to show him and the kiddos what awesomeness I discovered.  They were all very intrigued by the ocean appearance too.There are other color lights besides blue but that one is my favorite. It's so easy to scroll through the light selection with a button on the front of the unit. I found it very relaxing and so did my husband we could watch if for a while but then off to sleep we went.  A way to relax is always something I'm looking for and sleeping pills are not my first choice. This does the trick, calms my mind down and the relaxing slow movements gently put me to sleep.I'm not sure how it would work for my children, they may be tempted to jump up and play since there light. BUT I do think it would be awesome for a cranky baby or small child. The unit has an autoshut off since you will more than likely fall asleep and not remember to turn it off. It plugs into a standard plug or it can be run with batteries. This would be great for a romantic dinner or even at night to just lay in bed talking.i think playing ocean sounds would make this the most relaxing product. It would be amazing at a spa or salon, it would totally change the atmosphere.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZL89RFNLRZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKRU3UI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZL89RFNLRZK","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have Bunions but my in-laws do. They look very painful so I was happy to review something that may help relieve them. These are very unique and made solely of silicone. They have a lot of stretch to them without breaking or tearing. So they can be worn by anybody with any size foot.Being super stretchy and soft means you foot is cushioned from you shoe but the pads cause your shoes to fit any different.

"My husband and son could not wait to use this Liquid Latex. They were so excited when I got it in and started planning their Halloween Costume around it.My husband was very surprised how easy it is to use. It's not an extremely watery consistency so it's very easy to work where it's needed.  It works like a glue and dries in minutes so there is time to work the look but it stills dries fast enough for the costume to be done in no time.I would recommend using Liquid Latex with so many looks. With a little makes up and some tissue, it makes cuts and scraps come alive so they can be as gruesome as ever. The bottle is huge and since it can be used sparingly the bottle will last for a few Halloweens to come.My husband wore it for a few hours and was able to remove it super easy.

"I think a waist back gets a bad rep. They really are perfect for hands free enjoyment of a lot of activities. I think a waist pack is great for working out because it can hold my phone, earbuds, car keys, and what ever else I can shove in there. So I can still have what I need without having to give up my pocket space or comfort. I know that I have a purse but sometimes carrying my purse is a pain in the shoulder. It's true I get tired of carrying it and it gets heavy.This is a  really nice waist pack. It's very well made and the material is amazing. It's super thick so it will hold up to wear and tear, possibly a small amount of abuse. I mean if I'm being honest, I tend to toss things around when I'm in a hurry. In addition to that it's attractive with a denim look. It fits nicely and is completely adjustable to most waist sizes.I like that there are three separate zippered pouches because I can put my medicine in one, money in the other, that way things are not getting pulled out if there is no use for them.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLA39C6FK28F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D5RJ6U#wasThisHelpful","RTLA39C6FK28F","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I'm concerned this product is a must. I never like to put my baby in a buggy (that's what I call shopping carts) without them. I got rid of all of my baby stuff after my 5 year old so I didn't have my shopping cart cover anymore.  I never thought of using it in a highchair but that's an awesome Idea too.My daughter is 8 months old and still very wobbly and not quite sitting on her own so I was very excited to review this product.  This one is different from the one I had before it's much bigger and covers a larger part (almost all) of the buggy. It's easy to put over the buggy and Velcro the legs but the other parts don't Velcro as easy. But It does stay in place for the most part.the material is very soft but still easy to clean with a wipe or wet cloth. Like I said my daughter is not quite sitting up on her own so I do have a few complaints in that department. There is no head rest the cover is flush with the back of the buggy. So my daughter scooted down and laid on the metal hump. Another thing is there is no cushion, I had to make my own. I'm not saying I didn't know that by looking at the pics but I did think it was a little fluffier. The top only slides down over the handle so my daughter decided to move and still chew on the plastic.Overall with a few tweeks this worked amazing. I will get TONS of use out of it because I will be able to use it as my daughter grows. The best part is when not in use, it folds into a small zippered pouch. I  slipped it in my diaper bag. which is where it will stay. Always available when i need ti.I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TK3DPUTJU8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QD3538#wasThisHelpful","R15TK3DPUTJU8R","ARGT7BXP1K7HO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARGT7BXP1K7HO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband's favorite color is blue so I picked the navy for him. When i got this set in and opened the pack I was very surprised at how thick the material is. This is very well insulated and would be great for anybody who works in the weather. Once it's cold and rainy this wind can really cut through you so these can be worn underneath as a barrier to protect from wind/cold. As I mentioned the material is thick but neither the shirt or pants are bulky so they will not be uncomfortable when layered.I can think of so many uses for this set. It's great for a hunter, fisher, or offshore worker. But it could also be pajamas and the shirt could be worn as the only shirt. The pants however I wouldn't' recommend trying to wear them by themselves. The waist is elastic but not draw string so there is only a small amount of stretch. There bottom of the pants and the cuffs are fitted and ribbed.

"it's not often my husband gets excited over the products I review. But when he saw this speaker he was so excited and exclaimed it was his. He also exclaimed his new shed was going to be decked out and this speaker will be part of the decor.  I was very happy he liked it because I wanted the speaker to be displayed where it would be noticed and get a lot of use.This is by far the coolest speaker I have seen. It's space age look is sleek and attractive yet compact enough to display pretty much any where your imagination can come up with.It is rechargeable and comes with the USB cord for when that time comes. So that means no need for wires or to find an outlet. Control buttons prominently displayed on the front. They are also clearly marked so that means they are very easy to use. This is an awesome speaker that will get a lot of use at my house.

"I was so excited to review this keyboard. I can't use my tablet for writing because it takes too long. I don't like to use the so called Keyboard on the table too long. My finger always hit the wrong keys.This keyboard is compact and super lightweight so it's easy to stash in a backpack when you are on the go. The keys are close together but very smooth and work without getting stuck. The number board is actually just touch screen so those work almost effortlessly. This is set up like any standard keyboard so if you rely on home keys, you can use this keyboard with no problems.There are a few things I would change. 1: It takes AA batteries and is not your typical rechargeable bluetooth device. 2: I could not get it to link to any of my blue tooth devices. That was VERY upsetting because I would use this a lot. I may have been doing something wrong but it wouldn't pair or show up as a device on my phone or tablet.Overall I would buy this keyboard because it's compact and lightweight without loosing function.

"With 5 children in school we go through a ton of backpacks around here. I swear my six year old rolls hers around in mud while trying to rip the front off. So I was very excited to review this one. It really is very lightweight and the material is really soft but seems extremely durable. I love that the material is dark, that helps but I really love that the material will be easy to wipe down with a towel. It's not a cloth that will let the dirt stick.The straps look mesh but they are are material underneath so my daughter can't stick her fingers through the holes and rip them.I LOVE that it folds up to a compact zippered bag when not in use. That will come in handy during the summer if the bag makes it through the school year.

Obviously it's not the same but the weights offer a little resistance in cases where there wouldn't be any.I was very excited to review these ankle weights because I like Nordic products and they did not disappoint These are very well made with the weights being soft on the skin.

But that is very easy to do. I drilled mine out slightly larger and was able to get 6 strings run through the hole.Lastly, the color on these is off-white, kind of a light cream color. They were a perfect match for my blinds, but may stand out a little if you're looking for pure white.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D38HLJJR58EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSHUAFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3D38HLJJR58EV","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love cordless tools.  In fact, I got rid of my Toro electric (corded) blower to get this one because I was tired of dealing with the long extension cord.There are some good and bad things about this blower.The PROS are that it's lightweight, easy to carry and use, and it blows AND sucks up leaves/debris.  Plus, no cord to get in the way.However, the biggest CON is that it is not powerful at all.  Yes, you can adjust the power with a dial control, but anything less than full power simply won't be enough for anything you want to blow unless it's a piece of tissue paper on a hard flat surface.  Even at full power this thing leaves a lot to be desired.  For instance, it will blow light dust/leaves from a hard flat surface (i.e. concrete patio).  However, it's not good at blowing leaves from a surface like grass.  It even seriously struggles to blow spider webs from my house and lawn furniture.If I didn't already own the Black and Decker 36v lawn trimmer (which I love by the way) that uses the same battery, I would have already sent this blower back and tried a different brand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3IIWQSHL8K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZW9ZK4#wasThisHelpful","R2D3IIWQSHL8K1","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently bought this to sharpen all of my kitchen knives which had gone dull over the years.  At first, I didn't think it worked too well. But then I went to the Edgeware website and watched their YouTube video on how to use it, and realized that you may have to pull the knife throught the sharpener up to 10 times to get it sharp.  (I was initially only pulling it through a couple times.)After pulling through the knives about 5 times, the knives did indeed get very sharp.  For my knives, I pulled them through the ""course"" side 5-6 times, then through the ""fine"" side about 4 times.  Seemed to work well for me.Another tip I learned by watching Edgeware's YouTube video, was to set the sharpener on the edge of the counter at a 45 degree angle.  (That's apparently what the v-shaped groove is for on the bottom of the sharpener.)  When the sharpener is on the edge, you can pull the knives straight through and down without worrying about hitting the countertop and scratching it or breaking the tip off your knife.Lastly, I'm not sure why some reviewers say that this only works on small knives.  I used it on small knives, as well as all of my larger chef style knives.  The process is exactly the same no matter the size of the knife.  So it should work the same, and indeed it worked just fine on all of my small and large knives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFJVU1JL96N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CQTLJM#wasThisHelpful","RLFJVU1JL96N6","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this refillable cup because I was going through too many K-cups, and those things aren't cheap...especially if you drink a lot of coffee like I do.  As an alternative to K-cups, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  It is super easy to use, you don't have to do or remove anything from your coffee maker in order to use it, and it helps you save a lot of money by allowing you to use grounds over K-cups.HOWEVER, and this is why I didn't rate this product 5 stars, your coffee will be weaker.  I have tried numerous coffee grounds in this thing and they are all noticably weaker.  I like strong, dark coffee.  But when I use this refillable cup, my really dark coffee grounds come out tasking more like medium or even light roast.  My wife likes light roast coffee.  But when we use her light roast grounds the coffee almost can't even be tasted.So there's the trade off -- weaker coffee at a cheaper price.  I'm still using it because it does save me quite a bit of money, but I sure do miss my dark coffee.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2BAJYX1AJEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051SU0OW#wasThisHelpful","R1P2BAJYX1AJEK","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fall I had a big problem with a bunch of leaves and small seeds dropping in my pool.  It was too much for my automatic pool sweep to pick up, and when I tried to get them with a regular pool net I did get some of the leaves.  However, I mostly just stirred them up on the bottom and couldn't get any of the small seeds.Thought I'd give the Leaf Gulper a shot and boy am I happy I did.  It picked up all of the leaves AND the small seeds, which I wasn't expecting due to how small they are (a little bigger than sesame seeds).  So far, I have zero complaints about this product and I highly recommmend it if you have leaves in your pool that you want gone.p.s. I didn't need to add the tennis ball to the net to help the net float, like another reviewer suggested.  Mine was pushed up by the jets and floated just fine.  Speaking of the net, I also like how it is extra large in size.  I was able to vacuum up all the leaves and seeds from my pool in one sweeping without the need to empty the net part way through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D9RZF1BSQ5HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WKO8OK#wasThisHelpful","R1D9RZF1BSQ5HL","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been transcribing audio and video files for over six years now without the use of this foot pedal.  However, a co-worker recommended this pedal to me so I thought I'd give it a shot.  WOW!  What a difference.  It makes transcription SO much easier and faster.  I love the fact that you can set it (through the available software) to back up and/or fast forward at whatever speed you like because it is way more precise than having to drag and drop the status bar on a normal audio or video player and try and get it to the exact spot you need it.So far I am completely amazed with this product and wish I would have bought one years ago.  It has been able to play every type of audio and video file I've tried, and is as simple as just dragging and dropping the file into the software.  Also very easy to hookup and begin using.One word of caution for those not familiar with this pedal - this pedal does not come with any software.  All you get when you order is the pedal itself.  The software is separate.  Not a big deal for me because I had already been told that by the person who recommended it to me.  But just FYI for the rest of you considering this purchase.I've heard you can get a free software trial version called ""Express Scribe Free"", but for some reason my pedal said it wasn't compatible with the free version of this software.  (I never personally tried it. I just took their word for it.)  That wasn't a problem for me because I already knew I wanted the full version of this software (Express Scribe Pro), so I just bought that online and downloaded it right to my computer and immediately got to work.  (I love that software program too if you're looking for a recommendation for software.  It works very well with this pedal.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZ6FASDVL2EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MY6I7G#wasThisHelpful","R1AZ6FASDVL2EW","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only been using this for about a week, but so far so good.  I bought it because I wanted to keep water from being sprayed outside of the pool.  It does work for that.  However, it requires a minor deviation from the manufacturer's instructions (at least in my case).The instructions tell you to turn the water pressure on the pool sweep all the way to the max.  However, when I did that I still got water spraying outside of the pool (though not a great distance).  I then tried turning the pressure down a little bit and no more issues with water outside of the pool.I also have not experienced any clogging issues like some other posters have mentioned.  I'll update this review later if it does start to clog.UPDATE 11/13/12: I've been using this for a couple months now and still no issues with clogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ILG86QAKS3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AKGDUY#wasThisHelpful","R20ILG86QAKS3Y","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just bought this lock and was planning on using it at various rental houses.  My plan was to set the shackle code to a number I could easily remember, and then set the key storage combo to the four numbers from the address of whatever property I had it placed on so this code could also be easily remembered.  However, what I found (and I'm surprised that no one has mentioned this yet), is that you can choose EITHER a custom code for the shackle OR a custom code for the key storage area -- but not BOTH.The reason is that if you pick a custom 4-digit combo for the shackle, then your combo for the key storage area will automatically be set to a pre-determined code.  Or vice-versa.  However, you will not be able to custom choose two different codes for the shackle and key storage area.The lock still functions fine so far, but I would have liked to have known about this code-setting issue before making my purchase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FTEF36SN8NS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I6903Y#wasThisHelpful","R2FTEF36SN8NS2","A3IGETH1M17L0W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IGETH1M17L0W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up because the blurb was pretty gripping. You know from the first chapter that Billy is going to survive, and I was glad to know it as there are some really intense, hard moments for this young guy to survive. I'm putting a trigger warning here. While we don't see the rapes of several young men, it is alluded to. There is also a lot of swearing, and while Billy tends to apologize for it, the words are still there. This is rated YA, and I'm sure most teens have read these words before, but do be aware.This book is written as if Billy is telling us the story in the here and now, with grammar errors, odd phrasing, and rather weird spellings. It took me a long time to get into the flow of the story because of this. I thought about putting it down many times, then would tell myself to just finish it. Finally did, mainly because I needed to find out how Billy put all the clues together.Because that's what he did. Billy is out and about in the town a lot. He's got his eyes open, mostly because there are a few other kids that have it out for him, and want to beat him up. Billy hadn't been a good boy all that long. He used to just do ""stuff"" for the heck of it. And people called him on it. A promise to his dying mom and issues with his dad made him try to toe the line. It was a hard line for him, too. When boys start disappearing, he starts putting the clues together about the missing boys.I rooted for Billy. And I worried about him. Still wanted to take my editor's pen to his words. I think the ""style"" here took away some of the tension of the tale. But I still wanted to see him become a hero, and he did, even when it was hard for him. The story unfolds over the course of months, and sometimes it felt like the author was just moving time along.An interesting debut novel for the author. Will be interested to see what he comes up with next.Thank you, Clarion Books and NetGalley, for the opportunity to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FHAADD0AHDBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6GM8I8#wasThisHelpful","R2FHAADD0AHDBO","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short story kept me on the edge of my seat. And it made me hungry, too. Emet works for Eden Rose at the Serve You Right Cafe. The pastries made me drool. I think Ms. Jacobs could write a second book that just contained the recipes for the goodies in this one.Emet has only been out of prison for a month. He has spent the last ten years in jail for manslaughter. Eden Rose feels everyone deserves a second chance and Emet is an extraordinary baker so she hires him. When we first meet these two, Emet has asked Mercy (a woman he met out and about) out on a date, and she said yes.While Emet, Mercy and Eden are central to the plot, there are a lot of secondary characters that make this a lovely read, including an elderly couple who live in the park. Ms. Jacobs writes in an author's note at the end of the book that she had all these little stories in her head and when she drove by a coffee house one day, they all came together in a fictional coffee shop in her head. I liked many of these characters, so I'm glad it gelled!Mercy's twin brother, Clay, is everything she's not. She's driven, kind, smart, and sweet. He is not. After their mother is moved into a home, he knows that Mercy is on her way out, too. He can't stand that. He deserves to be catered to, taken care of, fed, and housed, or at least that's what his stoned brains are telling him. When he sees she really is going, he decides to do everything in his power to make her stay. To say he is delusional would be an understatement. And his conniving, violent, and evil ways kept me on the edge of my seat.There were some truly wonderful lines in this book. Here are a couple:Emet smiled at her. ""Do you ever get tired of being right?""""Never. It's a constant thrill.""~!~!~!~!~!~""Everyone has a past,"" he said. ""And no one has the future. We all have now, and right now, I like what I see.""~!~!~!~!~!~""I live for the midnight info-dump. In fact, when I got up this morning I said to my cats, 'You know what's missing in my life? A late-night confessional to curl my toes.""~!~!~!~!~!~""Do you always go shopping at the Crazy Store? It sounds like you bought out their entire stock.""~!~!~!~!~!~There were many cute moments (along with the TENSION) in this one. And while it's short, it still has all the things I want in a novella: A beginning, middle and an end!

"While this is the fourth book in the series, it can be read as a standalone. I do appreciate that!This is a quick read, but doesn't lack a beginning, middle or end. Julia is pregnant and is not fond of her protector at all. She realizes his charm at the beginning of their contract was all a facade. She'd walk away, but she has the child to consider. While I didn't understand her choices to begin with, as the author showed us the past, it made sense. There really weren't a lot of choices for women who were left alone during this time frame.Adam was her friend in their young years and his heart was taken by her. He's not happy she left and was shocked when he found her a little later. Later he realizes she left for them. Now that she's back where he can see her, he intends to fight for the right to do so. As head gardener, though, he's not sure he has enough to recommend himself.Personally, I thought Adam was charming! And sweet. And kind. And sexy. Julia thinks so, too.They have to get past her protector first, and I had worries about that.All in all, a nice, enjoyable read.

"I could hardly wait to get this one in my hands! I've thoroughly enjoyed the first books in the Scandals with Bite Series. I really wanted to see Rafael find his own HEA. When he finds someone robbing graves near a local vampire hangout, he just knows it's a vampire hunter. He's very taken aback when he realizes it's the beautiful woman he's been intrigued by. He's also pretty shocked to find that she's a doctor in training. Well, she's learning mostly on her own as woman aren't allowed to be doctors at that time.He takes her prisoner, but she demands a lot from him. To his surprise, he usually lets her get her way. She really wants to see if she can help him regain use of his arm. Sunshine is no friend to Ms. Ann's vampires and he bears the scars to prove it. The doctor in Cassandra wants to help him. They agree to a bargain. She'll experiment on him and he'll take kisses for his payment. And what wonderful kisses they are!We all know who the bad guys are...and I was really looking forward to seeing them get the slaps they so badly deserve. I also wanted to see Rafe find some love for himself, and Cassandra needed that comfort, too.With kisses as payment, experiments, kidnappings, and a battle at midnight, this book was a really fun read. You don't have to read the others in the series, but I bet you'll want to! Now, I really want more of this world. It's really delightful.Thank you, NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca, for giving me the opportunity to read One Bite Per Night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6YSIGRA4T8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3269H2#wasThisHelpful","RA6YSIGRA4T8C","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't read the other stories in this series, The Geek Girls, but I was quickly caught up in the action. I guessed that Ella knew the woman with the mirror from the previous stories and that turned out to be true.I'm going to give my ""quibbles"" first. When Patrick grabs Ella and flings her on the back of his horse, AFTER knocking her out, it's weird. The actions, including him pawing through his saddle bag to get a bit of thin leather to tie her hands in front of him, while they are galloping away from the constables...well, that just wouldn't work. I have horses. I ride. It wouldn't work. Then when she flings herself off the horse, taking him with her, while her hands are still tied in front of him...well, I'm pretty sure they would have broken a lot of bones when they landed, even if it was in a ditch! Then later, when a drop of rain falls on Bacon's neck (he's a horse), he snorts in response. Nope, he wouldn't have noticed one single drop of rain. A deluge, yes...but a couple drops? No. So...the horse stuff just didn't work for me, at all.Also, while Ella was from contemporary times, her speech patterns were fine when she was back in history. But Patrick thought and spoke in contemporary ways long before he got to know her. I'm pretty sure it would be difficult to keep both characters in the right mental frame, but it was quite jarring when Patrick spoke/thought with a contemporary twist.I did enjoy their banter and their getting to know each other. He was pretty accepting of the fact that she was from the future. He did enjoy her clothes, that's for sure. I kept thinking his friend, the one he thought Ella was when he ""kidnapped"" her, was a bit naive and deserving of a bit more ""comeuppance"" for all the drama.The ""fish out of water"" trope was enjoyable. At least Ella had been back in time before, so it wasn't QUITE the shock it might have been. I was impressed with Patrick.This contemporary woman threw him for a loop, but he tried his best to keep up. This was a sassy little read.  3.5 StarsThank you, NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca, for the opportunity to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6BO5SC504KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q326AOE#wasThisHelpful","R3F6BO5SC504KT","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was wonderful. I started it, thinking I'd read just a couple pages...yeah, right. I finished it in two days. While Ms. Burrowes has written a huge stack of books, they are all different. I don't start reading and thinking, ""Gosh, she's done THIS before."" Nope...all different.This one starts right off with Noah having been set aside by the giddy, young thing he's been wooing, and, since he needs a wife, he immediately asks her companion, Lady Thea, to wed him. A week later, the deed is done. Neither has a strong love for the other, although they find each other to be attractive, and while he says he's not ""nice"", she thinks he just may be. At least the kiss she asked for was more than nice! What pushed her into agreeing to wed him was the marriage contract. Her young sister will be safe and will have Thea's backing as a duchess to see her through life. Safety was her first concern.Their wedding night is stopped in its tracks by a confession. While we know things will eventually be smoothed over (otherwise, why would we read these books, you know?) it's the getting there that kept me reading (when I should have been editing!).There are plenty of ""bad guys"" here, and I was kept wondering who had really done the ""baddest thing"".There are also plenty of ""good guys"". Noah's brother, brothers-in-law, his ex-mistress, his sisters, his horticulturist! And Thea. Well, she has a backbone of steel, and determination to rise above. I liked her very much. He did buy the precious little girls ponies, and large ones at that. Thankfully, Harlan steered him that way. I'm actually thinking that Darius might have to share his spot on my favorites list with Noah. And that's saying something!You see I mentioned an ex-mistress? No worries. She does not cavort with married men. And Noah, well, he just wouldn't do that to his wife. No cheating here!While I have recently enjoyed this author's new contemporary series, I truly loved revisiting her historical voice.

"I haven't read the first book in the Newlywed Games series, but I was quickly caught up in the story. Meredith and Jason had a ""pretend"" wedding two years ago. They both felt a connection when their eyes met in Vegas. They could talk to each other like they had met years before. They decided to ""marry"" to act the part of grown ups. Then they went the separate ways, each believing the other had destroyed the marriage license. Somehow, and we never find out how, the license is filed and they've actually been married this whole time. It only comes to light when Meredith needs to have a clean slate before going to her father to ask for a loan.Probably good that Jason found out before he married his current fiance!I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. Meredith is a bit of an airhead, but she's apparently really really bright with regard to running a business. Jason is cold, no he's hot, nope...cold. Whiplash abounded for both Meredith and me. For her part, she still thinks  he's hot and everyone she's been with in the last two years just hasn't measured up. Yes, they have both had some significant, and not so significant, others since they left Vegas. Since they didn't know they were married, I guess technically it's not cheating. Still didn't sit well with me.There were a lot of leaps of faith on this reader's part. Jason needs Meredith to spy for him, in the other half of the company that his family used to all own together before his folks got divorced. She gets a job immediately in that half of the company. She meets his sister immediately. Nothing seemed to be hard for her, either. And she's brilliant at everything she does. Jason kept backtracking on what he wanted from her. It also seemed that only Meredith was using her head.Something I enjoyed was the fashion designer aspects of the story. Haven't read anything like that before and it was fun to get a peek into the life.This was an easy read, and while I liked Mindlink a lot better, I will still be looking for more from this author.3.5 stars*Thank you, Netgalley and Harlequin Desire, for the opportunity to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31D9W6LTT9EIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFELAOG#wasThisHelpful","R31D9W6LTT9EIW","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been anxiously awaiting this final chapter in Sandi Layne's Eire Series.  I have to say, this was worth the wait. Tuirgeis wants Eire for his own. It surprises him to find there are many kings, but he wants to be the ONLY king. He certainly had plenty of ambition, and a strong sword arm. Ms. Layne did her research, and her descriptive words made me feel like I was there as fights were fought and land overtaken.Charis remains a mystery. She was the main character in book one, Eire's Captive Moon. Just where did she come from? Is she fae? Does she have magic? Hard to tell. I do know that I'd want her on my side in a fight. She and her spear are deadly.The second book in the series, Eire's Viking, was the romance. This one most definitely centers on the warrior aspect of Eire's Vikings. There are lots skirmishes, battles, and wars. This is the bloodiest of the three books and it read real. There are some tender moments and I'll admit to shedding a few tears as the series wound up. The epilogue was brilliant. When I finally make it to the Emerald Isle, I am going to search out some of these sites. I want to experience standing where this history was made that Ms. Layne brought to life with her words. I will be keeping an eye out for a pale haired healer when I'm there.If you are looking for a read that makes history read real, this is the series for you.FIVE STARS!*Thank you, NetGalley and TWCS, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJZZ0T1QDDO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612133762#wasThisHelpful","RKJZZ0T1QDDO0","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this cover caught my attention. Then the blurb drew me in. It was an engaging read, for sure.Carter is chosen to check out the props at a stage show. Violet banters with him as he checks out the huge glass wall...that she then walks right through. He feels a connection to the woman in the cat suit and she gives him her number before he leaves. Carter has some hang ups, though. He's not quite over his ex-wife, the woman who just walked right of of his life. This new woman has pretty much overwhelmed him with how intrigued he is about her. But he's scared because Violet is drama and danger and lust and just maybe something else.The chapters switch between Carter and Luke. Luke is the manager and brains behind the illusion show. He makes the magic happen. He also lives with Violet. AND he gets kidnapped! I didn't like him very much. Carter was much more appealing to me.There's mystery here and one is constantly going: What the heck?Thankfully the story threads are all brought together and the things we questioned are all smoothed out. While I did appreciate that very much (and I hope you do, too) I was taken aback by the editing. There should be at least a double space when we change scenes. The characters would be in the theater...and then sitting in a car. I almost got whiplash. There were also formatting issues. Several times there would be a break in a sentence...and the rest of sentence was nowhere to be found. Pretty much stopped me in my reading tracks several times.Besides those issues, the story was one that kept me reading.

"When I read the first book in this series, Forgotten Sins, I was totally pulled into the Sin Brothers' world. At the time, three of the brothers, Shane, Matt, and Nate weren't sure Jory was still alive. They had evidence of his death...but didn't want to accept it.Their faith is rewarded when Jory is found to be alive in Book 3: Blind Faith. While he is alive, he's also locked up, held by the truly evil Dr. Madison, and the even worse, Commander. There's also the not-so-small issue of the kill chips in each of the brothers' necks. Time is running out before they are activated and deadly blades sever their spines. Yeah...it was nerve wracking!Piper Oliver is set up right outside Jory's cage. She's working as fast as her brilliant brain can process to try and get his particular chip back online. A bullet had nicked it and it wasn't responding to orders. She's not sure why she's doing this, since he IS a traitor to the USA and he's going to be court-martialed anyway (at least that's what her superiors have told her). But there's something about him, something that just calls to her. She has a POINT TO PROVE and she's not going to let his gorgeous gray eyes sway her, though. Nope, not her. Of course, since he knows to the minute how long he has on this earth, he's not going to let his heart come into play. We all know how that's going to work out for them, don't we? Yes, makes for some fun times.This is one wild ride of a book. Old secrets are opened to the light and new ones had me gasping and turning the pages as fast as I could read them. Once again, Ms. Zanetti throws twists and turns at us and keeps us hoping for an HEA for everyone and wondering just how that could possibly happen.This was a very satisfying read. I hate that it's OVER! Thankfully, this author is very prolific and she's already got more words in the pipeline. I'm in line for them!

"This was charming. It ties for my favorite novella in this series.Sadie is a chef, and her creations pretty much made me drool. She's worried about her heart, after being shot down in middle school. Even though she and the ""shooter"" became best friends...she's still worried about rejection. She really does want her own family, but after being dumped via text several times, she's not ready to put herself out there again.Erik is her best friend. He's also the guy that turned her down for a dance back in school. I like a guy that can learn, and he FINALLY gets it through his mind just WHO he has been waiting for. It's Sadie!

He now has to convince her, after her latest dumping, that she really belong with him.I enjoyed their banter and the way they really do depend on God for guidance.

"Oh my gosh. I've been anxiously awaiting this final book in The End of All Things series. And I can say: This was worth the wait!We pick right up where The Land of the Shadows ended. There's a military truck driving right up to them. I, just like Carly did, thought: Wow! They are saved! Finally, there's and end to food shortages and they can surely get more medical supplies!Dang that Justin...he made her hold back...and well he did.There isn't an easy fix in this brave, new world. And while that would have been great, Carly and Justin can bring their people through the shadows. It's hard, but it can be done.I did laugh at several points. Like when Justin remembered he was DOOMED from the first time he saw Carly. There was no way he wasn't going to fall for her. I also laughed when she remembered it was Monday, and therefore, wash day. So much easier here in my house to throw a load of wash into a washer that is powered by electricity and then I'm able to put it into a DRYER!Then Ms. Bryan made me cry. Because this new world has some harsh realities. And while one can get past some of those realities, hearts will hurt. And mine surely did.Once again, if I were in this situation, I would really want Justin and Carly on my side. Justin is a total warrior, but while her strengths are different, Carly is just as strong, maybe even stronger than he is.The last several chapters of this story had me on the edge of my seat, rushing through each page to the end, my heart clenching in my chest. The payoff was worth it.There's hope in these characters. I would hope that if something like the Infection happened, that humanity would rise above the carnage, just like these people did. While none of them are superheroes, they did overcome. That's what I'd hope for in this kind of future.Frankly, I loved Shadows Have Gone. And now I want more from Ms. Bryan. I don't think I can get enough of her words. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for adventure, mystery, a bit of romance, some humor, and a series to sink your teeth into.

"A December Brideby Denise HunterWhat started as a whim turned into an accidental - and very public - engagement. Can Layla and Seth keep up the facade in Chapel Springs this holiday season  -  for the sake of her career . . . and his heart?Under normal circumstances, Seth Murphy, the best friend of Layla O'Reilly's ex-fiance would be the last person she'd marry. But the news of their upcoming (and phony) nuptials convinces a big client that Layla may be high-society enough to work for his agency, a coup that would put her fledgling home-staging business on the map. Seth has secretly loved Layla for years, even when she was dating his best friend. Maybe she'll never forgive him for the way he hurt her back then, but he has to try. And Layla is willing to keep up their engagement farce until she's landed her client. For Layla, it's the chance to save her career. But for Seth, it's his last chance to win her heart.Kathie's Review:Again, I know Christmas is over for another 9 months...but this was cute! And short, and I needed something to read that wouldn't take all day. This fit the bill nicely.I really enjoyed the staging of Seth's house. I could see all the goodies Layla was setting up. The sleigh? Yes, that was a fantastic touch!And Seth, ah he was a sweetheart. Jumping at the chance to get the girl of his dreams. He was a bit awkward, but that made him all the more endearing.The thing that I didn't like about this one was Layla never laid the blame for her broken engagement where it belonged. That would be on her cousin and her ex-fiance. She forgives Seth, but he really didn't do anything wrong. That bothered me.He was a very forgiving guy, himself, and while he shouldn't have felt guilty, he was a great guy who did. Yes, he's a keeper.Even though their fake engagement and then their real one doesn't take all that much time, it worked here. They had known each other for a long time. Finally, the time was right...and it was sweet. There's no steamy scenes in this book. There is some lovely UST in the form of kisses. It was a lovely, clean read.So, if you are still wishing for a bit of Christmas Cheer, check this one out.FOUR BOOKMARKS for this one.A January Brideby Deborah RaneyWho can work in a house that's overrun by contractors and carpenters? Not Madeleine Houser, a successful novelist who gladly accepts the help of her octogenarian friend, Ginny, to arrange for a temporary office in the charming bed and breakfast owned by Ginny's friend, Arthur. Maddie’s never met the innkeeper––but a friendship grows between them as Maddie and Arthur leave messages for each other each day. To Maddie’s alternate delight and chagrin, she seems to be falling for the inn’s owner––a man who's likely many years her senior––and who she’s never even met.Kathie's Review:This is the third book in the ""Year of Weddings"" series that I've read. And I loved this one the most. Maybe because I'm an editor, and reading about Maddie's life as she writes books, there was something that rang true here.Maddie can't work in her sister's house as it undergoes a major renovation. Her elderly, but spry, neighbor Ginny finds a place for her to work in a friend's B&B. It's empty during the week and the lovely surrounds and the quiet are the perfect place for Maddie to get her novel going.She and the landlord, Arthur, leave each other notes. She assumes that he's this older gentleman, because he's Ginny's friend. He assumes she's elderly because she's Ginny's friend.Neither are correct.Times passes as do their letters to each other. They are rapidly becoming friends through their words. I found myself getting anxious about their actual meeting. Ginny has a hand in that, too.Arthur's beloved wife died nearly three years ago. He struggles to accept his growing attraction to Maddie and, once again, Ginny helps out. I think she needs her own book! Maybe Alex, the cat, needs one, too.Yes, I enjoyed this Wedding Series book the best so far. Well done, Ms. Raney. I will be looking up more from you!4.5 BOOKMARKSA February Brideby Betsy St. AmantIn A February Bride, history repeats itself when this bride runs out of the church on her wedding day---in the same dress that had been passed down for generations and worn by her mom, grandma and great-grandmother who also ran out of their weddings. The heroine struggles to break destructive cycles of the past. Can this bride shuck expectation and discover who SHE is as a bride and in the Bride of Christ? And if she finally walks down the aisle, what dress will she be wearing? Readers will enjoy this novel of redemption centered on a winter wedding.Kathie's Review:Ah, Allie...she hasn't had the best mentors as she stands in the church on her wedding day. She's wearing THE DRESS that the women in her family always wear to be married in. Each and every time they marry. They enjoy saying they are cursed. That they leave (or push out) the men that they love...before their own hearts can be broken. They've all been married over and over again. And now it's time for Allie to enjoy her own FIRST marriage.Allie loves Marcus. Loves him to distraction. While I don't agree with her method (leaving him standing at the altar) I can see why she does it. A tear in the sleeve of THE DRESS seems like a sign to her...and she sprints away, to save Marcus from the torment of a broken marriage later on.It's four months later and Hannah, Marcus' sister and Allie's best friend makes a huge request. She wants Allie to be her Maid of Honor in her own wedding, slated for Valentine's Day.My issue here is that Allie and Marcus haven't run into each other in FOUR MONTHS. This is a very small town. Very small. And once the initial meeting goes awkwardly by, they keep running into each other. And the sparks are still there. Oh, Allie admits to herself that she loves him, and probably always will. But she just doesn't want to hurt him any further.This book has alternating POV and Ms. St. Amant does it well. We get to read Marcus' confusion, and about his continuing love for Allie, and she does this very well.Just when Allie thinks maybe she can break the curse, and get back together with Marcus and they can live HEA, her mom calls. She needs THE DRESS back. She's getting married for the umpteenth time.I really enjoyed the VOICE OF REASON when she came to Allie. And I enjoyed the sweet ending. This was a fun way to spend a few hours.FOUR BOOKMARKS here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45H44TJE4BI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWW5BSY#wasThisHelpful","R45H44TJE4BI7","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was great fun! It was sweet...and charming...even though I wanted to shake both Mary and John a time or two.They had been married for a very short time. Their families were grateful they were together, as none of them wanted to deal with the boredom, and what the considered to be dullness, of either of them. Their first weeks of marriage were rather dry...neither of them had a huge love for the other, and both of them were just moving along as their parents wanted them to.When John gets the opportunity to travel abroad, he jumps at the chance. His time away changes him. He grows from a boy into a man, a man who is going to take his own future and shape it the way he wants.Mary, on the other hand, has been shuttled off to an aging relative. She wasn't sure what she wanted with her life, but taking over for the aunt wasn't in her cards. But if they were to keep themselves fed and warm, she needed to handle things. And, to her surprise, she was quite good at it.Now, John is back...and he's sure he'll be able to handle the door mouse of a wife he left behind. He is shocked and appalled that she is NOT who he thought she was. She's got a backbone! And Mary, for her part, is intrigued by the man who has returned to her. When he starts issuing orders, after she's been doing the ordering for years, she takes a firm stand.This is the story of how they come to work together, come to find love, and come to a sweet understanding.I read the last page and found myself smiling. And thinking back on it for days afterward. This was great! I will certainly be looking for more from this author.*Thank you, NetGalley and Sourcebook ~ Casablanca, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZG2H4H4J4U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH1UK0O#wasThisHelpful","R3CZG2H4H4J4U9","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<b>Happy Release Day!!!</b>First, I love that name...Killian. Second, I really enjoyed this book. Vampires and Werewolves that have a pretty believable mythos are a joy to read. This is the third book in the Dead in the City Series. I haven't read the first two, but was quickly caught up in the action here.Sadie is happy running The Coven, a bar in Manhattan. Well, except for the fact that this pack of Werewolves comes in every night. She finally asks the very hot, very Alpha, very sexy Killian why. Her feelings are just a tad hurt when he says he's opening up a bar that just might also cater to the supernatural. When she finds out he might want to ""borrow"" her sizzling DJ, well, her feelings are REALLY hurt.But that's before she's caught skinny dipping in his pool. While he's spying on her, he spots the mark on her shoulder, the one he's been dreaming out for decades. She's who he's been looking for and why he hasn't claimed a mate.They certainly do have some chemistry! I enjoyed that a lot. What I didn't enjoy was the repetition of why they couldn't be together, and how he was supposed to be king in five years. I got it the first time, didn't need to read it for the umpteenth time. #NaNoWriMoSyndrome for sure.Besides that pet peeve, I was very pleasantly surprised by a couple twists and tweaks that set this story ahead of the curve. Won't spoil it here, but yes, I liked those twists!There are more characters that could use their own HEA, and I'll be on the lookout for more from this author.*Thank you, NetGalley and Sourcebooks ~ Casablanca, for the opportunity to read this book","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GLXKICNNLRUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQEUEOO#wasThisHelpful","R3GLXKICNNLRUM","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"<b>Happy Release Day!!!</b>This is the final book in the Sweetest Kisses Series. While each book stands alone, they are all entwined, too. The characters in the three main novels (there are two novellas) come and go throughout the series.Mac has been the best oldest brother ever. He gives support to the family business (they are lawyers), watches nieces, trims the the hooves of the family horses (and those at the therapy riding stable), and worries over those he loves. He does not date. Hasn't for about twelve years. I had my theories about that and I was wrong.Sidonie is raising her foster son, Luis, who she wants to adopt. But he just won't let her. She's fighting battles with probate after the death of her brother, she's fighting DSS over the care of her son, she's fighting with herself, and has been for years.As always, Ms. Burrowes pulls us into the lives of these characters. She gives them flesh and fears and issues. We all know the major issue with Sidonie from the very beginning. She hates lawyers. Hates them! And Mac is one. He's not an ambulance chaser, he's a defender, but he knows she's not going to like it. And he likes her very much. So he puts off telling her. We know the reveal is coming throughout the book and the tension was really getting to me. Yes, it's not like some gun wielding bad guy was out to get them, but knowing that this issue was going to come to a head really got to me. Yes, Ms. Burrowes is that good at writing us into the scenes.This was a wonderful culmination of the series. There have been small issues threaded through the entire course, and we get to see the fallout, and the grace, here at the end.Had to chuckle when we are introduced to one of the people from the therapy riding center, Neils Haddonfield. I'm pretty sure he's a descendant of Nicholas Haddonfield, of Nicholas, Lord of Secrets fame. It was lovely to see that line here.There was humor in this book. There was joy. There was reality. Ms. Burrowes borrows from her real life in the legal world to show us how the courts get on. It's not a case of telling, either...but showing us without bogging down the narrative. If there was ever a reason for me to need legal help, I'd love to find a MacKenzie, Trent, and James to help me out. I was a legal secretary for years, and there are some lovely lawyers out there...and there are some bad ones, too. Just like in this book. Yes, it reads real.While I'm sad to see this series come to a close, I'm hoping Ms. Burrowes will now give us a novella...full of the recipes she kept taunting us with in these books! I need Vera's turtle cookie recipe, and James' special mashed potatoes!I highly recommend this book, this series, to anyone who loves contemporary romance that makes you stay up until all hours and fall in love with well developed, wonderful characters.Thank you, NetGalley and Sourcebooks ~ Casablanca, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDWAMD0KQ3PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEUAM2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1XDWAMD0KQ3PK","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh My Gosh! This is SMUT. Funny Smut. Silly Smut. CHARMING SMUT WITH A PLOT. I smiled a lot as I read this. I even laughed out loud a time or three. While the steamy times are many, they are held together with an actual plot.From a former fan fic reader and writer myself, this one hits home! Dawn has been writing fiction for free on line. Her readers want her to publish her work. They want to hold it in their hands. She decides to go for it. And that's when the ""fear of white pages"" aka ""writer's block"" smacks her keyboard. What seemed so easy, is now a challenge.Then the biggest challenge comes when Warner reads her beginning...and can't control his laughter. He decides she needs some real world experience in the romance and sexy times department, and he is just he man for the job. He's UP for it. You know, For Authentication Purposes!While Dawn is pushing to seal the deal, Warner is holding off. He wants her to really want IT. And he has a few fears of his own going, too. He's been more than singed in an ongoing issue and while he wants to ""get to the good stuff"" he also wants to wait. For good reason, he did ask her to marry him when he was 14, and now he wants to make it real. And a quick ""wham, bam"" is not in the cards.Yes, this was steamy...but it was also incredibly charming. Warner and Dawn are nicely showcased amidst a hysterical supporting cast. I enjoyed this one a lot. Hope you do, too.*Thank you, Netgalley and TWCS, for the opporturnity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G64QDEFK8BGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161213386X#wasThisHelpful","R2G64QDEFK8BGS","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We met Xavier Grey in the last book, as he finally came out of is fugue state after the turmoil of war. Spinster Jane Downing has been pining for him since she first met him years ago. He, of course, was clueless...men!After yet another evening spent among people who have no clue she's even there, people who forget her the moment they meet her, Jane has had IT. She's going to grasp life by the throat...and find herself some PASSION. One night to keep herself warm for the rest of her life. Of course, she chooses Xavier for that night.A bit of help from a snowstorm puts these two in an empty house...and within arm's reach. Well, empty except for them and an EVIL CAT. That dang cat blocked several moments that could have turned steamy. Xavier wanted those moments blocked. I think he was actually grateful to the EVIL SPAWN who ate everything linen he could get his claws and fangs on. That's because he is BAD...and Jane is good...and he doesn't deserve good or pure or love.As with any good romance, we know that both are going to have to face their issues to find true love. There's a lot of soul searching with these two. They are also going to have to corral that dang cat!A sweetly warm read that will make you smile that I give a 4.5 rating to!*Thank you, Netgalley and Erica Ridley, for the opportunity to read this book","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0BBDHSB83SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFGP5HG#wasThisHelpful","R1A0BBDHSB83SJ","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story has it all. Four con artists are at the top of their game, two want out to start their lives together, one last diamond heist on the books to fill the coffers...and some off the charts UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between the other two.

She gives us people to root for. I especially enjoyed the supporting character of Ethan's pilot and friend. Tickled me that he was a pilot named Gabriel. An angel in the pilot's seat! I'm thinking I'd read a book just about him.There were some really intense scenes in this book that kept me on the edge of my seat. There was tenderness that was touching, and revenge.

"Okay, read this one a very long time ago. Reread it just now because I saw FSOG this weekend. Thought I could get by just reading Darker...but that wasn't the case. Had to read this one again, too.You know, there are some books that just stick with you. Some characters that hang around and give you that ""book hangover"" when you read the last page. This series is like that for me. Right up there with Anne McCaffrey's PERN saga...right up there with Twilight. Right up there with the Harry Potter Series. Wowza, what a mix of books I read! But I have the same feeling when I read those...and this one. I'm IN that world, and it's hard to come back out.In FREED, we've skipped forward in time...just a bit. This author has issues with moving time forward, but that never has bothered me. I like living in their moments. I enjoyed their honeymoon very much. And I felt sad when their bubble was popped and they were back in the real world.The new security people sometimes made me laugh. Trying to keep up with that errant wife probably gave them gray hairs!I would love to wander through the new house...and spend time on the new deck, watching the sunset. Of course, I do love Washington State...born there, you know. It was fun tootling around town with them, seeing things I've seen in reality...lol And seeing Gia put in her place? Priceless!Once again, they are having to deal with Fifty's issues. She loves you, you idiot! Of course, he got his share of gray hairs from worry over her, and her errant ways. Not having OBEY in the vows? Yeah, go her!Once again, Ana's backbone is what impresses me. There were a few times I though she should have ""given"" in a bit more...but she stayed true to her own beliefs...and she learned from her mistakes. I like that in a character. I like that in Christian. Like many men, it took him a while to figure out the best course of action...but then he took the lesson to heart. Go him!I loved the book bonuses at the end, after the epilogue. Such wonderful peeks into scenes not in the book.Yep, I got a book hangover reading for the last two days. It was well worth it.

"From the first page, this drew me in. It was a quick read at only 203 pages. The blackmail and marriage proposal were right there at the beginning! Juliet needs a husband that will ignore her and let her get on with her life goal of breeding dogs...and selling them. Her icky cousin thinks to marry her and she really doesn't want to be a politician's wife. Seems like stealing, I mean, HIDING her neighbor's beloved pet to get him to do what she wants makes perfect sense, at least to her.I loved how confused Benjamin was to begin with. Then he was shocked and appalled this young woman was asking him to marry her, and then he was pretty much outraged to discover she had his DOG! There is no way he will give in to her...until she mentions the name of her cousin, then he agrees incredibly quickly. We find out why much later on.They need to pretend this is a love match, and both are very surprised to find that it just might be so.Both of our main characters were a bit hard headed at time, but I liked them very much.

"I am particularly fond of Ms. Spear's Highland shifter series. While this one was steamy, and some of the shifter scenes were fun, it read like a PSA...for how bad it is to buy and sell wild animals. Don't get me wrong, I agree that the trafficking of wild animals should be stopped, but I did get rather tired of hearing how bad people are. Not all of us fit that bill.What I did like was that Melissa and Huntley are a team for JAG Special Forces. Don't you love that name? Because they are also jaguar shifters. They are hunting for poachers and are looking at each other a bit differently. They've both recently stepped away from their significant others, for assorted reasons. Suddenly, it seems like becoming more than partners just might be fun. They are forced to pretend to be a couple anyway when they need to care for some temporarily orphaned cubs--cubs who shift to human every so often!Once again Ms. Spear takes us on a shifting ride where we find steam, mystery, and romance.*Thank you, NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca for the opportunity to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SKWM9ALII68R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH1UK68#wasThisHelpful","R2SKWM9ALII68R","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second full length novel in the Sweetest Kisses Series. We met James in the earlier books. He's the youngest of the Knightley brothers and has been thought a ""Gentleman Slut"" by them. He did put the moves on Trent's girl, but only to see if her feelings for him were sincere. I wasn't sure if I was going to like James. He flirts with everyone. Young, old, married, single. But then, so do I! James likes women. Very much so. He never has to pursue them, they do the calling. He wonders at one point if he'd win something along the lines of ""Most Sought Out Booty Call."" This makes me sad...because it makes him sad. Now, a young man, who doesn't HURT women, either their bodies or their hearts, can have fun if it's consensual. And it appears to be so for all those women in his past. He never calls, they call him and he's never had a reason to say no. Until recently.James is sad. He's a great attorney AND a sharp CPA. But he's still waiting for something and the things he used to enjoy...just don't appeal any longer.When he delivers some papers to one of his brother's clients, he meets the something, or rather, the someones, he's been looking for. Yes, there are two females who intrigue him. Vera and her daughter Twyla...two who might need him, too.As always, this is not a wild roller coaster ride of a book. We slowly get to know these characters as they wend their way toward an HEA. Vera and James have hurts in their pasts, some not quite that distant. Someone is stalking Vera and she's pretty sure it's her ex. Something a bit different with him, is that we get to see his POV...and once again, the bad guy is not totally evil. One can almost feel a bit of sympathy there. Almost, anyway.At one point, James and Trent are looking at horses to buy for Trent's new wife and her daughter. I truly enjoyed the brief glimpse we had of Wellie and Jo!It took me a few chapters to come to like Vera. She was too timid. She was too cranky. She was too...a lot of things that just didn't appeal to me. Then, on the slow ride to the end, she made sense. Her attitude at the beginning made sense, too. Her issues were hard ones. Real life ones. And then I liked her very much.Ms. Burrowes writes intimate scenes with a sweet, yet steamy, eloquence. It reads hot, but not ***porny***, if that makes sense! It also doesn't take over the entire book. It just fits the story and doesn't overpower it.This is another Five Bookmark review from me. I find I'm not even missing the Regency Era...although I am looking forward to more of those, too! The next book in this series, Kiss Me Hello, is calling to me. Mac is a farrier and visits a therapeutic riding stable at the beginning of the book. Our family volunteers at one, and this book is going to be fun! Mac needs to laugh a bit more and I hope he finds some joy in this one (of course he will!).Thank you, NetGalley and Sourecebooks ~ Casablanca, for the opportunity to read this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4SSPCZQ09EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEUAM5Q#wasThisHelpful","R2G4SSPCZQ09EQ","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FOUR and a HALF STARS for this charming story!This was my second book by this author. It won't be my last. I read Wrong Place, Right Time recently. Her characters are charming and the situations sweet.Renee is pretty much forced to try out for the local Bachelor Reality Show. She figures she might as well try it, since she needs to raise her public profile if she's going to get a prime promotion at the radio station where she works. When she hears who the Bachelor is, she thinks about running. He's the local playboy. But doesn't he have pretty eyes? Yep, he does. She decides to stay in the running, well, as long as he keeps handing her dandelions! Yes, instead of roses, he hands out dandelions, because we are all pretty much weeds, aren't we?Renee is an accident in progress from pretty much the moment she meets Ben. She certainly catches his attention when she also catches her dress on fire! Ben wonders if maybe she really does need a knight in shining armor to keep her safe. She intrigues him, to say the least.It was fun watching these two find common ground with all the messes occurring. Never having seen the way one of these bachelor shows goes forward, this read like it could happen this way. A sweet read, for sure.Thank you, Brooke Williams, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UR5A121JEPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R54MUXY#wasThisHelpful","R19UR5A121JEPU","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now, I don't normally do SCARY...and I never watch those ghostie reality shows. They give me the creeps. Seriously, the heebie jeebies! But...this summary drew me in and I figured I'd give it a shot. I will admit to having my arm hair stand up a time or three, but it wasn't SCARY scary...just a bit of scary. It was actually quite FUN.Ava's aunt has died and left her the mansion that she's always loved. She wants to use it as a bed and breakfast. There's so much room, there's so much history, the view is spectacular, Ava is a fabulous cook...and there's ghosts. Like all over the place! Her family refuse to step foot inside the place. They figure she's going to turn into a cat lady with no husband or kids. Of course, the fact that many of the men that married into the family, and stayed in the house, either went nuts, killed themselves, or had ""accidents"". They are right to feel a bit worried. When they finally do step foot inside the place, THEIR heebie jeebies made me laugh!To get her inheritance, Ava has to solve the 200+ year old mystery of what really happened to Sarah, whose body was never found. She recruits the TV crew of Phantoms to help her out. When she meets the star of the show, Jackson, there is an immediate connection, on both their parts. Jackson has a bit of a secret, too. He's a distant relation to Sarah's family.There's a mystery to solve, there's UST to enjoy between the characters, and there's a supporting cast of characters that were a joy to read.The pieces came together very nicely with a great balance of BOO and science. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It certainly made me want more from this author. Nice to know Ghost of a Promise is book one in a new series.Thank you, Netgalley and Entangled, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5RD40YFYJSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6AVJM0#wasThisHelpful","R1D5RD40YFYJSU","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one came up in an email from one of the Kindle Alert groups I follow. They had the first three chapters up and I read them. And was immediately hooked.Eve Knight has a whole bunch of attempts made on her life in a very short span of time. I immediately wanted to know who was after her.I also wanted to see how the UST between Eve and Jake came to fruition. Jake is one of the FBI agents guarding her life. He has some deep hurt in his past and overcoming those issues is next to impossible. When the depth of the hurt is revealed, I was actually quite surprised.I enjoyed the unraveling of the mystery of who was after Eve. Although I did feel the perp kind of came out of left field. I prefer having clues where I can figure it out myself. But that might just be me.This also was heavy with #NaNoWriMoSyndrome. There was quite a bit of repetition in back story that I didn't think was necessary. Also, we had several scenes that I felt the author was setting up characters for other books in the series. It was pretty heavy handed, and while I like Roy Hanson very much (he's the focus of the next book) the way he and Manny were inserted really slogged down the flow of the story.Even with those issues, I was still pleased with the story and I'll definitely be looking at the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHDRPB8QDADI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TD2FW4#wasThisHelpful","R1MHDRPB8QDADI","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw the first portion of this for free and downloaded it. It was interesting enough that I bought the entire set. HUGE Disclaimer: I never have, and never will, buy a SERIAL book that is not complete. I've read literally hundreds of fan fiction stories and those are okay to read as WIPs (works in progress). But I'm not paying for that pleasure. I've been left high and dry several times as writers of fan fiction left the fandom and didn't finish their stories. So...I wouldn't ever buy a book that wasn't finished. I really wish Amazon would CLEARLY mark books that are serials. This author was kind enough to do so, and I give her props for that.Back to the review. This story was finished, and after reading the free bit, I bought the boxed set. It didn't take very long to read, and I enjoyed it. I am very fond of dragon shifters and was pleased that we got to see these characters as human and dragon, both.Ah, Tristan...he and his dragon are totally ALPHA, with Tristan being a bit of a jerk. His dragon is interested in a very short list of things: Food, Sleep, Flying, and Sex. With the emphasis on sex!Their clan has been given a ""sacrifice"" in the form of Melanie Hall. In this world, sacrifices are volunteers. In her case, Melanie has offered herself up so her brother will get a vial of dragon blood to cure him of a particular malady. It's worth it to her to spend at least six months with some hot guy, trying to get her pregnant, to save her brother. The human women are offered the option of staying with their child, should they have one, which I thought was a nice touch.Every so often, a dragon becomes ""attached"" to the human. Makes for some steamy scenes, that's for sure. Tristan's dragon really, really wants Melanie all for themselves. He was pretty sweet, finally!This is basically smut...with a nice story line. There was some repetition (#NaNoWriMoSyndrome) and quite a bit of info dumping, but beyond that I enjoyed seeing this world. Ms. Donovan dedicated her book to Anne McCaffrey, and I thought that was nice, too. She was inspired by her, but took dragons and made her own world. Yes, it was enjoyable. I will have to check out more of her work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1X2U64S7K5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NU69YD0#wasThisHelpful","R3L1X2U64S7K5I","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this! It's a short story, but there's nothing missing here. It's a mystery, a romance, there's a bit of angst, and then we have a conclusion that's very satisfying.Georgia's daughter has to write a story about time before the internet...a time before search engines and social media. I laughed when she asked her mother if she had been alive then. Georgia then tells her a story about a search without our modern technology to help. A search that takes months, not just a few keystrokes.Just like her daughter, I was drawn into the story. I wanted these two starcrossed young people to find each other again. Then I wondered if they would find that HEA that we all search for. I was on the edge of my seat, right there with Sophie, as we waited to hear more of the story.Some short stories seem to be a prelude to a bigger novel. That's not the case here. We have a lovely beginning, a great middle...and a fulfilling end. If this is your first taste of a Suzanne Carroll story, I'm pretty sure it will make you want to read more! And, thankfully, she has more to read.

"I read the first book in this series, Loving the Marquess, and really enjoyed it. I was pleased to receive a copy of Beguiling the Earl from the author. Kerrick was a great hero. He was honorable and in a hard place due to a debt he owes to a fellow spy. Just when he was ready to court Catherine in earnest, he has to pretend to court another woman.Catherine wasn't all that pleased with the arrangement, either! Especially since she really likes Rose, who is her competition to everyone looking in. AND Rose has an ""understanding"" of long standing, to back her role in the eyes of the ton. Her parents are pushing for an engagement. Her father particularly. Rose was a spectacular supporting character and will be the star of the next book.I truly hate the trope of people not talking which brings about hurt feelings and misunderstandings. Especially when a few words would clear things up. That is not the case here. Kerrick doesn't let that happen, thankfully! And Catherine, while young, has a good head on her shoulders.They have to find a way through and over several obstacles in their path to happiness. Some of those things aren't totally cleared up by the end of the book. I'm pretty sure they'll be cleared in the next book of the series.One thing that bothered me, Kerrick knows how much Catherine's BIL cares for her. How protective he is of her. I'm not sure why Kerrick didn't clue him in over the fact that this really horrible man is stalking her. Nicholas needs to know.Other than that small issue, I thoroughly enjoyed the adult way these two carried on. It was refreshing to read! Now...I need that next book!

Ms. Tyler builds their back story naturally and I was quickly caught up in their lives.Mac wants to get THE STORY on the SWAT team. She figures there has to be something hinky with all those buff, too good to be true men. Gage, the team leader, decides that he has to keep her close just to keep her from finding out the truth.

"Anyone who reads this blog knows that I totally fangirl over the historical novels written by Grace Burrowes. One of my friends says that I'm probably her biggest fan. This is true. Her historicals are the books that once I get, I sit right down and read until I can't keep my eyes open any longer. Husband and kids are on their own for meals (good thing they can ALL cook!). I wasn't really worried about reading a contemporary series from this author, but I wondered if I'd like it just as much as her Regency romances.I began A Single Kiss...and was immediately swept right up into the story. For those who are wondering if Ms. Burrowes can write contemporary as well as she writes historical, worry no more! ""They"" say you should write what you know. This series is based around lawyers. The author is a lawyer and she brings insights to the story that can't be found by doing just a google search. Throughout the story we get legal information in a natural way. It's not a ""tell"" sort of situation. It fits the story and makes us understand what's going on. I was a legal secretary for years, and while I read from an understanding of some of the law already, I was not put off by hearing how things work. Again, it was very naturally done.While this is book one in the Sweetest Kisses Series, books .05 and .06 (reviewed earlier) give us bits of ""prologue"" in the supporting characters. Books 1, 2, and 3 are centered on the Knightly brothers.Once again, I laughed at several bits. There are two small girls in this book. Hannah's daughter and Trent's, as well. Little children can hear things and interpret them skewed. Yes, I laughed over the ""teensy fly"" a lot!We know from an early altercation, that things are going to heat up in the angst department. The foreshadowing nearly killed me. Something BAD was going to happen. Hannah has worries about her daughter. And as we hear from the BAD GUY, gah, I was worried.There are some twists and turns, with just enough hints that I was able to guess about the outcomes. That's so much fun for me. I like to be able to figure out ""whodunit"" but not until late in the game. And I did!A big appeal of Ms. Burrowes' books for me is the witty banter and narrative. This book reinforces that enjoyment. Her characters act like grownups, with no plot devices thrown in to extend the book. I do love that. Instead of going off on their own to ""save the loved ones,"" they get help! Like people should!Small pet peeve, that I hope was fixed in the final edit (I read an ARC of this book), is the word ""OK"". Every time I saw it as ""OK"" it pulled me right out of the story. I always think it should be spelled out, unless you are referring to the state of Oklahoma in an address. And that may have been fixed after I read my copy.The prequel novels, Kiss and Tell (Sweet Kisses, #0.5)  and A Kiss for Luck (Sweetest Kisses, #0.6) have been reviewed here and here.I am definitely in this series for the long haul. Do I still love her historical novels? Yes, but Ms. Burrowes has shown that she can write contemporary romance equally as well.

"The first two stories were steamy, but didn't have much ""heart"". They were hot and well-written, but there was a bit of cheating in the second one, and while it worked out for everyone, not really my cup of tea. They are both geared to get your engines running, though!But the third one! I loved it. It wasn't just erotica, it was romance. I enjoy romantica much more than your straight erotica. This one certainly fits that bill.Nikki and Hunter meet twice. First, there may be a misunderstanding about phone numbers and lists. She walks off in a huff. Unfortunately, she can't walk off at their second meeting, as she's waiting to see her doctor...who is ill...when HE walks in with his doctor coat and stethoscope around his neck...while she's only wearing a thin sheet. Yeah, embarrassment abounds. And it was fun. The remainder of the story is about trust, romance, and allowing yourself to find that HEA.

"4.5 ReadWhile I enjoyed the first book in the series, Pretty Hot, this one is even better. We get to see Kai and Kate fight, grow, and find a way to be together. There are many outside forces that really don't want them to be a couple: His father, her clueless mother, her ex (who is SUCH a jerk!).This one is also much steamier as Kate discovers that there's more to intimacy than what she previously thought. Kai is an incredibly erotic lover and he's more than willing to help her explore that side of her character. Watch out, your kindle may melt.While there is still more of the story to tell, this one leaves a reader in a good place.

"This little gem is free, or at least it was at the time I reviewed it. This is another prequel to Ms. Burrowes newest series, a contemporary grouping called Sweetest Kisses. While the main novels are about the Knightley brothers, the first two novellas are about supporting characters. A taste, if you will, of the goodies to come!I have loved the historical novels by this author. Some say I'm her number one fangirl. That could certainly be true!In this story, Sadie is working hard to protect her sister and her nephew. They've had a very hard couple years and this is a new start for everyone. Gideon has moved into the apartment complex while his elderly farmhouse is getting a face-lift. Living with him is his very LARGE dog, Baby. Gideon is an investigator and he's looking for the young son of a client. We know where the lines are going to cross long before our characters do, and it kept me on tenterhooks. One of the best parts of this author's ""tricks"" is that she has her characters ACT LIKE ADULTS. They don't keep secrets, they work together...family is everything. I do love that. While she uses this ""trope"" in every book she writes, whether it is this new contemporary series, or her many historicals, this never gets old with me.There is a love scene in this book that was truly one of the most beautiful ones I've ever read. And there are no ""f"" words...or that horrible ""c"" word either. It's hotter than heck, and beautifully erotic, with no ""bad"" words. Whew...almost melted my iPad.While we can worry if things will work out, we also know they will. One of the reasons why I read this author. Her foray into contemporary romance is a brilliant one. And the teaser she shares of the third book in the series, Kiss Me Hello, has me panting to get my hands on it. Mack is an attorney AND a farrier. Can't get any better than that!I'm reviewing the first novel in the series, A Single Kiss, tomorrow.

"""Amid the ensuring insanity..."" Yep, describes this very well! I laughed, a LOT over this one. It read REAL in the reactions of the towns' people. Scary, but real...and so very funny, too!Mark and Donna are older, but still not old. They have hated each other for years. The only reason they even had anything to do with each other was because of their love for her husband, John, who was also Mike's best friend. John's been dead for a while and the enmity has not eased. Now they just don't need to see each other because of him.Then some vans roll through town and up to the local home school family's home. The government? The law? ALIENS? And there go the rumors. Mark and Donna appear to be the only SANE people in the town, so they are deputized to go and find out some facts. This means they have to work together.In so doing more funny, and some sweet, moments enliven their relationship...and love grows as past hurts are laid to rest.This was a very enjoyable read, and the many belly laughs I felt made it more so.

"This one was 1.5 stars for me.I have never bought a book suggested to me at Facebook, until this one. I love shifter books, the price was right, and it was somewhat short, so I tried it. I was disappointed in so many ways with this one.First, the shifter, Lex (and how did they KNOW his name was LEX when he arrived there? It's not like he was wearing a kitty collar) has been in captivity for SEVEN YEARS. He's shifted to human many times, and hasn't left. He's found his true love in Cass. Cass who has been verbally abused and propositioned by the circus owner, has been pawed (no pun intended) as she ""dances"" for the drunks, and who drinks herself into oblivion at least monthly.Lex enters her sexy dreams as a man and tells her they will be free ""soon."" Seems like if he loved her that much they would have left much earlier than SEVEN YEARS.Another thing I had an issue with, once they DO escape, and are on the run, Lex has to decide if he TRUSTS Cass. Really? She's been his love for SEVEN YEARS, they've LIVED together (even if he was a lion MOST of the time) and he doesn't trust her yet? That just seemed weird.Of course not every book was written for every reader, and this one, with its many glowing reviews, was not for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U904MIL6ZLO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1XYVD6#wasThisHelpful","R1U904MIL6ZLO6","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this. It's that simple. I simply loved it. I realize Christmas was last week, but you can start your 2015 Christmas reading with this one. Or it might extend your 2014 Christmas Glow if you read it now!Lindsey likes Christmas, mostly, but she feels stressed, too. So much to do, so little time. I found myself thinking that Ms. Donovan must have been in MY HOME, taking notes, when I read some of the moments in this book. Christmas cards! They tend to STARE at me for ages and I find, just like Lindsey, that I keep putting them off. When she makes her famous fudge, she uses SIXTEEN marshmallows, not 15 and not 17. I have a cousin that uses 30 graham crackers for her cheese cake. Not 29 and certainly not 31! Yes, I laughed. I loved that Lindsey couldn't tell if she liked roasted chestnuts, even after eating an entire bag of them. I feel the same. Yes, there was a lot of ME in this book.One evening she's watching a very old version of Scrooge, and really enjoying what Fred looks like, when there's a knock on her door. She thinks she might be nuts when FRED is on the other side. The same Fred from the very old movie. Really, she has to be dreaming, right? When he says he's been sent from Headquarters to help her enjoy Christmas, she knows she's delusional.There's a bit of paranormal here as we don't know exactly what, or who, Fred is.  The joy is watching them both find out about each other.While I have marked this inspirational, it certainly doesn't beat one over the head with it. This line gave me warm fuzzies, as it's what I believe, too:""People come and go, they get older, move, have children. There's only one constant in all of Christmas."" He nodded toward the nativity scene a few feet away. ""And that's reason enough to rejoice.""Yes, I loved this. The ending was sweet and suited the book very well. Now, I want a Fred for each of my two unmarried daughters!AND...I'm going to find more from this author.

"I've been looking forward to this one since I read Stop Dragon My Heart Around. We met Darius and Mei then, and I knew there were going to be some fireworks. SHE really does not want to give into the bond they have forming between them. She has some major issues in the way of a really bad past and she doesn't want to drag Darius into it.For his part, Darius' dragon is waning. They've found their mate, Mei, but if she won't accept the bond, his dragon is toast.Unlike a couple dragon shifter books I've read recently, we get to spend quite a bit of time with these dragons as they've shifted. We are with them as they fly, as they drool over their gems (Mei's got hers locked in a cage at the bottom of a lake), and as they fight. I loved that about this series.I was a bit confused when Mei nearly attacks this chippy that smelled of Darius. We know he used her to try and make Mei jealous, but that was ages ago...why would she still smell like him? Especially since they didn't actually do anything.I loved how they wanted to protect each other, once they've given in to the fact they DO belong together. They have quite a few obstacles to overcome, though.All in all, a lot of fun and I can only want more in this series.Thank you, Ms. Scott and Entangled, for the opportunity to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S10BBWKJUVY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1ZIYLK#wasThisHelpful","R3S10BBWKJUVY0","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this one was intense. From the first moment we realize what Seventeen has lost, to her escape with a man who might be just using her, to her decision to search for the truth, this is one rough journey.Ms. Hoyle has built a future world that has moments of shining beauty...and monsters come to life that once were only in our nightmares.Seventeen has been bred and raised to give the fruits of her womb to the Unified World Order. She's a Breeder, and that's her only job. Until something happens and despair trickled into her perfect world. She's not even sure why she feels this way.Suddenly a man offers to help her. He says his name is Pax and he asks her for her name. She answers, Pria. He has to be a dream, but then the nightmare becomes truth and there's a death order on Seventeen's head. Escape is the only way for Pria to live.Freedom is scary, but fills her with something that she finds she longed for. She still wonders if she can trust Pax, but it seems like the right thing to do as they search for a home.Home comes with a cost and Pria has to decide if it's worth it.I really think I need to add a warning here. Not sure how to word it without spoiling anything. Here goes: There are some deaths here that affected me greatly. I'd actually put the tag ""horror"" on the book, as I was pretty horrified at some points. Don't get me wrong, this book is good, great even...and I want the next one now. And if I could get the third and final book the moment after I read the last page of book two, Criminal, then that would be even better.

"This is a sweet little romance. The kind where you settle in next to the fireplace with a cup of cocoa with whipped cream and read until it's done.Kate has been secretly in love with her co-worker Brian for three years. She's finally going to tell him. But before she can gets the words out, he announces that he's heading to Vegas to marry his high school sweetheart. Kate is shocked. Then she decides to just fly there and stop the wedding. That is the extent of her plan.With a shout, she interrupts the wedding...and then realizes Brian is not the groom. You'd think the groom would be pretty upset that his bride just walked out, but he's not. He quickly asks Kate to help him out. He needs to be married by the time he's thirty, and that's two days away.Kate figures she missed Brian's wedding, she's not really happy with her life, and she has a pile of debt to pay down, due to the medical bills she accrued while trying to help her grandmother. So...she says yes, she'll marry the groom, Chad, in exchange for a cool million. Why not, right?Chad doesn't tell Kate everything, and she keeps being surprised. First by the paparazzi, then when they meet his parents, and the fact that Brian not might be as married as she thought he was.This story is very much like a Harlequin. That's praise, by the way! You know when you pick one up you are in for an hour of two of romance and an HEA. That's what we get here and I did enjoy it. BTW, I really liked Chad's dad, Hank!I'll be looking for more from Ms. Williams in the future.*Thank you, NetGalley and TWCS, for the opportunity to read this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPXN5L682UIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCEH4SU#wasThisHelpful","R3RPXN5L682UIA","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catherine is something else. She's certainly no lady, at least she doesn't act like one! Nick, the Duke, knows how ladies should act, and none of the ones he's met ever had a cutlass in their skirt.She's pretty intriguing that way. He never knows what she's going to do next. Catherine really tries to be the perfect lady, but she slips every now and then. She takes her shoes off every chance she gets! She's also been known to slip in through a window. Yes, definitely not a lady. She makes an offer on her ancestral home,that he has bought and refurbished, and he refuses. After seeing the cutlass, Nick makes a wager. If she gets a marriage proposal from an upstanding member of the ton, he'll let her have the estate.These two dance around their urges over and over again. That's always fun to read...wondering which will fall first! He keeps saving her from committing an unforgivable faux pas while in public, and he's hard pressed to keep her reputation from falling into tatters.Besides trying to earn a proposal that will win her the wager, Catherine is searching for a pink diamond tiara that is supposedly hidden in the manor. Unfortunately someone else is also searching, and Catherine is in danger.There was a nice balance of mystery, suspense, and some intense UST in this one.

"This is the last book in the Dark Protectors' Series by Ms. Zanetti. I could hardly wait to read Janie and Zane's story. We've been seeing bits and pieces of it throughout the series and this book is the climax the arc. And what a climax it was! We got to see all the characters from the previous books. Everyone had a role to fill, and they did it marvelously.While I had my guess about who, and what, Zane would be, Ms. Zanetti kept the twists and turns coming. This was one continuous adventure. I am very impressed how she tied things up. I was left feeling satisfied, especially with all the little insights into our favorite couples the epilogue gave us. And then she gave us a hint for maybe another book later on! Ah, good times.There was humor, pages of intensity, moments of joy, paragraphs of fear...and it was all twisted up in a wonderful reading package. I read it in one sitting. Yes, it was that good. We have all been waiting for the culmination of the story, and it was worth the wait.But then she was mean. After the end of Marked, she gives us a teaser for her next series, The Realm Enforcers.

"Wow...Kai. Yeah...Kai is pretty hot and he's what gives this book the tag: Steamy. The cover really shows him off, don't you think?Kate really doesn't stand a chance against his heat. She's just run from her ex-fiance. He's a total jerk. She's moved to the other side of the world to get a fresh start. And there are men nearly everywhere. Well, not at the all girls' school where she teaches, but definitely everywhere else. She's not sure she wants to jump back into the pool, but she's really enjoying looking at all that man-candy.Kai wanders through and she just has to give in to temptation. And she's happy she did. And we the readers are happy, too!There are some stumbling blocks to an HEA in the form of culture issues. Ms. Alam lived in Dubai and writes with expertise on the differences. Made for some very intriguing tidbits.This is the first in a trilogy, but she leaves us in a *mostly* good place and the next book is due out soon.I suggest that if you are looking for a steamy read to keep you warm during this cold December days, do give Pretty Hot a chance!*Time to be honest, I was the editor for this one, and an honor it was, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LA475QPF9E2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q9NMV0O#wasThisHelpful","R6LA475QPF9E2","A1OSTZR835O0MI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OSTZR835O0MI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was glad I baked a few test cupcakes in these cupcake cups before baking the majority of my batch.  My son's 5th birthday was to be celebrated at school with these cupcakes.I think someone else mentioned that the cups ""darken"" upon use.  Understatement.  After cooking the test-batch, the images on the sides of the cupcakes were essentially unviewable (we were making chocolate cupcakes).  I resorted to baking my full batch of cupcakes in foil-paper cups, then once they were done, I inserted the cooked cupcakes into the robot cupcake cups resulting in double-ply cupcakes, not ideal but ok for my purposes.

"One of the things that has gotten my husband and me through the last five years (our son turns 5 years old in 20 minutes) is our shared misery.  We both break out in hives when we see people out in public who have a very small baby, or worse, a woman who is in the late part of pregnancy.  We both have ""you couldn't pay me enough to be back in that phase"" running through our brains.  For us, parenting has been terrible.  We have a highly challenging little boy who is only now, within the last few months, someone we actually want to be around.What's hard in a situation like ours is, we feel like terrible people, freaks.  None of our friends with small children seem to have suffered as we have.  Facebook statuses full of joyous tales...photos of families smiling and enjoying a wholesome hike in the wilderness...posts from their parents-only trips to Hawaii...we have felt alone in being super bummed out by parenthood.Enter this book.  Senior makes it clear that we are way more normal than we'd thought.  Lots of statistics supporting the idea that having a kid depletes just about everyone's ability to enjoy your life, your spouse, intimacy, your everything.Which was reassuring.  I stopped feeling like we're awful, but then I felt sad that everyone is, apparently, whitewashing their experiences as parents.

"I agree 100% that it's a great idea to get kids involved in preparing healthier choices to consume, and this book does aid in that chore.  However there are lots of unhealthful ingredients in these recipes including lots of sugar.  I don't object to some sugar -- I'm not a health food freak by any means -- but it seems counterproductive to the book's mission, which is ""get kids off sugar and unhealthy fats and junk food in general"".  I agree that a fruit and milk-based shake is more healthy than a Twinkie, even if the shake does have added sugar.  It's just that many of the recipes in this book are more like healthier desserts than they are healthy diet choices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OLZHRQT21MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP3ZVPM#wasThisHelpful","R28OLZHRQT21MG","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This building set is good with lots of potential.  I have to say that the instruction book models are hard to assemble in just exactly the right way so that they function properly.  Unlike LEGO, these pieces can be assembled in what you THINK is a proper fashion, but if they're off just a tiny bit, gears won't mesh or wheels won't align or etc etc.It's a good toy, and I think there's a ton of potential for an imagination-filled child, but it's nowhere near perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ARSCBBZ9310/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TXM84Y#wasThisHelpful","R36ARSCBBZ9310","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What was nice about this was that the pieces used to build the model are translucent and various colors.  You don't see much of that in LEGO kits.  You also don't see the light-up feature in LEGO kits that's prominent here.However.  The instructions with this kit  are very inferior compared to LEGO, and also the pieces don't stay together.  If you have a younger LEGO enthusiast (mine is 4, almost 5, and extremely literate in LEGO kits), they're bound to become frustrated with this kit.

"My almost-5-year-old received this from his grandmother as an early Christmas present. He was really anxious for this toy, having just gained an interest in Switch and Go Dinos after seeing a TV commercial. So far, he has definitely had fun with it, I'm not going to lie. BUT.I pulled it out of the box while he was in school so as to familiarize myself with its workings. I'm a smart gal but the instruction book had me flummoxed. I thought it was worded horribly unclearly. The instruction booklet is so tiny that the very intricate diagram was unintelligible to me. Add to that, the instructions only describe how to go from a vehicle to a t-rex (the reverse instruction is limited to ""do these steps in reverse to go the other direction""). When I pulled the toy out of the box, it was in neither formation, but rather somewhere in between, further complicating matters. I gave up.My husband, who is literally a rocket scientist, was ultimately able to get it figured out (but not without sharing my feeling that the instructions included are deplorable) and train me on how to use it so I could be helpful with my son.Once my son had the toy in hand, the fun as well as the frustration began. He caught on pretty quickly as far as transforming the toy, but it's the voice commands that are a mess. The toy has a lot of trouble recognizing what is being said to it. You have to talk extremely clearly at exactly the right volume and cadence for it to understand you properly. This has held true whether it is an adult speaking, or the child. The toy seems to respond better to lower registers but yeah, my four-year-old isn't exactly a baritone yet. Thank HEAVENS the one command it seems to understand pretty much every time is ""fire the drill!"" which is probably the one main reason my kid wanted the toy to begin with.Another thing that I understand, but which is super dumb, is that before EACH and EVERY vocal command you give, you have to first ""get the dino's attention"" by saying ""Hello, T-Rex!"" (or ""Hello, truck driver!"" if it's in crane mode). That gets old right-quick.I was sent here to amazon to write this review by my husband, who urged me to title the review ""ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS TOY"", because he is so disgusted by the failure of performance. I'm not quite that negative on the toy, because it's pretty nifty when it does work well, and when it does work well, my son is in heaven.This phase of loving SnGDs and Transformers can't end soon enough, I'll tell you that much!EDIT: OK well that didn't last long. My son was repeatedly frustrated by the performance of this toy so much so that it drove him to some of the worst tantrums he has had in months. He just turned into a broken mess of frustration and it was very hard for us to deal with so we had to put the toy in the basement. And then we had the joy of the tantrum that resulted after that, so it's been a very long day for us. Always nice when your child says to you, ""You broke my heart.""UPDATE UPDATE ONE MONTH LATER:  So we've had this thing for like a month now.  After having removed it from the scene per my review above, we gradually reintroduced it for brief practice periods.  Here is some of what we've learned.  To improve the performance of the voice recognition feature, it helps to pause a beat, or two beats, after the toy says ""tell me what to do!"".  If you immediately blurt out your command, as kids are wont to do, the toy isn't able to ""listen"" yet.  If the toy is unresponsive to your first attempt, ask a second time before the toy gives up and says ""We'll try again later.""  At this point, I'd say we're up to about 80% success if we are extremely careful in how we interact verbally with the toy.  I liken talking to this toy to when I have to attend an extended family Thanksgiving meal.  You have to be very careful how, and what, you say.That we've been able to achieve better results with performance does not soften my feelings toward this toy.  It's really more of a novelty than what I think of as a true toy.  It is so clunky to transform due to its size, my kid hardly ever wants to deal with that process.  He has been enjoying the voice recognition feature in recent days since we've gotten it to work better, but it's not really like he's ""playing"".I add a new criticism with this update, too, which is that the things the T Rex says when you issue the command, ""teach me something!"" are queued rather than randomized.  So, if you say ""teach me something"", he tells you something about the size of his teeth.  If you then ask him again, ""teach me something"", he'll tell you a second piece of info about T Rexes.  Ask him a third time in succession, and you'll learn a third thing.  But you only get to hear new information about the dino if you continue to issue the same command repeatedly without intermixing any of the other commands.  If you do interject a different command and then go back to ""teach me something!"", you'll be taken back to the front of the queue, the tooth thing.  No kid is going to repeatedly issue the same command so as to hear all of the many different educational statements buried in the microchip.  It's too bad because the educational component of these toys is really the only part of them that is redeeming.A similar-ish complaint:  The command ""Go Wild!"" only has 3 different responses from the dino, and I think the same is true of ""Make me laugh!"" which has the dino telling jokes.  Why only 3, and why not randomized?  I would think that it'd be easy peasy to include tons of randomized verbal responses without increasing the production cost of the toy.I do continue to believe that these Switch and Go Dinos may indeed be decent toys for kids who are really into creating imaginative scenarios, like the same kids who can play for hours on end with action figures.  Then again, a rubber dinosaur from the dollar section at Target should be just as good for that child.  But my kid, like a lot of kids, isn't often like that.  So again, this is why I give the rating I do.  I try to rate fairly based on the stated function of the toy as well as what its successes/failings are given what kind of kid I have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8H4BQE5HUNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMNX2IA#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8H4BQE5HUNV","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My almost-5-year-old son received one of these as a reward for filling up a good behavior chart. He was absolutely ravenous for one after having seen a commercial on TV.We had one blissful day around here with him occupied with it pretty much constantly. Dinosaur, car, dinosaur, car, dinosaur, car. The sound effects are fine, not too annoying, not too loud.  My son actually chooses to have the sounds turned off entirely.After that one blissful day, my son has barely given this toy a second glance. There've been one or two little spurts of interest, and actually last night he concocted a Godzilla-like scenario using this toy that was pretty fun to watch. But by and large, this is not a toy for your child UNLESS your child is very into imaginative scenarios. My son is very interested in the mechanics of this toy, but he is generally not into imaginative play (last night notwithstanding), so for him it's not a toy with any legs to speak of.He has also reported to me that he no longer enjoys the transforming of the toy, because when it's in car mode and you're trying to switch it to dino mode, the snapping upward of the car's hood to transform it to the dino head is very hard to do. I tried it, and he's right. Also, when the toy is in dino mode, it doesn't take much for the head/neck to disengage and retreat halfway back into vehicle mode. This is a design issue, or it's a durability issue, not sure which, but it has caused headaches around here and more headaches, I do not need.Having said all that, for the price amazon's getting for this thing, it's not a horrible buy. It's just sort of meh.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIGWXOIXBRNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AITWSZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3VIGWXOIXBRNF","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Design problems abound with this LEGO kit.  Our family owns literally hundreds of LEGO kits dating from the '70s to present-day and I would say this is among the five most horribly designed kits we've ever built.The fuselage is constantly disintegrating because the primary means of keeping it all connected are two flimsy 1x4 plates.  The cockpit connects to the plane by means of a cross-bar on its aft side which snaps into a clamp.  If you dare to raise or lower the cockpit, as small boys are wont to do, {and I've just had to interrupt writing this review to tend to my son who has become so frustrated with this toy that he is in a complete STATE) you can expect it to come loose.We buy LEGO toys precisely because, unlike so much of the other plastic junk that's on the shelves these days, LEGO toys are typically reliable and work as advertised.

"Dell 5110 is my machine, and the battery that came with it lasted maybe 60 minutes before crapping completely out.  I specified this for my highest priority birthday present, and hubby came through.  It is huge and sticks out of the back of my laptop, but not in a way that impedes me at all.  It is functional much longer than the original battery, but don't expect 5 or 6 hours.  I'd say, oh, maybe 3.5 hours.  Which is FINE.

"I gotta say, something smells a little fishy to me with all of the five-star reviews of this company's products.  Whether it's this 24 piece set or any of its siblings, the reviews are all rave with just about nothing negative included.  Also none of the reviews are Amazon Verified Purchases which makes me strongly suspect there are shills among us.The truth is, these toys are quite shoddy in my opinion.  My four-year old boy selected this toy at the locally-owned mom n pop toy store, Timbuk Toys.  We got it home and it was immediately apparent there is a quality void.  The track pieces are cheap-feeling waxy plastic.  The ""includes one car!"" car has to be assembled (no instructions, no image on the box to figure out out) and it's of lower quality than something you would get as a cereal box prize.  More of that flimsy waxy plastic.The components are cheap, and the design is poor as well.  The box boasts ""more than 1000 track combinations!"" and I suppose that could be true.  But surely the number of track combinations that make functional tracks for a real kid to really play with are few.  In any event, the instructions included show but one lonely layout.  The instructions themselves are understandable if a little weird.  Once complete, the track layout is in the first place unstable and in the second place it is out of scale with the included vehicle.  The turns are way too tight for 1:64 scale vehicles (ie Hot Wheels).What I do like about this toy is that the connectors work well.  Also the track pieces can be connected not only end-to-end, but they also have connector ports on their lateral sides which is sort of an interesting idea.I'm just sayin.  Read the other reviews with a critical frame of mind because they are not at all reflective of what our experience was.  The one review that claimed these are better than Legos immediately provoked shill suspicion.  This toy matches Lego quality and versatility on absolutely no level.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKJTMFKN0ZR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UL4GJG#wasThisHelpful","RAKJTMFKN0ZR2","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am the parent of a 4.5 year old boy.  He is an only child.  He has always been prone to negativity and it has been hard on the household, dealing with that day after day since he was a baby.  A friend recommended this book as a teaching tool to help him understand better how his behavior and attitude affects people around him.I'm pretty lukewarm on this book.  Some sections do a good job communicating this theme.  My son really likes the book.Here's where I think the book is very unsuccessful:  a whole lotta things get done by various characters in this book that are highly ""bucket emptying"" kinds of behaviors, but they go unacknowledged while every tiny thing Felix, the main character, does is either shamed or praised for its emptying or filling of buckets.  There are two main examples of this:- On the first page, Felix is nasty to his sister, who has asked nicely to play blocks with him.  On the next two pages, she pleads her case, ""I'll be careful"" etc.  Felix responds nastily to her and she responds by kicking over his block tower, blocks flying everywhere and the onomatopoeia ""THWACK!"" shown above her violent reaction.  Turn the page to see Felix summoning Grandpa.When Grandpa arrives on the scene, he is shown consoling...who?  Felix, whose block tower was just destroyed by an outright naughty behavior of the sister?  No.  Grandpa is picking up sister for a snuggle and bitching out Felix for ""dipping from your sister's bucket.""  Felix is in trouble for being nasty on the first two pages, but sister is being cuddled despite her far-greater-sin act of aggression.  It doesn't make any sense at all and I think it can really confuse the message for a small child whose parents are reading him this book. Grandpa should at least have said ""Your sister should not have destroyed your tower, but the problem started when you dipped from her bucket"" or something similar.- 2nd example: Felix takes the bucket analogy to heart while he's at school, experiencing both the hurt of having his bucket emptied by kids who tease him as well as the joy of having it filled by people being nice to him/him being nice to others.  Fine.  But when he gets home from school and sees the family dog has torn apart his sister's doll,  what goes through his mind?  "" 'Bad dog!' he almost scolded.  But then he thought maybe dogs have buckets too.""  What?  Having a bucket means there are no consequences for bad behavior?  Not that I think it's the child's job to scold the family pet, but the message conveyed is ""if punishment is meted out for bad behavior, that's wrong because it empties the guilty party's bucket.""I just find the message that is intended by this book is lost in its faulty logic and can ultimately just be confusing to a small child.There are two or three really great on-point pages that are good at illustrating the concept, so it's not a total mess but it's seriously flawed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAG774C68XFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595620273#wasThisHelpful","R3UAG774C68XFK","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seems like perforation is the standard these days in activity and coloring books, and I was super disappointed to discover these pages weren't perforated.

"We have dozens of LEGO kits that my 4 year old boy can assemble independently, usually 100% independently.  This product drew our attention at the toy store because it's a sizeable kit of a monster truck and is supposedly ""motorized"".Where to start.  Every 5 seconds with the assembly of this kit, my kid had to stop and fall apart with the frustration of poor fittings on these bricks.  Or he'd get something assembled right and it'd literally just disintegrate into chunks.  When we FINALLY got it together, we gingerly carried it to our hardwood floor to try out the ""motor!"" which by the way is a pull-back motor, not a battery operated one, and it didn't work.  We wound that truck up by pulling it back, and then it sputtered forward less than one inch.Also the wheels just fall off.  Just off.This is so going back to the store tomorrow.UPDATE:  Later in the day, we saw that the wheels have to be put on in a very particular and fussy way, but if you're able to figure it out and get them on right, they do stay on.  Also the pull-back function does work, kinda.This toy still pales when compared to real LEGO kits but it's not as bad as originally thought.SECOND UPDATE:  My kid played with this just a little bit more and somehow just by rolling the thing around on the hardwood, the axles broke.

"We bought this for our 4-year old boy for when we were travelling.  It's so easy to transport and seemed like it has enough variability that it'd be a great toy for keeping his attention in the otherwise boring hotel room.  Well LOL it didn't really work out that well initially, and he ran amuck as usual in the hotel room.In the subsequent months, we would just pull this one out of storage periodically and each time we do, it's been a HUGE hit.  The boy will play with it (assuming he has a willing playmate) endlessly.  This past weekend, it was his primary plaything for 2.5 straight days.I don't have any complaint with the quality, as some have mentioned.  We have other play food, both plastic and metal, and the felt is by FAR the easiest to really work with. Yes hair sticks to it, and yes it's all more or less stuff you could make yourself if you had the energy, but for the thirteen bucks they charge for it, I think it's a bargain.For us, the success of this toy, like so many other toys, revolves around our keeping it out of the rotation most of the time to keep it fresh.

"We bought one of these so that we could easily making single servings of ice cream for our little boy.  My husband and I aren't big ice cream folks so we don't like using the freezer space to store ice cream.  Also with this machine, there's never a meltdown because we've run out of ice cream.  As long as you have 3 simple ingredients in the house,  you've got ice cream.What I like about it:The bowl isn't huge and isn't much of an inconvenience in the freezer.Super easy to whip up one serving of ice cream.Saves money.  I think it's about 40 cents a serving.What I don't care for:None of the recipes I tried have worked except chocolate.  You're supposed to be able to dump yogurt into this thing and have it turn into froyo but it simply didn't work for me.It's a little hard to get clean because I assume you're not supposed to submerge the knob section which holds the batteries.Batteries don't last as long as the instructions indicate they will.The instructions should be super simple but I found they complicated the process due to being so horribly worded.Things you should know:1.  If you use reduced-fat or fat-free ingredients, the machine works much less well.  Reduced fat/fat-free means higher water content, so when you pour your mixture into the frozen bowl, the more watery mixture starts instantly freezing onto the wall of the bowl.  Then the agitator is unable to spin as well as it should, and then the agitator and lid start rising off the bowl as the frozen-to-the-walls product gets larger/thicker, creating less room within the bowl for the agitator to work.2.  The colder your mixture is before you pour it into the bowl, the better your outcome will be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YE96TIDDHTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R4NE5E#wasThisHelpful","R9YE96TIDDHTW","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Two things to note about the source of frustration: one is that the lenticular feature can make it hard to identify where the pieces go.

"I have a little boy who is 4 1/2 years old.  I would say his level of interest in this toy is sort of neutral.  Obviously he loved it initially because they love anything *new* at this age.  He had some trouble with the effects but not with the general act of taking pictures.Also he is a child like so many others who doesn't want a TOY, he wants the real thing.  Your kid *will know* this is a product for kids, so if they turn up their noses at kid-versions of adult stuff, you'll wanna pass.  For this amount of money, he really could have a real digital camera of his own.  The projector works decently, which sets this item apart from a digital camera, but you need to be in a really dark place.This toy does seem well-made (especially for Playskool - I have rarely had good things to say about Playskool stuff) and if your kid is super-interested in photography, it might be a good purchase.

"We use this product for hard water stains (soft water stains, maybe?  I don't know) that have accrued over the last few years.  We'd tried a few other Clorox/Tilex type products to little or no avail.""Kaboom"", as it is hilariously named, does work.  Does it work, like, KABOOM! fast? No, no it does not.  Kaboom is the opposite of how fast it works.  I am using it all over my left-side shower door, sort of evenly, for the last few months.  Then on the right shower door, I'm just using it on a like six-inch diamater circular spot to really be able to see how well it's working as against the rest of the filthy right shower door.Hard to tell on the left side, since I'm gradually cleaning this door in its entirety.  On the right side, yes, you can see that the spot I've been working for three or four weeks is definitely cleaner than the surrounding surface.I am glad I bought it, since nothing else seemed to dissolve the water stains at all.  BUT:  don't expect it to work in one douse.  No way will it make even a tiny difference if you have ""tough stains"".Also:  the color-changing business is malarkey.  It sprays on a sort of periwinkle blue and changes to white in 40 to 60 seconds regardless of the dirtiness of the surface.ODOR:  I am not sure what everyone is complaining about.  The Clorox/Tilex products I've used in the past have just about sent me to the hospital with their fumes, but I barely even notice an odor with this stuff.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35X9UV8HFAM3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IX0QK0#wasThisHelpful","R35X9UV8HFAM3G","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stories on CD are big in our house.  My four-year-old boy has been listening to stories on CD since he was about 2.  He does so while playing quiet activities in the play room.  It is a very calming experience for him, it seems, and after he has heard any given CD a few times, he really starts enjoying them even more due to being familiar with what's happening in the story.This Uncle Wiggily one may be the best one of our many that we own.  Uncle Wiggily stories only came into my awareness recently as I read Uncle Wiggily Bedtime Stories: In Easy-to-Read Type (Dover Children's Thrift Classics) to my son a few months ago.  The stories are ideal for four-year olds who are moving beyond picture books.  They are whimsical and sweet without much dark or negative content (stories where characters face great peril are still too much of a challenge for this age group).  The language used in these stories is neither too babyish nor too adult.  I long to read Winnie the Pooh stories to my boy but the language is a little too winky and wry for this age.So, start with fantastic content in the stories themselves, and then record them with a fantastic reader, and that's what you have here.  My only complaint is that there isn't a series of these CDs; there are hundreds and hundreds of Uncle Wiggily stories that are all in the public domain so please put some more of them on audio!For reference, here are the other stories on CD that have been well-loved in our house:Frog and Toad CD Audio Collection (I Can Read! - Level 2)  <-- that one especiallyFrances Audio Collection CD (I Can Read Book 2)The Mouse Tales CD Audio Collection (I Can Read! - Level 2)Arnold Lobel Audio Collection CD","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWNT8TAKU3MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1882513800#wasThisHelpful","R3KWNT8TAKU3MR","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The critical info you need when reading a toy review:A)  How old is the child using the toy?  My boy is just shy of his 4th birthday.  B)  Kids always love every toy when it's new - how has this one stood up with the passage of time?  Sorry - we've only had this puzzle for one day so I can't comment on its ""legs"".Usually I wait a while to write toy reviews because a parent can be misled by the child's initial reaction to a toy.  This puzzle, though, is so great that I felt moved to write a review after one day's play.

"What can you say.  Ravensburger puzzles and games are always way better quality than the stuff you see in the toy aisle at a big-box store.  This one is no exception.  The tin is great for holding the pieces and the image of the various engines watching a fireworks show is handsome and fun.I think the price for a 35-piece puzzle is very high.  My 3-year old boy has ""memorized"", for lack of a better word, this puzzle after only two iterations so it doesn't seem like it will be a toy with a lot of legs.  All puzzles with this few pieces are prone to this problem, but that's why their costs really shouldn't be this high.One thing I absolutely love is that the pieces arrived within the tin, and within a plastic bag that also contained a silica packet to absorb any moisture.  So many preschooler puzzles that have large pieces are prone to having warped pieces which essentially makes them garbage.  34 of the 35 pieces were perfectly flat which was nice.I am loyal to Ravensburger overall but the price is a rubbing point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3VOC88CA2PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R6AFLK#wasThisHelpful","R1S3VOC88CA2PO","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's good about this toy:1.  It is adorable.2.  The tracks are compatible with the common Thomas tracks made by Learning Curve.3.  It is a good size for people who, like us, did not want to invest in a huge train table arrangement.  Because my boy (almost 4 years old) tends to lose interest pretty quickly in any of these train sets, it's nice to be able to just pull it out occasionally, play for a day or two, and then load it all back up into the bag where we keep the components.What I like less about it:1.  Agreeing completely with the other reviewer about the scale issues.  The size of the wheels relative to the size of the train bodies is off, making them unstable on the tracks.  Even the smaller Thomas/Learning Curve train cars derail easily and the problem is even worse with these larger cars.2.  Personally I think the plastic bodies of the trains feel cheap, especially when you compare them to the wooden trains in the Thomas/Learning Curve set.3.  It's just not terribly fun for a very long period of time.If you're trying to decide between this set and the Thomas set, I would say the Thomas set wins for overall quality and functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VA4CGFOXZSP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QSX4RI#wasThisHelpful","R2VA4CGFOXZSP0","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This puzzle features really cute sea animals doing various silly things.PROS:- It is cute.- It is really sturdy for a cardboard puzzle.- Fun to try and find all the ""hidden"" numbers and letters.- The 3D component was pretty fun.CONS:- This is probably only a con if your child is 3 (the lowest recommended age for this toy).  The puzzle is irregularly shaped so it is very tricky for a child this age to correctly identify which pieces are ""edge pieces"".  In our house, this means that the grown-ups have to heavily assist with the construction of the frame, and then Little One can take over to finish the innards.  Not a big deal but typically we like puzzles to be one of the things the child does independently.- I didn't personally feel the 3D effect was very noticeable or stark.- The packaging was a DRAG.  The 3D glasses come contained inside a plastic bubble that is affixed to the front of the box, where the puzzle image is.  If you remove the glasses by cutting off the plastic bubble thing, you rip off part of the image.  There is an opening within the box where you can wrestle out the glasses from the inside, but then you're left with the empty plastic bubble on the front of the box obscuring the puzzle image.  There really isn't any good large puzzle image to study when you're assembling the puzzle.  You have to work off of the smaller one on the back (which is also partly obscured by some graphics) or the tiny image on the spine of the box.  I found this a big bummer.  I've always taught my kid to study the box image when he needs help figuring out what he's doing during puzzle assembly and he really can't with this one.EDIT:After three or four go-rounds with Mom and Dad, the boy started to be able to manage the puzzle entirely on his own, so don't fret so much about the irregular shape.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJJ6UB3D3IOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BLQG4O#wasThisHelpful","R3CJJ6UB3D3IOD","A2I3TKKHF6INI6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I3TKKHF6INI6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He is a capable writer and I especially appreciate his ability to avoid bogging down in tedious statistics.  Every now and then (as with the chapter about chess) you feel like he's meandering a little too much but then the problem resolves before it gets aggravating.I will say that the although this discussion of character education is very interesting, at the same time the content seemed to me to be dressed-up common sense.  It shouldn't be any surprise that being a hard worker, tenacious, patient, resilient, etc etc, will lead to success.

" 2:08 MinsThis time of year is my favorite time of the year. It reminds me of spending time with my family near and far.I have always loved personalized ornament’s, or unique ones. I don’t like the glass/plastic balls that you can pick up just about everywhere. I like ones that my boys pick out or make.When my husband ETS’s from the ARMY, we had decided that it was a fresh start and would only be taking what we needed to take back to his home state of Texas.We have been rebuilding our collection since 2012. I have to say that I am very happy to be adding this bell to our collection!I have to say it is a bit bigger than I originally thought it was gonna be but I actually like it this way.I love that the 2015 is like engraved into the bell. I don’t have to worry about the year coming off later on down the road.There is plenty of space to have this engraved and you could engrave so many different things• Our first Christmas• Baby’s first Christmas• Family last name• Family member’s names• So much more.Now when you shake it you will hear a bell. My oldest son made the comment that it sounded like the bell from Polar Express.Overall I have to say I love the price and the quality of this bell.I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

" 2:31 MinsI love to cook; it brings fond memories of my childhood.I can never ever have too many cooking utensils in my home. I swear I have to have something within arm’s reach in my kitchen at all times.So I do think that these are more of a darker pink than the lighter pink that they are in person. This has nothing to do with the quality of them just more of a thought for process.I have twisted and pulled on these and they have held up so far and seem to be doing great. I have washed them in my dishwasher several times already and they are holding up great.The slotted spatula is one of my favorite so far because it actually is really sturdy and great for flipping pancakes.There are four spatulas that come with this set are great as well, two are the same size, the other two are smaller with one of them having a thicker back.Lastly there is a spoon that comes with this set. I used that just this afternoon for my boy’s mac and cheese.Overall these are great and I know that they will last a long time for me.I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

" 2:12 MinsKids are going to swoon over this.  I do have to say that this train is LOUD, really loud. So if you have kidos with sensitive ears.My toy had the wires switched, the off is on and the on is off, I got the scare of my life putting the batteries in, I really did jump but it was fun at the same time.All the flashing lights and sounds draw you in, I swear I could get lost watching this for hours, I can only imagine how the kids will react to this. I love that the colors change and it’s not all the same old same old lights all the time.I do want to mention that there is a cap over the wheels that if you do not remove it your train will not move. Another thing that I link about this train is that if it bumps into anything it will change directions and keep going.Overall I can see this being hours of fun for kids.

" 2:44 MinsMy oldest son is scared of the dark, BIG TIME. He has been scared for years, while I have always tried to make things comfortable for him sometimes it is hard. Like in my house now, the bathroom closest to my son’s room happens to be down a hall that if I were to leave a light on for him would shine right into my bedroom right in my eyes, that is a no go for me.We have tried tap lights but they just don’t seem to work that well.There are three settings for this light. ON, OFF and AUTO.So I do have to admit that at first I did have a little hiccup with the light. I thought it was broken lol. BUT I figured out why the auto setting was not working…. My light was on overhead, this light needs there to be little to no light on when it is in that auto setting. This actually works out perfectly because it kicks on in the hall right as my son comes out of his room and lights the hall enough that he can make it to the bathroom without freaking out.The light is actually surprisingly bright. I really do like that it is this bright because it makes the hallway less scary for my son. It would be great to place this in a closet where you may not have any light or any place really.If you needed to you could leave it on all the time but I know that it would eat batteries like crazy (it takes 3 AA batteries NOT INCLUDED), to install the batteries you just have to slide off the back. Its rather easy to slide it off, I actually think that my son could do it.It comes with TWO 3M mounting pieces. Since we are renting this house I think I will set it on a shelf for now, also I have very textured walls that hate sticky tabs.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

" 8:02 MinsOh my can we say cuteness overload! This is just tooo cute for words.Talk about a little kids dream toy. You can tell that a lot of time and effort went into this toy. The details in the stickers, the clock, the food and just about everything is just amazing. I really have to say that I am very impressed.So let’s start that this is more than a toy, it has three different functions. It works as a step stool, a seat and a play kitchen. It also has a handle on the top so that your little one can carry it with them.  There is a latch on the front that will keep it closed when you want it to be.When you have it set up as a play kitchen it has a piece that will be the range. It has two burners with functional knobs that turn. When you turn the knobs the red center of the burner lights up and it will make sounds of food cooking (at least to me that’s what it sounds like).  Under that is what I would call a well, inside that is where you will find all the little parts and pieces that snap into place to make this play kitchen come alive. There is a little orange basket like piece that will snap into the lid/back of the play kitchen. Then there is a little blue piece that I think is either the range hood or a window valance I’m not too sure but it’s just as cute as the rest.  There is an another blue piece that has little hooks on it, conveniently this will hold the utensil’s and the spatula. There is a pot and a skillet, both come with lids. Then there are 4 plates, two yellow and two blue. There are two pink cups.Now onto the food, wow the details in the food. The orange has little dimples just like a real orange. The carrot has the little groves that a real carrot has. The apple is so cute. The lettuce you can see the leaves and the ripples in those leaves. There is an egg that is fried and one still in a shell.There are two white pieces that clip onto the side one to be a counter space and one to be a sink with the faucet.The designs on the outside of the play kitchen/stool are so cute. With little music notes, hearts, stars and dots.Overall this is a really cute toy and will make your little one so happy to have it to play with.

" 2:33 MinsSo this blackhead removal kit comes in a nice leather case. There are 5 different tools in it, each held securely in its own spot. Each tool is two sided.  The tools are stainless steel which makes for easy sterilization.Now here comes the not so nice part. This is my first set of blackhead tools, and with reading the directions I am a little lost. I know that I am a visual learner but I should be able to read directions and get the basic concept.So I figured I would still go forth and try. So my husband breaks out on his back so bad sometimes, due to food allergies, so I figured he would provide enough to be able to test these tools out.Well needless to say he said never again, he said that these hurt so much that he won’t even let me try again. I don’t know if this was because I did something wrong or if the tools are just bad. I wish I could give more clarity but I just can’t.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

" 1:56 MinsMy mom loves her coffee. Ok who am I kidding I would be dead if my mom had to go without it lol. Anyways she loves to collect different coffee cups.I remember a few months ago we were watching tv and she seen a mug that was shaped like a camera lens and she said she had to have it.Well now she will. I think that this year I might actually get a smile out of her, she is the hardest person to shop for.I have to say that the pictures do not do this cup justice. This cup is just so amazing in person. Now I must say that I am no expert but I really thought this looks realistic.I love that the lid screws on so you don’t have to worry about leaks, that makes this cup extra amazing.I does come with a little drawstring bag so you can keep it in there if you choose.This would be a great gift for a photographer, especially one that loves to drink hot liquids, i.e. tea or coffee.Overall I have to say I am very impressed with this cup!I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

"My husband has been through a lot, he is a veteran, and I always tell people that the Army rode him hard and put him away wet, meaning that like other soldiers their idea of looking at a soldier that has a problem, broke leg, sprained ankle, problems with anything else, is to had them Motrin and tell them to walk it off.For years my husband has had knee pain. The VA told him that he needs a J lateral knee brace, we are still waiting on that to be ordered.Most days he had a ton of pain in his knees, his left more than the right. He has tried many braces before and usually after a few minutes he takes them off.I have to say that not only am I surprised by this brace but so is he.It is really easy to put on. It only took him a minute or two while standing outside waiting on our son to get off the bus.He already has been wearing it for a few hours and I have asked him several times how it feels. At first he was like oh it feels great, now he is like oh im still wearing it I can’t tell lol.Overall my husband loves this brace and I am so glad that it is helping him deal with the knee pain and other issues.I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

" 1:36 MinsMy mom told me a few months ago that she wanted to get some Adult coloring books, I have always known that she likes to color.I have to say that there is a lot of different pages in here. They also range from supper easy to oh my how do I do this. Which is good for my mom, it gives some that are easy and something to challenge her all in one book.There are 33 different coloring pages in this book. I feel that the price (at the time of this review $9.43) is well worth it for this book. I have seen other adult coloring books in the stores for around $25.00 with just about the same amount of pages.The paper quality in this book is better than I expected. It is sturdy and not easy to tear.The only thing that I have to say that I am disappointed by this book is that the pages are not perforated. This can make it harder for some people to color because you have to roll the cover behind the book and that makes it where there is not a flat surface.  This also becomes a problem for some of the designs. They seem to run into the binding a little bit and so it seems to be a waste.I have to say though I am a little excited about seeing my mom’s face when I give this to her.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

"My husband and I were able to upgrade our phones recently, which I say is a good thing because out old ones were not going to last much longer.My husband is really rough on his phones. He is always dropping them and I swear I don’t know how many times I have had to replace his phone because he cracked or shattered the screen, this time I told him I didn’t care what he said he was keeping a case on it.I have to tell you be prepared for a fight with this case… it is a P-A-I-N to put on. I am not joking it took just a bit of time to get it on but you will be happy once it is.My husband has dropped his phone more than once with this case on and so far its holding up.

"A little over a month ago my dad had two strokes 3 days apart. With this happening he became almost 100% paralyzed on his left side.He has almost no use of his left arm, he has it in a sling but his arm is still like dead weight, this has caused his shoulder to separate some. The doctors showed us how to use this kind of tape to tape up his shoulder to help that from happening.My dad usually takes a shower every other day just because he needs so much help. We tape up his shoulder after his shower and then we take it off when he takes his next one and this tape holds up great! It has been such a blessing in my family.I know that you can use this to workout but I have to say that this has been such a great help with my dad.

"Last Christmas my parents got my husband a BBQ grill for Christmas.  Man oh man does he love to grill.Over the past year almost we have tried many different things to help him clean that dang grill, most did not work.I have to say that I am really impressed with this grill brush. It is wider than most that we have tried.Another thing that I love is that it has a long handle because we like to try to clean the grill while it is still warm and man that can cause some warm hands with shorter brushes.I love the small leather loop on the end because I can hang it up on the wall when I’m done and don’t have to worry about it just lying around.I am so excited that they included a silicon brush in with the grill brush. We really love to wait to put our sauces on till the food is almost done so this way it does not burn and you can never ever have too many silicon brushes.I know that this brush will last us for many years to come and that makes me oh so happy.As soon as this rain lets up long enough for me to do a video I will.

" 1:52 Minsso I originally got this because I thought that my essential oils would fit in it but I was wrong but have no fear I did actually find a great use for it.So I have a ton of lip gloss and mascara tubs and they drive me nuts sometimes to have to dig to find the ones that I am looking for. So with this stand I am able to have the labels up so I can see what I am grabbing.The size is rather perfect because it does not take up that much space in my already tiny bathroom.I also love that it is clear because it will go in with any décor in my home no matter where I move it to!Another thing that I also was using it for (and may go back to using it for) is for my son’s crayons. Like any kid he loves to color but with his SPD he has to have the colors all visible and sometimes that is hard to do when they are in a box.

"OK so I have always had an issue with my baby toe (that’s what I always call it lol I blame my mother) and the toe next to it sliding under each other, usually this does not bother be but when I have to be on my feet all day it can be a pain. Another time it can be a pain is it’s not the most pretties thing when I wear flip flops and my nail polish rubs off a lot of the time.I have to say while this does separate my toes it does nothing to make them turn back up so they are not sideways. This does disappoint me a little because I would really love it if it did.This is actually not that uncomfortable. After about a minute or two it’s like it’s not even on my feet. It feels like there is this weird powder on them, now this may or may not bother you. It did not seem to bother me that much I only noticed it because I was tugging and pulling on it.Overall these are ok but I wish that maybe they were a little sturdier so that they would turn my toes up and not just separate them.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

"When I first seen this clothes line I thought that it would be perfect in my laundry room because I really like to have my sons school shirts hung up right away so that they do not get all messed up.I was right about that and so much more! One weekend we decided to have a yard sale and man oh man was I irritated with the cord that I was using to hold the clothes, the clothes would just slide down to the middle and bunch up.So I had this awesome idea. Why not take this and hook it up on my fence and then hang the clothes on it! WOW what a life saver. It kept the clothes from bunching together. It also made it easier for people to look through the clothes.The clothesline is made of a super sturdy plastic.  It is omg strong it can put up with a lot of weight because I am telling you that I weighted in down with clothes at the yard sale.I love that you can loop the line over a pole or board or anything and it will attach itself to the line meaning that you do not need any nails or have to make any holes in the wall.You cannot go wrong with this clothesline!

"Recently my Daddy had two strokes 3 day apart. He now has to take extra care in the shower since he is paralyzed on his left side.I have been going out of my mind trying to figure out how to make his life a little easier.When I found these I thought about how much they would help my dad.  I ordered the towel hanger, and the soap dish.So they are fairly easy to install. You stick them to the wall and then you press the button (it’s in the center of the suction cup area).  Make sure you’re not putting them on the suction cup on the seam of the tile, if you do they will not stay up very well.I will admit that I have had them fall a time or two but the first time was when I first put them up I didn’t clean the tile well enough. The second time that they fell was when my boys decided that it would be a great thing to hang on and try to play with.Over all these are not that bad and they actually help my dad a great deal. Anything that gives him any resemblance of independence is amazing in my book.I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

"Christmas is one of my most favorite times of the year. I love it because it’s always when family gets together.I love to decorate; it brings back the happy memories of my child hood.When I got these stocking holders, I was surprised by the weight. These have some weight to them. They are not too heavy but they are just heavy enough to hold up stockings stuffed on Christmas morning.The snowflakes are beautiful. They are a little on the flimsy side, just be careful when you’re taking them out of the box and when you’re putting them up, they can bend a little. You can bend them right back so it’s not really that big of an issue in my opinion.I am so happy with the fact that Velcro sections are included because if you needed them to be even more sturdy where you place them you can set them down with Velcro and then it’s easy to cover that up the rest of the year.Over all these are awesome. I love that they come in a four pack and the price. even if my family adds more members it will be easy to add more!I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

" 5:33 MinsMy family and I love to camp.  I hate having to pack up a big stove or a grill. To me this kind of takes the fun out of camping having to lug around a big stove.When I first came across this I first thought about my best friend who is going to bike ride across the United States.  She won’t have a lot of room to pack a big heavy stove.  This is so perfect for her.It is so lightweight that I am thinking about getting a few more for my house.  One for my car one for my husbands and another for our camping stuff. I also have to add in the cuteness factor of this set!  It is perfect for one or two people. Or if it had to be used for more in an emergency case.I love that it comes with handles that are attached. Most other sets that I have seen you have to clamp something on to the cooking pot and this is not always so easy plus there is more chances of losing it. With the handles being attached this takes care of that.So if you know someone who loves the outdoors, is prepping for the Zombie outbreak (I love watching the walking dead.) or to just have one in your car just in case, this is the cooking set for you.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

" 6:56 MinsMy husband got me my kindle for Valentine’s Day a few years back. It’s the Kindle Fire HD 7’ 2012 2nd GenerationWhen I first got it I looked everywhere to find a hard case because I have kids. Kids = Messes lol, and I wanted my Kindle to last a long long time.Fast forward to now.  I have found the most perfect case ever!  I love the ease of use of this case. I love that the colors are bright.  It comes with its own stand this way I can set it up to either read, watch videos or whatever else I may need to do.Another thing that I love is that it has a built in screen protector.  This makes me so happy because kids tend to have grimy fingers and with this its so easy to clean off and not have to worry about it damaging my screen.There is a flap over the charging port area. It is rubber and covers very well.  It is easy to close the flap that covers the charging area.This is a very sturdy case. My youngest son has dropped it and there was no damage to my kindle. This makes me over the moon happy.I love this case and so glad to have it in my life. I know that it will last a long time for me and can we say oh my goodness so many color options! If you choose more than one you can interchange the colors with another one. This makes it more options.I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

" 1:00 MinsI have two boys so sometimes its nice to make things in a smaller size.So far I have made, Mini Corn bread, mini muffins (oh man my kids love these), mini cakes, brownie bites.These are such a big hit with my kids.  With regular sized muffins my kids can have a hard time eating them because they are so big. With these muffins it's so easy 1 maybe 2 bites and its gone.As soon as I can get my hands on some fruit I plan on trying to make some smoothie cubes for my boys to snack on. It gets so hot here in Texas and regular popsicles melt too quickly. I did not see any warnings on my silicone to say do not put in the freezer so we will see how that turns out.Overall I really love these; you can do so many things with them it's unreal.

" 3:59 MinsThese molds are just so much fun; I love that my boys can help me when I use them.I use the star one for making wax tarts. They pop right out when ready and the star mold is so easy to clean.  I love that I can see the design in the top it adds a little extra pizzazz to my molds.The other two I have used for making goodies for both my boys. We have made chocolates in them. we have also made  no bake cookies in them.Another thing that I am using them for is my youngest therapy. He is Autistic and has SPD. We take cool whip and add food coloring and let him paint with it. we also use pudding. We put the different colors in the molds and he love sit.These molds are so easy to clean just pop them in the dishwasher and bam they are good to go.I hope that you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mineI did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

" 4:20 MinsMy parents have a really small closet in their room. My mom is always saying how much she needs more room.Ok I need to say first off I never thought that I would laugh so hard in my life. My parents are very independent.  They insisted that they put together this closet themselves.  My parents are 55 years old. I am so glad that my kids were asleep while this was going on because there were a lot of words coming from my parent's room.  It was awesome, lol.  Any time I would try to help them I would get yelled at and told to go away.My dad said that he didn't know that he needed an engineer degree to be able to put this together.  While the directions are a big crazy and all over the place they did get it put together.  My mom said that it would be nice if the pieces had numbers on them or letters so you can identify them because she says that the ""short rods"" are not much shorter than the Long Rods.  Also there are several different connectors and none of them are labeled. Again if more thought went into the directions this would have been a lot easier and not taken hours to do.So far it has been holding up great for my parents.  My mom did say that she will not hang any jeans on it because she fears that it may break the bar or the whole structure itself.  But this did open a lot of space in her small closet.Over all I am giving this product 4 stars because the directions are just crazy. Had it not been for the crazy directions I would be giving 5 stars.

"I have two white boards in my home that I keep information one.One holds my totals for the utilities and the totals for the last year. I also put up on the board what im making for dinner.The other board is the running totals of all the meats that I keep in my deep freeze.I hated using dry erase boards because if someone rubbed against it boom there it goes.  I have been using chalk markers on them for a while now.  Most I have noticed do leave some color behind when I wipe it away. Another thing that I have noticed with some chalk markers on them is that they will run a little.  I have not noticed either of these problems with these markers.I love all the colors that there are. Can you say variety? I love it I can have bright colors and dull colors at the same time.I love that I can use this on many different surfaces.  Heck I even tried it on paper and I loved the way it looked!  I love that on paper I can layer the colors, I make sure they are dry then I apply my next color.I love that the tips are reversible. It can be a little messy to change them out but that don’t bother me too much.Overall I am very happy with these markers.

"I am a short girl so when I have to get my spices out of the cupboard I hate having to dig for the one I want.I buy a lot of my spices in bulk so those containers can be large.  The containers of spices that I cannot buy in bulk tend to be smaller and this creates a problem in my cupboard.This shelf organizer is awesome to help me with this problem. I can put the bigger spices in the back and the shorter ones in the front.  If your using all the same size bottles you may have a little bit of an issue reading labels but it still is better than blindly fumbling around looking in the cupboard.I love how wide the shelves are because the bigger bottles won’t fit on other shelf organizers.The bamboo is so beautiful.  The shelves are smooth and clean.There are a few other uses that I thought about for this. You could use it to organize perfume bottles; you could use it to organize kid’s cups. (My youngest is autistic and this thought did cross my mind when I first got this.)  If you take a lot of medications use this to organize the bottles.  You could even use this to organize essential oils bottles.Overall this shelf is amazing and can be used for so many things. It’s a great price as well.

He also says that he can hear me quite well through them.He loves to take them to the gym so he can listen to Pandora while working out.  He said it allows him to focus more.

"Comparisons to Ray Bradbury by other reviewers left me skeptical.  As a Bradbury fan, however, I had to give this author a try.  And I was not disappointed.  It is a brilliant work of fiction pulling the reader to think deeply about the importance of relationships and what it means to be human.

"Mr. Pearce has given all lovers of Shakespeare some solid food for thought in this thorough case for the bard's Catholic faith and convictions.  Any history enthusiast familiar with the English reformation will find fascinating tidbits of information that support Eamon Duffy's assertions in The Voices of Morebath.  The old faith refused to die despite the persecution and the way in which it survived is key to understanding why the question of Shakespeare's faith has been something of an enigma to historians.  Some have argued that he was an enthusiastic protestant convert while others attempt to mold him into the post-enlightenment anti-theist (the logical progression of protestantism).  But neither case is tenable in light of the questions raised in this work.  Others have gone before along this line but Mr. Pearce has provided the most readable and accessible form of the Catholic Shakespeare case.  My only disappointment is that the work focuses a lot on the life and influences of Shakespeare with few examples from his plays to support the case.  It is understood that the author intends to dig deeper into the plays with later works but this reader was hoping for some teasers in this work.  Such teasers might have convinced me to go immediately to the next book focusing on the plays.  However, without the appetizer, there is less sense of anticipation for what follows.  Still, that is hardly enough disappointment to give it less than 4 stars for being quite good.  We suspect successor volume(s) that focus on the plays will be rated with 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU2E3QZ43DH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030FQOTI#wasThisHelpful","RZU2E3QZ43DH3","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a complex plot reminiscent of Tom Clancy and an alternate history twist like Harry Turtledove, this fast-paced thriller is hard to put down.  The primary plot centers around a Nazi experiment in suspended animation giving a sense of a science fiction tale.  The experiment goes awry through unexpected events which leads to a complex web of interactions that give us insight into what might have been and a view of how much the world stage can change in a generation.  Technical details, especially submarine technology, keeps the most demanding techno-thriller fan involved.  Details of the German U-boats engages the history buff.  And the impact of small, seemingly isolated events will intrigue the alternate history and science fiction enthusiast.  A fun read that anticipates a good movie plot in the works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38G08A49O5E52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0AIXJO#wasThisHelpful","R38G08A49O5E52","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rich characters, authentic dialects, and meaningful dialogue spread across an otherworldly canvas that gives this a science-fiction feel makes this one of the most enjoyable fiction works encountered.  Is it a travel log, a western, a coming of age story, or something else?  The ambiguity of the mixed culture setting opens the door to unusual circumstance that lead the reader through an intriguing adventure tale.  The setting is a late-19th-century cattle drive led by Montana cowboys escorted by cossacks across the vast Siberian steppes to a hungry village.

"Professor Neidinger identifies the problem of faith affecting how one approaches this topic.  At the same time he asserts that it is possible to try to see past our prejudices into the documents themselves to see where the historical documents alone will lead us.  And, in this, he does a fine job of leading us.  Only one comment that seems an obvious oversight in his coverage and that is Tertullian's lines about the masculine/feminine wording of both Latin and Greek texts concerning Peter and his conclusion, therefore, that the ""rock"" Jesus was referring to was Peter's confession and not Peter himself.  The problem with that entire line of reasoning is that we can conclude pretty easily that Jesus was not speaking either Latin or Greek when he spoke the line about the rock.  Speaking those words in Aramaic, there would have been no masc/fem question involved and therefore the rock=confession case is untenable.  We would think Dr. Neidinger would have noted how that makes the entire debate problematic but he never corrects that issue.  Still, this is a great beginning and we look forward to the remaining 5 lessons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H0UO54A2X5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXN54JM#wasThisHelpful","R3H0UO54A2X5H","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Science fiction is well-suited to questioning the obvious and conventional wisdom.  It dispels what we think we know with what could be and challenges our assumptions in ways no other genre can.  That is what makes the genre such a powerful tool in leading us to think outside the box as good scientists and philosophers (professional or armchair) should.  That special nature of science fiction is the secret behind the brilliance of this publication.  Those of us with a love for science fiction generally love the way it makes us think deeply and in unconventional ways.  Good science fiction, to us, is not just the simple question of what kind of gadgets will be invented in the future – but will also strive to explain how those changes might affect how we think about what it means to be human.  The carefully selected short stories in this journal bring us back to the deep philosophical questions of life.  It gives us a sense of the mystical and transcendent.  If the first two issues are any indication, science fiction readers are in for some truly thought-provoking literature.  I hope they can keep this momentum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0HMHSDTWY2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYWSP7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1M0HMHSDTWY2N","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have used this trap several times with good results.  A little peanut butter in the trap door then the easy snap into triggered position makes this trap easy to set.  Most of the time it is easy to empty the carcass.  Only on one occasion did it not drop out of the trap when used as described and I found that the mouse had caught its teeth in the bating hole so releasing the trap and shaking was not enough.  So the solution seemed only to find a stick and push the teeth off the bate hole and then it dropped out as expected.  We only had that trouble once out of several mice and it was not pleasant but not worse than the old-fashioned traps that sometimes required prying the carcass out.  The big improvement on this over the old snap traps is that the guillotine mechanism just breaks the animal’s neck every time and the design prevents it breaking further down the animal’s back where it might cause a bloody mess.  A good design that improves on the basic snap trap idea that has proven so effective over the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRQ31U29TU7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGVCJX4#wasThisHelpful","R1CRQ31U29TU7C","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intrigue and action you would expect from such a work.  The plot has enough twists and surprises to keep you turning pages.  The characters have a great deal of depth making it easy to relate and be drawn into the plot with them.  Comparisons to similar works are inevitable.  If you are interested in this genre you will not be disappointed in the technical and historical detail provided.  Mr. Russell’s style and ability are comparable to O’Brian or Forester.  As some reviewers have mentioned, this work is less dark than O’Brian’s writing.  I would add that I find it a bit less action-packed than Forester’s Hornblower series.  The underlying love story is done with taste and without the gratuitous innuendo that seems so prevalent with many authors.  A very enjoyable read for anyone interested in the sailing ships genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1LKJ4IFL2Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158979#wasThisHelpful","R1R1LKJ4IFL2Y2","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best biographies I have read in a while.  This parallel biography of two key American players in the cold war is at once a detailed study of their two lives and a gripping history of the cold war period.  Like a great novel with intertwined themes and plots, the stories of these men's lives join the themes of the cold war story in a fascinating way.

"Economics is not one of my primary interests but more an occasional fascination.  Many economics texts, frankly, are dry and rather dull.  But occasionally a book comes along that causes me to rethink everything I thought I knew on the subject.  Years ago Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson caused such a paradigm shift in me toward a longtime slant toward the Austrian school of economics.  Now I have another highlight in my readings in economics, it is this book.Mr. Mueller’s assertion that we have lost a key concept of economics when we ignore distributism has led me down a new direction of study in economics.  No other work in economics has given me quite the paradigm shift this one has and made me eager to learn more on this topic.  The early chapters provide a cogent and complete economic model or theory and later chapters provide practical implications of that model in modern American political policy.  While there may be some debate over the implications Mr. Mueller cites in the end, it is far more difficult to dispute the model he lays out in the beginning.  In that sense, I enjoyed the model description of the first chapters a great deal more than his explanations of where he thinks that model leads us in particular policies.Marvelous book on a topic too many of us have ignored.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVLMIEYCI53F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBRUK2G#wasThisHelpful","R3SVLMIEYCI53F","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A disappointing offering that builds on neither the blues nor rock genius of this performer.  The tracks are mediocre renditions of old middle-of-the-road and country classics without an original sound to them.  For instance,  Willie Nelson's cover of All Of Me plays on Nelson's unique vocal qualities and chord progressions but Clapton's version sounds like the dozens of tired covers by so many others.  ""Still Got the Blues"" almost raises us above the mediocre with a soulful vocal but it is not enough to carry the rest of the collection.

Few other nations have been influenced by religious culture as has the United States.

"In the area of the ancient city of Caesarea Philipi is a huge stone that dominates and can be seen from all over the area.  At the foot of this rock are the remains of an ancient site dedicated to the pagan fertility god, Pan.  On the top of the rock are the remains of a temple to the Roman god, Jupiter.  From a crevice in the rock springs one of the source tributaries of the Jordan river that flows through and nourishes the barren landscape.  It was with this backdrop that Jesus affirmed Simon as the Rock on which He would build His church.  Many scholars have failed to grasp the significance of this location to the affirmation of Peter's primacy among the apostles.  But what better juxtaposition of the stability to be found in the life-giving church against the gates of hell?Fr. Jaki brings his thorough scrutiny as a scientist and theologian to bear on the history of the use of the name, Rock, for God alone in ancient Jewish tradition.  He affirms that a mere man being called Rock should lead us to humility and provide a basis for greater unity among different Christian traditions rather than prove to be a point of contention between us.In the final chapter, Fr. Jaki takes to task liberal Protestantism as it searches for the historical Jesus while denying His assertion to Peter.  Taken to their logical conclusions, Fr. Jaki observes, ""any investigator of Jesus' life, who does not take for genuine Jesus' reply to Peter's confession, will not endorse a faith in Jesus as defined at Niceaea.""  And so, in the end, the infallible Rock of the Catholic Church stands against the liberalizing influences of changing times and remains a bulwark of the one true deposit of faith.  Fr. Jaki's insights from scripture, philosophy, and common sense have given us a great work for meditation as well as apologetics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEO7IODH2ZSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0931888689#wasThisHelpful","R2FEO7IODH2ZSF","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The plastic cover over the map storage came off within a hour of 4-year-old use.  It snapped back on easily but continues to come off with normal use allowing the maps to fall out of their slot.  After a few days, the kids discovered how easily the pen could be pulled out of the PS2-like socket and their attempts to put it back in bent the pins.  After straightening the pens I was able to repair the problem but soon the pen was removed again and is now lost.  And, unfortunately, without the pen the game is useless.  A locking mechanism on the pen socket would be a great improvement as well as a simpler connector that is not so difficult for young children to fit back in place if it is removed.

"The past century has seen a trend in Eastern Orthodox theologians who have attempted to distance their own theology from that of the west with historical revisionism that questions St. Augustine as part of the authentic Christian tradition.  For a good detailed study of this trend see, The Revival of Political Hesychasm in Contemporary Orthodox Thought: The Political Hesychasm of John Romanides and Christos Yannaras.  But is Augustine's work truly a divergence from that sacred tradition or are his detractors too quick to dismiss his influence on the east?  This is the question asked at the Orthodox Readings of Augustine conference held in 2007.  The intent of the conference was ecumenical in that it sought to find the common Augustinian ground between east and west.  It is encouraging that an Eastern Orthodox publisher has taken up this collection but it is unfortunate that most of the essay authors are from the western tradition.Still, the case for Augustinian influence in the east that directly challenges the assertions of those Father Payne referred to as ""political hesychasts"" is thorough, scholarly, and convincing.  The articles range somewhat in depth with many that are difficult to follow without a good background in the ancient languages as well as philosophy.  Other articles are more conversational and easier to follow; professor Carol Harrison's article, ""De Profundis: Augustine's Reading of Orthodoxy"" is such an article, not only as a good play on the book title but as a refreshing understanding of sacred tradition as a living tradition.  Harrison's essay alone is worth the cost of the book and, though conversational in approach, is profound in content yielding a wealth toward meditation.Several articles take to task the influence of Augustine's work on Gregory Palamas and the Cappadocian fathers that has to make one doubt the dichotomy insisted upon by the ""political hesychasts.""  The dichotomy is only present in a shallow understanding of Augustine or of the eastern fathers if we follow these articles to their logical conclusions.  And again we are faced with the very real probability that the differences between east and west are not based in real theological disagreements but in a refusal to look to the other side with the goal of understanding rather than polemic.  We can only hope and pray that readers of these essays will be able to overcome those biases that drive us toward polemic and seek to truly find the common ground that has for too long eluded us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPWIILL6KPN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881413275#wasThisHelpful","RUPWIILL6KPN5","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An interesting trend emerged in the 20th century.  A backlash of religious fervor swept the world.  Fr. Payne identifies this trend as a reaction against the anti-theistic bias of modernism and globalization.  It has occurred in Islam and in the Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant).  Fr. Payne focuses his attention on the form of this religious backlash within the Orthodox tradition in the form of a revival of hesychasm.Hesychasm is based in the theology of the 14th century theologian, Gregory of Palamas and it has always had adherents and detractors in the various Christian traditions.  However, in the works of some 20th century theologians, such as Fr. John Romanides and Christos Yannaras, hesychasm became the primary means to distinguish the Orthodox from the Catholic tradition.  Indeed, some critics of the modern hesychast movement have claimed it is simply an attempt to distinguish an Orthodox identify and divorce it from the Catholic tradition.  Fr. Payne even asks the question, ""can it be stated that the East-West divide is more about polemics and misrepresentation of theology than about theology per se?""  That does not imply that Fr. Payne, a Greek Orthodox priest, agrees with those critics.  Fr. Payne, in the end, does not see the revival of hesychasm as a reaction to Catholic tradition but as a direct reaction to globalization.  To flesh out this conclusion, Fr. Payne goes into great detail explaining the theology of Fr. Romanides and Christos Yannaras.  Fr. Romanides historical contributions to the identification of the authentic Christian tradition with a Roman identity is given particular attention in order to later draw attention to the possible implications of that theory.  Fr. Payne does not try to refute the (I think) dubious historical theories but instead points out their possible effects on a culture.  Carrying on the discussion Fr. Payne shows how the more political strain of hesychasm in the teachings of Christos Yannaras have led to a new theory of the rights of human beings in society and our relation to the state.  Christos Yannaras, like Fr. Romanides, attempts to distinguish the basis of those rights from the theories that sprouted from western Christian traditions.Fr. Payne avoids criticizing the modern hesychast theology but does point out possible dangers inherent in it.  He does express unease that the church seems to be becoming centered around hesychast theology and abandoning it's true roots in Eucharistic theology.  The hesychast theologians, Fr. Payne asserts, have claimed hesychasm is the mooring of the authentic tradition when in fact they have dislodged a great number away from the Eucharistic mooring of the early church.This is not an easy work to read but the investment is worth the time.  It is a scholarly work with a challenging case.  Unfortunately, such works tend to be read only by experts and go unnoticed in popular circles.  Do not let the nature of the work dissuade you from reading, it is well worth the time for a deeper appreciation of the eastern churches and relations with the west.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7VSLIXBCTY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073914720X#wasThisHelpful","R2U7VSLIXBCTY2","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though the shortest and final volume of the Jesus trilogy, once again the Holy Father has found a way to challenge unbelief and strengthen the faithful both intellectually and spiritually.  This volume is an exposition and discourse on the infancy narratives of the gospels.  Through Old Testament parallels and historical background these seemingly mythic stories are affirmed as historically reliable and spiritually encouraging.  Once again Pope Benedict does not shy from acknowledging the questions raised by those who have challenged the historical reliability of the gospels.  But with that acknowledgement he once again brings their methods into question and demonstrates the shaky foundations on which the criticisms have been built.But, it is not just critics and apologists who will find intellectual food in this volume.  Those everyday mystics who pray the rosary will find new food for meditation on the joyful mysteries in particular and for Marian devotion in general.  Evangelists will find fresh insight into sharing the joy Pope Benedict finds necessarily linked to grace.This work has been one we have anticipated for some time and though it is short it is no less profound and fulfilling than the preceding volumes.

"Some events in history are so dramatic that they take on the character of myth and often with such force that myth replaces history.  Such is the myth that surrounds the end of the cold war.  The myth that America won the war alone and that it was led to victory by a tough confrontational approach led by President Ronald Reagan.  The problem with our popular understanding  is that it is almost entirely an invention of post-Reagan era neoconservatives with little relation to facts.  And basing foreign policy approaches to the problems of today on a fiction of what worked in the past can lead us to disaster.  Believing the fiction twists our foreign policy in so many ways it is difficult to estimate the impact that might result in our relations with those other nations.  The gritty reporting with story-telling style make this myth-buster work a great resource for understanding the real forces and people behind the incredible changes of 1989.  The stories of many former communists who were able to overcome their own prejudices and redirect their countries is inspiring.

"Apparently, the point of this movie was to warn against the dangers of unfettered religious fanaticism and not to convey an historically accurate tale of the philosopher Hypatia.  The setting is in the early years following the edict of Milan that would eventually lead to the acceptance of Christianity as the Roman state religion.  However, the Christian bishops of this movie are not portrayed as the neo-Platonic philosophers they tended to be but as something more akin to modern Fundamentalist extremists.  Such anachronisms are expected from the movie business but then to build subtle error into outright inaccuracy, the script writers decided to pin the blame for burning the great library at Alexandria on these same proto-Charismatics.  Never mind that at the time of the movie setting the library had already been burned centuries before by Roman armies.  No, once again there seems to be an underlying agenda that must force the past to fit the modern bias toward faith as opposed to enlightened and morally superior reason and science.  History has many examples of injustice on the part of Christians (or any group for that matter).  But perpetuating the anti-faith myths such as the Hypatia incident and Galileo without an honest treatment of the historical context is becoming a modern film cliché.  It is unfortunate because the cinematography is original in recreating ancient Alexandria in the context of the entire world.  But average acting supported by original cinematography are not enough to cover the underlying prejudices implied in the story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ1TT2PS5TBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047VSW30#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ1TT2PS5TBO","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife, who limits her gluten, is very impressed with this product.  Interestingly enough, she does not like dark chocolate but she does like these.  Dark chocolate is one of my favorites and these bars provide a rich chocolate flavor with healthy whole grains.

"Comrades, you will like this video.  Pavel Tatsouline has been serving up stereotypical soviet supremacy with strength and flexibility training for years.  Before kettle bells were the latest fad, he was pushing his dry cold war jokes and Russian training methods.  Indeed, he is likely the original source of the kettle bell enthusiasm.  But there is more than fad and enthusiasm and silly jokes in this video.  Along with all the humor and stereotypes is solid instruction for kettle bell safety through proper form.  Pavel provides the basic exercises then adds to them in a logical progression providing a true full body workout.  The idea is to begin with the basic exercises to start to develop the muscle and skill you need to build up to more the more complex exercises.  Follow the advice and work them in the progression he recommends for best results.  If you are impatient and anxious to jump to the next more complex routines before you have mastered the first, you will likely end up hurt and fail in your goals in the end.  Let Pavel's goading push you on to greater effort but do not rush the training into injury.  If you really want to give kettle bells a try, this is a great place to start.  If you are not yet sure about spending the money on a couple of kettle bells (Pavel recommends men start with a 35-pound bell and women begin with an 18 pound bell) then try Pavel's body weight only workout in The Naked Warrior, Master the Secrets of the Super-Strong--Using Bodyweight Exercises Only with Pavel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2ABDN227DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DE650Q#wasThisHelpful","R1K2ABDN227DS","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second kettlebell I have purchased from this seller and I am quite pleased.  The list price plus shipping is the lowest you will find anywhere.  The kettlebell itself is a little rough and unfinished but not so much that it tears your hands.  If nothing else, it provides a better grip.  They are not pretty but they provide the work.  Only one minor problem I have found with a lot of use is that they can be a little unstable if you want to use them as a pushup platform.  As my arms get tired and start to shake, it is easy to accidentally turn them and hurt your wrists.  If you are like me and prefer to do pushups without the kettlebells as a platform, then this is no concern at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6IRNM9IKG6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077XYTDW#wasThisHelpful","R3K6IRNM9IKG6C","AF3X7J0XC391L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF3X7J0XC391L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems to be a well built, high quality motherboard, with many features.  I purchased it on ebay for $128 with free shipping. I am able to overclock my  i5-6600k CPU to 4400 MHz simply by bumping the multiplier up to 44, while leaving the CPU Load Line Calibration at it's lowest level.  This keeps the voltage and heat low.  I was able to bring the clock up to 4600 MHz by bumping the voltage to a fixed 1.35, but this pulls more power and generates more heat and fan noise than I like.  4700 was too much with my limited knowledge, and my reluctance to go past 1.35v,  I was able to push the integrated GPU to 1400 as well. I imagine I could get more out of it if I knew more about the intricacies of overclocking, but it shows what this board is capable of with just a modicum of knowledge and air cooling.My setup utilizes an Intel i5-6600k CPU, an EVGA GTX750 Ti SC, 2x4gb sticks of Crucial 2133 DDR4, a Crucial MX200 2.5"" SSD, a 3TB WD Green HDD, a LG WH16NS40 Blu-ray Disc Rewriter, an EVGA SuperNOVA 550 G2 PSU, Case ventilation is provided by a pair of Noctua NF-F12 PWM Cooling Fans on intake duty, and a Noctua NF-P12 PWM fan on exhaust duty. The case is a Cooler Master Silencio 352 mATX. Everything fits perfectly.This was my first build in over 10 years.  I built it to be a HTPC, and it is performing admirably.  The board connectors worked out ok for my build.  I do wish the battery was in a more open place, as my CPU cooler and video card block access to it.  Likewise, the CPU cooler fan connection is under the cooler when it is installed.  I would have preferred that the SATA connectors were oriented vertically, rather than parallel at the edge, but I was able to make it work.I did have trouble installing Windows 7.  Skylake drops Legacy USB support, so USB keyboards won't work without going into the BIOS to enable the OS/2 port simulator.  Due to the fact that I did not have a DVI-D capable monitor or DVI-D to VGA converter, I was unable to get into the BIOS.  I was unable to see the BIOS screen on my TV until I turned off the HD setting in the BIOS, once I had gotten a DVI-D to VGA active converter.  This would also not have been an issue with the GTX-750 video card, but I had not yet decided to get it yet.  I used the USB Patcher that comes on the driver CD and on the Asrock website, but that wound up getting me only to the first screen of the setup, where you are supposed to give the PC a name.  I tried many other workarounds, but what finally did the trick was buying a used PS/2 keyboard.  This allowed me to get into Windows, and then the driver disk did the rest.One issue I have been seeing is that the BIOS screen freezes up occasionally.  The mouse pointer will still move, but mouse clicks and keyboard commands no longer have any effect.  When this happens, I have to Control Alt Delete to reboot.  This seems to have no effect on Windows 7 stability, and some times it will happen repeatedly, and then other times, it won't happen for a long while.Overall, I am pretty happy with this board.  It represents a good feature set and quality for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASP5MOW6UP9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JEOXJS#wasThisHelpful","RASP5MOW6UP9I","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I went with the NH-C14S due to advertised limitations on cooler height with my Cooler Master Silencio 352 mATX case.  I found out later that a taller cooler may have fit, but I don't regret the choice.I picked this cooler because I'm a big fan of Noctua quality and performance and its specs showed it was compatible with my setup.  Tests showed that this cooler is only slightly behind the big NH-D14, which is incredible when you consider the C14S only has one row of fins and a single 120mm fan, vs the double-radiator with 140 and 120 mm fans of the D14.  Another plus of the C14S is that it blows cooling air directly at the motherboard, so in the end, it may be a better choice after all.I wound up mounting it with the fan underneath, the way it ships, because there was more clearance between the fan and the board than the fan and the side of the case if mounted on top.  I feel the improved airflow makes up for it being in a less ideal spot.  My experience has been that the cooler works very well.  CPU temperatures do not exceed 20degC above ambient in stock form, and 30degC when overclocked to 4600, from 3500 stock.  The fan is fairly quiet at full speed, but with the CPU at stock clock, I find I don't need to spin the fan above 700 RPM to keep things cool, and at that speed its near silent.  I did find that the fan does not want to start if PWM is set to 300 at low temps, so I had to move the starting speed up to 400 RPM, still almost inaudible though.My setup utilizes an ASRock Z170M Extreme4 MB, with an Intel I5-6600k CPU, an EVGA GTX750 Ti SC, 2x4gb sticks of Crucial 2133 DDR4, a Crucial MX200 2.5"" SSD, a 3TB WD Green HDD, a LG WH16NS40 Blu-ray Disc Rewriter, an EVGA SuperNOVA 550 G2 PSU,  Case ventilation is provided by a pair of Noctua NF-F12 PWM Cooling Fans on intake duty, and a Noctua NF-P12 PWM fan on exhaust duty.

"This tree is very beautiful, looks very realistic, and has the feel of great durability.  I purchased it direct from Balsam Hill, as it was not available at the time on Amazon.  It came the next day, even though I ordered ground shipping.  It did ship from Fremont though, which is fairly close.I purchased this tree to go on top of a table in my entry-way.  I went with un-lighted because I have vintage lighting to put on it.This tree comes in two pieces.  It has a bottom section with branches that are hinged and fold upward.  The top section is not folding.When you first put the bottom section in the stand, you realize that this is a heavy tree, and feels very solid.  It also looks very scrawny when it comes to foliage.  You have to fluff the foliage out, and there is plenty to fluff out.I used a tip found elsewhere that was to use the ribbon that held the branches folded up, to hold all the branches up but the layer you are working on.  This worked out very well.  It took me about an hour to get the tree looking the way I wanted it too, but when completed, I was VERY impressed.

"If you have a '94-96 Caprice, Roadmaster, Fleetwood or Impala SS with 4-wheel disk brakes, you probably want this.GM used the same proportioning valve whether the car was equipped with rear drums or disks.What this means is that there is a variable amount of pressure sent to the rear brake, depending on how hard you push on the brake pedal and the pressure is delayed as well.This means that, if you have 4 wheel disks, upon a light activation of the brakes, the rears do almost nothing, the bias being about 95/5.  Under heavy application, the rear brakes do their share, with a bias of about 65/35.These brake bolts make the front/rear application stay about 65/35 all the time and remove the delay in rear brake application.The benefit of this is that your front brakes will last longer, and trail-braking is much more effective.The downside of this is that you will be replacing your rear-brakes more often and cleaning brake dust off your rear wheels more often as well.DO NOT apply this modification if your car has rear drum brakes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OFXCS4DEQON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANJA77O#wasThisHelpful","R27OFXCS4DEQON","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite knife so far is the Benchmade Griptilian in D2 steel from Cabelas.  I've had a few Kershaws over  the years, but they have never really grabbed me.  This one caught my eye so I had to pick one up.The Strobe has a solid, weighty feel in the hand and opens fast and smooth with a bit of resistance at the beginning, which keeps the knife closed when it is in your pocket.  I've not had it long enough to know if it won't open by itself, but I feel like it won't.  My previous Kershaws would open in my pocket unless I locked them closed.  I really did not like having to lock them closed and that was one of my main problems with them.The Strobe feels nice and secure in the hand, well balanced and comfortable to grip firmly.  The blade is fairly thick, wide and very sharp, right out of the box.  Once open, the frame lock looks and feels like it is very secure.  There is no play once locked, no impression that the blade will fold unless you unlock it.  The Strobe seems to have about the same stiffness, side to side, as the Griptilian, which is very good.For me, the Griptilian is still my first choice for every day carry, but if the Strobe were the same size as the Grip, the deciding factor would be the Axis lock of the Griptilian, which I prefer.All in all, a very good knife for the money, and I expect it will see plenty of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V794FE6XY54C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0ROEPC#wasThisHelpful","R3V794FE6XY54C","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initial Review;This is my first smoker, and I've only cured it and used it one time.  I'm afraid I jumped on this due to the price, before I had researched smokers.  This is rare for me, but I was mainly looking for something with more flexibility than my Son of Hibachi.  The Son of Hibachi is great for grilling, but I wanted to do some smoking as well, with the ability to also grill larger quantities than the Hibachi will handle..What I have found, is that this smoker has all of the short-comings of typical off-set smokers, and that all of those short-comings are made worse by small size and relatively thin metal.I cured it, as per the directions on page 3 of the manual, using charcoal in the firebox.  I then added more charcoal, and rolled right into smoking some boneless chicken thighs, a pork roast, and a tri-tip.  I used a mixture of hickory and cherry chunks.  I put two 8x8 aluminum pans underneath the grills, and a 4x8 loaf pan as well, to catch drippings.I found that, with charcoal, I was having trouble getting the temperature up on the grill.  I found that the grill temperature, right underneath the thermometer, was much lower than the temperature indicated on the thermometer.  300 on the thermometer resulted in 200 at the grill surface.  I found that the area next to the firebox cooked very quickly, cooked more like grilling than smoking, while the area opposite the firebox remains pretty cool, to the point I could touch the grills.  Until I pushed the temperature to 350 with a resulting 225-250 at the grill, the food in the middle did not cook.I wound up relying solely on wood to keep the heat up, and had no issues with temperatures being too low once I did this.  Due to the small size of the wood chucks I was using, I wound up having to use a lot more wood than I expected.  After a couple of hours of this, I wound up with perfectly cooked chicken thighs, but the other meat had an interior temp of only 120F.  If I had had more time, I would have continued smoking and eventually gotten the tri-tip and roast up to temp, but instead, I put the remaining meat in the oven and finished it that way.All of the meat turned out delicious.  The roast and tri-tip had very nice smoke-rings.  I was very pleased with the way the food turned out.If I did not plan to try some modifications, I think I would use mainly charcoal for fuel, and put some charcoal in the smoker chamber to bring temps up in the far end.My plan is to try putting a baffle in, mainly to shield the food from the direct heat of the firebox, but also to move the heat entry point more toward the middle of the smoker area.  I also plan to extend the smoker chimney down closer to the grill, to force the smoke down there.  I also plan to find a basket so I can use the Minion Method of fueling the smoker.  I feel that these additions will greatly aid the ease of use of the smoker.I do wish Char-Broil would cure the paint in-house.  I feel it is impossible to cure the paint at home from the inside nearly as well as could be done in an oven big enough to hold the parts.  I feel that curing issues are a large part of the paint complaints received.I'm not sure that, had I done more research, that I would still buy this smoker, but for the money, I feel it is worthwhile.Update;I have since smoked a 4 lb pork shoulder and smoked and grilled some burgers.To smoke the pork shoulder, I took two disposable bread-loaf pans, of the 4x8 variety, punched holes in them for ventilation, and loaded each with charcoal.  I tilted the pans and laid the charcoal on it's side in a sort of chevron pattern.  I then put another layer of charcoal on top of that in the same pattern.I also cut 3/4 of the bottom out of a mini-loaf pan of the 3x6 variety, and bent the flap of remaining material up to extend the heat shield/baffle.  I then put the loaf pan in the hole between the fire-box and smoker chamber with the flap portion up, and expanded the pan to lodge in the opening.  This made a nice baffle and heat shield.I then put the two pans in the smoker and lit one end of the briquettes using a blow torch.  I lit the 4 briquettes on top at the end closest to the smoker chamber, so the flame had to work back toward the vent.  After those briquettes were well lit, and the temperature started coming up in the smoker chamber, I put the un-seasoned pork shoulder in the middle of the smoker, over a foil pan to catch the drippings.  I put some cherry wood on the lit briquettes as well as the unlit ones, and let the meat smoke.  After about 30 to 45 minutes, all of the briquettes in the pan were lit, and I had to use the air register to keep the heat down.  Occasionally I would put a couple of pieces of wood on the briquettes to keep the smoke going.  Occasionally I would put a chunk of hickory in, but the smoke was mainly from cherry.With this method, after 3 hours of smoking, the charcoal was still going.  I would have left the meat in the smoker, but it was bed time, so I put the pork shoulder in a slow cooker on low while I slept.  I put a half cup of water in as well as the drippings from the pork.The next morning, the pork shoulder was fork tender and was easily pulled apart.  I had some for breakfast, gave some to a friend to try, and had some more for supper.  It was one of the best I've ever had.  It was hard to believe the flavor was only smoke and natural pork juices.  My friend raved about it.For the burgers, I just put about 30 briquettes in the firebox, lit them, and when fully lit, spread them out and put 8 seasoned patties in the smoker chamber.  I smoked the patties using mainly cherry with some hickory, for about 30 minutes.  The patties closest to the firebox needed to be flipped at 15 minutes, and were pretty much done at 30.  I finished grilling them in the firebox grill, and then grilled all the rest of the patties in turn in the firebox, returning them to the smoker to keep them warm when they were finished.  These burgers turned out fabulously!Update2;I smoked a brisket this weekend.  This time, I made two additions to my smoker.The first is a Maverick Et 733 Wireless BBQ Meat Thermometer.  This lets me see the actual temperature the meat is seeing, as well as the meat internal temp, without having to constantly go out to the smoker.  This is a must have item, no matter what smoker you use.I am very much enjoying this purchase.The second was a FDS-875 Stainless Steel Floor Drain Strainer.  This is a perforated pan that fits into the firebox and allows one to put a lot more charcoal in for 4 hours worth of heat.  It also makes cleanup easier.  I have put a photograph of it in the customer images section.  I purchased this off of ebay for $20.I have settled on a method of smoking large cuts of meat, where I smoke the meat until the heat dies off, and then put it in a slow-cooker to finish it.  This has worked great for pork shoulder and brisket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRAKIORQHFYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00365FI9E#wasThisHelpful","R2CRAKIORQHFYU","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this lamp because it was about the same price as other 2-bulb lamps and has glowing reviews. I also thought it would have bloom and vegetation bulbs included. I see now that the description shows 6500K bulbs by default, and one can request mixed or only bloom bulbs.My lamp was poorly packed and was damaged in shipping, but I see later reviews are saying it is well packed, so maybe they have improved. The lamp was much flimsier than I expected, but because it is so flimsy, it is very light for the amount of light it puts out. The seller did offer a refund, or would send new ballasts to get the lamp working. I took new ballasts, but still faced hassle either way, either of returning the lamp, or having to install the ballasts.The seller did respond quickly and gives good support.When faced with the buying another lamp, I chose to try a more expensive and hopefully better built one(hasn't arrived yet), but I will keep using this one as well.Pros;Very high output for the money.Can be switched to have 0, 2 or 4 lamps on at a timeCan be daisy chained together, only needing one cord to plug into the outlet or timer.LightweightCons;Very flimsy constructionEasily damaged in shippingCould be good or bad, depending;Puts out a good deal of heat","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRIB80MZK8AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEYCRI8#wasThisHelpful","RTRIB80MZK8AR","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It pains me to write this review.I use a Litter Robot and my cat has only peed outside the box one time.  That was when the Litter Robot stopped upside down so she did not have a box to go in.  She peed right in front of me.  So one time, in 7 years, and that was for cause.I've mostly used Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented,  I loved the original formula, but that is unavailable now, so I've tried others, including Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter.  Nothing has really been better though, so I stick with Everclean.2 months ago, I started replacing her litter with World's best.  I did this by putting it in one scoop at a time to replace the litter that the Litter Robot scooped out.  After 2 months of this, the littler is mostly World's Best, and that was enough for my Sofie.  She started peeing on the bath mat in the guest bath.So I dumped the World's best litter and replaced it with Everclean.  The next morning, there was a urine clump in the litter and no pee on the bath mat.I really wanted this litter to work, as I feel it is a healthier and more environmentally friendly choice.Maybe it just doesn't work well in Litter Robot service.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JA0VE8BM6EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QJYBVK#wasThisHelpful","R25JA0VE8BM6EG","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been trying to keep my yard green for years now, using organic fertilizers and other non-traditional soil enhancers.  I have been successful, but it still requires a lot of ""stuff"" sprinkled onto the lawn.  I kept thinking about the yards of my youth.  My father and grandfather never fertilized their yards and they looked fine.  Why is it so hard for me to keep my yard healthy?One day I found out that clover is a nitrogen fixer.  It takes nitrogen out of the air, and puts it in the ground.  Wait, what!?I remembered that clover always grew in the yards of my youth.  Where did it come from?  Where had it gone?It turns out that clover is great for a lawn, but broadleaf herbicides kill it.  Time to plant some clover!I ordered this clover from Nichols Garden Nursery last year and planted it in the late summer.  I also planted some indoors in potting soil in a 12"" square plastic pan and it germinated and started growing very quickly.  It was very close to 100% germination, so the seed was certainly good.I simply sprinkled the seed all over the yard, hoping that enough would germinate to get a good start, and then it would spread.  I did water it in and watered it every day for a week, but got no germination.We had a very dry winter and nothing happened until the late rains and warmth of late winter.  As soon as we had a few warmish days, I started seeing clover germinating in patches in the yard.  Much less germinated than I had hoped for, and it mostly germinated in places where the grass was growing well already.  I suppose this is to be expected, but I had really hoped it would germinate in the bare patches in the yard.This clover seems very hardy, and is growing profusely in the spots where it took hold, and slowly spreading, as I had hoped it would.  It is not at all ""micro"" though.  It quickly grows much taller than the grass, and the leaves are as big as the clover I am used too.This is not a deal-breaker for me, but I had hoped that it would not be so tall and big as normal clover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NT9T4D9OOY7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGCX58G#wasThisHelpful","R3NT9T4D9OOY7G","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on a review of 5 battery maintainers in Wing World magazine, I purchased a Yuasa 1.5 amp battery maintainer. I have a 2001 Honda GL1800 Goldwing with a battery that is at least 2 years old. I have an Argus Battery Bug that showed the battery was at 48% of life, and that the voltage would fall to 12.2 volts over the course of a day.I put the Yuasa on each night for a week, basically until several days past with no further improvements, and then reset the battery bug. I then rode the bike to work for a week and found that the battery was holding 12.5 volts and was at 77% on the battery bug.I then discovered another review in Wing World magazine on the Pulsetech Xtreme Charge, which indicated that it brought batteries to a higher state of charge than other battery maintainers. I decided to give it a try.After using it every night for a week, I again saw no further improvements, and reset the Battery Bug and rode it for another week. At the end of that week, the battery was maintaining 12.9 volts after the course of a day, and the Battery bug was indicating that the battery was at 91% life.I have since used this charger on all of the batteries in my household.  I rotate it around so that each vehicle ""gets a hit"" at least once a month for a few days.  It helped the battery in my Burgman 650 last over 6 years.  That battery was still firing off like new when I sold the scooter.So, in conclusion, the Pulsetech Xtreme Charge appears to perform as advertised. It brings batteries to a higher state of charge, giving shorter cranking times, which wastes less fuel and ensures a longer starter and alternator life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3U4ARW4LZNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AWH96U#wasThisHelpful","R2M3U4ARW4LZNP","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this on a 2007 BMW F650GS.  It fits like it were almost tailored to the bike.  I hate big tank bags, and this one is just right to me, having enough space to store gloves, cap, camera, phone... with room to spare, but not interfering with the full lock of the bars in either direction, nor sitting too tall.The three pont strap mount is perfect as well.  It was a bit difficult to get the strap threaded through for the part under the seat, but the strap can stay there even if the bag is not mounted, so that is a one time job, unless you want to move from bike to bike with the bag.It seems very well made, mounts securely, and has a non-slip, non-scratch neoprene base.The rear pocket is perfect for keeping the rain cover in.One gripe I have is that the entrance to the map pocket is pretty narrow.I've heard that the clear plastic will yellow from UV, so make sure you treat it with UV protectant.

"I used this to replace an old Docsis 2.0 Motorola SBG900.The SBG900 worked well enough until I purchased a Logitech Revue, which has issues with the SBG900, such as dropping connections which required a reboot of the router, among other things.After doing my research, I found that the Zoom 5341J was Comcast compatible and capable of connecting to 8 download channels and 4 upload channels, compared to the much more common 4Down x 4Up configuration.  Keep in mind that the Zoom 5341(with no J at the end) is a 4x4 configuration.The Zoom 5341 is a modem only, not having a wireless router embedded like the SBG900, but I already had a Linksys WRT54G router, which I had already pulled out to try and rectify my problems with the Logitech Revue.  The SBG900 kept dropping the wired connection to the Linksys though...  The Zoom 5350 is compatible with Comcast and has the same specs as the 5341J, but also has a wireless router and 4 wired ports as well.  I considered it, but decided to go with seperate pieces for modem and router duty.The evening that the Zoom 5341J arrived, I installed it in place of the SBG900, and plugged my laptop in.  Once it had established a connection, the Comcast device activation page came up in my browser, and I was able to switch the activation from the SBG900 to the Zoom 5341J in minutes, with no need for phone calls to support.The configuration of the Zoom 5341J is very simple, and I made no changes to the default configuration.  I did check the connections, and found that I had 8 download connections and 2 upload connections.  It appears that Comcast in my area will only provide 2 upload connections.I plugged the Linksys WRT54G in and had WiFi a minute later.  I found average speeds to be about the same as before, but peak speeds to be about 30% faster, and this resulted in snappier browser performance, and quicker starting of streaming video.  I also have found that the connection is more robust, as I have not been getting the rebuffering and disconnects streaming video that I was getting with the SBG900.My problems with the Logitech Revue have also been solved, and the Zoom 5341J has not been dropping the wired connection to the Linksys WRT54G.  That, combined with the performance enhancements, has left me very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1V26HWOLPWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063K4NN6#wasThisHelpful","R1F1V26HWOLPWR","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been drinking this tea for over a year now, and it is the main tea I drink.  I prefer other teas for flavor, for sipping and savoring, but this is what I drink the most of, as a refreshing and healthy beverage, and it is very good for that purpose.The Amazon description, saying this is Bai Mu Dan, is incorrect. It is actually fannings. Fannings is the second to the smallest leaf size. Fannings are used in tea bags because of their small size and economic price. On the Uncle Lee's tea website, this tea is shown just as white camellia sinensis. The Uncle Lee's Organic White tea that is described as Bai Mu Dan on the Uncle Lee website is $5 for 18 bags.The only other pure white tea I've had is Republic of Tea's Emperor's white tea, which I find superior to this tea, having a milder and sweeter flavor that is even more pleasant to drink without sweetener than this one. The Uncle Lee's white tea is closer to an oolong in both color and flavor than the Emperor's, with just a hint of bitterness and none of the herbal tones of a green tea.That said, the RoT Emperor's White is almost 6 times more expensive than this tea, and Uncle Lee's is still easy to drink without sweetener, so I'll save the Emperor's for special moments and use the Uncle Lee's as my ""daily drinker.""Having more flavor, I find that this makes an excellent iced tea.  I usually use 4 bags of this, and one bag of Republic of Tea's Cherry Green Tea, to a gallon of water plus 2 heaping teaspoons of natural cane sugar to provide just a hint of sweetness in a very refreshing iced tea that everyone loves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKJR2LZ3RNTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V7MCBC#wasThisHelpful","R3BKJR2LZ3RNTN","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is very nice since I'm using a stick edger attachment for an Echo SRM-210.The second is that the edger is much less likely to come out of the ""groove"" now, in heavier going.I will be purchasing this type of blade from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSGGZPJ73XKMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018U061O#wasThisHelpful","RSGGZPJ73XKMY","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is composed of 100% corn meal gluten.  Corn meal gluten is a non-selective pre-emergent herbicide which also has naturally occuring nitrogen as well, so it makes it a great product to put on your lawn in the fall, BEFORE the weeds start growing.Being a non-selective pre-emergent herbicide means that it keeps ALL seeds from germinating.  This means that it needs to be applied to lawns that are already esablished, and care needs to be taken to not apply it where seeds have been planted which you want to grow.As a fertilizer, corn meal gluten is rated at N-P-K ratio of 9-1-0, or 10% nitrogen by weight.It should be applied at a rate of 20-40 lbs per 1,000 ft-sq.  Rates above 80 lbs per ft-square will interfere with the growth of healty plants and grass, so don't go above 40.  I used 20 and had good results.Corn meal gluten is not 100% effective either.  On first application, it is around 60% effective, but that goes up to a maximum of about 80% after multiple applications, about 4-6 weeks apart.Corn meal gluten needs to be watered lightly after use and allowed to dry after, so don't apply it if rain is forecast before the lawn can dry.It must also be said that if you already see weeds growing in your lawn, it is too late for this product, at least as a weed killer.  It will still prevent more weeds from germinating, and it will fertilize the soil, as well as helping to make future applications more effective.So, you will still see some weeds with this product, but because you are not damaging the soil, and are making your lawn healthier, there will be fewer weeds just due to the thicker grass.Another thing to take note of is that this often can be found at feed stores and is finding its way into the nuseries and other places that carry lawn care products.  It generally goes for half the price at sources other than Amazon...  That said, if I can't find a local source, I will be purchasing it from Amazon again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SB6QNSB4GJ60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AWCVWM#wasThisHelpful","R1SB6QNSB4GJ60","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really can't vouch for any of the claims that are made for this product except that applying it as directed worked to make my grass greener, thicker, lusher, and grow faster.I have a 3 year old lawn on poor topsoil in a new development.  I have been using only organic products such as Dr Earth Supernatural Lawn Food, Medina Hasta Gro, and corn meal gluten.  I also use a Toro Super Recycler mulching mower so my fertilizer is not thrown out with the clippings, and I cut the lawn tall.  My lawn has steadily improved in appearance and health since I started using these products.  I use much less water than my neighbors to keep my grass looking healthier.That said, it never consistently had that lush green look.  There were areas that had it, and areas that did not, but it was not until I tried measuring my soils moisture content that I realized how hard the soil was.I originally bought a quart to use on high traffic areas of my lawn and give the rest a light dose.  It worked well enough for me to get another gallon to repeat a month later.  I put a half-gallon down next over the entire yard and was rewarded with a greener lawn in less than a week and was needing to mow it more often.  I was also able to cut back on the amount of water I was putting on it.There were still spots that were not as nice as the rest, so I hit those spots and wound up overdoing it, as those spots are now much greener and the grass is denser and faster growing.  The grass is denser than I've ever seen in those areas.  It is simply amazing to me what this liquid is doing.  It has a much more pronounced effect than any other product I have used.  I am guessing that at least part of this is due to the fact that I have been applying fertilizer as directed, and that the fertilizer is now being used more effectively as the soil health improves.I plan on putting down the rest as a very light application on the rest of the lawn and hope that will get me to consistancy.I am very happy with this product and will be ordering more for next spring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZANFBXFEU1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003G6MMD8#wasThisHelpful","RTZANFBXFEU1E","AOA0XDHSL5GRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOA0XDHSL5GRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Cop Car” is not a movie with a huge scope. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Like so many of my favorite films, it takes place between a few select characters and depicts a single incident or situation that sets them all off. These kinds of movies tend to give the audience tons of room to interpret their own meaning. They aren’t often rich in character development right off the bat. We have to learn about these characters as the situation evolves, and that can be the most exciting thing as a viewer. This film is no different.It opens very suddenly with two young boys wandering in the fields of Colorado who find an inconspicuously parked cop car. Them being daring kids with nothing to lose, they hop in and set in motion both the vehicle and Kevin Bacon’s character after them (the sheriff who’s up to some shady business in the isolated area). He needs the contents of the car, which will most definitely incriminate him if in the wrong hands, and the boys need to satisfy their boredom in a huge way. What begins is an engaging interplay between the two as everything unfolds.It’s not a flawless film, instead embracing a ‘B-movie’ quality that’s meant only to thrill and entertain us. The skillful direction from Jon Watts goes a long way, and it’s obvious that he takes real care with his actors. Kevin Bacon as the sleazy, immoral cop is worth the price of admission alone, but he’s certainly not the only thing keeping this film together. The recognizable character actor Shea Whigham, along with the two boys played by Hays Wellford and James Freedson-Jackson, deliver solid support. It’s simple filmmaking, but effective in every sense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW5TSLD52HYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011S9HMFM#wasThisHelpful","R1BW5TSLD52HYM","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Dope” is not the movie that you probably expect when hearing the title. I want to stress that. The word itself has negative connotations (with most thinking immediately of drugs when they hear it), and though it certainly deals with things of that sort, it isn’t really that simple. The few definitions of the word are addressed at the beginning of the film, most notably as a slang term referring to something that is “very good”. This definition, my favorite of the few, seems to capture the movie in the best light.Essentially, this is a coming-of-age picture. Our main character is Malcolm, a high-school senior who’s obsessed with 90s hip-hop culture, and who constantly shows this affection by emulating the fashion and language of the time. He’s a straight-A student with perfect SAT scores and seems to have everything under control - despite a few bullies - until he finds himself taking a chance invitation to a drug dealer’s birthday party along with his two best friends. From there, he's taken on a crazy adventure littered with bad choice after bad choice, all the while juggling college applications and interviews that will surely determine his future.Writer/Director Rick Famuyiwa strips the film of any tired cliches or stereotypes for African-American characters, and surprisingly manages to infuse details that question the issues of racism and class discrimination. But above all, he makes a really fun movie. The writing is sharp and humorous, with the acting from the main trio - Shameik Moore, Tony Revolori, and Kiersey Clemons - complimenting it excellently. And though it’s undoubtedly rough around the edges, its wit and ceaseless energy make it irresistible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TNB0DY608BBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01169NMY4#wasThisHelpful","R3TNB0DY608BBF","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best feelings you can have while sitting in a movie theater, having chosen something you weren’t necessarily looking forward to, is to have your expectations greatly exceeded. This was the sort of situation I was in with “The Gift”. By no means was I anxiously awaiting its release, nor did I expect to enjoy it all that much as I paid and took my seat. But low and behold, I was thoroughly entertained and thrilled for the extent of its runtime. Once the first eerie frames flashed onto the screen and I got a glimpse of the kind-of experience I might have, I was in.In a sense, the film seems almost plucked out of the 90s. It’s one of those well-executed thrillers that you might expect would star someone like Michael Douglas in his prime. It focuses on a newly-married couple who, after an encounter with an old high school ‘buddy’ of the husband’s, begin receiving mysterious gifts and run-ins with this same peculiar man. Simon and Robyn (played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) - the pair in question - try their best to handle the bizarre events as they begin to get weirder and weirder. But as the film unfolds, and the truth comes out, these strange occurrences take on a whole new meaning.It’s definitely one of the most entertaining movies I’ve seen all summer, and the performances are downright fantastic. Joel Edgerton, who also wrote and directed the film, gets some massive screen-time of his own as the mystifying acquaintance that shakes everything up. It’s a wonder that he’s able to be so present and immersed in this character while also seeing that his own material is fully realized on-screen. He’s created a movie that will get inside the viewer’s head and, in my case, even make them jump out of their seat a few times. It’s one of those extremely satisfying movie experiences that sneaks up on you, proving that a compelling story is really all you need to make an engrossing film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31K8V7927OBCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C6OW1Q#wasThisHelpful","R31K8V7927OBCJ","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judd Apatow’s movies tend to have a well-developed dramatic core, though they’re undoubtedly comedies, him being a director that doesn’t solely go for cheap laughs. We have to get to know his characters, problems and all, before we can really find their situations funny. He’s proven his method works with “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up” - both of which hold up very well - along with his more underrated efforts such as “Funny People”. This fact is what makes “Trainwreck”, his latest film, such an oddly dissatisfying experience. It’s not as if we can’t see Apatow trying - he definitely is - but it just somehow doesn’t come together in the same way that so many of his past films have.It’s all centered around a twenty-something reporter named Amy (Amy Schumer), a girl who’s been living her life by a ‘monogamy isn’t realistic’ code (an idea she learned at a very young age from her father). She sleeps around with men every other night, always avoiding the idea of getting married or settling down. That is, until she’s assigned to write a story on one of the biggest sports physicians in the country (played by Bill Hader). It turns out he’s a bit different than her casual encounters, even if she doesn’t realize it at first, and we’re mainly seeing her transformation from a careless person to a more mature and responsible one.But the problem is, the journey isn’t all that interesting. Amy’s character is insensitive and quite unlikable from the start, and when some of the more dramatic moments start to come, I’m not sure the audience cares enough to sympathize. The writing just isn’t as sharp or witty as you might expect, and Amy Schumer has a hard time carrying the film. The supporting cast often steals the show, with a pretty well-rounded performance from Hader and a hilarious LeBron James playing one of his patients. It seems that James is probably the funniest thing about this movie, the rest being pretty standard fare. Judd Apatow can definitely do better, with this being my least favorite of his thus far.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTP88BGZFKMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VRP4EC#wasThisHelpful","R3DTP88BGZFKMU","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Unexpected”, the new film from writer/director Kris Swanberg, is one of the few movies that I’ve been truly impressed by this year. I’ve definitely been hugely affected by other pictures - from “Clouds of Sils Maria” to “Manglehorn” - but the title of Swanberg’s latest feature tells all. It wasn’t something I expected to enjoy quite as much as I did, and that’s what made the experience all the more rewarding. Its all-around great feel is not only due to the fantastic work behind the camera, but from its two leads Cobie Smulders and Gail Bean as well. Together, they just might be the most vibrant and funny on-screen pair of recent memory.Smulders, who’s most known for her roles in the “The Avengers” and the television series “Agents of Shield”, plays a Chicago high-school teacher who discovers she’s pregnant along with one of her graduating students. The two form an immediate bond, with Smulders’ character trying her best to get the promising student accepted at the nearby Illinois University. And, obviously, the film is mainly about them dealing with their shared situation. The setup isn’t particularly original, but that is easily overlooked once we see this delightful acting duo in full swing. Cobie Smulders succeeds in distancing herself from some of her larger-scale work, and the proper introduction of newcomer Gail Bean is certainly well-deserved. Their infectious back-and-forth compels you to keep watching and ultimately care about what happens to their characters.Beyond that, the film is beautifully shot and tightly edited (coming in at around ninety minutes). The camera never really strays from our two main characters, and this adds to the already intimate quality of the film. It undoubtedly solidifies Kris Swanberg as an important dramatic director, and serves as a perfect antidote for those tired of this summer’s blockbusters. If you get the chance to see this wonderful little movie, take it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQI2VL80OXEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOJICP8#wasThisHelpful","R3AQI2VL80OXEP","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first glimpse we get of Jake Gyllenhaal in “Southpaw” consists of his character preparing for  a pivotal boxing match at one of the biggest venues in the United States: Madison Square Garden. His trainer is wrapping his hands as he blares hip-hop from his headphones, all of this part of his process when getting ready for a fight. We’re quickly swept into the ring, where the blows are harsh and the blood flows. These scenes - the ones that are uncompromising and relentless - are the best in the film. And particularly, when Gyllenhaal is at his most remarkable.However, the movie is considerably more about a tragic event and how his character is forced to deal with the aftermath. This incident involves the death of his wife, and occurs only a few scenes after the ones I just described. This leads Billy Hope, the undefeated prize-fighter who Gyllenhaal plays, to lose his child to protective services and seek a new trainer after reaching the lowest point in his career. More than anything, it’s about his character trying to redeem himself (both in his daughter’s eyes and in boxing). And his new mentor and coach Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) is helping him to achieve that.For the most part, I found the movie to be an enjoyable ride. It certainly has a dark tone, that to be expected, but it’s up close and personal in a way that few studio-made films have been as of late. Gyllenhaal, as usual, puts his all into the performance. By all means, he IS this character. But as good as he is, some of the supporting cast (namely 50 Cent) aren’t able to keep up. There’s also a slight pacing problem, with several scenes that go on just a few minutes too long, this resulting in a movie that feels sluggish at times and certainly could’ve been tighter. But it’s definitely a solid drama worth seeing, and Jake Gyllenhaal’s strong performance will help you overlook the majority of its issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZ4W7O2AEQ7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BPM536#wasThisHelpful","R3QZ4W7O2AEQ7U","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The subjects of the new documentary “The Wolfpack” have to be some of the most odd people I’ve seen put to film all year. The individuals I’m talking about are a group of brothers who, throughout their childhood, were shut off from society and forced to stay in their New York City apartment. Being home-schooled and in a unique state of seclusion - in which they only got outside nine or ten times a year - they formed a religious love of movies. Without internet and with plenty of time on their hands, they compiled homemade scripts of their most treasured films (which range from “The Dark Knight” to “Gone With the Wind”). This, of course, all for the purpose of remaking them to their own delight. Cinema helps them pass the time and gain access to a bit of the world that they can’t actually see themselves.The opening sequence is most telling, in which they lovingly act out their favorite moments from Quentin Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs”. It’s at once extremely funny, with their cardboard guns and baggy suits, yet haunting in the same sense. It’s the definition of a fly-on-the-wall documentary, in which we’re not really sure how the filmmakers found these kids, much less were allowed into their lives. The fact that some of this footage even exists is a testament to the superb direction by Crystal Moselle.I found it captivating from beginning to end. The mystery of why these boys have been treated this way is handled excellently. Nothing is revealed too quickly, partly because the answers aren’t all that simple. It’s definitely a slow-build, but completely absorbing. You won’t be able to take your eyes off this family. The story of their lives is incredibly gripping, and absolutely worthy of this skillfully-made film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QHFQE8CVP1PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BFXFBS#wasThisHelpful","R3QHFQE8CVP1PT","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Dano is a fantastic actor, and I think Hollywood has started to realize that over the past few years. If I remember correctly, the first thing I ever saw him in was a small little movie called “Ruby Sparks”. I had never seen this guy before, but I thought he was pretty incredible. And from that day on, I made it my mission to see almost everything he’s ever been in. Of course, a few of them have slipped through the cracks, but I’ve seen the good majority of his on-screen work. Some of my personal favorites include the aforementioned as well as his roles in “The Extra Man” and “Meek’s Cutoff”. And his performance in “Love & Mercy” is no different, I just wish there was more of it.The film itself is split directly down the middle. As you may know, it’s the story of Brian Wilson (otherwise known as the frontman for The Beach Boys). But it’s by no means chronologically told. We cut to and fro from Brian’s formative years as a musician to his later days when he seems to be manipulated by a greedy therapist out to swindle him. In his younger years, he’s excellently played by Paul Dano, with John Cusack stepping in for the later part of his life. These are two different stories, and two different movies at that.The one that I was constantly enjoying and couldn’t get enough of was his early years of dealing with quick success, and trying to follow up on that with more genuine music that spoke to the listener. This struggle, the one that is parleyed with his confusion and fractured being that came about as he was much older, is far more interesting. John Cusack definitely tries his best along with Elizabeth Banks to capture that fractured state - and turns in a commendable performance along the way - but it simply can’t measure up to the electricity that is seen when Dano emerges. The result is a somewhat underwhelming movie, one that most definitely would’ve been better if entirely focused on one part of his life. However, one thing is certainly made clear, Paul Dano is sensational.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMMFCTD9CJHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01127XNHQ#wasThisHelpful","ROMMFCTD9CJHI","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“71” had my heart racing. It doesn’t stop. It doesn’t need to stop. The audience is thrown into a story with grit, one told in an uncompromising fashion. We don’t need any backstory. We don’t need any sort of setup. All we need is now. That now is war. Hellish war to be precise. But, it isn’t exactly your typical setting.What we’re seeing is the very beginning of what came to be called ‘The Troubles’. This is referring to a violent thirty-year conflict in Northern Ireland that mainly concerned the constitutional status of the country. However, if I may be blunt, the specifics don’t really matter. This isn’t a film that deals with a huge scope. Our story is right in front of us and is all the viewer needs: one soldier (that being Jack O’Connell of “Unbroken” fame). After a terrifying riot on the crowded streets of Belfast, this one soldier is accidentally abandoned by his unit and left to survive the night alone in a bewildering new landscape. He has people after him, doesn’t know who he can trust, and is as scared as can be.It’s certainly one of the most intense films I’ve seen all year and doesn’t let up. But, as I said earlier, it doesn’t need to. The audience is already emotionally attached from the first few scenes and continues to root for him as his safety is questioned. Yann Demange, a director that’s fairly new to the field, shows a natural knack for filmmaking and brilliantly brings this story to life alongside actor Jack O’Connell. Who, if you hadn’t already made notice of, should definitely do so now. His sensational performance floored me and ultimately drives the whole film. They’re a phenomenal team and are both ones to watch. Seek this film out, you won’t be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NIQ1DG7A4AN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC644#wasThisHelpful","R5NIQ1DG7A4AN","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ex Machina"", Alex Garland's directorial debut, has an eerie feeling to it. It's one of those science-fiction films that so perfectly creates a new world that we've never seen before, and because of this, the audience is subtly creeped out. At least, I was. Of course, it has its small moments that may remind you of another movie you've seen (or elements of it), but it's definitely one of the most original films of its kind. And when looking at how small of a budget they had to work with, what they were able to achieve is pretty remarkable.It all centers around a young programmer named Caleb - one of the top coders at the company Bluebook - who's selected to take part in a confidential experiment he knows nothing about. All he's aware of is that it's extremely important and that it's being conducted by Nathan, the company's talented CEO. He's flown to an isolated location and quickly finds that his task consists of interacting with the world's first true artificial intelligence (and that it's housed in the body of a beautiful girl). What we see are the sessions that take place between the two, in which they talk for hours and test whether or not she's consciously thinking herself or just imitating things she's seen or heard.It's a spellbinding film that manages to grow creepier as it progresses, and flows seamlessly from scene to scene. The dynamic between these characters is the most fascinating part of it all, with their relationships to each other constantly changing. And the actors who portray them - Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander - are dynamite together. This film solidifies Alex Garland as a director-to-watch, and he no doubt has a promising career ahead of him. I'm positive that this will serve as a template on how to make a great sci-fi film for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVHJ6PTTFGH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWPQNJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2RVHJ6PTTFGH5","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After thoroughly enjoying “Adult Beginners”, which I can easily say is one of the most hilarious and smart movies of the year, I’m curious to know why I had never seen Nick Kroll in any prominent film roles before (or noticed him when I did). The name alone may not mean much to you, him being an actor that has only slowly emerged into film and television over the past decade, but he’s certainly made his mark recently with his popular Comedy Central program “Kroll Show”. Bringing sketch comedy to the masses, he’s already gained a huge cult following and is sure to grow more with this new film. However, it’s not exactly what you might expect. It’s certainly very funny - with Kroll bringing the majority of the laughs - but its fair share of dramatic moments just may surprise fans of his signature over-the-top comedy.He plays Jake, a self-absorbed entrepreneur who seems to have everything going for him until his much-talked about tech company loses its sole manufacturer the eve before its launch. With a huge amount of investor money dissipating overnight - as well as a great deal of his own - he’s forced to leave Manhattan and seek support from his sister and brother-in-law at his childhood home (them being played by Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale). We see him try to get back on his feet and rediscover his family, all the while becoming a temporary nanny to his three year-old nephew.The writing is extremely funny and the realism of it all is spot-on, not to mention the fantastic acting from each member of the cast. Byrne and Kroll are perfect together, feeling as if they’re actual brother and sister, with some genuinely moving scenes that really blew me away. It’s an unexpected pleasure of a movie that I couldn’t recommend more, and will definitely be one of those that I’ll be happily revisiting for a long time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RES46ENYP6HJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5WKP5Q#wasThisHelpful","RES46ENYP6HJM","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Clouds of Sils Maria”, the latest work from auteur director Olivier Assayas, is one of those films that leaves a deep impression. It’s warm and intimate in ways movies simply aren’t anymore, and the characters in it are the same way. Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart - who play the ones we so closely get to know - are simply wonderful together, possibly being the most interesting duo you’ll see on screen all year. These people aren’t afraid to be vulnerable, or show their idiosyncrasies, and that’s precisely what makes them so human and comforting. It’s a movie that I got lost in (in a good way) and gravitated towards immediately.Binoche plays one of the most renowned actresses in Hollywood, having starred in a seminal play and film based on the same material that made her career twenty years earlier, but is now confronted with starring in a new stage production of that same play. She’s hesitant, but excepts the challenge, and the film centers around her struggle to deal with the difficult script that she hasn’t visited in so long, and her looming age over everything she does. That, along with the fascinating relationship she has with her assistant (Stewart), which quickly becomes the focus.Both of these women are charming beyond belief, spending the good majority of their screen-time together, and their constant rapport is one of the main reasons why I liked the film so much. Of course, you have breathtaking cinematography and a really distinct directing style from Assayas, but these characters are unmatched. We don’t simply get acquainted with them, we know them. It’s an immediate thing from the first few scenes alone. Each moment flows so beautifully to the next, and the precision is something to marvel at. That, in a nutshell, is why I found it to be so brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8V1VTEE70DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX4UZTG#wasThisHelpful","R1D8V1VTEE70DM","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s a distinct difference in a thriller and a horror movie, one that moviegoers don’t seem to be picking up on as of late. Thrillers - at least in my eyes - are films with an exciting plot, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole experience. And on the other hand, horror films are exactly as described: horrifying. They get under your skin and aren’t easily forgotten (the best example would be “The Shining”). And “The Lazarus Effect”, despite the way it’s being marketed, is not a horror film. It may provide cheap ‘scares’ that cause the audience to jump in that very moment, but it isn’t genuinely terrifying. Real horror movies cause sleepless nights and can frighten you to the core. This film most certainly does not. That, above all, is the main reason why this movie got on my nerves.The plot alone could make for a potentially interesting film: a group of medical students essentially trying to bring the dead back to life with a new serum they’ve created. However, it takes a ridiculous turn when one of the researchers is killed in an accident and the team is forced to test the serum on a human for the first time. Of course, things get out of control quickly and the rest of the movie is set up. I’m sure most of you can guess what happens.I’ll admit, I tried to look past some of the problems I had with the film during the first half and enjoy the chaos, but it swiftly became worse and worse. Olivia Wilde - an actress I usually enjoy - descended into an utterly laughable performance as the film progressed and the rest of the cast isn’t much different. At times, I felt as if I was watching some lost 70s movie that shouldn’t have ever been found.

"There aren’t many films that I’ve seen recently that warrant a second viewing. By the time the credits rolled, I had already (for the most part) decided my thoughts and felt I had fully grasped the movie as a whole. And though I may watch it again for pleasure, I don’t necessarily need to. So, I was quite surprised when I felt the need to re-watch “The Gambler”. I had seen flickers of greatness and wasn’t sure whether or not it was just in my head, or if every single critic that had bashed the movie was dead wrong. And for those reasons alone, I decided to give it another whirl. The second time confirmed my already established thoughts and much more. Trust me, this is not your average thriller (if it even falls under that category).At the center of the film is Mark Wahlberg’s character, who is the ‘Houdini’ (as one calls him) of gambling. He pulls things out of thin air and manages to win just about every time. But, the catch is, he doesn’t know when to stop. Hence the title. It’s a man’s struggle with debt, loved-ones, and his own reason for living. By day he’s a philosophizing English professor and by night a ferocious gambler. All of this is a distraction to him. To what, is fair-game to the audience.It’s slick filmmaking above all, but it’s even more than that, with an assured style that usually comes with an experienced director. However, I’m thinking it’s more to the writer’s credit in this case (who also brilliantly wrote “The Departed”). The most entertaining moments consist of the back-and-forth between Wahlberg and John Goodman’s character, who plays one of the many gangsters our protagonist’s involved with. What surprised me - and pleased me - about the whole experience was its hesitance to include an abundance of action. It could have easily been that kind-of mindless, chase scene-driven film that I’ve slowly grown to hate. But, it’s more of a slow-burn. It doesn’t reveal everything all at once and leaves a certain air of mystery for the audience to ponder over.

"WOW. Put simply, that was the single thought running through my head as I left the crowded screening of “It Follows”. I noticed a distinct haze of uncertainty hanging over the throng of people leaving the theater, none of them fully realizing or understanding what they just saw. But luckily, I was there in a sense that they weren’t. I connected, and knew what I witnessed. Something odd. Something out of the ordinary. A horror experience that doesn’t come along often. Not one without flaws, just one with more interesting ideas at play than your average “scary” movie. Infused with a synth, electronic soundtrack that gets your blood pumping long before the characters, it quickly finds its own creepy rhythm and entrances you from then on.The story is pretty straightforward, that is, once you know what you’re dealing with (even if the characters don’t). A twenty-something girl is involved in a sexual encounter and, due to this, is followed by an unknown force that wants her dead. This force is passed on from person to person strictly through sexual means, and is the only way to get rid of the threatening presence. Unlike most films of the same genre, we have no idea where it could go. Its unpredictable in every sense of the word and keeps the audience guessing throughout.One thing I really admired about it was its intimate nature. Most horror films tend to stand back a bit and let the audience be a mere bystander. However, “It Follows” does the exact opposite. The viewer is right there with the main characters as the action unfolds, never feeling disconnected. We know these people, and feel for them as such. David Robert Mitchell shows great strength as a director - harkening us back to John Carpenter and other horror masters - but bringing a natural flair of his own that will transfix and mystify. Don’t miss this modern, unsettling gem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4D94CG8JYXYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVNN5W#wasThisHelpful","R4D94CG8JYXYP","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In just a matter of months, “Cake” - the latest starring role for Jennifer Aniston - went from being on every Oscars short-list to relatively forgotten by most moviegoers. There was much buzz surrounding Aniston’s performance, some even saying she would receive a Best Actress nomination, but that quickly dissipated when her name was no where to be found on the Academy Awards ballot. And here’s the question most of you are wanting to know the answer to: was this deserved? Is it in fact not an Oscar-worthy film, or was it wrongly left out? Frankly, I don’t really have a straight answer. However, what I can say is, the movie itself is not anything extraordinary. The only reason I feel it succeeds for the most part is because of Jennifer Aniston’s dedicated performance. Much like “Wild”, it’s a film that simply wouldn’t work without its strong female lead.It centers around a woman named Claire who is, more or less, contemplating suicide every day of her life. She’s dealing with a traumatic event that is unknown to the audience (until about half-way through) and has become addicted to Oxycontin and many other drugs. She’s constantly wallering in her own self-pity and the only person she has to care for her is a maid that is willing to fuel her drug addiction.As you can probably tell, it isn’t the most cheery movie. It mainly deals with themes of soul-searching and trying to get past something you cannot change. The main thing that struck me about it, and what sets it apart, is that it’s obviously a story directed at women. There’s been many films about similar subjects, but most of them are from a man’s perspective. The fact that it isn’t afraid to depict a flawed woman’s struggle with her own mortality is refreshing. But, that isn’t to say the movie is without its flaws. It was a tad too sentimental for my taste and definitely could have been cut-down by about twenty minutes. But overall, it’s definitely one to check out if you’re even mildly interested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKLUGZFCQAO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY6CM7U#wasThisHelpful","REKLUGZFCQAO5","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Unfinished Business” is the hybrid of two types of films. At times, it feels as if it wants to emulate the comedy seen in movies like “Neighbors” with its raunchy dialogue, but at others it seems to mimic the heartfelt moments that can be seen in stuff like last year’s “Delivery Man”. And it’s also no coincidence that the same writer/director of “Delivery Man” is also at the helm of Vince Vaughn’s latest work.To be completely honest, Vaughn is the best part about the whole experience (if you can call it that). He’s able to bring his usual charm and do more than phone-in his performance, and I respect him for that. However, the movie itself is not very good. I can’t really say that it’s bad - I certainly laughed out loud more than once - but it isn’t really good either. Though it sufficiently entertained me for the most part, it felt irrelevant the second the credits rolled. That’s not a feeling that I get often. And though the first few months of the year are usually the worst for mainstream movies, various comedies from the past year like “Ride Along” and “That Awkward Moment” still managed to win me over. “Unfinished Business” is different though. It felt like a placeholder for 20th Century Fox before they’re able to replace that slot with their big summer blockbusters to come. 'The plot is obviously recycled from many other party movies like “The Hangover”, the only difference being these three men are on a business trip. We see them let loose, realize that they all they need is their families, roll credits. Frankly, it’s forgettable at best. I might have enjoyed it if I stumbled upon it on Netflix at 3 AM and had nothing better to do, but the key is, I didn’t. I paid $9.75 to see a movie that I’ll fail to recall a month from now. Whether or not that sounds appealing is up to you. It certainly doesn’t to me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWO7B1D54LPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBRGMI6#wasThisHelpful","RRWO7B1D54LPN","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Julianne Moore has brought us countless interesting and complex performances over the years, some of my favorites being her roles in “Boogie Nights” and “The Kids Are All Right” (two drastically different movies). And she keeps with her now normal amount of excellence in her latest, “Still Alice”. Managing to prove yet again the wide extent of her acting ability, she takes on this challenging character with a huge amount of dedication and finesse. Heartbreaking and fascinating to watch, she brings many levels to Alice’s extremely difficult situation.The situation I’m talking about - as many of you know - is her being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The film revolves around the deterioration of her memory, simultaneously showing her drive to keep her life together in every way possible. And despite what you might think, it’s a relatively slow process. Though she may receive the diagnosis in what feels like overnight, she gradually loses her mental functions over the course of a few years and can’t properly think or do much for herself.The picture ultimately rests on Moore’s shoulders and she handles it superbly. She may have help from a talented supporting cast including Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart, but their characters are never the absolute focus. It doesn’t overwhelm the audience with her family members’ problems like so many other films centered around disease. It simply concentrates on Alice and her daily struggles instead of dwelling on how it affects those around her. That, above all, is one of the many reasons why I found the film so engaging. I had slight problems here and there - the biggest being with the fairly melodramatic ending - but overall I found the movie to be especially powerful. In fact, it almost brought me to tears about halfway through. When a movie can affect you that profoundly is when you know it has succeeded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRY5UG1ARAY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSNA4I#wasThisHelpful","R1CRY5UG1ARAY8","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The word that keeps coming to mind in relation to my thoughts on “A Most Violent Year” is exquisite. I’m primarily speaking to the elegant, yet fierce, feel of the film and the complex duo of characters within. It’s a movie that effortlessly manages to pull off something that most never can, a perfect balance of delicacy and intensity in almost every scene. That fusion is really what makes the movie great, along with the commanding performances at the center from both Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain.Taking place in the early 80s, it focuses on a young, power-hungry businessman (Isaac) struggling to protect his livelihood in any way he sees fit. We witness his many attempts to keep his oil company afloat amidst one of the most crime-ridden winters in history. But, unlike his extremely determined wife (Chastain), he doesn’t feel the need to act in a violent or aggressive way to do so. He approaches things in a calm, reserved fashion - for the most part - and tries to keep everything in his life together.It struck me as one of those pictures that will slowly garner a huge audience and appreciation over the years, particularly because it speaks to a time and place that isn’t typically being shown in this day and age. We may have films that deal with overbearing crime in big cities, but not ones that compare in style and resonance. That’s the beauty of this film, it doesn’t hit you right off the bat as deeply as it does the weeks after you’ve seen it. It allows its audience to infer, and the more you mull it over the more you see the brilliance. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly was for me. It doesn’t miss a beat, and neither do the actors involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4VDZLY6MOXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNELHU8#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4VDZLY6MOXO","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sheer fearlessness that David Oyelowo brings to his performance in “Selma” is something that can’t be rivaled by anything else I’ve seen this year. He doesn’t simply mimic, he embodies, and inhabits his role as Martin Luther King Jr. magnificently. Any reservations that I may have had about the film went out the door seconds after it began. It’s a movie that spellbinds from beginning to end and is competently crafted in a way that most biographical pictures aren’t.But then again, it’s not really a biography. It doesn’t aim to cover the whole life of an individual. In fact, it only focuses on one key aspect of it. In this case, that happens to be King’s crusade to procure equal voting rights through his march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. What we see is the inner workings of that, the trials and tribulations that King and his many supporters are faced with. And one of the main strong points is the way each event is handled, in a way that never feels as if its holding back. What we see on the screen isn’t far off from the actual events, and that’s the way it should be, especially when you’re dealing with an issue this huge.Oyelowo presents a robust, nuanced performance and works perfectly alongside each of the other actors (another notable one being Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King). It’s an ensemble if I’ve ever seen one - with character actor after character actor - all fantastic.

"The experience that I had with “Inherent Vice” was an odd one, but we are talking about Paul Thomas Anderson, so that was certainly expected. From the poster alone - with an afro-bearing Joaquin Phoenix surrounded by a number of the peculiar characters he meets - I figured it would be something unlike most films being released today. And having now seen it, I can confirm that wholeheartedly.It’s a movie that, for the most part, makes up for its flaws in the form of originality and gusto. From the first frame, it knows what it wants to be and continues to stick with that tempo right until the end. Because of this, it won’t be for everyone. It’s a psychedelic trip of a movie, taking you on a weird and interesting journey that has its fair share of goofy moments and unusual happenings.The film centers around Doc Sportello (Phoenix), a private investigator who gets quickly wrapped up in the kidnapping case of a local billionaire land developer and briskly begins a search to find him. What he doesn’t realize is how hard that’s going to be, especially when he’s stoned out of his mind half of the time. So through the fog of marijuana and alcohol, he meets eccentric character after eccentric character, all in good fun. It’s just about as silly as it gets, but once you’re on board you succumb to the charming atmosphere of the whole thing and its weird look at the world. You’ve also got a great early 60s and 70s soundtrack that serves as the glue to keep everything together.It’s definitely got several weak points, mostly in the pacing and a few scenes that seemed out of place (particularly when Martin Short shows up), but I liked it quite a bit. I found it refreshing amidst some of the more conventional things I’ve seen this year. If you like unordinary, quirky stories then this comes highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R83YAYUO2C9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXIIZ3W#wasThisHelpful","R3R83YAYUO2C9N","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can’t say that I see the appeal when it comes to “American Sniper”. Frankly, I don’t understand what all the fuss has been about. This is a film that I found to be sub-standard in almost every way possible and by no means anything remarkable. It’s something that seems to have absolutely no point whatsoever and fails to find one along the way, leaving the audience left to watch meaningless recounted events. And after a while, it gets a bit monotonous.As you may know, the film centers around the infamous Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, focusing on his four tours of duty in Iraq. We see him grapple with keeping his fellow soldiers alive while also pursuing leads on various al-Qaeda members.And what could be an interesting story - possibly one of value - is reduced to a tiresome gimmick revolved around whether or not he can snipe down person after person. It seems to have been made just to prove the fact that he is “the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history”. With flashbacks to his childhood straight out of a TV movie and unnecessary jumps from his time at home to his time serving, it never quite finds a rhythm. I couldn’t tell if it was trying to be an intense war flick or a study on his PTSD, and I’m not sure that Clint Eastwood knew either.Bradley Cooper manages to deliver a solid performance here but he’s certainly done much better work and has virtually no chemistry with co-star Sienna Miller. How anyone could consider this an Oscar-worthy picture baffles me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3R8DQ9ZIJFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHVCFI#wasThisHelpful","R3A3R8DQ9ZIJFR","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The performance that Miles Teller gives in Damien Chazelle’s new film “Whiplash” reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro’s in “Raging Bull”. They both play tenacious, unrelenting characters and do so in a way that can’t be forgotten and stays with the viewer long after the movie’s over. They may be pursuing different things, De Niro with boxing and Teller with drumming, but they’re each after the same goal: greatness. And that’s what this film is all about, reaching a goal that is relative to the person trying to achieve it.In this case, it centers around a guy who never feels understood. He’s attending the most prestigious music school in the country and is constantly working to be ‘one of the greats’. Who, in his eyes, is someone like Buddy Rich. Then unexpectedly, he’s given a chance to prove his chops on the renowned studio band instructed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). He’s soon met with Fletcher’s abusive teaching tactics and is continuously tested under pressure. The question is, can he withstand.It tests the psyche of a young man and shows how far a person will go for something they love and want to do for the rest of their life. That being said, it’s a harsh movie. The audience is thrown right into the pressure cooker along with Teller, and if you’re not ready for it, it can be unsettling and scary. But that’s one of the main reasons why I liked it. Not only does it test the main character, it tests the viewer. You also can’t deny the masterful performances on display and finesse that the director brings along with them. Needless to say, this is a must-see. If I had seen it in 2014, it would’ve undoubtedly made my top ten.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJF14EN0OKCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT3AUYO#wasThisHelpful","R2EJF14EN0OKCP","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Birdman” is such a hard movie to describe. I honestly don’t know where to start. It’s one of those films that doesn’t fit into any one genre (or any two for that matter) and its wide array of interesting characters can’t be easily summed up. But, that may be the reason why the film is so absorbing. It has so many original qualities that certainly don’t fit into the standard mold of what a star-studded movie should be, instead putting a strange (but fascinating) spin on your typical drama.Set in the heart of New York City, it focuses on Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a washed-up actor who gained fame for his role as the iconic superhero Birdman. Trying to overcome his ego 12 years later, he adapts and stars in his own Broadway play hoping to reclaim his spot as an important actor. We see the ups and downs of this production along with the odd way his psyche works, his inner voice being the Birdman character.There’s also many other facets, including the quarrels between Keaton and Edward Norton’s character (one of the main stars of the play), all equally entertaining. The writing is top-notch, serving up witty and funny moments throughout, and each member of the cast delivers a fantastic performance (my favorite being Norton). It also includes a brilliant musical score, entirely done with drums. And despite its flaws, mostly in a few goofy moments, it isn’t one to miss. The concept alone is remarkable and the execution isn’t far off, give this one a watch, it will be one of the standouts in the upcoming awards season.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HR47TVFJ4WJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO49JEI#wasThisHelpful","R3HR47TVFJ4WJ6","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Interview” is an extremely ridiculous movie, but if you’re a fan of either Seth Rogen or James Franco, you probably knew that going in. It’s a raunchy, foul-mouthed comedy with an unstoppable energy that requires the audience to be on board or off. And people that enjoy this new brand of hilarity - myself included - will have a lot of fun with it. It’s just a matter of accepting and reveling in the absurdity.The plot itself is absolutely ludicrous (but in all the best ways), centered around a flamboyant talk show host and his loyal producer who are granted an exclusive interview with Kim Jong-un. But, there’s a catch. The CIA wants them to “take him out”. Not for drinks, not to dinner, and certainly not to party. So, these two have no choice but to attempt to assassinate the leader of North Korea. Yeah, it gets a bit crazy.The humor is obviously akin to the kind-of stuff in “This is the End” and “Neighbors”, so if you weren’t a fan, you’re probably not going to like this. And as it goes on, it becomes increasingly silly and preposterous. But that’s precisely why I got such a kick out of it. It’s refreshing to see a movie that isn’t afraid to ‘go there’ and even be willing to step on another country’s toes to do so. But don’t get me wrong, this isn’t an offensive movie. For anyone who found this even remotely disrespectful - especially considering the ridiculous lengths this movie goes - doesn’t understand the satire. This isn’t a modern comedic masterpiece, but it’s throughly entertaining and comes highly recommended. Rogen and Franco are pitch-perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QA5B3X6LXTMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNRD7Y4#wasThisHelpful","R3QA5B3X6LXTMS","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve never been particularly fond of biographical pictures. Most of the time, they seem to exist only as a vehicle for an actor or studio that are usually solely focused on gaining awards or recognition. The movies themselves seem to always lack in quality and almost never hold up as the years go on.Now, there have been a few films in recent years that have broken this pattern (things like “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Philomena”) and “The Imitation Game” is one to add to that very short list. It’s a movie with strengths that go way beyond the performances - though they are incredible - and resonates with the viewer in a deep way.The film centers around Alan Turing, a mathematician who was hired by the British Government in World War Two to attempt to crack the ‘unbreakable’ German communication system nicknamed Enigma. We see his time at a top secret code-breaking school in Bletchley Park along with a skilled team as he creates a machine that will break the complicated cypher (and revolutionize the world).Benedict Cumberbatch - who most of you know from “Star Trek Into Darkness” and the television series “Sherlock” - heads the cast as Turing, bringing an emotional and layered performance to the table. He’s really what makes this movie thrive, but not without help from an excellent supporting cast and the attention to detail that director Morten Tyldum shows throughout.It’s an engrossing film that isn’t hard to get behind, especially when you get to the heart of the main character, and deserves all the positive buzz surrounding it. It’s a superb film all-around and contains one of the most memorable and interesting performances of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JHB681CLW1IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FZ074#wasThisHelpful","R2JHB681CLW1IB","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a performance from Adam Sandler. That is, aside from his role in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" a full twelve years ago. He's an actor that's always had a certain potential that seemed to be wasted on the pointless, raunchy comedies he's churned out for the past few decades.But, hopefully his emotional performance in ""Men, Women & Children"" serves as a precursor to more interesting work to come. Despite its flaws, this is one of the most timely and deeply affecting pieces of work I've seen in a long time.It's a movie that tries to tackle many subjects, all under the bubble of technology. At the forefront, we see Sandler's character struggling with his marriage and trying to work out some of his various problems. There's also several other intertwining stories, some that deal with infidelity and young love, and others that handle issues with self-image and peer pressure. They're not all equal in quality (that being expected), but each one certainly has something to say.The most well-developed segment includes Ansel Elgort (who you may know from ""The Fault in Our Stars""), playing a teen struggling with having just quit his high-school football team. We see him concerned over the meaning of life and this is only alleviated as he gets to know a girl named Brandy. Their relationship in the film is beautiful - and so is most of the movie - with a few exceptions here and there. It's a film that starts off a bit rocky and doesn't really find its footing until the first thirty minutes have past. But once it does, it proves to be shockingly true and current. These are issues that people are dealing with on a daily basis, and it handles them in a touching and true manner that can't be rivaled by the majority of mainstream movies out today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YCA9MZ9OWODK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGL7JPE#wasThisHelpful","R2YCA9MZ9OWODK","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most important film you will see all year - possibly ever - is “Citizenfour”. This is the single-most groundbreaking documentary I’ve ever laid eyes on, surpassing some of Michael Moore’s greatest works. The amount of people that will be affected due to the information in this film is staggering. Every American owes it to themselves to see this. It will undoubtedly change the way you operate and think in more ways than one.As you may already know, the film centers around Edward Snowden, the much-talked about ‘whistleblower’ that leaked an enormous amount of top secret information concerning the National Security Agency. It revealed the many ways that the NSA was spying on billions of people, creating a huge political conversation.However, “Citizenfour” in no way participates in that conversation. It doesn’t try to debate whether it was right or wrong for them to do that, it leaves all of that up to its subject. That’s one of the countless reasons why it succeeds. It isn’t a documentary that needs a ton of flare, it’s actually quite the opposite. It states the facts, lets us decide how we feel about it, and all in the most simplistic and brilliant manner.The majority of it takes place in one hotel room where Laura Poitras (the director of the film) and Glenn Greenwald (the first journalist to leak the story) listen to everything Snowden has to say. We watch them go over the program files and documents that serve as the evidence of what the NSA has done - scenes that include astounding stats and figures - those being some of the most powerful moments I’ve ever witnessed. It’s a gut-punch of a movie, but one that’s undeniably needed.

"“Gone Girl” is fantastic. There, I said it. It’s one of the most thrilling American movies I’ve seen in the past five years. However, I can’t say I’m surprised. David Fincher is known for bringing us milestones in cinema (being responsible for classics such as “Fight Club” and “Seven”) and you can easily add his latest film to the long list of spellbinding and transfixing movies he’s been a part of. Not only is it a genius piece of art, but it’s daring in its storytelling, especially considering how wide of an audience the film has.Set in a small Missouri town, it centers around Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a man who may or may not have killed his wife. At least, that’s what everyone’s trying to figure out. His wife goes missing, he’s suspected, and we watch things unravel from there.It’s riveting, strangely creepy at times, and isn’t afraid to show sexuality (which most mainstream films are too afraid to touch). Not to mention the exceptional performances from the whole cast, mainly our two leads (Affleck and Rosamund Pike), but also from other standouts like Tyler Perry and Kim Dickens.One of my favorite aspects was the little splices of comedy that seemed to break up the more tense moments, showing how impeccable the writing is. And you when you couple that with the beautiful cinematography, you have a near perfect film. I urge you to the see this.

"I'm not sure what to say when it comes to David Ayer's latest film ""Fury"". It's a movie that rides a fine line between mediocre and good. There were moments when I realized how great this film could have been, but those split-seconds were sparse. It's not as if it's particularly unpleasant, It's just not anything new, and none of the characters stuck out to me.The plot is pretty commonplace, set in the heart of World War Two. We follow Brad Pitt's character, a battered sergeant nick-named `Wardaddy', who has his hands full commanding his five-man crew in their cramped tank. Dealing with the harsh realities of war and a new man aboard, a young soldier who hasn't been properly trained, they're forced to fight outnumbered and outgunned.The movie is exactly what you might expect and that's probably why I didn't enjoy it. I was able to predict every move, all the way down to each character's arc, and it wasn't an original experience in any way. It felt as if they went down the list of every great war film collecting each trope they could and threw them in as needed.The most redeeming aspect is the cinematography (which I found to be Oscar-worthy) but the other aspects can't match its greatness. The acting is fine, with Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf bringing the most to the table, but as a whole it's pretty substandard. If you're a fan of the genre you'll probably like this, but I'd recommend skipping it and revisiting classics like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Patton"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TV0QRKFJHFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMC0W9G#wasThisHelpful","R10TV0QRKFJHFU","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most talented and reliable actors alive today. He’s blown me away in more movies than I can name (some of my favorites being “Donnie Darko”, “Prisoners”, and “Enemy”) and his latest role as the sleazy crime reporter Lou Bloom even further proves his genius. He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. “Nightcrawler” is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. It’s a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyone’s level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films I’ve seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character. Everything about this movie enchanted me: the darkly comic moments, dedicated performances, and dynamite writing. Add all that up and you have one of my favorite films of the year.

"""Kelly and Cal"" is one of those movies that starts out in an amazing way. We get to know our main character, Kelly, who is fresh from having a baby only six weeks earlier with her husband and is feeling exhausted and overworked. In comes the hilarious, handicapped teenager living next door who serves as the antidote to all her problems. They have laughs, drink beer, and start to build a relationship that is more meaningful than anything either of them have had in a long time. But though it starts off well (maybe even excellent) it soon deteriorates in a slow decline that ends when the credits roll. And the disappointment wouldn't mean much if the film hadn't given you a taste of what it could've been, but unfortunately, it does.Some of the best scenes at the beginning include the two of them bulls***ting and having a great time talking about their problems, and nothing more than that. All either of them needs is a friend or simply just someone to talk to. But the movie turns into something it shouldn't be, something that's extremely cliche and never needed to happen, a romance.Just like so many other films, we see them start to connect and their forbidden relationship ensues. She has a husband and a baby, he's under 18, I think you can see what's coming. And frankly, it doesn't work. It tries to become emotional, possibly pulling at your heartstrings, but by the time that happens you could care less. There's so many moments when I was cursing under my breath hoping that the movie  wouldn't go down the road it does.And what's even worse, the two leads are great together. Juliette Lewis (Kelly) and Jonny Weston (Cal) have so much potential that is wasted, and try their hardest to work with the been-there-done-that material, but even they can't save the film. It's a huge letdown, and one that stung.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKZ0YN7S2A8NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBO0QMO#wasThisHelpful","RKZ0YN7S2A8NI","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It’s been forty-seven years since George Takei began his iconic role as Sulu on the Star Trek television series, and since then he’s gone on to participate in an animated show along with six feature films portraying the same character. But what most people outside of his intimate fan-base don’t realize is that throughout the bulk of his acting career he was forced to hide his homosexuality, fearing he would lose his job and other subsequent parts he hoped to get.But now with battles over same-sex marriage starting to see a hopeful end, he’s become deeply imbedded in the fight for gay rights. And with his position as official announcer on The Howard Stern Show, has been quite upfront about his orientation.And “To Be Takei” doesn’t make a huge deal out of it, which is one of the main reasons I liked it. It’s a documentary that treats its subject as is, and doesn’t try to explain his many odd (but hilarious) characteristics.As he says himself, his “life has been transformed as fantastically as science fiction”, and he’s got a point. From spending four years in various internment camps during World War 2, where American citizens of Japanese descent were rounded up and put after Pearl Harbor, to becoming a sort-of pop culture icon contained in his own bubble far away from the hubbub of Hollywood.And the film captures his personality superbly, focusing on his constant trips to comic-cons and conventions accompanied by his Husband Brad (with their relationship also serving as a huge focal point).It may not be a documentary that’s in anyway breaking ground, but to me, it didn’t matter. It’s a light, fun movie that will be savored by fans of Takei.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8M11Q4KZHC9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV8IE7U#wasThisHelpful","R8M11Q4KZHC9R","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s few actors that I can comfortably watch suffer. Not necessarily in the way you may be thinking, like being harmed, but more in a mid-life crisis type sense. Maybe in a drama that concerns a family member dying or a couple that’s having trouble raising their kids, something that’s familiar. To me, it always seems a bit too cliche and something I’ve seen time and time again. It’s boring.But every now and then there’s a movie that may deal with issues I’ve seen before but since it stars one of those people, I don’t mind as much. They elevate the film to a level that grabs my attention that it wouldn’t have had before. One of those key people is Zach Braff.His name may not ring a bell right away but you may know him from his directorial debut “Garden State” (which he also wrote and starred in) that caused quite a stir at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, and has now become a cult hit. It’s a delightful little movie that is certainly better than “Wish I Was Here”, his latest venture, but they share an undeniable aura of sweetness and authenticity. You can tell that he’s coming from a genuine place and drawing directly from his own experiences.And that’s the main reason why I give his new movie, flaws and all, a pass. It follows a father struggling with chasing his dream and trying to keep his spirits up as bad news continues to pile on, teaching his kids about moving forward in life. It’s a movie for regular people. And though it doesn’t succeed in every theme it tries to get across, and may try too hard to be funny, it still moved me and is undoubtedly more emotionally rich than most films out now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QO5NS5LNI3QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJDR97I#wasThisHelpful","R2QO5NS5LNI3QF","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The One I Love” is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It’s the kind of thing that lingers in your psyche for days and it’s something you’ll still be mulling over weeks after you’ve seen it. It’s a powerhouse of a movie: mind-bending, smart, original, and ultimately satisfying. But it’s definitely an odd experience and one that I can’t reveal too much about, though it’s completely genius in so many ways.The film centers around a married couple played by Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss, who after going through many struggles in trying to rekindle their relationship, decide on taking a getaway trip to a secluded cottage recommended by their therapist. But after only one night, they discover some strange things happening, and that’s just about all I can say without spoiling things.I guess you could say that it enters into the sci-fi realm, but at its core is a more personal story. From the first scene alone, Duplass and Moss show their outstanding chemistry that ends up carrying the film to its climactic ending. Not to mention the brilliant (and sometimes unsettling) music that interlaces perfectly with the tension.And most of all, what I really admired about it was how logical the writing was. Every time I tried to anticipate what the characters were going to do or how they’d react, I was wrong. They didn’t react to things in a typical movie manner, where they may do something stupid just to further the film’s plot. They acted as normal people, showing just how refreshing this movie really is.It’s beautifully shot, acted with fantastic grace, and is easily one of my favorite films of the year so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHLDTXQC06TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB6KDHG#wasThisHelpful","RNHLDTXQC06TM","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Giver"", as you might expect, is in the same sort-of batch of young adult films like ""The Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"". Usually set in a cold dystopian future, these kinds of stories center around one character fighting for change. They also tend to contain a cliched love affair that never ceases to seem forced and overdone. And most of all, they're bland, with this one being no exception. In fact, every aspect of the movie seems to be coated in a dry and uninspired element.Taking place in a world without color and originality, it follows a teenager named Jonas who is assigned as the new receiver of memories. Being the only person besides his predecessor who knows the past (and isn't brainwashed), he must save his world from an eternal unknowingness and return the memories to the citizens. But obviously, things don't go as planned and he's pitted against his own government in order to save the people.It certainly isn't a terrible idea for a plot, I actually remember liking the book it's based on, but the genesis of the story doesn't allow any of the actors to shine. Jeff Bridges, who co-stars as the previous `receiver', is the only one who comes close to an interesting performance. The rest of the cast including Brenton Thwaites and Meryl Streep (as well as a cameo from Taylor Swift) were too wooden for my taste. Overall, it's not something I could recommend. The action scenes, if you could call them that, are scarce and the characters aren't nearly able to hold the film up on their own. It's also far too dull and gloomy to hold the audience's attention and never improves as it goes on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCPXZIB32GH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQOQFPW#wasThisHelpful","R2PCPXZIB32GH1","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can’t exactly explain why or how I ended up liking “Let’s Be Cops” as much as I did. I guess it’s one of those situations where my expectations were at such an average level, mixed with the fact that I was really in need of something to fill the void of late summer, that I was able to just sit back and enjoy myself. Because frankly, on paper this movie doesn’t really work. The plot alone is extremely ridiculous, but luckily the actors bring the film alive and push the reality of their shenanigans to the back of your mind. And though it does require you to suspend a good amount of your disbelief, it just may surprise you with the amount of laughs to be had.Set in Los Angeles, it follows two best friends who decide on attending a costume party as full fledged cops. Suddenly realizing that people are mistaking them for the real deal, they begin to take advantage of their circumstances as they up the ante more and more. But simultaneously they become wrapped up in the local mob and must complete a mission they got themselves into.Told in a hilarious self-aware style that makes fun of the normal buddy-cop cliches, it proves to be more original than anticipated. The lead duo played by Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. show great chemistry and deliver a series of uproariously funny moments that seem to never end. It may not be the most sophisticated comedy (with this being more on the raunchy side) but I still got a huge kick out of it and laughed considerably more than I did in other comedies like “Neighbors” and “22 Jump Street”. It’s a pleasant surprise that I would highly recommend to those interested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQM8WGZKEIZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO7Y44U#wasThisHelpful","R3UQM8WGZKEIZC","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” is the perfect example of a movie that isn’t made for me. It’s main demographic is children from the age of 5 to 10 years-old, and for that group, it’s probably the best thing they’ve seen all year. But unlike them, I wasn’t expecting anything extraordinary. It looked to be a harmless, cheesy, and occasionally funny action-flick that wouldn’t be a total bust. And as suspected, that’s exactly what it was. It’s one of those films that you won’t remember 24 hours after you’ve seen it, but in this case that doesn’t matter. For what it is and what it’s meant to do, it’s not half-bad (at least in a campy sort-of way).A remake of the classic story, it follows a lovable group of mutated turtles who are forced to face-off with Shredder, an evil gang leader taking over New York City. And for the most part, it’s nothing special. It’s your standard Michael Bay-type action with jokes sprinkled in here and there, the funniest coming from Michaelangelo. But the reason I’m giving it a pass is because the target viewers don’t really care about some of its flaws, like the acting from Megan Fox or the ridiculous writing.They’re simply hoping to laugh a bit and see their favorite turtles fly around and kick some butt, and in my opinion, it achieves that. As I was watching, I looked around and only saw pure joy on the kids’ faces, some of them even cheering when the turtles were winning. And though I may not think the film is great by my standards, I could tell they were loving it. So if you have kids, I encourage you to give this a shot. It may not be your cup of tea, but it most certainly will be theirs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJ98VFMNOUOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1X58S#wasThisHelpful","R3LJ98VFMNOUOE","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year ago Marvel Studios created quite a bit of conversation after announcing a film adaptation of one of their lesser-known comic book properties, that being ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". And I know most of you were wondering (including myself) what that even was, and what the movie would entail. Not only is it a series that few people know about, but its one that many doubted could be transformed to the screen. Packed to the brim with epic space voyages and galactic wars, it would certainly need a huge budget and a talented director to fine tune and re-work the source material. And as luck would have it, they found just that with James Gunn who some may know from his work on the horror flick ""Slither"" or even 2010's ""Super"". Finally proving his comic brilliance on a larger scale, he's made one of the smartest and most crowd-pleasing summer blockbusters of the year.Taking place on several planets far from Earth, it focuses on a ravaging thief named Peter Quill (also known as Starlord). After finding a mysterious orb that is coveted by Ronan, a villain who's willing to kill for this powerful prize-possession, we see him clumsily assemble The Guardians of the Galaxy in an effort to stop the inevitable destruction. And what ensues is a fantastic mixture of slapstick comedy and an all-out action bonanza that will surely surprise and delight you for the two hour runtime.Chock-full of superb performances coupled with an unforgettable 80's soundtrack, it's an incredibly re-watchable movie that will leave you wanting more as the credits roll. And though I may not hold it as highly as ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", I still couldn't recommend it enough, having seen it twice already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IP02R0TN39U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM95Y#wasThisHelpful","R35IP02R0TN39U","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can safely say that “Life Itself”, the new feature film detailing Roger Ebert’s life, is one of the most touching and brave documentaries I’ve ever seen. It’s the kind of movie that isn’t afraid to portray a man flaws-and-all, and also isn’t afraid to be honest and true. It’s a work of art that’s drenched in love and celebrates something that Ebert loved to death, movies.But even beyond that, the film sets out to discover the man behind the icon. Not necessarily the controversial reviews he wrote (though they do touch on that), but more about his unequaled love for his family and his impact on everyone he met. From Martin Scorsese and other famous filmmakers to his close friends and colleagues, we hear intimate and fascinating stories that turn a figure into a tangible, relatable human being.Candidly showing his difficult bout with cancer and losing the ability to speak in 2006 (and also how he continued writing long after), it’s endlessly heartfelt and successful in bringing the audience close to a man that few knew well. Director Steve James, who most may know for his epic documentary “Hoop Dreams” which was nominated for an Oscar back in ’94, proves that he can step outside of his normal filmmaking style and focus on a more biographical story.With beautiful cinematography and a wonderful abundance of clips from ""Siskel & Ebert & the Movies”, “Life Itself” is a loving and important documentary that I relished from beginning to end. Not only is it one of the best films of the year, it’s one that will stand the test of time and will be talked about decades from now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMHYQXKHZ9BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIRFVNK#wasThisHelpful","RGMHYQXKHZ9BX","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seems again and again, faith-based movies seem to always get the short end of the stick and never usually turn out well.

"It’s hard to remember a time when a teenager’s Friday night consisted of hanging at the local drive-in and terms like ‘going steady’ or ‘ boss’ were frequently used, especially for this generation. Much of the youth these days are so attached to their phones (and technology in general) that unlike the kids of the 60s, have been robbed of so many weekends of just aimlessly driving with friends and having the luxury of nowhere to go. And often, movies that try to capture those picturesque moments in time aren’t successful and there’s only been a few gems over the years that have done it. One in particular that jumpstarted the careers of many of the young actors involved and is a sort of love-story dedicated to that time period, is “American Graffiti”.Spanning only one night in the lives of a group of high school graduates, some that may be going off to college and others with no plan whatsoever, it perfectly encapsulates that crucial time of indecision when finally leaving the nest may not seem like the smartest idea. We also see many relationships (whether romantic or not) be put to the test, as most of the main characters are trying to figure out who are really important to them as they move into adulthood.  But the one thing that I certainly took away from the film, and you should to, is that that move isn’t as easy as it looks.And the ensemble of great actors express that magnificently, with the standout being Richard Dreyfuss. George Lucas also directs beautifully, keeping all the various stories balanced and bringing them to a nice resolution, proving that some films are timeless enough to remain relevant today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R393AJL22QOVSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QBWU02#wasThisHelpful","R393AJL22QOVSI","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are few actors that are as reliable and dynamic as Tom Hardy, who most people know from his fantastic turn as Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or his role in ""Inception"", but even when he isn't starring front and center he always manages to bring interesting and distinct performances to the table. And after seeing him play so many unconventional characters it's nice to get a look at him in a more every-man kind of persona, this time in the new drama ""Locke"".With a car as its only set piece, it follows Ivan, a family man and construction manager who is in the midst of dealing with one of the biggest mistakes of his life. But while doing so, he must also orchestrate a huge challenge of his career over the phone that may determine whether he keeps his job. Desperately trying to do the right thing and attempting to keep his sanity as so many things are happening without his control, we see the series of events through his car windows, beautifully lit by streetlights and the vehicles around him.But as simple as it may sound, it sucks you in from the start and proves to be a compelling experience with Hardy delivering a subtle and genuine performance.

"Hollywood has a problem with sequels, especially when it comes to comedy. The second a film makes any kind of profit, whether it be 20 million or 200, studios automatically feel the need to make a follow up. And that’s understandable (they need to make money) but what they usually can’t get through their heads is that they almost never work. The actors generally tend to phone-in their performances and it always seems like a recreation of something much better, the original. But every now and then, once in a blue moon, a sequel comes along that isn’t total trash. And luckily enough, we have “22 Jump Street” to prove it.The new film continues the story (or what some may call bromance) of Schmidt and Jenko, two undercover police officers who after re-living high school and busting a drug operation must do the same at college. But after Jenko meets a new friend on the football team and Schmidt feels left out, they begin to question their partnership.Poking fun at the fact that the story is almost identical to the first and certainly aware of the cliches associated with sequels, it’s a hilarious thrill-ride that will please fans of “21 Jump Street”. But as funny as it is, I’m not sure I would hold it above other recent comedies like “Neighbors” and “This is the End”. It definitely had its moments but unlike the other flicks that I mentioned, I found myself forgetting much of the movie once it was over. Rated R for language and sexual content, “22 Jump Street” is funny but forgettable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URFS40S1G8I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPYT3LS#wasThisHelpful","R1URFS40S1G8I2","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.” Wes Anderson is one of them. His movies can be described in a number of ways but the word that invariably comes to mind is genius. The writer/director behind brilliant films such as “Rushmore” (my personal favorite), “The Royal Tenenbaums” and “Moonrise Kingdom”, he’s effectively created his own world of quirky and zany characters that resonate with people more than your typical Hollywood escape. And now after only two years since the release of his last project he brings us “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, which proves to be just as delightful and charming as his past work. Chock-full of small but equally memorable roles from actors that we all know and love, it may be the most clever movie you see all year.Set in 1932, it’s the story of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), a sprightly concierge at the Budapest Hotel who quickly becomes friends with his new protege and lobby-boy, Zero (Tony Revolori). Their adventures begin after the death of a wealthy guest who after being carefully taken care of by Gustave, is soon found dead. We see him quickly become pinned as the prime suspect and the events surrounding Zero’s attempt to clear his name. Full of slapstick humor that will undoubtedly make you laugh, the film is constructed in a magnificent and elegant manner where all the characters get their chance to shine. Even the smallest roles (the crippled shoe-shine boy and the man with a scar on his face) still have an impression on the movie as a whole, and it never feels too ‘written’.Ralph Fiennes delivers a striking and hilarious performance unlike anything he’s ever done, and works well alongside scene-stealers like Adrien Brody and Edward Norton. The movie’s fast-paced and distinct style may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but if you’re a fan of Wes Anderson this will be another great film to add to the collection. It is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15KW5QC7D1AUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAQJMJ0#wasThisHelpful","R15KW5QC7D1AUV","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think most people realize that when going into feel-good sports movies, particularly when they’re produced by Disney, they shouldn’t expect a masterpiece. The majority of these kinds of films rely on true stories and are designed to pull at your heartstrings, and usually they succeed in doing so. But from my point of view they have become a bit lackluster recently, constantly being churned out as a quick moneymaker. We used to see great flicks like “The Mighty Ducks” and “Remember the Titans” every few years but these kind of movies now come few and far between. And though Disney’s newest movie “Million Dollar Arm” certainly isn’t a substitute for those, its characters and lively tone elevate the otherwise dull story.Set in 2008, the film follows J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm), a down-on-his-luck sports agent who will soon be run out of business if he doesn’t close the next big deal. Inspired by his best friend, he gets the brave idea to find and train Indian cricket players to become pro baseball athletes in America. Setting up a competition throughout India called Million Dollar Arm, we see his journey and eventual struggle to complete what he started.A bit generic at times and not without its flaws, the movie stumbles along the way. The pace is a tad too slow (not to mention the two hour runtime) and it takes a little while to warm up to the characters. But by the end, I’ll admit I was extremely invested in the story and was having fun. Rated PG for mild language, “Million Dollar Arm” is light-hearted and entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPXI5W51AJRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD9NKYG#wasThisHelpful","R2LPXI5W51AJRT","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the tagline for your movie is ‘Live. Die. Repeat’, you’ve got me from the jump. But with the added combination of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt running around in metal super-soldier suits kicking major butt and saving the world, then I know it’s really going to be great. I’m aware that Cruise hasn’t exactly been having his greatest couple of years, need I remind you of last year’s “Oblivion”, but he’s still managed to keep up that “Risky Business” charm throughout some of the lower points in his career. And after seeing his newest film “Edge of Tomorrow” I’m pretty sure he won’t be falling back into a slump anytime soon.This new action-epic centers around an officer (Cruise) who, during a war with an alien race, is forced to relive the same day over and over until he increases his skills enough to defeat the enemy. Meeting a woman who has already faced the same challenge (Blunt), he teams up with her to fight and die repeatedly as each alien encounter gets them one step closer to triumph.A sort of juiced up, special effects heavy version of 2011’s “Source Code”, it’s the most entertaining sci-fi flick you’ll see all year. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances of the decade and works terrifically alongside Emily Blunt, with their back-and-forth providing comedic relief from beginning to end. Rated PG-13 for language and action, “Edge of Tomorrow” is a fantastic spectacle meant to be experienced on the big screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK4PS3AV5WNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEQOE9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1VK4PS3AV5WNW","A2EO4O7D7BA2K8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EO4O7D7BA2K8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been buying Caterpillar boots for years and I'm used to a certain level of quality. They look great and the sole, lower and upper appear to all be good quality. The lack of quality is where the sole is joined to the lower. The first day of wearing them, I lightly stubbed my foot on a chair and the front proceeded to come unglued from the sole. I still like caterpillar boots, but if this is their new level of craftsmanship I'll have to look elsewhere.

"I can't speak highly enough about this shoe rack. First of all, it was super easy to put together and I had it up and on the door within ten minutes. I was a little worried about it not fitting my door or not being able to close it with the rack on it, but I shouldn't have worried - everything was fine. It's great for organizing and saving space, and it's great for stuff other than shoes too. I don't have nearly enough shoes to fill up the rack, so I've put other stuff on it to utilize the space, like small storage boxes full of odds and ends that don't have any other place in my room. There's tons of space, a lot more than I thought there would be to begin with, so it really helped me cut down on clutter. It's also really sturdy, which makes it well worth the money. Most racks you see are pretty flimsy, but I have tons of stuff piled on this one without any bending or strain. The shelves are adjustable and everything is well made, and it doesn't seem to cause any damage to the closet door either.

"I love this keyboard! It's very unique looking and lightweight, but still durable. I use it with my iPad and it works great. It's large enough that you can type easily but not so large that it's bulky or gets in the way. I've never seen a keyboard that was made out of bamboo before, and I really like that it's so unique and cool looking. It's really easy to hook up to a tablet or a phone, even though I've only used it with my phone once. All you have to do is hook it up via Bluetooth.

It has templates for just about anything you could think of that you might need: interview follow-ups, negotiation, acceptance letters, thank you letters, even rejection letters. I have not used all of them, but I have everything I might ever need just in case. It's definitely worth the price you pay for the amount you get. It gives you an edge over other people who don't have letters that are as professional and makes you stand out from the crowd and be noticed, which can make a big difference when you're job searching.

Some lesser faraday bags will still let wifi penetrate the fabric due to the higher frequency but that doesn’t seem to be the case with the Black Hole bag. I’ve tested it against normal radio, wifi, cell signal, Bluetooth, RFID, and GPS. It has some of the best shielding of any bags on the consumer market.

"I try to do detoxes regularly since I'm trying to switch to clean eating, but it's not always possible since I have a tight schedule and limited budget. Since I can't eat healthily all the time, I try to make up for it by using detoxes. I was using a detox drink that got good reviews, but it wasn't working well for me, so I switched to this after a friend recommended I try detox pills instead. I didn't know a detox could work this effectively. I noticed a little difference on the other detox I was using previously, but the difference with these is huge. I'm more energized, I feel better, and it's cut down my craving for sugary foods. I've always heard that one reason you crave sugary foods is because you're used to them and that detoxes help with that, but especially after the crappy detox I was using before, I didn't believe that until now. I still have to eat it occasionally, but it's a lot easier to be healthy when I'm not craving it as much. I definitely recommend this brand if you want a powerful and effective detox.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZ3BIZNQEHQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTZBL1W#wasThisHelpful","R3HZ3BIZNQEHQI","A5FSLYZXCW0S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5FSLYZXCW0S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've been using them for a few months now, and I just went back to the optometrist yesterday to get my eyes tested again.

Either way, I'm really looking forward to how well it works as I continue taking it since I've already noticed a difference. As for my beard, I noticed improvement a lot quicker, about a week and a half in. It's still patchy in some places, but it's thicker than it's ever been before.

"Finally, a mechanical keyboard that is tenkeyless with a perfect size and layout.  Most tenkeyless keyboards over the years have had weird layouts trying to be as small as possible, like the Poker and the Happy Hacking keyboards, and this makes those keyboards just not practical.  This keyboard, along with an ALPS clone model from Ducky, will set the trend for tenkeyless keyboards that are laid out exactly the same as full-sized keyboards but simply with the tenkey pad sliced off.Build quality is very good (made in Taiwan) and the keys are mounted solidly on a metal plate.  It comes with a keycap remover and some extra keycaps.  I've already spilled liquid into it and it still works fine thanks to the mounting plate.I have some observations after several months of daily use.  The keycaps have become shiny, much like what happens to laptop keyboards.  Second, the rubberized coating on the bezel is probably not going to stay perfect for much longer--it should be a matte, plastic finish instead.All space-saving keyboards should have this layout.

"I do not know if it is either the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD CPU or its graphics capability but I have to say that this game plays much better on the Google Nexus 7 than on the Kindle Fire.  Perhaps Android game developers should instruct the device to stop all background operations when playing games because this game runs perfectly for a while on the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD but starts bogging down after a few moments presumably due to the Kindle Fire/Kindle Fire HD performing some background tasks that could very well have waited for later.Otherwise, the pinball tables are as good as or better than those available for Visual Pinball and VPinMAME for the Windows PC which are considerably more difficult to install and use.  This is a great app.***EDIT*** I have noticed a problem when playing this game on the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD which is most likely related to the graphics drivers on these Amazon devices.

"This cover, when ordered in 2011 and later, works great with no problems at all.

"Be careful if getting more than one of these Bluetooth dongles. I have a handful of dongles that are identical to this one but are sold under many different brand names from several dozen different Amazon vendors. The dongles interfere with each other because many of them have the same MAC address. MAC addresses are supposed to be universally unique but these off-brand dongles are not unique. This can confuse you and your other Bluetooth devices. More than once I have paired a Bluetooth phone with the wrong computer when two computers use the same brand of Bluetooth dongle even when the Bluetooth device name is changed.It gets very hot, but most cheap Bluetooth dongles do, probably because the radio is very powerful and possibly non-FCC-compliant. My basement Bluetooth dongle can be reached from the second floor.The trouble is that it's hard which dongle to buy except by price and the photo.

"**EDIT See EDITS at the bottom.**The AMD processor is very fast.  Compared to the HP Mini 311 with nVidia ION graphics, the Acer with AMD Fusion processor is computationally faster and the graphical performance is  the same.The screen is this netbook's biggest disappointment.  Compared to other 1366x768 monitors like the HP Mini 311, the Acer has a slightly noticeable moire pattern and as a result is not as sharp as the HP.  If you watch movies, you won't notice this, but if you do any sort of productivity work it can be distracting especially if you're sensitive to that sort of thing.The prominent Netflix application works almost perfectly watching HD programming.  The battery life is longer than the HP Mini.  It is also much lighter to carry than the HP Mini is.The keyboard is functional but not for touch-typists.  It has a noticeable warp and flexes upon use.  The HP Mini's keyboard is much nicer than this Acer's keyboard.The Acer is very easy to upgrade and even has PCIe ports so you can replace the wireless card, but you really wouldn't need to since it works wonderfully.  Performance on Windows 7 Ultimate is acceptable with the included two gigabytes of memory.When considering this netbook it is important to compare its screen side-by-side to other 1366x768 netbooks since it is by no means a high-quality screen.There is no hard drive LED.  This is actually a good thing since they are distracting.  Since I keep picking on the HP Mini, which has many distracting bright white LEDs, I prefer the Acer as it only has three subtle LEDs, none of which blink incessently like on the HP Mini.  Thankfully the wireless LED does not blink, either.The screen opens almost flat, to almost 170 degrees, so you can get to the correct viewing angle on the tray table on an airline or train seat.  This was my biggest complaint with the HP Mini which only opens to a very restrictive 130 degrees.  This is a good thing, because the Acer's rather poor screen has very limited viewing angles compared to the HP Mini.I am glad the netbook market is rejecting the foolish Intel Atom platform's restrictive, useless, low-resolution 1024x600 screens.  The 1366x768 resolution is ideal--this is normal for AMD Fusion but unusual for Intel Atom netbooks like the HP Mini and Dell that can be special-ordered with the higher resolution.  The 1366x768 resolution should be the new standard.I like this Acer.  You will save hundreds of dollars over the nearly comparable HP Mini line.**EDIT**I just put in a 4 gigabyte SODIMM and it works a bit faster.

This is a worthwhile, historical record of the same caliber of the Making of the Washington DC Metro book.

"This is the famous ""Blue Cube"" PS/2-to-USB adapter that lets you use your old-school PS/2 keyboard with your USB-only computer.  It works perfectly with IBM Model Ms of all vintages, as well as the occasional PS/2 Unicomp keyboard, too.  Since this is a keyboard-only adapter, it provides the full 500 milliamp USB power current to power your favorite, vintage keyboard.If you're going to get this adapter, though, be sure to also get a little three-inch USB extension cable.  This adapter, unfortunately, will obscure adjacent USB ports.  This isn't a problem on Dell computers which typically have four or more USB ports, but in a pinch, the USB extension cable is recommended.  It's offered by Amazon as an add-on purchase for this reason.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKHR8AVFVX2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BSJFJS#wasThisHelpful","R2EKHR8AVFVX2F","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Slingbox is excellent for standard definition viewing both within the home and remotely.  I have used both methods.  You really don't need high-definition if you're viewing it on your iPod Touch or remote laptop.  Chances are your upload speed from your house won't handle high-def and the download speed of your remote location, especially if it's a handheld device, won't handle high-def either.  The software does let you select resolutions up to high-def, but 640x480 is the limit for standard-def and you're not going to see any difference if you set it any higher.This is an excellent solution and the fact that you can watch your video from Slingbox.com is simply astounding.  Remote viewing from handhelds is a nice touch, too.For practical use, I think that hooking a TiVo Series 2 DVR to a Slingbox is the optimum solution for catching up on those shows you like.  You can manipulate your TiVo through the Slingbox viewer both on the PC, on mobile devices, and on the ""Watch"" feature on Slingbox.com.  Slingbox provides a ""controlling"" mode that lets you use the TiVo remote control in a relatively quicker mode so it's easy to use it over a remote connection.  Then, when you select what you want to watch, put it back in ""high quality"" mode where the optimzed Slingstreaming processing takes over.Finally, for home use, you can manually set up all sorts of media settings, including audio and video quality, key frames, bit rate, smoothing, resolution, and others.  It's fun to configure if you want to limit bandwidth on your home network.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QW8RSCC1BQCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VXKD8K#wasThisHelpful","R2QW8RSCC1BQCA","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the cost-reduced version of the Razer BlackWidow mechanical keyboard.  The Cherry Blue keyswitches are just as perfect as they are on more expensive keyboards and provide pleasant feedback.  You still get the amazing, programmable firmware feature which is something I have never seen in any other keyboard.  You can program practically any key on the keyboard to be another key, a macro, or whatever you like.  It's simple to turn off or reprogram that annoying left Windows key so you don't accidentally switch out of your full-screen game.  For programmers you can even reprogram the Caps Lock key to the Control key right from the Razer's configuration utility.The feet are really grippy so you might have trouble sliding it around on your desk, but I really think that is the point, since this is a gaming keyboard.  There are dedicated macro keys to the left which may throw some people off.The glowing blue logo is a nice touch.

"I enjoyed this book even though I'm not familiar with this region.  It helped me understand the geography of Penn Central and helps me try to understand why Conrail did not quickly break PC back into the constituent NYC and PRR sections sooner.  Unlike much of the Northeast, of which I am most familiar, the regions described in this book were areas where extensive parallel and duplicative lines, yards, shops, and physical plant had to be consolidated no matter whether Penn Central merged or not.  There was simply too much railroad and not enough customers in these areas where NYC and PRR directly competed, in stark contrast to the Northeast where the two roads were more geographically separated.This book is fascinating but difficult to read due to the editing (or lack thereof).  The photographs are presented with detailed copy on the facing page in a wide, fixed-width font.  What is very odd is that there are corrections to the copy presented as footnotes, such as ""Line 2 should read: This branch line goes to Cincinnati.""  To my layman's eye it might appear that the copy and photographs were scanned from an earlier edition but instead of using OCR and correcting the copy the current editor just footnoted corrections.  This is not such a bad thing but these corrections are everywhere.  Some pages have more than five corrections.I recommend this book for serious railroad historians and fans of the art.I would like to see a book like this for Northeast railroads and the massive vat of worms that merged into Conrail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PXR79Q0ORZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=025333702X#wasThisHelpful","R24PXR79Q0ORZ0","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This keyboard looks great but it's not for typists.  I'm not sure it's even for gamers due to some technical problems with it.Microsoft developed the Sidewinder X4 keyboard with special firmware and drivers to support a form of N-key rollover that really works.  The keyboard in this review, however, is the Sidewinder X6, and despite what its name might imply, this keyboard does not feature N-key rollover and is a significant downgrade from the X4.  It's just barely passable as any other USB keyboard is for gaming.What it does feature is a snazzy, orange backlight whose brightness is controlled by an awkwardly large knob (the other is for volume control).  The keys are flat, scissor-type switches that feel like the keys on those toy Fisher-Price laptops and it shares all of the bad ergonomics those keyboards have.  There are no riser feet so you either have to take it like it is, at the wrong angle, or stick rubber feet on the back panel to raise it to comfortable typing height and angle.  The keys are not sculpted so this keyboard cannot really be taken seriously for typists and programmers except for extremely occasional use.For gamers there are three banks of macro keys and the unique ability to swap the numeric keypad to the left side of the keyboard without powering down anything.  This may make up for a lack of N-key rollover since I've never had problems with chording or ghosting using any keyboard's numeric keypad.  Some people will like that it can be placed on the left-hand side so you can use it like a better form of W-A-S-D.This keyboard has been heavily discounted at every retailer for a couple of years.  You'll be buying new-old stock, but you'll own a keyboard that is like nothing else you've ever used.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZCHIJ1AFS6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DWI4FM#wasThisHelpful","RHZCHIJ1AFS6S","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this for the exceptionally affordable LG Prime touch-screen phone on AT&T GoPhone prepaid and it works well.  I got what I expected.  It's a cheap case and not as snug as I think it should be, but for this price, I really don't see a reason to complain.  When I first got it there was a bulge but it eventually form-fitted the phone pretty well.The case actually does cover the side buttons, but it has thoughtful bumps where the buttons should be, so you will not have any trouble finding the side buttons.  If you were to drop this phone this case will protect it.  No matter how you drop it there is no part of the phone that will come in contact with any surface and the skin is soft enough to protect the phone.Owners of these phones know that the screen is practically unscratchable but the shell of the phone is a scratch magnet.

"I had watched this webcam to see if it ever went below ""overpriced"" and it finally did, so I bought a two-pack for a really good price.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The camera is grainy and while it does have good color reproduction the graininess and lack of speed over the USB 2.0 bus was alarming.  All the reviews touted the glass lens, as if that matters, when it's the sensors in this camera that is the main disappointment.  Pictures are over-saturated and low-light exposure is overly grainy.  The thing is, these two combine for a low-quality picture that doesn't compress well over an internet connection due to all the grain and blurriness.Even though this aging, expensive camera is now available a more reasonable price, I still recommend trying the new store-brand, generic UVC cameras instead of this one.  This camera is outdated and not really a good value.  The $25 generic UVC camera is definitely a much better value and delivers a better picture than this one.The Lifecam software has great effects that are a lot of fun.  I hope the newer generation of Microsoft cameras are better when it comes to picture quality and frame rate without blurrying.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXEAI99A6X5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVM5DU#wasThisHelpful","R1BXEAI99A6X5D","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two of these.  They're great clocks for about two years.  They're accurage, really big, easy to read, and reliable for about two years.They last about two years and after that they start going crazy.  One of them is still working and I'm afraid to touch it.  The other unit started having trouble getting the clock signal even though it's on the second floor of the house.  Then its second hand stopped moving but it still kept time.  Most recently it failed to reset itself to DST I replaced the battery and the arms just spin in circles forever.  I gave it two hours of spinning, and even took it apart to see if I could remedy it, but it's dead.  The reset button and manual set buttons also stopped responding.  Another model I gave to someone started doing the same thing.So, they're great clocks for about two years.  Then you will have to buy a new one.  For some reason when these fail, they fail without possibility of repair.  Get it on sale (which happens often).

"This radio is impossibly small and has unexpectly good sound through the external speaker.  I bought it only for external listening but I can say that the earphone is compatible with stereo headphones--that is to say that it plays monaural audio through both earphone channels.The AM reception is superb.  I don't know how they did it in such a small package; perhaps they used their experience with shortware receivers in this radio.  Very sensitive FM reception but it has a touch too much resistance for fine tuning.  On the other hand, the volume knob needs much more resistance because I found myself accidentally muting or blasting the audio.  It also has a rather fragile FM antenna that does not swivel or sweep at all--you bend it, you break it.At this size it's a good compromise.

"This is a great hand-held transistor-radio-style radio for use without headphones.  I specifically bought this and a competing Kaito model for headphone-free portable radio listening.  I had been moving my excellent Sony shower radio for a couple of years but realized only recently a decent, tiny portable would be a better idea.I use this to listen to internet and satellite radio broadcast by an in-home FM transmitter.  This radio is sensitive enough with a frighteningly long whip antenna for its size.  It distorts at a volume just slightly higher than comfortable listening at arm's-length.  It sounds much better than the Kaito but not as good as the Sony shower radio.There are some things I don't like about the radio.  For one, the antenna only sweeps left-to-right.  It does not swivel, and swivelling it will break it.  Second, in the lower third of the FM band the radio picks up its own internal electronic noise and creates a ""hum"" as you raise the volume.  This doesn't happen in the middle and top end of the FM band.  This isn't such a big deal for my application because I would just move my FM transmitter's frequency into the non-noisy area of the band.  However, if you like listening to things like NPR that are on the low end of the band you cannot turn the volume too loudly without this humming interference.  Finally, the earphone jack is wired for monaural headphones so the ubiquitous stereo headphones will play out of one speaker, and very quietly in the other speaker.  I bought it for non-headphone use so this doesn't really matter to me.  It does work fine with the C. Crane monaural pillow speaker.I thought twelve dollars was a little costly for a radio of this size and quality but it seems to be the going rate for good name brand, transistor-radio-style radios.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJPZTZPPF9UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00020S7XK#wasThisHelpful","R1JJPZTZPPF9UW","A1X3DA7C61WZLQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3DA7C61WZLQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I struggled through this book on my Kindle and I regret not getting the hard copy.  The story is engrossing and is about on par with ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" by Richard Rhodes.  The book's first part deals with more detail about the weapon's development including new accounts of the German and Soviet bomb-making teams, but you don't read about anything but the USA in the second two-thirds of the book.The focus is on the frequent nuclear tests and the fallout that has poisoned most of the United States and other countries.The highly-detailed accounts of many nuclear shots emphasize the fallout aspect.  It is a great book to read if you're interested in not just the science but the social implications of nuclear testing and the fallout that occurred in communities all over the United States.**WARNING about the Kindle Edition.It's a great book but do *not* buy the Kindle edition.  Frequent misspellings, unreadable (and unlinkable) footnotes, and bleed-through of what appears to be a very bad 300 dpi OCR scan, page headers/footers interrupting the body text, and unacceptable line breaks make reading this thing a chore.  They didn't even run this through a spelling checker.  Shame on you, Amazon, for charging ten dollars for this sloppy scanning job.  The only thing I can say positively is that the table of contents seems to work.  I'm lodging a complaint about this shoddy Kindle book.**EDIT** I'm tolerating the Kindle Edition, but anything that quotes a number is suspect.  The OCR process did not capture numbers accurately so I'm not sure if they meant 10% of all units or if they really meant 10 units.  The OCR software apparently has had a hard time interpreting percentages, footnote numbers, and any other numeric value.**EDIT** I have finished the book and do not recommend the Kindle edition.  The last third of the book consists of pictures and footnotes and are just not legible or readable.  I'm very disappointed with this shoddy Kindle OCR scan obviously done by someone who sawed the binding off and fed it through a scanner using the consumer version of some OCR software that came with the scanner.

"I had tried Garcinia Gamboa before but this was my first time using and hearing of Garcinia Cambogia, which sounds similar but is much more potent marking at 95% HCA. I'd say give it a week and maintain a routine to really feel the effects kick in.  Starting with a higher energy and a boost in your metabolism. It's helped me cut back on food, from reducing my cravings for sweets to indulging in late night snacks...it curbs your appetite without making you feel jittery or empty.

"One of the most important, beautiful..powerful and deadly inventions of all time. The tank revolutionized the way a was fought and won, and the army who was able to advance the complexities of the tank came out on top most of the time.  The book covers the origins of the tank, the battles they were used in, the way they were built, how powerful they were, and ultimately what they achieved.  From the famous tanks like the German Blitzkrieg to other lesser famous but just important tanks like the British El Amaein.  As get deeper in the book, you begin to see the big picture which is, what would war 2 be without the use of tanks..or where would this world be without tanks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DWKWA8Y4SKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMADLXQ#wasThisHelpful","R4DWKWA8Y4SKZ","AMGCX56Y21XEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMGCX56Y21XEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A in depth look into one of the the most gruesome eras of history and what would come to be the most costly wars of all time, in human loss and financially. It covers everything from the invasion of Russia to the ultimate battle of Berlin in which Hitler would fall, but it's what you find in between those times, in what makes this look at history so intriguing yet devastating at the same time. The book is filled with facts I've never known like Churchill sending Stalin a note warning him of the German invasion but Stalin didn't believe him thinking he was inciting a war between Germany and the Soviet Union in hopes of distracting Hitler from invading England.  It talks about the tragedy of large numbers of captured Russian solders being taken to the Auschwitz camp and marched to the chambers, essentially being one of the first occupants of the camp.  To me, it serves as a reminder of the brutality and a place our world never wants go go again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZQLJC8MQXSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0PSXYU#wasThisHelpful","R22ZQLJC8MQXSY","AMGCX56Y21XEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMGCX56Y21XEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a fan of fantasy, comics, and gaming(especially Minecraft)you'll love this book.  I actually started off reading this with my kid..there's cool pictures through the book so it makes it funner to read along.  Theres a wide array of characters from boys to girl, quiet and loud, it covers a large spectrum of personalities from hero to villain.  It centers around Punchy and his group of friends taking on the task of uncovering whats going on with all the zombies and mobs going missing in the minecraft world.  They quickly find out it won't be easy as they encounter dangerous roadblocks on the way, from battling enderman to avoiding slime bobs.

"It took me a while to differentiate between digital cameras and DSLR, but after that you begin to see the beauty in the possibilities of photography. I've had my canon rebel for a few months now, but wasn't getting the most out of it until I got this book.  One of the more important things I learned is, whether it's huge or minute detail, every little single details in photography.  That single detail can bring life to your photo, or completely kill the vibe you're going for. The book covers everything from getting to know your own camera, the knobs, the position of the switches and getting a feel for the shape of it to understanding composition, shadows, what lenses to use and manipulating angles to get the picture to do what you want it to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOVGUAKT9A9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZAYGG0#wasThisHelpful","R3SOVGUAKT9A9L","AMGCX56Y21XEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMGCX56Y21XEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my wife's GSG-522 SD model. Installs in minutes and easy to use! It's 2"" shorter than the standard stock that comes on the 522 (when fully extended) and brings the SD model to just over 26""  length when fully collapsed.My only ""complaint"" is the title currently reads ""steel stock"" and if there is something steel on it, I can't find it (well okay, maybe the spring and the screws). It seems to be 100% polymer. However I'm not calling this entirely a complaint since 1) it fits with the athstetics of the rest of the firearm, and 2) after 200 rounds with it on, it appears to be solid and well designed enough to do what it needs to. Even dropped it on my foot (by accident) and it didn't budge.Overall I really like this stock; although the gun is primarily for my wife, I do carry it with a Magpul MS2 sling when we walk our dog at night and having the stock collapsable allows for better ease of carry making it less cumbersome than a full sized AR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AI3FF3SPP10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIC6MBQ#wasThisHelpful","R13AI3FF3SPP10","A1Y2ES3X1M0Q3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y2ES3X1M0Q3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well now I can cook without burning and smoking, and add fatty acids while I'm at it! This is a good size, and it says on the bottle that if used within 2 months it need not be refrigerated. Not sure how fast I will be using this yet, so I am refrigerating right now. But I tend to think, that especially now during the Holidays, I may just use it all with in 2 months. The real test is just cold on a piece of bread. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it tastes like quality butter. Should be wonderful for baking. This is definitely a find!

I always feel so sorry for our garbage man when he comes around to our division, and it's rainy, or windy, or snowy, and people have just put out their cardboard delivery boxes for him to pick up. I always bag my boxes for him. They don't get soggy, or blown around, and it's so easy for him to just toss the bag into the garbage truck. I probably use 1 bag a week, so this will last a good part of a year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZOYXYVP3B1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YPMXGG#wasThisHelpful","R2MZOYXYVP3B1N","A2PN55MTK1BIL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PN55MTK1BIL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are so cute! I wanted something to hang on my plant hooks, after the flowers are gone. These are perfect! The Chicago area is known for not having continuous sunny days, so wasn't sure if these would actually light up every night, as they are situated between 2 large bushes that only get afternoon sun, when it is sunny, but so far, lights every night, even when the day has been cloudy! I plan on adding some pre lit greenery for the holidays, and these are just perfect all around! These had been pre charged and lit up the very first night right out of the box.

"I have been using these products for 20 years, and I don't care what other people say, I know that these work for me. 20 years ago I lived in an exclusive condo complex in downtown Chicago. There was a hoarder that died on one of the floors. When they entered they were horrified, not only by the mess, but the roaches. Now this was not a small building, 320 condos, but when they fumigated, they ran, everywhere! I awoke to roaches in bed with me, all over the kitchen, my young child and I were horrified, as we had never really seen a roach before. This was as I said over 20 years ago. I had seen these advertised and even though I only lived in a 2 bedroom condo, I purchased 4 of them, one for each bedroom, living room, and kitchen. I never saw another roach. I have moved into 2 townhouses since then, each one was a model, and therefor the garages were used as storage for the workers. Both, I was told, by other home owners, had hoards of mice run out when the garages were emptied.  I would not have known as when I moved each time I took my Riddex with me. I purchase new ones every once in a while to replace the old ones. I still use more than you are supposed to. They never bothered my pets over the years, dogs and cats. They are supposed to work for 5 years, I think they work longer than that. I swear by these things. Riddex has now come out with a new product that emits through the air, as these emit in the walls. I purchased those also recently for spiders, I think Chicago is going to have a bad winter this year. Spiders are coming in almost everyday. This Riddex may work on Spiders inside the walls, I don't know, but they don't work on anything that may come in directly from outside, like through the garage, or a crack. So if you are expecting these to kill all the critters that you can see, forget about this. This gets rid of the ones you can't see yet. The ones in the walls. The ones you can see, you'll have to get rid of those yourself. It definitely works on critters that come in through the walls, though! I know, and am so very grateful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAKJXUMEI4XD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NZUB86#wasThisHelpful","R2LAKJXUMEI4XD","A2PN55MTK1BIL5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PN55MTK1BIL5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another product that you need to do your own research on. Excellent for so many reasons.Definitely helps to even out emotional stress. I am a very emotional person, and have noticed that I do not react as strongly to stress as I did before this product. I am also sleeping like I did when I was twenty. I am sleeping more deeply, without waking up sleepy. I used to think of the Now Brand as something that you bought at the grocery store, or drug store to get you through till you could go to the health food store, but not any more. I have done my homework on this company, and they are doing so much research on what is good for us, and what these supplements do, and how much is needed, that I have a whole new respect for Now, and am requesting this brand more and more often.

"Do not go by the size chart. I purchased the small hoping that the chart was wrong and it is. It says that a small is size 42. I am a female 5'6"",  and about 125. I would usually wear a medium in women's sizes, as I don't like tight fitting clothes. This is almost a small/medium. I would say a 38 maybe 40 in men's sizes. That is fine for me, but not for a man who wears a 42. For men's sizing, if you usually wear a large, then go with a large, medium, then medium, and so on. It is meant to be form fitting, so athletic fit, but not body builder. The chest would fit, but not the shoulders. Very nicely made. Classic styling. Medium weight. I would say comfortable in the 40s and 50s degrees. All of which I was looking for!  Good fabrication. Looks and feels like leather, without the upkeep of leather, or of course the price! Good color.

"I have a 40 pound Cockapoo, with such thick curly hair that I have problems finding the skin for his flee drops. It usually takes me 2 days to thoroughly brush his hair, as after an hour here and an hour there, I got tired of brushing out his tangles. I just brushed his very long , at the moment, hair. His whole body in 1/2 hour! It has been 6 weeks since his last hair cut and he is very long. This makes it so easy, it's like spritzing a glass table with glass cleaner! Spray and rub in and brush. The tangles practically disappear! The ones that remain, just a quick localized spray to the tangle, and that's gone too. I have tried other so called detangler sprays, and they did nothing on this dog's curly hair. My puppy and I are so glad to have discovered this product!

"This is a tried and true cleaning product that has been around for many generations. Borax is a natural product that was sold before natural was ""in"". The oxygenated products are poor imitations of Borax. They try to do the same cleaning projects, but really don't compare. This can be used in your laundry, to clean surfaces that you can't use scouring powder on, and is gentler than scouring powder. I have been using this product around the house for many many years, and so did my mother. I am 66 years old, so it has been around for longer than that, because it is a good product that works. I have tried the others, and they really don't compare. I have 2 major neighborhood stores that carried this product and then stopped. I was so very happy that I found this on Amazon.

"I'm no stranger to Streamlight.  If you are, you don't know what you're missing.  I've been using their products 20+ years.  Nearly every light they make is built to endure for years and years.  (Their knucklehead light being the glaring exception).This little powerhouse is a rechargeable version of the Stylus Pro.  It's  small, pen style flashlight that fits nearly anywhere.  Mine came with the AC/DC adapter, which puts out 5V 1A.  The light is very bright and the clicker on the bottom has very solid action.The clip prevents it from rolling on a flat surface.The only thing that I didn't like --and it wasn't even enough to deduct one star-- is the sliding cover for the USB.  Although it slides smoothly, if you hold it by the sleeve and bump up against anything, it does have movement.  I would have preferred a more solid, snap lock at the full closure of the sleeve or maybe a twist and lock mechanism to prevent accidental movement.

"While I have tried about a half dozen brands of LED bulbs, I have never tried Kobi.  Although some bulb have a dark spot in them (Cree), others have a delayed start (G7) or have funky looking casings (Philips and GE).

"I love horchata.  I drink it a lot a restaurants.  I also love energy drinks.  This drink, in spite of the high price and high calories, sounded like a dream come true.I received the drink and chilled it.  I decided to replace my morning coffee with it one day.  The consistency is there.  The flavor was not good.  Although it is sweetened with sugar, it had a bad aftertaste --some would call it a 'twang'-- like a cheap, nasty piece of sugar-free candy.  I wasn't able to finish it, so I shared the remainder with a friend of mine.  He said the same thing.I found the pick me up wasn't there at all.

"This is my second Wilson cellular amplifier.  My other one was contained in a dock for an iPhone.  I found the installation requirements for this to very particular.  I thought I could get away with a bit of adjustment, but I got no signal improvement when I did that.So, I installed the antennas exactly as directed and I was able to pick up an extra bar.  I personally felt it should have been more than that.  Another thing I was not overly happy with is the distance from the inside antenna you have to be.  You have to be very close to it.. like 18"" close.  This could be an issue for those who put their phones in cradles on the dash or even in the console.  You lose the benefit very quickly.  I even lost my 'extra bar' several times when switching from my left ear, which was closest to the inside antenna, to my right ear.  I really felt it should be more sensitive than that.If you are able to live with those quirks, then this is for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IS4KRN6YJLYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG9O2P0#wasThisHelpful","R2IS4KRN6YJLYW","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never used a Wilton product before, but I'm quite impressed.  I got this vise so I could use it with our aerial lift in the field.  We commonly have rods, tie downs, pipe, and other needs where one hand --or even another person-- just won't do.This vise has some serious bite to it.  It's been able to hold whatever I throw into it... from 3"" steel pipe to tie down rods.  It tightens smoothly and I like the pull out handle so you can rotate it if you have something in the way where the handle won't rotate 360 degrees.It's got a bit of chipping in the paint, but so will any vise you buy if it it put into field use.  With the fit and finish of the product body and movement, as well as the quality materials, it should last a long time.  I'll be sure to update if it doesn't.As a side note, the bench mount clamp does have a bit of play in it when the vise is mounted in it.  However, given the numerous positives they overcame my impulse to deduct a star for it... but I thought I would mention it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PC90UBRECSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG4QM4Q#wasThisHelpful","R24PC90UBRECSI","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good printer.  I have used dozens of B&W and color laser printers at work but never could afford one for home.  Having this at the house to print up business brochures or the occasional card or certificate has been a joy.I have found that HP has greatly improved their Windows software.  It's not buggy or clunky anymore.  This also has CUPS support for you *nix people.It prints quickly and beautifully except for photo paper.  I found my inkjet still has holds the crown on photos.  However, using bright white presentation paper produced very good photos too.The scanning is fairly good.  I would get an occasional skewed paper when scanning multiples through the ADF.  I'm not sure why.  I'm also not sure why there's no duplex tray.  Sorry folks, you'll have to flip your pages manually in the ADF.Faxing is quick and painless... toner costs are acceptable.  The airprint works flawlessly and the direct WiFi print is great to have too.I really like this printer, but it has the following minor annoyances.  I knew most of these going into it though.*  No duplex ADF*  Memory not upgradeable (256MB)*  No memory card option*  No manual sheet feed (envelopes, photo paper, etc. must be put in the tray)Overall, I really like this printer and I would recommend it if you are okay with the above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDC5NL4UYWLV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ABLJC4#wasThisHelpful","RDC5NL4UYWLV2","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third portable A/C (2nd De'Longhi).  They all still work, I just have two offices and the garage to cool.  The other De'Longhi is the PACC120E and the other A/C is another brand.  This is by far the best one out of them all, heating functionality aside.Also others may think this is a large unit, it's actually smaller than the A/C only units.  The unit is more quiet than the others both in operation and cycling of the compressor.  (The other De'Longhi actually has a louder 'clank' when cycling).  I found it cools very quickly even though it is is much more quiet.The dehumidifier works well and the heater will keep you warm.  The thermostat goes up to 81 degrees, so if you want it warmer than that, I don't know what to tell you.The unit is stylish, well made, and the LCD display has a very nice contrast, so it's easy to see.  With the programmable timer and different fan speeds, this unit does it all.My only negative, which seems to be a common theme with De'Longhi units, is the vents are not movable.  I didn't really need to move them to get the temps I wanted, but I like that option.  My other A/C has movable vents, so you can direct the heat away from a plant or something or you can direct the A/C at you if you want.Nonetheless, I really love this unit.  It's the best one I own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVVVY751RC63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INHW3J8#wasThisHelpful","R3TVVVY751RC63","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This timer is useful for anything from lights, to sprinklers, to various electronic gadgets.  No matter what your reason, be it to make the house appear occupied, or to give that problematic electronic device a nightly reboot, this will suit your needs.It has dual outlets, which can power a TV or radio and a lamp in a room.  It also has buttons that are fairly easy to push for those who hate mashing on those small ones.  The buttons do not give tactile feedback, so you'll need to keep an eye on the display for your results.  Speaking of display, this one is 'pretty good'.  I would have preferred larger digits or a backlight, but it is quite readable.When it operates it is nearly silent.  Many timers have a click noise to them.  This one is so quiet you can plug it in next to your bed if you want to automatically power a fan or something and then kick off.I have used it several times now and I really like it.  I will post an update on the durability at a later date, but I don't expect that to be an issue.  I have used the mechanical Intermatic timers before and they last forever.  Even though it's digital, it should be fine.Wish list:* A tad bit more responsiveness after pressing the button.  It's not slow by any means, but it's not as 'instant' as I'm used to with other consumer devices.* Capability to operate outlets independently.For the price point, this is a great timer.  I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TPGKP9I9ONA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBHBH6C#wasThisHelpful","R8TPGKP9I9ONA","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this phone for an aging relative who has never had a cell phone before.  I wanted something they could easily use to call in case of a medical emergency.I received the phone already programmed for some other area code.  It didn't make sense to me that the area code would not match my mailing address.  I also wanted a number that was local.  I emailed tech support and asked for a local number and assistance with activating my phone.  The website said 24-48 hours for email support response, but I found it was 36-48 hours at the minimum.  After 4 contacts back and forth with email support, I was forced to call.The phone rep (state-side) was very polite and was able to get my situation fixed immediately.I tested the phone a couple of times when I accidentally dialed the emergency operator. One time they answered almost immediately and the other time I hung up thinking I beat the operator, but they called back to make sure I was okay.In spite of the slow email response, the great phone support and prompt operator response gave me confidence in giving this to my relative.He likes the phone and is able to navigate the menus easily.

"Having about a half dozen smart home products in the house, I wanted to try this one out to see how it fares against the front runners in this category.I found the setup to be extremely simple.  I didn't have to create any online account or even try to connect via WiFi to the device.  It found it and began controlling it automatically.  There's something to be said for easy setup!I have been able to control the device on WiFi and via cellular without issue.  It's very easy to set up a schedule for it too.One thing you should realize is this is simply a remotely controlled outlet.  Nothing more really.  It doesn't integrate with other services or anything like that.I feel the marketing is a little misleading as two of the four functions they advertise for it are essentially the same function.  (e.g. ""Anti-theft timer"" is the same thing as ""schedule"".... you're scheduling a time for the outlet to turn on/off.I also wish it was a different color.  I won't put this where it's visible since it stands out so much.I also think it's priced a bit on the high side.  For around $5 more, you can get a Wemo outlet and integrate it with other services and really maximize its functionality.  That said, the Wemos tend to be a bit more finicky.  So, it you want just a remotely controlled plug that you can schedule or count down --one that works everytime-- then this one is it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205TIIW2UZMZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWHDAKA#wasThisHelpful","R205TIIW2UZMZF","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice unit.  I have a several of them (Koldfront, Delonghi, etc.) and this one is pretty good.  It is definitely the most stylish one, but as far as cooling, I rank it as 'pretty good'.I have to say I'm not a fan of the dual exhaust.  I did not find it to be advantageous to have dual exhaust over a single exhaust.  (Both 5"" and 6"").  It gives me two hoses to deal with and since I vent it out of the of the garage wall, it took a little ingenuity to adapt it to the 4"" x 10"" exit hole.I really do like the 3M antimicrobial filter.  I come in contact with enough germs at work and through my kids.  I don't need any help.  It is moderately quiet.  It doesn't have that loud clang that other A/C units have when the compressor kicks on/off.I also like the backlit display. (Not that I'm running around with the lights off, but it does help visibility from a distance).Overall, I give it 4 stars.  I took away one star for the dual exhaust.

"I was a bit hesitant of the claims of these headlights.  So I did a before test night drive and an after test night drive through the same area so the memory would be fresh.I first did the test night drive around 9pm.  I went over hills, through open areas and city streets, and through more rural areas with roadside trees/shrubs.  I also parked approximately 5 and 20 feet away, facing a wall to see how much of a difference it made.I then switched out the headlights which were very easy to do on my Toyota Camry.  I had been using stock, OEM bulbs.I then did another test drive.  WOW.  What a difference these can make!  They are a bright white light.  Not yellow and not blue.I immediately noticed during my drive that I could see further out in front of me than before.  I also noticed that the flood spill was significantly more.  This gave me better peripheral view to see the edges and shoulders of the road.  It was even more apparent in the rural areas where the light was shining outward onto the shrubs, grass, etc. on the side of the road.  I drove past many cars and no one flashed their brights at me, so I don't think anyone will have a problem there.I really like these and it actually makes me feel better knowing I can see more at night.  I would recommend these to everyone.  I'm getting a set for a family member who has poor to fair night vision.  This will help them alot!  I'll update with her comments too.GE REPS:  I almost deducted a star because mine arrived with the bulbs loose in the packaging.  Somehow they can come loose from their mounts during transit.

"I own two other laser measurers (both Bosch), so my experience with these will be contrasted against this.I run coax and cat5 cables, do basic cabinet installs, and paint.  I use laser measurers often to estimate jobs.  Using this device, I found the quality of it to be adequate.  It's not bad and it's not great.  The buttons feel a little cheap.  The instructions were obviously written by someone whose first language is not English.  They should improve that.

The calculator function, as well as other functions can be a bit clunky.  Review of the manual will be necessary as its not as intuitive as you think.Overall I am fairly please with it.

"This is my second portable A/C, but my first DeLonghi brand. I got this for my office area due to computer heat issues.The package arrived fairly dinged up and one strap busted, but everything seemed to be intact.  (BE SURE TO WAIT 24 HOURS AFTER RECEIVING BEFORE TURNING IT ON.)After the 'settling' period, I was cooling down my office in no time.  I love the timer feature because I can set the temp and then the timer for 9 hours and it turns off right after I leave work, so it saves money by not running all night.  I was going to buy a digital timer or a Wemo plug, but that feature saved me some $$.It's not the quietest A/C I've seen and it's not the loudest.. it's kind of medium in loudness when running.  I can have a conversation with someone while it's running, but if there is a need to keep our voices down, I turn it off for a bit as it can be a little bit hard to hear.  It sits about 6 feet from my desk.I took off one star for two reasons.  1)  The vent is not adjustable.  It simply aims out.  2) When the compressor kicks off it has a somewhat loud knock or clank.

"Overall I was very pleased with the system.  The contents were well packaged and everything was included to install the system.Cameras -  Camera cables were 60 feet in length and were long enough for my application.  The aiming adjustment system for each camera were easy to adjust and makes it where it is easy to aim and will work in virtually any application.  The camera housings are metal, not plastic and seem to be well made and rugged.  The PTZ camera came with an arm mount and a ceiling mount.  The housing was metal and very sturdy.Recorder – Very easy to set up and get going.  All cables, for different applications, were included.  The instruction  guide was awesome!  It was very easy to read and understand and included screenshots for each step of the way.  The system comes with a mouse so all you had to do is follow along and click.Performance -  Cameras have great coverage with their 59 degree arc with little or no distortion.  Images are very sharp and identifiable.  The IR throws plenty of light out to an advertised distance of 85 feet.  I’m able to get every bit of that with mine and the image is still nice and sharp.The recording ability is motion activated.  An icon appears on the picture frame of your monitor indication which camera has been activated and is recording.  During testing, the activations triggers quickly, as soon as there is movement in the frame.Playback is a breeze, using the provided mouse and screen icons and menus.The iPhone app works great and it was has novel way to transfer the settings from your DVR to the app... just scan a QR code!  The settings then appear in your app and you're good to go.  The web app worked with IE, Firefox, and Chrome.  Unfortunately, you have to be an admin on the computer to install the web software.  I really wish they had a MJPEG push option for viewing so you could at least see what's going on without having to be an admin.One more picky thing I would improve on is the type of screw they use on  the camera angle adjustment.  It is a very small Phillips head screw.  One of the cameras had this screw tightened down pretty tight and was difficult to get out without stripping the shallow head out.  I think an Allen head screw would work better and less likely to strip out the head is torqued down tight.  Also, an Allen head screw can be tightened more easily and it can be reached more easily in tight spaces or against a wall with an Allen wrench verses a screwdriver.Overall I am more than please with the system, its capabilities and performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29C0XS8AYNOUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2N6O20#wasThisHelpful","R29C0XS8AYNOUE","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I primarily bought these because they said ""Made in USA"".  I try to buy American made when I can.  However, these are awful.  The cotton/fiber absorbent material is not evenly spread across the pad.  This leaves bare spots with no absorbent material.  Most of them were like that and I was not able to use them because urine pooled in those areas.As an FYI, they don't have adhesive tape on the back either, so the pet can easily bunch them up when moving on it.I threw them away.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25583YEEB5UC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A47UO7S#wasThisHelpful","R25583YEEB5UC8","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After spending time in the Southwest, especially in Tornado Alley, I purchased an Eton emergency radio.  While I did love it, the features of this Midland have caused me to switch to this as my primary emergency radio.The radio is very versatile, running off of a rechargeable battery, regular AA batteries, solar charging, or crank charging.  There's simply no reason to have a dead radio with all of these power options.The display is easy to read and the local stations came in very clear with the digital tuning.  (My Eton had manual tuning).  I even got down into the storm shelter and closed the steel door and could pull in signals quite well.The LED light is plenty bright to light your way around.  In the small shelter, it gave us a good amount of light to read by or see each other very clearly.A unique feature I've not seen before is the dog alert.  It's an ultra-high pitch tone that is similar to a dog whistle.  It is supposed to indicate to rescue dogs that you're located in a rubble or a storm shelter.  I tried it on my dog and I got that 'head-cocked-to-the-side' look like ""what's that noise?"".The USB charger works as advertised, but I would only use it to power up your phone enough to call out.  Save the juice for your radio, SOS beacon, or dog whistle.I'm very pleased with this radio.  The included case makes it perfect for the trunk or the storm shelter.  I definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGOHVLI9QPJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GO1UV4E#wasThisHelpful","R2TGOHVLI9QPJO","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used these on both faux stainless steel as well as regular stainless steel and I had very good results with both.  I like the fact the wipes are sealed in a bag inside the tub.

"I really wanted to like this!!  I got this device not so much as a 'wallet tracker' as a general 'stuff' tracker.  I was considering putting it on my son's iPad case because he's always losing it.  Unfortunately, I never got to that point.  I am VERY well versed in iOS operation as well as Bluetooth procedures such as pairing, etc.When first putting it together, the instructions say to never fully pull out the battery tray.  I imagine this is because the tray fits in upside down or right side up... if you happen to drop the battery tray, as I did, you run a 50/50 chance of putting the tray in correctly.  They should have printed or cast something on the tray to avoid this issue.The iOS app is pretty clean and easy to navigate.  It took me a few tries to discover the trackr.  After getting it paired to the phone, I found the option to turn off 'separation alerts' did not work.  Even in the off position, I would get alerts for getting too far away.  I tried this several times, to no avail.To stop the separation alerts, I had to remove the batteries from it over the weekend. After putting them back in after the weekend, I found out the phone and wallet trackr had forgotten their pairing.  I'm not sure why.I was never able to get the device paired again.  The app would hang on the 'connecting' screen (longer than 20 min) or would not find the device at all.  I finally gave up.  I wished this worked as advertised... it would be extremely useful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15S82IX5FKSZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK0ECYA#wasThisHelpful","R15S82IX5FKSZS","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say I was extremely disappointed with this grill.  I have owned several brands, from cheap to nice, and this one falls short of the Hamilton Beach standard in my opinion.  I've had great luck with other items of theirs, but the grill I received was damaged in several places and poorly packed.COSMETICALLY:  Large dents in the edge of the left door kept me from closing it initially.  The side panel and the frame that holds the main grill box were dented.  Where the lid handle was mounted to the lid appears to have been ground with a rough surface around 1"" of the hole, then painted over.  The shipping box didn't really show any damage which leads me to believe the packing system isn't sufficient.ASSEMBLY:  The instructions are pretty straightforward, with  many diagrams.  It took me about an hour or so to assemble everything.  However, several of the threaded nuts that are pressed into the sheet metal stripped out.  They would just spin with the screw halfway into it, so I couldn't back the screw out or tighten it.  Other than that, the assembly went well.FUNCTIONALLY:  After assembly, I was able to fire the grill up very easily.  It took about 10 minutes or so to get to searing temp.  I cooked some burgers and some hot dogs and all went well with that. There's ample room to move around with a large spatula or tongs.  I tried to cook some beans on the side burner, but the wind kept blowing the flame out. Granted, it was a moderately windy day, but I was on the patio.  I gave up on that after a few tries and used the stove.QUALITY:  I was not impressed with the quality of this grill.  Although the finishes are nice, the metal is extremely thin and bends very easily.  I would take a sturdier grill over the fancier finish.  I was also disappointed that the towel bar (described in instruction assembly) was missing.Hamilton Beach can and has done better than this.  I hope they improve the quality and shipping/packing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CT0ARXY15DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4LJG6U#wasThisHelpful","R8CT0ARXY15DH","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an IT admin, I've had my share of situations where I had to IPCONFIG /RELEASE /RENEW, etc. time after time... then plugging my laptop in, doing it on that, trying to determine cable or port failure, etc.I came across the LinkSprinter and my IT world has changed.  Fluke has done a remarkable job putting together the all of the essentials for diagnosing basic network failures.  I've used it many times without having to bust out my laptop.  I can determine whether it's a gateway failure, internet service, LAN failure, and more.  What a time saver... and with Fluke, I know it'll last virtually forever.I cannot review the cloud service as I don't use it.

"If you don't already have a device for detecting primary or secondary line voltage, this is one you should consider.  I've used it numerous times lately and I'm still amazed at how well it works.  It doesn't matter if you're testing a three phase drop, a couple of 240V cans, or whether you've got it on a hot stick detecting primary voltage, it should suit you well.The case clips on the tool belt or bag for easy access.

"I've never tried a Volo brand before, but I decided to take the chance and give my Camry a little more pep.  Considering the cost difference over other chips, I figured any improvement would be worth the money.  Volo's website has a chart that gives you expected HP improvement for your particular vehicle.Installation was pretty straightforward.  You basically have to splice into four of the OBD2 diagnostic port wires.  Unfortunately, these wires can be very fragile and I didn't have much slack in mine to 'splice' into.  So, I found a 'splice adapter' which extends your wires by about 6"" and I spliced into those instead.  It made install MUCH easier, giving me the slack to work with and I didn't have to worry about accidentally chopping a factory wire.  I got it from the website OBD2POWERPLUG (add .com to the end).After installing it I fired up the car and got all of the LED indications that showed it was working.  I put it all together took it out for a spin.  After hitting the floor at about 35MPH, I was able to break the tires loose.  I was not able to do that before.  I noticed it appeared to hold its shift a little longer too.  The shifting was not any harder like you experience with some chips or tranny shift kits.I waited the recommended 125 miles to see if it 'learned' improvements, but I didn't notice any difference between first start and the 125 mile mark.Overall I am very happy with this chip.  It's nice because it is streetable and allows 'normal' driving without high RPMs or hard shifts, but it gives you a good boost when you want it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOOJ55FBAO85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K6EFWY#wasThisHelpful","R3FOOJ55FBAO85","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this keyboard for my iPad Air due to the numerous emails and searching I have to do for work.  This thing is a speed demon.  It has great response time after typing and it stays put on the table... even at angle... due to rubber feet.  It holds the iPad well when it is in the slot.I think it protects it well and it is easy to remove (using two hands).  The battery holds a very long charge, even after repeated use, and Kensington has programmed the most useful keyboard functions into hotkeys.  I love it!If anyone from Kensington is reading these, I have a couple of suggestions.  Nothing big, but just a thought.One end has a lightning port cutout and the other end has a hole for earphones. Why not have both cutouts on both sides so it can be placed into the case either way?The other thing that would be neat is a combo cable with microUSB and Lightning.I'm extremely happy with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8IAMV6DXDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLZ5P7W#wasThisHelpful","R1J8IAMV6DXDU","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a gadget guy for sure, so this device is definitely down my alley.  I've also been curious about MPG and driving habits since gas prices began fluctuating significantly several years ago.  Automatic seemed to fill both needs, so I ordered it.Installation was very simple.  It automatically detected my car (Camry) and synced with my phone.Using the app I was able to program in up to three emergency contacts to text in case of an accident.  It sends them a text message asking for confirmation.  That is very reassuring.  It's kind of like a poor-man's OnStar.The device communicated well with the app.  It produced beeps during hard braking, fast accelerating, and other bad habits.  You can turn the audio warnings off.  I did find that it was not consistent in warning.  Sometimes I would intentionally take off as fast as I could from a stop and it would not do anything.  The same occurred with braking.The app takes a few seconds after you turn off the car for it to process your trip.  The GPS tracking did well as did the parking.I was disappointed that the Bluetooth 4.0 still used a lot of battery on my phone.  It caused me to charge it once per day when I did not have to do that before.  I don't drive that much either.The trip feature is neat and the cost estimation will make you think twice before just 'driving around'.

It can also send a notification if the door is opened or closed and you can schedule what hours it will do that.As far as operation, this opener is smooth as can be... And so quiet!  The motion sensor built into the switch turns the light on and off. That is very nice so that I can tell if somebody has entered the garage.The installer said this was a great brand and was impressed with the feature set.  He said they are very easy to install.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this opener.  It's my second Chamberlain, so I definitely recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K2BR75RMH75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APL6Q0W#wasThisHelpful","R32K2BR75RMH75","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WordLock Stor-More Key Storage box is very sturdy and very well built.  It has a good amount of room for securing small objects.  It provide a wall mount option or a door knob option that could be placed around a pole, bike frame, etc.I was actually quite impressed with it.  The only issue I was curious about was the word possibilities.  I visited their site and most of their WordLock products have only 2-3 dozen word possibilities.  If you used something common, chances are someone else would guess it too.  If you could try a word every few seconds, they could have your combo in a few minutes.I would suggest instead of using a word use the first letters in a phrase.  It makes it MUCH more difficult to guess then.  (e.g. Don't Take My Stuff = DTMS)Other than that, I very much like this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZTXCQ3AP7HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2B243G#wasThisHelpful","R3OZTXCQ3AP7HT","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these for my 8 year old.  He wanted a pair of cool headphones and I wanted a pair that wouldn't blast his ears when he plays his iPod.We got them in and they were a no-brainer to use.  I like the volume limiting, so they satisfied Dad.  However, after the novelty or looking at himself in the mirror wore off (about 10 min) then they became just another set of headphones to him.  He'll occasionally look in the mirror or a friend will ask what he's listening to because of the beat, but most times he ignores that part of them.These are okay kid friendly headphones, but the novelty wears off quick.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW93YRQOX56JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1LQMQ6#wasThisHelpful","RW93YRQOX56JE","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This camcorder still amazes me and I've had it for weeks and used it dozens of times already.  The technology Sony has packed into this is incredible.The tiny size of this camcorder is great for large or small hands.  The buttons are easily accessible.  The touch screen icons could be a bit sensitive for larger fingers, but with a small LCD that's to be expected.It charges fairly quickly and the battery life is phenomenal.  The fact it turns on and off by simply opening the viewing screen is a very nice touch.  I really like that.It gives you various recording quality options when setting it up and the higher end modes shoot drop dead gorgeous video.  It has an 'internet' video mode for easily shooting clips for YouTube and other social media.The zoom is fantastic.  With the built in stabilization it is not a problem to zoom way out and still shoot quality video.The crowning jewel of this camcorder is the built in LCD projector.  It is not extremely bright, but it is plenty to show everything in a dark room and clearly see the video.  I hook up my Kindle Fire to it via HDMI and project Netflix and Amazon Video for family entertainment.  We like to lay out blankets and project it straight up on the ceiling and just lay back and relax.The camcorder is very responsive.  It doesn't lag when changing modes or turning off/on.The software installation was easy and it immediately updated to the latest version.  I am still getting used to Sony's memories software and using its features.If you can't tell already, I absolutely love this camcorder.  I would (and have) recommend it to anyone looking for a quality compact camcorder with entertainment value to boot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYQM3DVO51I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR95FPO#wasThisHelpful","RRYQM3DVO51I3","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Boostcase Hybrid Battery case for iPhone 5.The face I spend hours a day on my phone caused me to look for a little help on the battery side.  I don't like having to charge twice a day.I ordered this from Amazon and it arrived promptly, of course.  The case has two pieces.  A snap on shell and the battery part.The snap on shell protects the phone well from bumps and low drops.  It's not a shock resistant case.  It has two small round discs that protrude slightly from the back and those lock into the channels on the battery part by fitting them in and sliding it up.The slightly tacky feel is great for not losing your grip on the phone, but it also make for a slightly unpleasant task if you try to separate the battery and case.  They grip together and it is not easily pulled apart.  Since the battery part is held on by friction, rather than a snap/clip process, I could see this wearing out over time and becoming loose.The snap on shell also has numerous holes in it for looks and these began to quickly fill with dust after repeated use in my jeans pocket.The battery does provide a boost and it charges fairly quickly.For the $70 price tag, I would have expected a little better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBQU4HD0LPES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS4WRDO#wasThisHelpful","R3IBQU4HD0LPES","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had several inverters, from super cheap ones to the higher end true sine waves.  For what this inverter provides, it is well worth the money.  It is powerful enough for most needs and they provide both battery clamps and standard wires.The item is well built and cords plug into it and remove easily.  It has bright indicator lights so there is no question about what's going on.The fact it has 2.1A USB ports is great.  However, be aware that that is shared between both USB ports.  So you cannot charge two higher amperage devices, such as iPads, simultaneously.  You could, however, use the USB port for one and the AC charger for the other and that would solve it.  I don't really charge two at the same time, so it's never an issue.The included  mounting hardware make it a snap to put in.  I would recommend one for every car.

"I liked this paper cutter.  It is heavy duty and most of it is well built.  The Microban protection is an added bonus.  When you chop paper it has great cutting action and doesn't move around when cutting.There were two things I did not like about this.  First and foremost, the board does have a safety catch to keep kids from raising the handle.  However, the plastic guard that covers the exposed blade edge does not come out far enough to keep small fingers from touching it.  Adult fingers would have great difficulty getting it, but my 3 year old has tiny fingers and the opening is wide enough for her to touch it.  If she ran her finger along it the edge, it would get cut.  That's significant and could have been easily remedied by making the plastic 'rib' that guards it extend out further.The second thing I was not crazy about was the paper guide.  It is plastic and snaps into place with two square pressure clips on the bottom of the guide.  It wobbles easily due to this and I felt they could have done better.I am satisfied for the most part, but I felt the blade guard issued should have been solved during design phase.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6LQT4ICLQF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058TW286#wasThisHelpful","RP6LQT4ICLQF5","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own three other Bose headsets, so I am a little biased already.  No need to tell you about the phenomenal quality or incredible sound.  Their reputation is well known.What impressed me most about these is the noise cancellation.  It's quite amazing.  I spend a lot of time in the shop with large fans going and with these headphones on active, I hear nothing but music.  Nothing!  It's like I'm sitting in a library listening to my headphones.I also wore these out while mowing.  It did not completely block out the sound of my ZTR mower, but it made it sound like a little model airplane off in the distance.  What a great experience.  I always thought I would be limited to ear blocking headphones because noise cancelling was just not portable.  However, Bose has really advanced this technology and the rectangular plastic piece containing the circuitry is very light.The silicone ear pieces are similar to the other Bose headsets I have.  They are extremely comfortable, even after extended use, and they do not slip out during activities.I do have one small complaint about the design.  The headphone plug is a 90 degree plug... so when you plug it into the phone, the cord comes away from it at a 90 degree angle too instead of straight like most headphone plugs.  I didn't like that.  I think straight plug is more functional and puts less stress on the cord, but maybe Bose has already considered that.Nonetheless, I would not hesitate to get these headphones.  What an amazing piece of technology!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVCY67R07FL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D429Y12#wasThisHelpful","R2PVCY67R07FL0","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know some things just don't go together... oil and water... Congress and approval ratings... and pets and carpet.  After we converted our 'outside' dog to an 'inside' dog, the carpet just didn't stay the same.  We vacuumed with our Dyson, but that doesn't do anything for the stains.  Between occasional accidents and dirty paws, we had to do something.  I have rented carpet cleaning machines from the box stores, but often times they were more nasty than the carpet.  Enter the Bissell DeepClean Premier Pet Upright Deep Cleaner... <whew>.The cleaner came mostly assembled and it was easy to finish out.  It came with a trial size of Bissell 2X cleaner which we liked very much.  A quick read of the directions and a fill with water and cleaner and we were good to go.  We focused on two high traffic areas in the living room.  The heated solution was able to lift the stains in a couple of passes.  It was amazing.  A more stubborn stain took a few passes, but pet tool cleaned it up well.  I found it easy to maneuver around objects in the house despite the large cleaning head.After several dumps of dirty water and a hair basket emptying, our floors were looking much better.  I did find small Lego end pieces in the hair basket and, to my son's delight, was able to rescue the little stowaways.It's amazing how much stuff gets brought into your house on shoes, boots, pets, etc.  However, with the DeepClean Premier, you can begin to feel clean again in your home.  We'll be getting some frequent use out of this between the kids and the pets.Well worth the investment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19S3LSWZWEFQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBIPGU#wasThisHelpful","R19S3LSWZWEFQJ","AM9APPMIE1BHZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9APPMIE1BHZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What caught my eye was the 'permanent' adhesive. Masking tape tends so slip off after 6 months or a year on things like plastic storage boxes in the basement.

"Like others that received these through Vine, it is too early to report on their lifespan. I have found no online sources comparing them to other brands. Nor do I feel the need at this point to investigate further. Getting these has inspired me to learn more about Alkaline batteries than I ever thought I cared to know.I will now saddle up my High Horse.Did you ever see on the back of an aerosol can ""No CFCs."" They fail to mention that CFCs were banned decades ago in the US. But you think buying that can is good for the environment. That's one of the many ways that companies differentiate themselves falsely from their competition. It's taking advantage of peoples good nature, ignorance, and affection for symbolic gestures.

It was last updated 3 years ago.As for recycling, there just isn't much in an alkaline battery worth recycling. It's not the same as recycling single ingredient items like aluminum cans. They point out in their copy that nothing in the batteries is harmful to the environment. And they also state on their website that sending the batteries in has a carbon footprint. Sorting, transporting, separating and cleaning the different materials all have a carbon footprint. It may actually be worse for the environment.Marketing strategies like this may be common, but that doesn't make it acceptable.

"My review is based on comparing it with the 3M Speedglas 9100V (3M Speedglas Welding Helmet 9100 with Standard Size Auto-Darkening Filter 9100V- Shades 5, 8-13, Model 06-0100-10SW). I've had it for 5 years and it cost almost 3 times as much on Amazon.Both are almost exactly the same weight at about 20 Oz.The ADF lens on the Jackson is almost everything you could want. The lens is  2.36 x 3.9  vs. 1.8 x 3.7 on the 3M. Up close to your face, that little bit extra gives a much larger field of view. The LCD readout is easy to read and you know right where you're at. It's only shortcomings are no Lock in Dark mode, and only shade 4 is available in Grind mode. Minor drawbacks.When it comes to the helmet, that's a different story.First, it's a really soft plastic. No doubt it's durable, but it feels like you could cut it with scissors. In a welding environment, you don't always have just bright arcs. There's angle irons to run into, concrete to get drop-kicked on, sparks flying. My 3M helmet has protected more than my eyes.Which brings me to the 2nd point: Head coverage. The Jackson feels cramped. My ears actually touch the sides (and no, I don't have Dumbo ears). That's with the strap adjusted all the way out - the way I like it. With it in, my nose hits the lens. I wonder how it will do in really hot humid environments, as it feels so close in.I know I'm being picky here - just passing on my observations. It's not bad. The narrower profile might be preferable to some people. Any decent ANSI rated helmet will protect your eyes (stay away from those HF ones, you eyes are worth more than that). I would be less inclined to use this for grinding (See photo as to why).

"This is the heaviest, and most heavy-duty colander I have ever seen. It's very well made, like most Oxo products. The plastic is 3/16"" thick! The snap-open leg assembly is attached with Stainless Steel screws. The whole thing weighs 1.5 lbs. I think it was originally designed to pan for gold.The legs are handy for spanning even a large sink. It's a nice feature I guess, but having the colander down on the floor of the sink never bothered me before. The legs do add a substantial amount to the storage space.So I give it 4 stars for being a quality product. And I highly recommend it if that's what fits your need. Maybe you're running a cafeteria, a soup kitchen, or you cook for a small army. Or you just like having a huge heavy colander that just might outlive you.But here's the thing: After using it for the first time, my wife said ""What the heck? This takes up half of the dishwasher!"" After draining pasta or rinsing some fruit, that's pretty much what I want to do - toss it in the dishwasher and not have to mess with it. So for every day use, I'll stick to one of my lighter colanders that takes up a lot less space.

"At first these seemed like too expensive for the quality. But they've held up well. The finish and the swing joints have stayed good as new.

"I have 2 of these, to keep deer out of my garden and Blueberry patch.

"Taylor makes a lot of perfectly good thermometers, about 50 different digital choices from what I can make of their website. I have several of them, and they all seems to be reasonably accurate within a degree or 2.  It's easy to test by putting them in ice water and boiling water.  This seems to be their only one with LED readout. LEDs have been supplanted by LCDs for good reason. They use a lot less power, and back-lit LCDs solve the problem of reading in the dark.The 9835 does have a nice large and bright readout. The downside is that you can't read it at all in sunlight. So don't plan on using for grilling out during the day.Two other reasons not to like this one. It is not water resistant, as some of the other models (such as the 9842, that I have used for years). Also, because of the concern for battery life with LEDs, this model 9835 shuts off after 15 seconds. Even if you hit the HOLD button. I find that annoying and unacceptable.Bottom line - the only reason to want this one is you only plan on using this in the kitchen, and prefer or require a larger (1/2"") bright LED readout.

"I have several Foscam cameras. The indoor 18916 is a nice design and never given me a problem. The 2 18905s look like they came from different factories - one has been fine, the other needs resetting regularly. This 18904 needs to be reset all the time, which is a problem. I'm not home to reset it.All the the cameras came with different wall  mounts, ranging from barely adequate to totally useless.One of the common questions people ask is what is the real viewing angle of the camera. Mine seems to be 67, based on my crude measurement. But that doesn't mean you'll get the same thing. I've seen the same one advertised as 50 degrees, and sometimes as just 'wide angle'.I was surprised to find out that this camera has no audio. Why not? All the other ones did. Shame on me for not checking the specs closer, I guess. But it says right on the box: ""View and listen to your world anywhere...anytime.""  I do not think those words mean what you think they mean.Foscam definitely competes on price. But their quality is inconsistent. The marketing bizarre. And all the fake reviews a real shame.

"When IR thermometers first came out they were hundreds of dollars. Now you can get a basic 'non-contact' thermometer for under $20. This similar looking but much more expensive option is a major step above that, and a step below the Star Wars military imaging you see in the movies.Fluke products are industrial quality. This one is no exception. It's got a good rugged feel, fits nicely in your palm.  They claim it will fit in your pocket. It could go in a hoodie sweatshirt pocket, but I wouldn't try cramming it into your jeans.It takes about 15 seconds to start up, then gives the camera view and temperature readings. So it's very easy to get started. Using the advanced features such as parallax adjustment, time lapse and emissivity require spending a little time with the manual.The image is good, especially inside about 4 feet. It functions at greater distances, but it's not designed for spotting critters on your lawn (although I intend to test that).  It's very precise with it's aiming - aim just to the side of a light bulb and get the room temperature, move to the bulb itself and it quickly counts up to the bulb temp. One feature I like is the Image Blending. You can start with just the visual image, then gradually add in the infra-red image. This allows you to find the right 'contrast' when looking for a hot spot.Another feature, which I have not tried yet is the Time Lapse Image Capture. For example, you can mount the unit on a tripod and take a picture every 30 seconds for up to 8 hours.You can see from the price that this is aimed at the professional market. The target user would be a contractor, electrician, or manufacturing operation. Electrical and mechanical maintenance needs can be spotted before they become breakdowns. I could also see an auto repair shop finding a use, such as a bad bearing, or coolant and exhaust leaks. Being able to take a picture and show the customer a hot spot can go a long way to building customer trust.The average homeowner thinking of getting this to save on energy bills, might do better to have an audit done by a contractor or utility company.As I have time to experiment, I will update this review with more info and some photos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8CIC0UBJU2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW2MC9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2N8CIC0UBJU2C","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Clearly these are a big improvement over wireless G, and not that much slower than direct Ethernet cabling. So for getting a signal to a remote location (such as my shop) without the hassle of running a cable, this is the way to go.If you have 400 Amp service, bear in mind that these adapters generally have to be plugged into circuits that are on the same main panel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQ0Y7QUJ0489/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF8ZRPU#wasThisHelpful","RFQ0Y7QUJ0489","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife didn't like it. I got it for her as a Christmas gift. It works fine, fits OK, so it could be a 5 star just what you're looking for kind of case. But as Melissa said in her review, it's Clunky. It weighs 1lb 8 oz (681 g), and makes your ipad 1 inch thick at the bracket.So if you really need the keyboard and a hardshell case, this might be worth the trade-off. But my wife likes to carry her ipad around in her purse all the time, and decided that she'd rather deal with the on screen keyboard than lug the extra weight around.Just keep that in mind when making the choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPDER57GG6P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMECCGS#wasThisHelpful","R3OPDER57GG6P3","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Like I said - I'm shocked.Besides cleaning it thoroughly, I sprayed water around the room to get the dust down. I did it in the afternoon with low sunlight streaming in, so I could see the surface of my screen along the edge and make sure it was speck free.I ended up with one tiny dust bubble near the edge. I was able to peel the cover up and pick the dust speck off  with a toothpick.This protector seems stiffer and thicker than other ones I've had. I think it will hold up well.

"Well, OK, it's just a lid after all. The main reason I got this is that I have a drawer full of lids - 4 metal and 2 glass. But when I replaced my Calphalon frying pans with the exact same size pans, the newer models have a slightly different slope to the sides. . So I'm stuck with lids that that don't quite fit. This universal lid solves that problem nicely.The construction seems sound. The silicon appears to be molded to the glass - I tried to peel it off. The lid is held on with a Stainless Steel screw, If it gets loose, don't make it too tight.The only slight negative I have is the graduated aspect of silicon rim. This is unnecessary, IMHO. The lid is still only going to fit tight if the pan is exactly the right size, But the drawback is this:  the larger the pan, the lower the lid sits. Not a big issue, but sometimes you want that extra clearance.In all, a worthwhile addition to the kitchen.

"I have a Jura Capressa F7. Of course they only recommend using their overpriced tablets for their machines. I've been using these for years now with great results.

I'm at over 8,000 cups on my F7 with no major problems.Note: These do not descale. You must descale your machine occasionally, even if you use the filter and have soft water.Edit 11/20/14: Now that these are available on the Subscribe and Save plan, they're even less expensive.

"Are there any decent mounts out there? The one that came with my Foscam 18905 - why did they even bother? Useful only if you don't care where the camera is aimed.These are actually a big improvement. But they still don't work very well.The modular design and all the pieces screw together in lots of possible configurations. It's a cool idea, really. But the weak link is the most important - the ball joint. It just won't hold like it should. A heavy camera like the 18905 will get pulled by the wind or the ethernet cable. Makes for a precarious situation.Another example of that Wal-Mart mentality. Make it cheap and the heck with the functionality.Edit: I tossed out the ball head that comes with it and replaced it with a decent one - Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount.

"The Neptor battery pack has a nice feel. It's a great ergonomic shape for any pocket. And, it has a flashlight ! What more could you ask for?I'm not a huge power user on my phone ( I don't talk all day or watch Netflix). I do use the GPS about 1.5 hours every morning plus moderate usage throughout the day. I have to charge my Sprint Nexus with (so-called) extended battery every night.So I did the following experiment:Sunday AM: Started with a fully charged phone. I only used the Neptor to charge my phone starting Sunday night. It charged fully Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. On Wednesday night the Neptor was totally pooped out. Decent performance, for it's size, really.Other aspects of the design are pretty slick. It seems to shut itself off after fully charging the phone. The LED gives you some idea of it's charge when you press the on button. Also, did I mention it's a flashlight?My other experience with this type of charger is the Energizer Universal Multi-Port Smartphone Rechargeable Charger with 2 USB Ports, Micro USB Cable, 10W and 5W Charger. It's more expensive, and I was not too impressed with it. Also, it was bulkier.If you really need one of these fairly often, then I guess it's worth the steep price tag. If you don't travel a lot, or just need to make it through the occasional emergency call when your battery is dead, consider something like the Burro Mobile Charger - AA-Powered, USB Power Pack - Building Better Lives in Africa. Not as slick as this product, but a lot cheaper and uses AA batteries.Edit: It's been about a year.I just spent a long time traveling, and this was a real benefit to have.

Makes the charging station in the kitchen more tidy, and the car as well.These thin cables won't take lots of abuse. But at this price, it's easy to keep a few spares around.Edit: One of the Micro USB plugs was loose. On careful inspection I realized that these are snap on housings, not molded.

"This laser measurer works surprisingly well. I tested it in my basement, where it reflected and gave accurate readings against wood, plastic, just about everything I tested it on. I also shot some measurements outside, getting readings of 40 - 80 ft without trouble against smooth and rough objects.I was impressed with how sensitive it is, and the fact that you don't have to aim it at a perpendicular surface to get a reading. I shot an 8 foot reading at a matte finish surface.Right next to the dot was a metal bracket 1/8th thick. When I slid the dot over to the bracket, it detected the difference.I was disappointed at how hard it was to see the laser dot outdoors. Even with red 'laser glasses' on, it was hard to find at 60 ft. against a light tan background (it was a bright but overcast day).If you need to estimate a run of pipe, electric cable, or how much fence to buy, this will do the trick. It won't replace your tape measure for cutting a 2x4 to length, or anything like that.So if your in construction, I could see having this in your toolbox. It would be money well spent.

"There's a couple of reasons you might choose this over a solar powered light. Maybe you don't like the look of an ugly solar cell. The soft olive drab finish on this makes it pretty discrete looking. Or maybe you want a light in a place that doesn't get much sun. Both reasons apply to me. I think the choice of using C cells to power this is a good trade-off between size and battery life. One set of batteries should last quite a while.There is an option to have it run all night on low power. Of course that will eat up the batteries quicker - I won't be testing that function. I recommend Paradise GL28100BS6 Low Voltage Metal Deck Light, Brushed Stainless Steel, 6-Pack for a nice dusk to dawn, soft lighting solution.On the regular setting the single LED is quite bright. I'll post a photo.The remote works at about 30 feet. Since the lights have motion sensors, I'm not sure how useful the remote will be. It's not like you can use these for illuminating a large area.So far, there's been one annoying flaw. The method to make the battery compartment water resistant uses a 1 mm gasket that loops around in an overly complicated shape. This choice is notorious for working fine until the seal pops out, and it gets stretched. When I opened the first unit, I noticed the seal was installed out of it's slot. After 20 minutes of trying to 'get the toothpaste back in the tube', I gave up and went on to the second. I later went back and sealed it with silicon caulk, but of course that should not have been necessary.I would also like to have seen them use captive screws for the proprietary screws on the battery cover. If you lose one of these while changing the battery, you're out of luck.In all, a pretty nice design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8W03G6B0CVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00455ED18#wasThisHelpful","R1D8W03G6B0CVL","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this just to play with the vibration detector. Then I decided to annoy a cat that was scratching where it shouldn't. I set it off about 20 times while testing it. Once it settles in, the slightest jolt will set it off. It reminds me of the old game 'Operation' - see how far you can move it without triggering it.The siren is not only loud, but an ascending sine wave that hurts the ears in less than a second. It shuts off after about 20 seconds, but believe me, you can't stand it that long.Back to the cat story: I rigged it up with thread to scare the cat when it went near that spot. Trouble is, I go there too. After accidentally tripping it about 6 times, I got mad and kicked the hell out of it. It flew across the room, bounced off the dresser, battery and battery cover flying off. Still works fine with the same battery.It's not waterproof. It might be OK outside in a ziploc bag. I'm thinking of testing it on the resident deer population.No question, if you need something to attach to a door or window (or several), this is a cheap solution. A string or anything to knock it over or make it wobble is all you need.It 'could' work as a personal alarm, but I  don't recommend it. After you turn it on, it takes 15 seconds before it's armed. That's a long time if someone is attacking you. On the other hand, if you want to let some stranger knocking at the door know just how you feel about him, that 15 seconds while he's introducing himself might be perfect timing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBHEN7R5NX0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00554MLPI#wasThisHelpful","R3JBHEN7R5NX0P","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a few of these locally to give them a try. At first I thought these were for non-electricians that didn't know how to use a wire nut. Plus, they were kind of expensive.Then I did a lighting project that had me working on the ceiling, running lines to multiple fixtures from 1 box. between the reach, and the box filling up fast, it would have been a drag. But these EZ Connectors (as I call them) made it go much quicker and kept the box neater. I had some of the 4 wire connectors (these are the 2 wire option). It was a lot nicer using those than twisting 4 wires into a large wire nut. Especially as my basal arthritis does not appreciate applying torque with my thumbs.Another nice feature: At first I only needed 3 of the 4 connections. When I decided to add another fixture, It was a breeze to just slide the new wire in instead of disassembling the twisted wire assemblies.I realize it seems like I'm reviewing the 4 connector instead of this item. But my point is the same. I don't think I would pay for the convenience at the price these were available locally. When I saw these, it was a no-brainer. It's almost impossible to get a bad connection with these as compared to a wire nut, especially if using different gauge or stranded wire. So pick up a box of these, and the Push Wire Connector 773-164, and save yourself some time.

"I have keyless entry to my car, or I would never lock it. I installed a Schlage Keyless deadbolt on my front door 4 years ago, and it still works fine. The batteries last about 2 years.This FE5576 model went on the basement door. It has a lot of features that the deadbolt does not have, such as the alarms. They are mostly overkill for my application, but I can see how they might be useful to some. Like other models, you can set up temporary codes for contractors, etc. Installation was smooth and simple.Regarding the construction, this thing is built like a tank. I measured it at about 12 gauge steel for the housing. It feels like it would stop a bullet. Or a sledgehammer.Along the same lines, this has a clean industrial look to it. I can't really cal it 'stylish'. My wife said it definitely would not be going on the front door.

"I've been using a couple of cheap plastic turkey platters for years to cart piles of burgers, etc. up from the big grill. They were looking shabby, so I found this substitute. Rectangular, it's a more stable and effective shape than the oval platters. Not for fine dining, but if you want to hold a dozen burgers or several pounds of brats, it's great. You're not adding a couple pounds to the load, like you would be with a similar porcelain platter.One thing I'm bad about, is using a knife on something like this. If you avoid scratching it with knives or turners, it will stay easy-to-clean much longer. I will no doubt ignore my own advice. For the price, replacing this every grilling season is no big deal if it gets gunked up.I bought just one to see how flimsy or brittle it is. It has a little flex to it, about 1 inch if you twist it. The stiffness and feel convey a pretty good tradeoff between brittle and flex. I think it would withstand a fall onto gravel or wood. But drop it loaded onto concrete and it just might crack. Of course, a porcelain platter would fare much worse.So I'm buying a second one and I'm all set to grill for a crowd.Edit 5/22/15: Another one cracked. I ordered 2 more, and one arrived cracked from bouncing around the box (shame on those Amazon packers). Bought 2 more and BOTH were broken (double shame). I give up on these. Does anyone make a more resilient one?Edit 8/24/25: Another one broke on the corner. If these were $2.00 I wouldn't mind them being so short-lived. They have no flex at all anymore and might as well be porcelain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKT63VMDBBQXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X86T7E#wasThisHelpful","RKT63VMDBBQXS","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Asus brags that it has Altec Lansing speakers. So what. I can hardly hear them. My laptop is really my everyday, sitting on the kitchen table desktop, so I want to be able to hear a YouTube video while I'm cooking, or whatever. This addition has made that possible.Some reviewers have complained about the strength of the spring on the speaker clip. I was all set to use my second favorite adhesive - Velcro - to solve that problem. But I don't move my computer much, and my laptop 'top' is only about 1/4"", so that seems to be a non-issue.Regarding the volume control, it works smoothly, so that is definitely a function of your driver. But here's what was weird for me: At first I thought it wasn't going to be loud enough, despite some reviews that claimed it was really loud. Playing around, I turned on the 'Loudness' on my Realtek driver, and the volume more than doubled. I've had other issues with Realtek drivers on other PCs, so don't give up if you're not happy with the sound at first. Mess around with those sound settings.Another reason I went with this low end brand was the built in cable. Just one less thing to keep track of. If you are on the go, it stores nicely into the back of the case.If you want to talk about Bass response, get over it. Frequency response at the low end is a function of size. If you want Bass, carry around a subwoofer, or a Boombox. If you want to hear decent sound out of your laptop, this is a reasonably priced, compact option.Edit 11/17: My laptop doesn't have a USB port on the back. This might seem a bit picky, but to keep the cable hugging the side of the keyboard, I added this to the setup: HDE USB 3.0 Vertical Male to Female Adapter. I just know I would hit the cable with a drink or something otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392BX91B1AMSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WPR60O#wasThisHelpful","R392BX91B1AMSL","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an old New Trent, which I never use. It has a dedicated charger, so that means you have to pack another charger.At least this Energizer uses Micro USB, which is the new standard everywhere (except Apple, of course).I have found that it barely charges on some wimpy USB ports or chargers. Nor will it charge my phone when plugged into a charger that's less than 1 amp, even when it's full.My phone is a Nexus, which I know is a hungry device. I get about 24 hrs out of a charge, less if I'm using Navigation. I believe the extended battery is rated at 2100 Mahr.I tested this a couple of times to make sure I was getting the same results. When the phone got down to under 15%, I charged it with this Energizer charger. It successfully charged it overnight, but at that point it was crying out to be recharged itself.That's OK, I thought. It could still come in handy in an airport, or similar situation. I looked at the product page to see if other reviewers shared my experience. Since I received this through Vine, I had no idea of the price.WOW! I have no compunction about spending too much on something that's truly handy.

"I just bought a third one of these.The first one I got in 2006. It's downstairs with my big grill, and doesn't get used much. It's bent, it's dirty, it's got Silicon where I sealed the probe back to the body after breaking it off. I have to press the button a few times to turn it on and off. But hey - it's 6 years old!!My second one just crapped out after 3 1/2 years. But I used it almost every day in the kitchen, and I'm not shy about getting it wet or sticking it in the oven for a minute where it doesn't belong. I've left it out in the rain and melted a bit of it here and there.Your mileage may vary. I'm going for another one and we'll see if the quality has changed.Some have complained about the response time. I don't get that. There's no such thing as instant readout, except with a IR thermometer such as HDE Temperature Gun Infrared Thermometer w/ Laser Sight(which is also very handy for measuring pan temps - 700 degrees for the best Carne Asada).I feel lucky that I haven't had to dink around trying different models to get the right one.

"Actually this is a great little blower for certain circumstances. Like a mini-Leaf Blower, it churns out a pretty nice blast of air. But not enough to blow everything over. So what's it  good for?I bought one to feed air into a heat exchanger for an air roaster. Since that isn't done yet, I've been using it to blow dust off my workbench. It clears the bench without creating a huge storm, or sending small tools flying. The leaf blower would be overkill for that task. You can blow the sweat out of your shirt, the sawdust out of your chopsaw, or get your charcoal grille going in a hurry. I'm picking up a couple of these for future use.I did not have the oily smell that one reviewer mentioned. It was quite loud with a high pitched whine, but that seems to have calmed down with about 10 minutes of running.I expect this to last with intermittent usage. I would not build it into any design where it ran for hours on end.Revised 10/12/2012:Ok, I've never had to downgrade a review as much as I have to with this one. I bought a second one. They are loud enough to warrant earplugs. Ouch. Then I dropped it from less than 2 feet onto gravel and it died. Tried taking it apart to find the loose wire, but no luck. Honest - less than 2 feet.First one - even giving it the benefit of the doubt: I tried it on my heat exchanger as mentioned above. Under a restricted airflow, I know it's not meant for that. But after just under 5 minutes, it burst into flames! Literally caught fire! Ouch again.So, I realize I'm not very kind to my equipment, and take that into consideration when reviewing them. But this is a shop tool, and although it's the perfect size, it's just not that well made.

"These germinated quickly, and grew pretty well in my lousy soil (if it wasn't for the compost I have brought in, it would be all rock and clay).Around the middle of August, all my cucurbits petered out and died. But before they went, these Minnesota Midgets gave up about 8 or 10 tiny melons per plant. They were very mild tasting. Not too sweet, not a real strong 'Canteloupe' fragrance. Of course, I can't say whether that's a characteristic of the melon, or my growing conditions. I've never had great success with melons.Nice texture - we ate them right down the rind every time.Regarding the size, they are like a large grapefruit.

So I liked the idea, especially for organizing things in Rubbermaid containers in the basement, etc. So I was hoping this would do better than mailing labels that tend to fall off over time.No such luck. On really smooth plastic, they seem to stick well. On the standard Rubbermaid container that has a little textured surface to it, they fall off in seconds. So it definitely could have a place in the kitchen drawer. But it is limited as to what you can use it on.

"I bought this just to try it, and can not use it for metalworking. The shield is a full inch shorter than a standard Sperian type shield 3M AO Safety/3M Tekk 90028 Professional Faceshield, and even they don't really keep particles from coming up from underneath. So for preventing straight on flying debris, this one is adequate. But not much more.The real deal-breaker is that the shield attaches to the mask in a proprietary way. So you can't buy a handful of standard shields to replace it. Nor did I see any on Amazon. You drop it, scratch it, and you have to throw the whole thing away.It is light and comfortable to wear. The shield is very thin compared to Sperian type masks. I would not consider it high-impact resistant.So I don't recommend this one for much of anything, except maybe the reviewer that rides a scooter in winter. Even then, their are better masks out there for a few dollars more.I just splurged on this oneSperian Protection S8500 Bionic Face Shield, which really comes down and covers your chin area.

"There's a lot of LED strip lighting out there. It seems like everyone in Guangdong or Shenzen is either making it or selling it. So far all the strips I've bought appear to be from the same factory or same process, even ones that I paid a lot more for before they became more widely available. Some of them are mis-represented here on Amazon, either on purpose or because the seller doesn't know what he's doing.Everything I've bought from this vendor has been exactly as described, at a good price.  These 2700K LEDs most closely resemble incandescent lighting, and may even be a little too warm for some. That's because LEDs have a narrower spectrum than a filament bulb.For hallways, under cabinets, I think these are the best.I've done some projects where the brighter double density or 5050 LEDs are needed to squeeze a lot of light into a small space. But for most accent lighting, these 3528s are more than sufficient. I'll post a couple of photos where I used these.Don't scrimp on the power supply. Don't use some old wall wart you have laying around. They often put out up to 20% more voltage, which will cook your LEDs.If you're going to do a lot of these projects, splurge on a good soldering, too:Hakko Soldering Station, FX-888, 65W","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N669JPZAUC4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q907EW#wasThisHelpful","R3N669JPZAUC4J","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished a big LED project with a $10 iron. What a pain. Why work with marginal tools? I ordered this the next day, and am already loving it. The design is nice (even signed!). Three levels of tip cleaning. Solid metal iron holder. Small footprint power supply. But most important:Plenty of heat - when and where you need it. Heats up quickly, and recovers in seconds. I was amazed at how quickly it got up to 700 degrees.I weld stainless, so this is like mini-welding. Get in and get out, before you burn something. With this iron, you're not cooking the circuit board waiting for it to melt the solder. Crank it up and heat the joint in a second or 2. No cold solder joints with this iron.

"It took me a long time to get into this book. I love evolution, history, and biography - all of the things this book was. So why did I have so much trouble getting through it?The premise seems reasonable - plot the 'history' of evolutionary thought as determined by Darwin's list of those he felt should be acknowledged. But as Aristotle's biography developed (""Aristotle's feelings toward Philip must have been complex at this point. Even if he had fond memories of the prince ...). Already by page 27 I'm thinking TMI. It reads like historical fiction. Which may be good or bad, according to your taste. Another example: ""Sometime in 1493, a family of Italian peasants pushed a handcart into the courtyard of a grand but faded palace in the center of Milan"" ...). The prose scores well for imagery. Not my preference for a science book generally.But as I labored further in time, I found it more absorbing. Stott has unearthed a lot of information on some interesting, not-well-known characters. She does an excellent job of highlighting the challenges of heretical thought during the 18th and 19th century. One is not likely to seek out biographies on the likes of Robert Grant or Abraham Trembley, so these vignettes are refreshing and fun. I never felt that it developed into a cohesive theme, but the theme was arbitrary from the start.So if historical fiction interests you, this non-fiction book might be right up your alley. Definitely 4 Stars. If you prefer a more prosaic style in science writing, then 3 Stars.

"You might enjoy this book. But it's not a primer on wines, nor does it claim to be. It's a memoir, plain and simple. It could have been called ""The trials and tribulations of living your dream and opening a wine shop."" It follows roughly ten years in the life of the author, as he tries to make a go of starting a new business in New York City. Starting a new family at the same time give the story some dramatic tension. There's some interesting tales about wine marketing and the wine industry that are interesting, as well.I can't recommend that this is a book you 'just have to read.' It's just a good story and a quick read. For me it was a fun diversion from my usual weighty tome. Being somewhat familiar with the part of Manhattan where they opened the store gave it a bit more charm for me, also","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKKT5947NEGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307719847#wasThisHelpful","R1RKKT5947NEGS","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There a lot of nesting prep bowls out there. Many of them (like these), are available in bright and strange colors. That's why I didn't buy any of the ones I saw at Sur La Table. These are available in 'Natural', which is a light tan.Also, the ones at Sur La Table all varied in size in order to nest. Which could be an advantage I guess, but I found the small ones too small. Although these nest well, they are all the same size, and perfect most of the time. There are definitely times when I need something much bigger, but there are plenty of other bowls in the cabinet for those situations. However, if you are always cooking for a crowd, you might find these too small.When you're cooking at very high temps, timing is everything. Plus, I like to get my prep done before guests arrive and we start drinking. These are great for that home version of Mis en Place.

"Now that I've found this SSR at a great price, many control circuits are easier to do. Just about any application where you need a switch, but don't want to run a 110v wire. Example - I wanted to replace the noisy but ineffective fan to my Jenn-Air down-draft range. I installed this beefy exhaust fanHydrofarm Active Air 6 inch In-Line Fan 400 CFMoutside,about 20 ft from the range. When I flip the fan switch on the range, it triggers a small wall wart instead of the original fan. I ran a control line through the floor and along the garage ceiling.If I had to run 110, it would have been a major pain, and I never would have tackled the project.Because if the small size, this SSR mounts in a standard wall box and other tight places. For example, I put one inside an outdoor box like this one RAB VXCW Weatherproof Round Box 1/2 - White Color W/O Cover. When the garage lights come on, it triggers additional lighting.Both of these circuits use less that 10% of the 25A rating, so I did not use a heat sink. If you plan on burning a lot of amps through this, there is also a 40 amp version that is only slightly larger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSNBWD77BW24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KPGPU4#wasThisHelpful","R3QSNBWD77BW24","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Bluetooth headset, so I'm a late adopter. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was for me to use this. The instructions are pretty simple.  I thought the voice prompts would be weird, but I prefer them for now. It lets you know if you hit the right button. It synched to my phone right away. I use Greenpower to manage my phone's battery. With it controlling the bluetooth, it turns it on when a call is made or received. It syncs faster than I can answer the call.The sound quality is good based on the feedback I've received. I'm a little deaf, so I wish it had more gain. But it's adequate in most situations.I tested the range with my LG Optimus. I set the phone down and walked about 45 feet away before it dropped the signal. Taking a few steps back, and it picked it right up again.Some have mentioned the port cover. I've already ripped that off.Finally, as for comfort - it could be better. I wear earplugs all the time, and it seems like this would do better if it had a more tapered shape. I don't talk on the phone a lot, so no big deal.

"I've had this for 2 months now, so I feel ready to give it a review. I started with a primitive crock-pot hack, and quickly decided I wanted the real deal. If you have the counter space, this looks a lot nicer than a crock-pot with a bunch of wires everywhere. As an appliance that I use about twice a week, it merits a prominent spot in my kitchen.I've done pork chops, pork and beef tenderloin, short ribs, Delmonico, whole chicken, chicken breasts. All of these early experiments have ranged from decent first attempts, to amazing.Chicken (145 with fresh Rosemary)is the tenderest ever - white meat that explodes with juices when you poke it. I'm looking forward to trying some free range birds, hoping for some real intrinsic flavor.Pork loin (134) has been especially good. I get local meat that isn't pumped with liquids. Prepared simply and cooked all day. Ready to sear when I get home from work.I've also used it to keep liquids at 105 for a yeast based batter.I haven't mentioned seafood - I will try it, but feel that broiling or grilling will still be my preference for that. The utility of this is clearly geared to meats. Some people use it to achieve the perfect egg, something else that isn't my thing.My latest adventure was a local grass-fed sirloin tip. Seasoned with old bay and pepper, it cooked for 48 hours at 131. Sliced thin and served cold, it was quite a treat for a weekday meal.The design is perfectly utilitarian. It's a simple concept, and they didn't over-complicate it. The appliance looks fine enough to leave out, and is light enough (without water!) to pull in and out of a cabinet. The handle placement is perfect for pouring out the water.It's not a panacea. You still need good ingredients and a sense of proportion in use of spices. Generally, less spice is better. If you use something permeating like Cumin seed, better to count the seeds (like 5).Regarding the Ziploc/Foodsaver debate, I don't see much difference. Ziplocs do leak some of the aroma, but that's not a bad thing, is it? I use vacpacs for smaller items, especially because I have a lot of them. A 3 lb chicken fit nicely in a 2 gallon Ziploc. I do recommend keeping the zipper draped over the side just in case you didn't zip it perfectly.There's lots of info on the web, if you're looking for some guidance on a particular cut. At least you can see what other people have tried. Google 'Dave Arnold' for some Culinary fun.Some people balk at the price. I don't agree, considering there is no competition at the consumer level. I'm not saying it's a bargain, but either is a Kitchenaid mixer. What does a Kitchenaid do? It saves you time and gives you consistent results. That's the way I look at this Low Temp Cooker.  The ability to do Sous Vide in my own kitchen has changed the way I think about cooking and meal planning. It allows me to focus on the other dishes and not worry about timing the meat. It allows me to serve meals on a weeknight that would otherwise not be possible. Assuming it lasts a long time, it will be money well spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23F2LKJKUSIAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CNVW4Y#wasThisHelpful","R23F2LKJKUSIAQ","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of light duty brakes out there. But this is the first one I found that seemed heavy duty enough for me, without going to that next level in the thousands of dollars. It's made with pretty thick steel - 10 MM in most places where it counts. I only work with SS -  I've bent some 16 and 18 gauge without trouble. Twelve gauge I scored first.The adjustments for the Press Plate are easy and seem to have enough precision. I give it 4 stars for it's overall design and strength. The precision of the build is about what you expect from some unknown Chinese factory, maybe even a little better.But:I bought mine as an assembled floor display - I could mostly see what I was getting but for the thick red paint. If you've ever bought HF tools, etc., you know that it can be a bit of a gamble.The one problem I had with mine is after a few uses, a weld on the Press Plate Stabilizer broke. I could have chalked it up to abuse, except when I cleaned the paint off the weld area I discovered deep rust. The kind you get from leaving a piece of steel outside for the winter.Despite that, I still think it deserves 4 stars. For the money, it's a solid tool. The quality control of any particular bender is something you can only judge when it's in your hands.For adjustments, you'll need a 13, 17, 18, and 24MM wrench. The 24 you might as well buy hereTEKTON 21411 24mm Combination Wrench.

"First let me say that I'm not an 'athlete'. Nor am I a huge fan of earbuds. Also, when I think of Monster, I think of the company that convinced people a $100 HDMI cable is really worth it.I waited a while to do this review, for a short plane trip to test them out. Of course they did not block sound as well as my active noise canceling headphones, but they were adequate for listening to my ipod on a 90 minute flight. They were also quite comfortable. I ended up not using any of the Sportclips, but with the right tip it stayed in by ears. I'm not sure if the little swivel adjustent really helped, but they are the most comfortable earbuds yet. The sound is decent, and the case holds my Nano as well. I've had a few other brands with replaceable tips, which turned into loseable tips. These tips feel like they will stay on and not disappear.The controller worked well with my Nano, and surprised me when I held a button ( I never read instructions), and a strange voice said ""Billy Strayhorn Rain Check""As for value - I got these as a VINE item. I had no idea of the cost until I went to write this review. Are these really 15 times better than $10 earbuds. Will they last 15 times longer in harsh environments. I'm not the one to judge that. I see that these are not the most expensive earbuds you can buy, So I'm clearly out of the zeitgeist. I spent $1200 for a coffee maker, so I guess $150 earbuds aren't too outrageous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V14YWVTZ296/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YH9EZ8#wasThisHelpful","R15V14YWVTZ296","A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ERTHGCYNZ1TA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this drill for over 2 years. I had one of the same issues as reviewer Martin Snider - I almost broke my wrist a couple of times. I work mostly in SS, and this drill gets a lot of abuse. I've left it out in the rain occasionally. My wife uses it with a 3"" bulb bit to plant bulbs. It comes back to me filthy - I hose it off and keep on going.I've dropped it more than a few times. Eventually the tab broke that holds the battery in. I can't blame PC for that. Using plastic epoxy, I refashioned the tab and it'd good as new.I know that Lithium cells are all the rage. I have a Hitachi DS10DFL 12-Volt Peak Li-Ion 2-Speed Drill/Driver, and it's great too. But this Porter Cable drill has pretty much eliminated my need to pull an electric (you know, actually plug in) drill out of the tool box. Only when I need a hammer drill. The battery life is starting to fade a little, but not much. With 2 batteries, it's never been an issue.Finally, the service: When I brought this home, the charger light did not indicate it was charging. I called customer service, and they had a new one on the way in the time it took to give them my name and address. Hassle free service. Can't beat that.I hope Santa brings me a new one.

"I'm impressed by the temperature aspect of this water bottle - touch the cap to see the temperature of the liquid inside.  I thought that this was an impressive and unique aspect that puts this water bottle above others.  If you find that a certain temperature is perfect, then you can continually have your liquid (coffee, tea, whatever!) reach that temperature prior to drinking so you can be completely satisfied!  The water bottle includes an infuser - put fruit in the infuser to give your water an added bump of flavor (personally, my favorite to add is strawberries!).  This insulated water bottle is reported to keep cold liquids cold for 24 hours and hot liquids hot for 12 hours.  Although I can't personally attest to either since my liquids don't last that long, I can say that the cold/hot has stayed until I've finished my drink without issues!  As the company reports, I've not had any issues with condensation or leaking either, which is definitely a win.One issue I do have is that the temperature only shows in Celsius...I wish it had an option to change between Celsius and Fahrenheit so I could choose how I want to view the temperature of the contents.

"The headphones look nice in person - I received the red pair and the coloring really does look nice; however, they don't feel like they are the best quality and, as other reviewers have said, these will definitely not fit my nephew (four years old) that I purchased them for.  The tightest setting fits my head...and I don't have the smallest head.  The star on one side was already scratched and the red could be seen.  If this happened prior to me even receiving them, I have to wonder how well they would hold up to being used by children (who aren't notorious for taking good care of things).  I think these headphones would be more accurately described as being good for TEENAGERS (not children) and only to play around with, not as well-made, high quality headphones.  I wore for a short time and I do think they are fairly comfortable, but the ear pads (and all other aspects of the headphones) really do feel cheap.  I understand that at this price range you can't expect perfection (and that's why I gave the product three stars), but I do think there are probably better options out there at this price.In addition to some of the other issues discussed, my husband also noted that, when at the smallest setting, they fit awkwardly on the head because spacing and angles are incorrect.  Also, I think it would better if buyers could CHOOSE the color they want instead of getting a random color.

"I am an organization fanatic and most people close to me know my obsession with storage boxes!  With that being said, I usually focus on purchasing inexpensive boxes so I can get several instead of spending $20+ on one storage box.  This storage box is seriously fantastic, but is more than I would want to spend on one storage box (although I will say that it is probably worth it when looking at the quality of the one that I received).All of the thread lines on the storage box I received are perfect, all the fabric is perfectly in place as well.  The box is a decent size and I love the fabric feel of the outside and the faux leather lid.  Appearance-wise, this is probably one of the most attractive storage boxes that I own and I'll definitely be putting it to good use in an area where it can be seen!  The black and white herringbone pattern with the faux leather lid gives the storage box a modern and stylish look that most other storage boxes can't reach.  The storage box also feels very well-made and heavy duty (I wouldn't worry about it messing up anytime soon!).If the price was lower, I would definitely be giving this storage box five stars, but since I would hesitate purchasing because of the price, I can't justify five stars - although this is a fantastic storage box, don't get me wrong!

"My husband has been working outside a lot lately and I worry about his body temperature rising and worry about heat-related risks as he does this.  I was excited to get a chance to test out this cooling towel to see if this could help keep his body temperature down while working outside in the heat (80 and 90 degree F days!).  The cooling towel is easy to use - all you have to do is soak it in cold water, ring out the excess, and it's good to go!  I am impressed with how long the towel stays cold and it gives me some piece of mind as he is outside working in the heat.  In addition, he's reported that this helps him stay cool for an extended amount of time before having to re-wet it.

"My husband was so excited when I showed him this Helicopter Landing Pad!  My husband has a small (or...large) obsession with remote controlled helicopters/drones/everything.  He regularly will fly one of these devices outside (and sometimes inside...) our home.

I also love the ""realistic"" look to this Helicopter Landing Pad, with the large ""H,"" the black and yellow stripes, and the red LED lights (which, like other reviewers said, are surprisingly bright!).  The landing pad was easy to assemble overall, but my husband did have some complications with the one that we received (which is the reason for the docked star).

"My husband enjoys a specific brand of water and, since the company is in the same city as we are, he can get his hands on the large jugs of water.  We've had one of these sitting around for awhile and he's been discussing getting a water stand so that he can drink it, but I wasn't really excited about the bulkiness of having one of those in the house.  When I saw this, I thought it would be a great alternative to having the actual stand.  Although the concept is great, this particular dispenser did have some issues.  For starters, I did have difficulty with getting a secure fit on the bottled water that we have...I finally got it to a point where it would do the job, but it wasn't a great seal and had to be held in place awkwardly.  On top of that, I agree with another reviewer who stated that it had an odd smell.

I was immediately impressed with the quality - I can tell that the product is well-made, but also felt soft and didn't make my knee area sweaty when wearing it while moving furniture.  I did notice that I seemed to have less pressure on my knee (maybe the tendon underneath?) and my knee didn't get as sore as it normally does during high levels of physical assertion.  It felt flexible, moved well with my body, and fit my legs without issue (which isn't always possible when you're a thick-legged girl like me).

"Even though we try our best to give our dogs regular baths, I have to admit that occasionally they probably go a little longer than they should!

This vertical stand has really been a winner for me - I stand the PS4 on its side which takes up less space and I can put the controllers on the stand as well to keep them next to the PS4 (and it makes it where they have a designated spot to go after use!).  Also, it charges the controllers as well, which is fantastic since I have a history of using controllers until they are dead before taking time to charge them.  With this, they charge every time that I finish using them and place them on the dock!  Just in case I forget to place them on the charging stand, it also has four USB ports on the front (easily accessible!) in case I need to plug the controller in via USB cord.Overall, I love it!  Organizes while charging without taking away from the modern look of the PS4.  This is a great stand/charging dock that keeps everything in one place without distracting from how great the PS4 looks.  I was also impressed by the fact that the controllers fit so perfectly on the stand that when you put them in their designated spot, they controllers are immediately plugged in.My only downside (although it wasn't enough to dock a star) is how bright the blue power light is on the front of the stand.  Oh my god, it lights up the entire room!  Making sure that everything is turned off before going to bed is a must as the light is so bright that I'd never be able to sleep if it was visible.  I do think future purchasers would appreciate the brightness of the light being significantly toned down!  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LO3216LLDQI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BUQDPI#wasThisHelpful","R1LO3216LLDQI1","A2B2ZV61X41YIS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B2ZV61X41YIS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw this on tv last night. Unfortunately I did not see the very beginning where it must have said that the show is fictional. The scientist's account of his experience at the dead zone at the Algerian desert piqued my interest. However, as it went on, it started sounding weird and scripted. Comcast listed it as a ""documentary,"" so I thought I would stick it out until the end. It was a 2-hour show that ended at midnight and I struggled to stay awake (it was a weeknight). I only wish that I had googled the show sooner and so have gone to bed sooner.

"I have a 4 year old German Shepherd who's always been addicted to walking fast. She knows ""heel"" but she prefers to walk ahead of me. I learned about the slip leash from watching the Dog Whisperer and I've been using a double-handle leash as one. My dog is much easier to control as long as the leash is at the top of her neck but it tends to slide down after a minute or so and then she'll start pulling again. What's so nice about this leash is it has a sliding leather that keeps the leash in place at the top of my dog's neck. It is also thick, smooth and soft. It doesn't chafe my hands like some nylon leashes do. The color is a nice olive green.

"I have an energetic 65lb 3-year old German Shepherd who has always loved to pull until one day she dragged me onto the ground when she saw a couple yappy little dogs. So I said, that's it, I have to be the pack leader a la Cesar Millan. The past couple of weeks I've been using Cesar's techniques on her (and on my husband!) and I must say she's improved a great deal. No more walking on a long leash and sniffing and peeing whenever and wherever she wants. Now that she has learned to heel, there's really no more need for a 6-foot leash so I switched to this one. It is not as pictured but it works well. The material is very thick and is comfortable to hold. It's great to use with a regular collar but since my dog still isn't a 100% well-behaved walker (she lapses to her old wild ways when she sees small yappy dogs), I use it with the Premier Pet Gentle Leader Headcollar, Black, Large.

"The ceramic pot looks small but it holds a little over 2 cups of liquid or a fondue recipe with 16oz of cheese. The instructions say that it should be immersed in water for 2 hours before use. I don't know if it's a one-time thing or it has to be done before EACH use. Since it's not a lot of work, I immerse it in water before each use just to be safe. There are holes at the base of the feet where water can get into the interior of the pot - which is probably what prevents the pot from cracking due to heat.I cook the fondue in a nonstick pot and transfer it in the ceramic fondue pot just before serving. The tea light does a good job of keeping the fondue hot and in the liquid state. Even with the traditional Swiss fondue pots, cheese tends to burn/form a ball close to the heat source, so I give the fondue a little swirl with my bread every now and then. In the end, my husband and I were able to eat only half of the fondue - so this size pot can definitely feed 4 people. I covered the leftover fondue (still in the ceramic pot) with a cling wrap and stored it in the fridge. To eat it again, I heated the entire thing in the microwave a minute at a time, 2 to 3 times, giving it a swirl with a spoon after each minute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMW4PN9EXT6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y9SO9C#wasThisHelpful","R2NMW4PN9EXT6F","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this cover because I park my 2003 VW Passat in my driveway and it gets dusty pretty fast. Aside from that, leaves from neighbors' trees get in the trim of the windows, doors and windshield. I also see a lot of yellow spots...until now I don't know if it's from tree pollen or bird poop. I would have liked a waterproof cover but the price is outrageous so I settled for this one. During the rainy season I plan to just keep the car uncovered.I did not know there was a marking on the front end of the cover which says ""Front."" So after taking it out of the box, lay it out first inside your house to locate the marking. That simple step will make life easier. There's a string included in the bag but I did not even use it because the elastic hem was enough to keep the cover firmly in place. We had a really windy night right after I put the cover on but the next morning the cover was still there.***UPDATE: 08/15/2013: I really liked how this cover fits on my car but sadly, after only 1 month I began noticing a significant thinning of the material. Eventually, it started shedding powdery lint. The last straw was when it ripped on several spots on the roof area while I was putting it back on the car.

"I have a 2003 VW Passat which has a peculiar size windshield (27x50 inches). Most sunshades for sedans that I've seen were under 24 inches in length. I found Amico 50.8"" x 27.6"" Car Rear Window Reflective Bubble Aluminum Foil Sunshade which looks just right but it ships from Hongkong and has no Amazon guarantee. So at the end I chose this one which is slightly bigger but has a nicer design and ships from CA. I live in northern CA so I got it in the mail in just 4 days. It fits perfectly in my windshield, however, the rearview mirror sits a little low so I couldn't tuck the center V portion of the sunshade beneath it. So I just put the 2 visors down to keep the sunshade propped up. Overall, for the price and quality, I'm very satisfied.

"I'm so glad I found this product. I couldn't find it anywhere else, even Petco. My German shepherd dog already has a harness so I really don't need the harness car strap that is quite expensive. This one is great because it's $5 and the fact that one end inserts into the seat belt slot is really cool. Now I keep it inserted in the slot all the time. I just unclip my dog's harness when she gets out and clip it back when she gets back in. It's so hassle-free. I highly recommend it for dogs who like to walk/crawl all over the place.

"I recently bought a sedan with leather seats which my German shepherd can easily puncture and rip. She drags a lot of mud and dirt as well when I take her out running. I must say this pet hammock does a really good job of taking care of those problems. Hair does escape the hammock but I vacuum the interior once a month anyway so it's not a big deal.There are no instructions but it's easy to figure out from the pictures. The short side obviously attaches to the back of the front seats. There are 2 disks that you insert in the back seats so the hammock stays in place. I must say the 4 corners of the hammock do not stay in place like in the photo. They droop because there's no means of attaching them onto the top of the seats.My dog likes to walk/crawl all over the place so I got her a leash seat belt as well (P26o Adjustable Pet Cat Dog Safety Leads Car Seat Belt). It prevents her from jumping onto the front seats (the hammock can't prevent that if the dog is really determined). With her strapped in, she's content to rest her head on the edge of the hammock in between the front seats.I have never washed the hammock since getting it. There was a new nylon smell at the beginning but it went away after a couple of trips with the windows open. I give it a good shake after each trip to get dirt and some hair off and that's it. When my dog is really muddy, I wipe her off with a towel first before I let her in the car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38L6BQBIJ1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIZ4WME#wasThisHelpful","R38L6BQBIJ1E","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very sturdy and well-made cast iron wok. I followed the instructions for seasoning and the wok came out golden brown. I followed one reviewer's suggestion to heat up water in it to remove the waxy substance. To save gas, I filled the wok 3/4 full with water and placed it in the oven while it was preheating. By the time the oven reached 450 degrees, I could see the wax mixed in the water. I brushed it after that (no soap) and then I coated it with a thin layer of vegetable oil. The oven would smoke even if you use only a thin layer of oil so I lined the bottom of my oven with foil to catch the drippings. I think I seasoned it pretty good because after a wash, I let it drip in the sink for a couple minutes and then wipe it off with a paper towel. I don't even bother coating it with oil anymore. Of course, I never use soap/dish detergent. A good soak and brushing would do.I have cooked rice noodles in it and didn't experience sticking or any other problems. Like any other cast iron utensil, it takes awhile to heat up but once it is hot, it stays hot. I am sure this wok would outlive me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQMT5XJMXA9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z0ZMX6#wasThisHelpful","RTQMT5XJMXA9H","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have both the Burgmuller etudes and the Czerny opus 599. However, those books don't really tell you what the etudes are specifically targeting.

I'm not a big fan of Hanon but Clarfield chose some of his useful exercises in preparation for a Burgmuller etude. All I can say is it's great.

"I've always liked Schirmer music editions because their layout is always nice and easy to read. However, one reviewer mentioned that this volume is not the absolute complete collection of Songs Without Words. So I compared it with Complete Songs without Words for Piano (Dover Music for Piano) and Schirmer in fact has 49 songs. Dover (""Complete"") only has 48.  The 49th song from Schirmer's is the Venetian Boat Song published posthumously. I chose this book over the Dover edition because apart from the notes being bigger, the editor added some helpful fingerings here and there as well as pedal marks. I am not concert pianist caliber so I could definitely benefit from a little editorializing. The Dover book was purely notes from start to finish and contains more music in a page so it's 40 pages less than Schirmers. For my needs and skill level, this book is just perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKDEO9AJC3N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0793525969#wasThisHelpful","R1SKDEO9AJC3N1","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, the publisher did not indicate which Opus # each exercise was from. It would have been nice to know. My main gripe about this compilation is that exercises aren't categorized.

"I used Opus 599 when I first learned to play the piano back in highschool. Interestingly, my mom happened to have a copy although she never played the piano and she convinced my teacher to use it on me. My teacher is a proponent of Hanon and I'm so thankful that she agreed to train me on Czerny. I'm sure Hanon is effective but I could never stand it!  The Czerny etudes are very melodic so I have always had fun playing them. Unfortunately, when I went to college and after that started working, I stopped playing piano entirely. Now, 15 years later, I'm home a lot more and my husband bought me a piano! I tried to find the Czerny I used in the past but couldn't. Luckily my mom still has it and she emailed me a photo. It is exactly the same as this version (Schirmer's) except it was published by Carl Fischer - probably out of print already that's why I couldn't find it. Anyway, I highly recommend this book... you won't need anything else. Unlike the super tedious Hanon, it doesn't feel like a drudgery to go through each exercise.

"I've been baking scones weekly for my husband to eat for breakfast at work and he loves it.  However, scones have a lot of butter in them and I'm worried about my husband's cholesterol intake. I found a healthy apple muffin recipe by Ellie Krieger which is delicious but I needed a variation. This book is perfect! It has 100 kinds of muffins and they're so easy to make.  I do tweak the ingredients a bit to make them healthier, for example, I substitute butter with canola oil and use a 50-50 ratio of white to whole wheat flour.  I also use a teaspoon of baking soda to make it less cakey.There was a lady who said the title was misleading and I don't know what she's talking about.  There is a basic muffin mix which all the muffins have in common - flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, shortening and eggs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ASES9QDF4ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1407526162#wasThisHelpful","R29ASES9QDF4ZN","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this fryer for my husband last Christmas... he's been wanting one for the longest time.  I must admit I was surprised at first at how small it was inside but my first try was a success so I decided to keep it.  I made crinkle cut chips and french fries from fresh potatoes and they both turned out great!  For 5 russet potatoes I think I did around 10 batches.  I did not want to overcrowd the tank because the temperature would drop.  What's really nice was the potatoes cooked evenly so there was no need to babysit it.  Once I dropped the basket in I could do other things and check only after 5 minutes or so. It's also great that I could hook the basket onto the lip and leave it there for a few seconds to drain.  My only wish is that the tank could be removed for easier cleaning.  I cook for only my husband and myself so this size is perfect for us.  It is a cute little appliance that goes well with our tiny kitchen. Hopefully it would last a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137K25LGOA780/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I6NOF4#wasThisHelpful","R137K25LGOA780","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to bake breads back in highschool (over 20 something years ago) and the book I had back then was a basic baking cookbook with lots of pictures.  Sadly I don't have that book anymore and never wrote down my favorite bread recipes.  I tried some recipes from Foodnetwork.com and allrecipes but those sites don't really give good step-by-step instructions especially with regards to kneading.  I would always get a tough and heavy dough and I always thought that I was over-kneading it.

I've made the pizza dough, banana bread and cinnamon rolls.  My husband was really impressed.  Although this book has no pictures, the instructions are very easy to read and follow.

"I was so happy with the lemon squeezer that I got this one too.  I have a navel orange tree in my yard and I thought this would make life easier for me.  As one reviewer noted, once you start squeezing, the lip of the orange half would get folded in.  I also think that because navel oranges are too meaty, the holes get plugged by the meat and juice doesn't come out.  I always finish up by hand.  On the bright side, since the orange has already been squished, squeezing it even by one hand is pretty easy.  I think this would work better if the diameter of the squeezer was made a little bigger.  It would prevent the lip of the orange from folding inward.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EA2MQGBW1UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002V23BQ#wasThisHelpful","R10EA2MQGBW1UG","A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SDVBZFH9UZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I held off on the TC Electronic Dark Matter distortion for a little while, even after an impressive demo session a few months ago because: (a) I thought it would be redundant with pedals I already have; and (b) at $50 (or less), I really didn't think it could be that great.  Over time, though, the low prices for both the MojoMojo and Dark Matter got me, and I now own both.  It's a good pedal, but I think their marketing of it is a bit misguided, and that's reflected in some of inconsistent reviews.Let's get a few things cleared up.  While the name ""Dark Matter"" sounds evil and imposing, this is essentially a crunchy ""Marshall-in-a-box"" pedal.  It probably covers more of the ""cranked Plexi"" territory than the higher gain JCM, but it can get fairly gainy.  Paradoxically, however, the ""Dark Matter"", in my opinion, is a much brighter pedal than the MojoMojo.  Whereas the MojoMojo has a lot of bassy low frequencies and tube-like sag, the Dark Matter is more obviously British-voiced.  That means tight low-end frequencies and a clear-yet-sometimes-abrasive high end.If you watch the promotion materials from TC Electronic, it was clear that their goal with both of these pedals was to offer affordable overdrive/distortion pedals that do not cut out all of the low end you experience if you were plugged into a big amp.  The Dark Matter isn't hurting for low end by any means, but as I said, it's more of a tight, focused low end than a booming swelling bass.  I didn't do a A/B comparison, but I suspect that if your goal is to make a small amp sound ""bigger"", you may be better served with an OCD variant, like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or EHX Glove OD.  But on most 10"" or 12"" combos, the Dark Matter will do just fine.  It actually sounded great on my Vox AC10C1, even though that is an amp with a very non-Marhsall gain structure, and can be finicky with some pedals.The mod switch isn't as dramatic as the Hi/Lo switch on an OCD.  It's more of a subtle shift in the mid range frequencies to focus on higher mids (up) or lower mids (down).  TC Electronic mentions that if you are playing in a mix, you may want the switch up, whereas solo players may prefer it down.The Bass and Treble controls are neutral in the middle position, and there is a cool ""notch"" you can feel in the potentiometer when it is centered.  The tone controls work, but are not quite as dramatic as some of the new Baxandall circuits you'd find on a $200 boutique.  In other words, you can expect to boost some low frequencies, or cut the treble a little, but don't depend on the EQ to dramatically alter the underlying tone of the pedal.If this pedal cost $200, it would be a fairly average distortion that would likely get lost in a crowd of excellent boutique options.  At $50, however, it's a 5-star product in my opinion.  In fact, it makes me almost sick to think that people can have something like this for the same cost as the DS-1 I had in the 90's, when that was really my only decent choice at that price.  The Dark Matter may be a bit mismarketed, but it can do an excellent Marshall crunch and is a nice compliment to the darker MojoMojo.  Great pedal at a price almost any guitarist could afford.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9TSWEZVH5QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OK5TRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3N9TSWEZVH5QP","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great ironies of the guitar gear industry is that much of what's popular is based on recycled technology (50's era pickups, tube amps, hundreds of overdrives based on Tubescreamer circuits, etc.), yet there's a constant hunger for the newest and best pedal on the market.  Sometimes, that phenomenon leads to pedals released a few years ago being overlooked.  In this way, I feel that 2011's Mojo Hand FX Rook Overdrive is vastly underappreciated.BUILD QUALITY - Mojo Hand FX pedals are very well-built.  The knobs and enclosure look very similar to JHS Pedals (another favorite of mine), and everything feels solid.  There is a 9V battery compartment, but it is only accessible by removing 4 screws.  I also added 4 rubber feet to the bottom of my Rook, but you could fasten it using zip ties or velcro also.  The 9V jack is center negative (BOSS standard), and is top mounted, which I prefer, as it keeps it away from the I/O jacks.  Top notch durability.TONES - The Rook actually has 3 settings with the center mod switch, and they are quite a bit different - we'll refer to them as ""TOP"", ""MIDDLE"", and ""BOTTOM"" positions.  Before I bought the Rook, I heard people say that the Top and Bottom positions were kind of like a modded Tubescreamer.  I see some similarities, but know that the Rook has CONSIDERABLY more low end and tonal flexibility than any Tubescreamer I've used.  If you're paying for a boutique overdrive pedal, it's a nice touch when virtually all of the settings on every knob offer something musically useful.  On the Rook, you get almost a true bypass sound with the Gain all the way at zero.  With my Vox AC10C1, I was even using the Rook as an ""underdrive"" - you could set it up clean up some of the tube distortion of the amp and play at lower volumes, while retaining a great deal of EQ control.  Very few overdrive pedals offer this flexibility - usually there are entire ranges of the gain knob that are either unusable, or don't sound particularly good.  The Rook's gain knob sounds great all over the place.TOP Setting - With the switch all the way up, you get a low to moderate overdrive that breaks up with the smoothness of a Tubescreamer, but can get much bassier.  I really liked some of the lower gain settings, which remind you of a tube amp just starting to break up.  The tone controls are very powerful, however, so there's plenty of high end sparkle also available.BOTTOM Setting - The switch's bottom position is similar to the TOP setting, except meaner and higher gain.  The Rook isn't really meant to be a heavy rock or metal pedal, but this setting will get you pretty close.MIDDLE Setting - The middle setting is pretty interesting - I've heard some people compare it to a Klon, even though Mojo Hand did not promote it that way, and only just released a separate Klon pedal (Sacred Cow) in November 2015.  The middle setting removes some of the clipping diodes, so the result is louder, cleaner, and more punchy/responsive.  Since there is less overall compression on this setting, the tone controls become even more powerful here.  At first, I wasn't sure if I liked it as much as the other settings, but when I got it home, I was really impressed with some of the subtle things it could do with the breakup of my tube amp.  It's a nice clean boost capable of some additional grit, and you can use Rook as an always on, simplified ""EQ"" pedal to fatten up or brighten up your tone.SUMMARY - Overdrive pedals tend to be very redundant, but I was actually surprised just how varied and different the Rook was given that I hadn't heard a ton of people raving about it.  The only pedal I've previously owned that it reminded me of was the Fultone Full Drive 2, which seems to behave similarly on its CompCut setting as the middle position does on the Rook.  But the Rook is about half the size, and I like it better than that pedal.  It's a definite keeper, and built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSWP0K1UTDUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015X6UOYM#wasThisHelpful","R1LSWP0K1UTDUL","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an older piece of hardware, but so many people sang its praises and it was so cheap by the time I bought it that I figured ""why not"".  I already own an excellent guitar interface for iPad (the Apogee JAM) and I have cheap mixer and studio monitors, so it's already possibly for me to use iOS instruments through the headphone jack/line out.  So I wondered if the StudioConnect would be an all-in-one solution that would offer RCA connections for digital audio out.For that last purpose, it works fine.  For guitar, not so much.  I'm surprised more people didn't comment on the noise/feedback issues with using the 1/4"" guitar jack in the back.  The Apogee JAM (which, granted, is a $100 device) basically eliminates all of this unwanted noise.  The noise came rushing back with the StudioConnect, which renders it basically useless for quality guitar recording.  It's a shame.The StudioConnect also ties up the 30-pin interface, and does not have a USB MIDI jack of its own.  What this means is that it is basically useful as a conventional MIDI jack interface and not much else.  You can't use a USB MIDI device at the same time as the StudioConnect, and nowadays, USB MIDI has really become the new standard.I didn't spend much on it, but given some of the limitations noted above, I basically purchased a glorified iPad stand that offers some interface capabilities for the traditional MIDI controllers I don't own.  It's possible it could be useful for a particularly subset of iOS musicians, but the prevalence of USB MIDI and abundance of other quality affordable guitar interfaces makes that an ever-narrowing niche.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOO5ELOVUT47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BR5PWI#wasThisHelpful","R2YOO5ELOVUT47","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you get when you find an old drawing from Leo Fender, and combine the pickups, headstock design, and 24.75"" scale of a Les Paul with the basic body shape and feel of a Stratocaster?  If you're G & L, you get the Ascari, which is a relatively new set-neck creation with a mahogany body and rosewood fingerboard.G & L's branding can be somewhat confusing - most of their guitars are named using either acronyms or influences from foreign languages (ASAT, Ascari, Fiorano, etc.), but their basic form factor is usually pretty familiar.  In fact, G & L started in 1979 with the apparent goal of evolving on some of the vintage Fender designs.  But the Ascari is an original design, though not too dissimilar from many PRS SE, Washburn, or Schecter guitars already on the market.Everything about this guitar says ""warmth"".  Mahogany wood and a rosewood fingerboard are a warm combination as are the higher-output alnico humbucker pickups.  This guitar also has impressive acoustic sustain, thanks the upgraded TonePros bridge and tailpiece.One reason I often prefer single coils to humbuckers is that they can drive a tube amp too hard, and then get muddy when you try to mitigate that by rolling off the volume.  For this reason, I like the coil tapping feature on the Ascari.  It doesn't sound ""like a single coil"" per se, but retains the brightness while effectively cutting the output in half.  And these pickups do sound great - it's a nice balanced set that would be at home doing rock, blues, or even heavier genres.Even shipped in a box through an online order, my Ascari arrived set up quite well.  Low action with minimal fret buzz, and a very playable neck.  I've heard some people describe it as a thin neck, but it's not like a Jackson or Ibanez.  The medium jumbo frets are also appreciated.This is an excellent guitar that stays in tune and offers a good variety of tones.  The fact that it's ""just a little different"" than the Strats and Les Pauls that everyone else plays makes it all the more appealing to me.

"While the TC Electronic Flashback is hardly a ""boutique"" piece of gear, you'll see it featured on a lot of expensive-looking pedal boards because it's just so darn versatile! I've had a Boss DD-3 Digital Delay for some time - it's great at what it does.  I've used a couple of inexpensive ""analog""-sounding delay pedals, and they're great also.  But the Flashback is a single pedal that can go from one type of delay to another with a flip of the selector knob.  And that's really why I believe this one will stand the test of time.To be honest, I'm likely to use a few of the delay settings much more than the others.  The ""2290"" delay appealed to me because I grew up as a fan of U2's The Edge, and in fact, he was my entire reason for wanting to check out delay in the first place.  The 2290 delay is a bright, percussive delay - it's not terribly unlike the DD-3, except the Flashback has added features of quarter note, dotted eight, or combined repeats.  So if you're looking for a compact, affordable way to get that dotted eighth delay made famous by U2 and featured heavily in many other types of music, the Flashback is a great place to start.A couple other features worth mentioning...  The ""Delay"" knob sets the time of the delay, and functions like it would on any other delay pedal.  But there is also an option to hold down the soft bypass switch for a few seconds, which kills the sound and allows you to strum out the rhythm on your guitar like a metronome and set the timing that way.  It does work, though it may or may not be your preferred way to set timing (strumming in the proper time silently is harder than it sounds!).Also, this pedal features a 40-second (mono) looper, which I've read some criticism about.  I tested it, and it works pretty well for what it is, which is a ""throwaway"" feature on pedal that otherwise focuses on delay.  Still, don't be too quick to dismiss it completely.  I actually have a dedicated looper pedal (similar to TC Electronics' own Ditto Looper), and while it's superior feature-wise to the looper on the Flashback, it's never going to be a permanent fixture on my pedalboard.  By contrast, the Flashback would be a pedal that would be affixed to my board and used frequently.  So if I'm just messing around and want to solo over a simple chord progression, the Flashback will be there to handle that.Finally, TC Electronic pedals have a ""TonePrint"" customizable delay slot, and you can edit this using a USB cable and a computer, or download artist signature delays from online.  I believe you can even use the ""BEAM"" feature from a smartphone - it emits a high-pitch screech that is picked up by your guitar's pickup, and funneled through to the Flashback.  I'm not kidding, this is how it sends the new preset to the pedal.  And it usually works, except when it doesn't.  The iOS app is a little buggy and needs to be updated more frequently.  Still, a pretty cool idea.This is a great delay pedal that is well worth the price.  It's well-built, versatile, and pretty easy to use relative to its insane feature set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPNN7SMW2FPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M9CKVM#wasThisHelpful","R2DPNN7SMW2FPP","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mooer Yellow Comp was recommended to me by countless people online and in guitar stores, so when I saw it go on sale a bit, I finally checked it out.  I actually have another affordable compressor (The Joyo Dyna Compressor) that I am quite happy with, though I believe it is an ""OTA"" (Operation Transconductance Amp) compressor similar to an MXR, BOSS, or Ross, whereas the Yellow Comp is an Optical Compressor.  I don't have the expertise to get too far into the differences between the two, but I've had it explained that optical compressors are a little slower in cutting off the attack and compress less, but are a bit more transparent and smooth as a result.I think the Mooer Yellow Comp sounds great.  Besides the Joyo, I have owned both the BOSS and MXR varieties.  All of them have their positives and negatives, but this is the first compressor I've played where I really felt like it could be an ""always on"" effect.  Even if you don't want a heavily ""squashed"" sound, mild amounts of compression are still useful for smoothing out undesirable volume spikes and generally adding sustain and saturation to clean tones.My current amp is the new Vox AC10C1 - it's a great amp, but extremely touch-responsive and can get too loud/bright with my heavy picking technique.  The Yellow Comp is great with this amp - I didn't want to turn it off!  The EQ knob on the Yellow Comp operates like the ""Top Cut"" knob that my amp doesn't have!  It seems to alter the amount of compression applied to low or high frequencies, so the result is similar to a high or low-pass filter, even though that really isn't what it's doing.Finally, I should point out that there's no volume loss with this compressor, which is something I noticed with some MXR Dyna Comp variants.  If anything, the Yellow Comp can make things louder by bringing up the level of those quieter notes.  Unity gain for me was probably around 11:30 on the level knob, and increasing compression seemed to make it louder, which is almost the opposite of how a CS-3 or Dyna Comp works.Compressors are very hard to research and review - everyone's idea of how they work seems to be little different.  I've used a few, and I think this is my favorite.  The Mooer pedals are Chinese made and affordable, but the build quality seems excellent.  This one's a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LKBJZO8L48J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM4LT10#wasThisHelpful","R21LKBJZO8L48J","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewing the Mini Tubescreamer here because the other page blends reviews for the full sized TS9 and other variants...I like the Tubescreamer Mini quite a bit.  I hated myself for wanting one because it's about 75% novelty - pretty much every serious pedal nut has a Tubescreamer or cheap clone of one already, and the mini pedal craze is a bit overrated because after you cable everything together, there isn't much room that is saved on a pedalboard using minis versus a ""BOSS""-sized pedal.Still, I sold my TS9 reissue after finding a number of clones (EHX East River Drive being the primary one) that worked well enough, plus I wasn't crazy about the switch on the fullsize model.  This TS Mini is a very nicely made mini pedal.  It has some heft to it, and the switch is soft enough that you don't to knock it over trying to turn it on.  The difficulty seeing the Tone and Level settings on the black mini knobs has been well-documented, but can be fixed with some silver/white paint.Tonally, the TS Mini had more power than I expected.  I felt like my original TS9 was lower output than this pedal, and that's a good thing for the Mini.  Even with lower overdrive settings, the pedal was boosting quite easily.  Not sure if the sound is more TS9 or TS808, but it's a great mids-boosting overdrive that works best with a slightly dirty amp or stacked with other pedals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DHGO2ZX8KGZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLYES6O#wasThisHelpful","R2DHGO2ZX8KGZF","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty hard to fault the Caline Sand Storm for anything given its price and solid build quality.  But of the Caline pedals I have tried (Orange Burst, Pure Sky, English Man), this one probably impressed me the least, so I feel a 4-star review is appropriate.It's becoming apparent that certain Chinese brands (notably Donner and Caline) are rehousing and re-branding pedals that were sold as a different Chinese brand.  My assumption is that this is done for one of two reasons: (1) To generate false hype over a ""new"" product, that is actually just leftover stock; (2) To clear out inventory at a discounted price while protecting the brand integrity of some of the more reputable Chinese brands.  (For instance, Mooer pedals retailed at $88 for quite awhile, where as the nearly identical Donner pedals are closer to $30).With that in mind, I am about 90% certain that the Sand Storm is actually a rehoused Joyo Deluxe Crunch.  The giveaways are the Marshall-flavored tones and the position of ""Pre"" (presence knob).  This pedal actually sounds pretty good, but isn't as appealing at the higher gain Marshall tones as something like the Donner Morpher, and doesn't quite have the low end response to nail the chunkier Plexi tones.  Simply put, there are just SO many affordable options covering this type of sound, they can't all be ""the best"".  But the Sand Storm is a solid overdrive/distortion pedal, and given its minuscule resale value, I am likely holding onto it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVDJBF8M6XJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SV129HC#wasThisHelpful","R2DVDJBF8M6XJU","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased a matched pair of JJ EL84's to ""upgrade"" my Vox AC10C1.  The AC10C1 is a new amp, but I've heard that JJ power amp tubes are a great pairing with Vox-style amps, as they help bring out that trademark ""chime"".  The results with the new tubes have been quite good.  The amp really sparkles with valve/tube sustain and saturation, and it gets bright without being overly harsh or thin.  Even compared to the stock tubes, I feel that the JJ's were an improvement.  Installation was a breeze.

"I purchased a set of 2 Tungsol 12AX7's for an upgrade to my Vox AC10C1, which ships with generic Chinese-made tubes.  I think that sound differences in pre-amp tubes from brand to brand is probably a real thing, but also very hard to gauge.  I opted for the Tungsol's over some other options because I heard that they were well-made and had a bit more warmth to them.  Some other people have remarked that they are good for blues because they dirty up a little more quickly.I cannot confirm all of those things are true, but I am happy with the tube swap in my amp, and would buy this set again.  Installation was a breeze.  Many tubes nowadays are made in just a handful of factories and then re-branded, but I am happy with the Tungsols.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BATVQ7HO8GM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SJLFS#wasThisHelpful","R2BATVQ7HO8GM5","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was initially a little disappointed with the DOD Gunslinger Distortion pedal.  I picked it up based on some great YouTube demo videos and a satisfying low volume playing session at home.  When I got it home, I played it through two amps: a solid state Vox Pathfinder 15 and the all-tube Vox AC10C1.  On the solid state amp, the tone was a little difficult to dial in.  It sounded either muddy or brittle and harsh, kind of like the abrasiveness of a BOSS DS-1.  On the tube amp, the tone became a little too dark and mushy.  It wasn't a terrible sound, but not really what I was expecting.But the tone controls of the DOD Gunslinger are extremely powerful, and after playing with that and accounting for the fact that this is a very high output pedal, I started to pull some great amp-like distortion sounds out of it.  I think the Gunslinger has a nice warmth to it that is also very touch-responsive.  It should excel at warming up an otherwise bright amp.  Definitely more of a ""square wave"" distorted tone than an overdrive.  By turning down the Treble a bit, I got some almost fuzz-like lead tones out of it.  And unity gain on this pedal is probably around 9:00 on the volume knob, so there's no issue boosting your signal.  I read that DOD really aimed to make a pedal that works great with a clean or already dirty amp, and I can see that from my use of it.To summarize, the Gunslinger wasn't a distortion pedal that instantly reminded me of the classic rock distortion tones I expected.  It's not a pedal like the MXR Super Badass Distortion, where it's difficult to make the pedal sound bad on any setting.  The Gunslinger has a personality of its own, and I'm coming to appreciate that.  After all, if it were exactly the same as the other distortion pedals I have, what would be the point?  It doesn't have a mids control (and the pedal is probably a little ""scooped"" overall in sound), but it has plenty of low end and can retain brightness and string-to-string clarity at the same time.  Try it first before you buy it if that's an option for you, but I think it's another quality new product from DOD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CNB5V1UUOAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT7KPCK#wasThisHelpful","R12CNB5V1UUOAC","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am quite pleased with my purchase of the newly-released Vox AC10C1, a 10-watt combo amplifier featuring a 10"" Celestion speaker.  I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but I did quite a bit of research on the AC10C1 and its place in the Vox lineup.  I hope my comments prove useful for prospective buyers, and I will amend my review if my thoughts on the amp change or evolve over time.BACKGROUND - The AC10C1 is in some respects a resurrection of a discontinued vintage product and, in other respects, a completely ""new"" product.  Vox manufactured an ""AC10"" from 1959 to 1967, but the similarities between the two basically end with the model name and wattage.  The original AC10 was a square ""TV front"" combo amplifier that was offered both in a single 10"", or as a 2x10"" ""Twin"" configuration.  The original AC10 featured multiple inputs, vibrato, an open-back cabinet, and an assortment of 5 tubes under the hood.FEATURES OF THE AC10C1 - In 2015, Vox released the AC10C1, but the amp is far from a ""reissue"" of this original design.  Rather, Vox seems to created a completely new design targeting something that the famed AC15 and AC30 do not offer - a sub-$500 tube/valve combo amplifier capable reasonably suited for portability, and home/studio use at reasonable volumes.  The feature set of the AC10C1 is somewhat limited, but mostly in line with similarly priced ""entry-level"" tube amplifiers.  There is a single input jack, and extension cabinet jack for 10 watts in a 16-ohm cabinet, a separate gain and master volume control, and knobs for bass, treble, and reverb.  There is also a main power switch but no standby switch (my understanding is that this is commonly missing on many modern lower powered tube amps).PROS - I had the opportunity to try out the AC10C1 a few times before I bought it, and I was instantly enamored with the tone.  It somehow marries the ""chime"" and ""dirty cleans"" of a signature Vox tone with a fuller low end presence - almost like a Fender Deluxe Reverb.  One thing important to point out is that this amp becomes loud fairly quickly.  I am using it exclusively as a hobbyist for bedroom/basement levels, but if controlling volume for your neighbors is a priority, there are other amps I would consider first.  But the nice about the AC10C1 is that it is at least capable of bedroom level cleans (or overdriven tones, due to the master volume control), while also having horsepower for keeping up with other instruments and possibly some smaller gigs.  I've been in love the tone of an AC30 for years, but it wasn't until the AC10C1 was released that Vox made an all-tube amplifier that I could realistically consider owning.The aesthetics of this amp nail vintage Vox, and I believe that is a step in the right direction for this company, which has spent the last 15 years or so releasing some decent products (Night Train, Valvetronix, etc.) that are either divisive or downright ugly in appearance, depending on whom you ask.  The rectangular shape not only makes the amp look like a smaller AC30, but I believe it benefits the sound.  Some 10"" combo amps develop a ""boxy"" sound that can be quite directional.  The wider, closed-back cabinet deflects bass frequencies forward across a wider field, and I would argue that this amp can compete with some 12"" combos in terms of fullness in a home practice setting.Vox advertises that the AC10C1 features the famous ""Top Boost"" circuitry made popular on the AC30 and popularized by players like Brian May and The Edge.  People who understand amp circuitry better than I do have remarked that the tube configuration of the AC10C1 is quite different from the authentic Top Boost circuit.  Whatever you call it, however, the amp is extremely warm-sounding and versatile.  Low wattage, single-channel tube amps seem to fail more often than not at offering a combination of clean headroom and rich, saturated overdrive tones.  The AC10C1 nails both, and can do so at a variety of volumes.  At 27 pounds (versus 47 pounds for the AC15), it is also surprisingly lightweight and portable.CONS - Despite my overwhelming positive impressions of the AC10C1, this is far a perfect product both in design and in execution.  Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first - the amp is manufactured in China, much a like an increasing portion of affordable gear nowadays.  If your expectation for a tube amplifier is that it is hand wired in the US or UK, then those products are available for you, but usually at a considerably higher cost.  Chinese construction is a reality of globalization in 2015, especially in the more affordable end of the guitar gear spectrum.  My personal view on it is that guitar playing is a hobby for me, and my gear does not need to ""perform"" or be thrown into vans at 2am.  If it is built well enough to sit in my basement, I hope that I can take care of it and get many years of enjoyment, while saving money that I don't have to spend on $1,000+ amplifiers.  But the fact remains that this is the first run of a new product, so nobody can say for certain if there are any pressing design flaws.I have not removed the back of the cabinet, but have seen pictures of the amp's internals from other people who have.  The components, including the two pre-amp and two power amp tubes are arranged and fastened in a manner that seems more focused on keeping the size compact, as opposed to convenience or long-term durability.  Also, I have heard that speaker replacement on this amp can be quite difficult because there is simply not much room to install a speaker of a different size/shape.  So, if you are into modding, this is almost certainly not the right amp for you, but I like amp stock, and as long as it continues function for many years, I will be happy enough.Feature-wise, the amp does not have an effects loop, which is a bit disappointing for me, as I like to use effects pedals, and the loop can really expand the way effects are used.  The on-board reverb is digital, and I actually like the initial attack and quality of its tone.  But if this amp is ever revised, I hope they re-tune it a bit because it seems to favor long decay times even on very low settings.  I found that using the reverb on ""1"" or even less than ""1"" was all that I needed, but that setting would usually correspond to a ""3"" or a ""4"" on a Fender amp, for example.  At the end of the day, it's not a great reverb, but it's better that it's there versus not having one at all.  I do plan on using it, and an amp with on-board reverb is more tempting to plug directly into, which means it is more likely to get played.ALTERNATIVES TO THE AC10C1 - As written above, I bought the AC10C1 exclusively to use as a home combo amp.  I wanted it to get just slightly louder than I would ever need, while retaining fullness and clarity at bedroom levels.  I believe the AC10C1 does that exceptionally well.  It nails the character of ""Vox clean"", which adds in tube saturation and sustain to a tone that otherwise remains brilliant and expressive, walking a delicate line between ""clean"" and ""overdriven"".But if you are looking for a solid tube amplifier without being married to the idea of owning a Vox, there are other options out there.  The VHT Special 6 is one such option, and retails for nearly $200 less.  Vox offers the Night Train 15 for nearly the same price, and it has an effects loop and more tonal versatility (though I preferred the sounds of the AC10C1).  Fender offers a Pro Junior (10"") and Blues Junior (12"") which are quality tube amplifiers with a longer track record than the new AC10C1.  For gigging, the AC15 is a larger, louder relative of the AC10C1, and may be worth the additional money.  I do not recommend the AC4-112, which is slightly cheaper, but lacks the low end presence of the AC10C1.For a very affordable bedroom solution, however, I would also recommend checking out the Vox Pathfinder 15, which is a now-discontinued solid state 8"" combo.  It can be found used for about $75 to $125, and is an absolute freak of nature in its ability to offer Vox cleans (and even some overdriven tones) in a portable, inexpensive package with no tubes involved.Time will tell if the Vox AC10C1 is a reliable amp.  But I think there is little question they have made a great sounding, 10"" combo that covers the full range of classic Vox tones.  It offers the authentic warmth of an all-tube amplifier and manageable volumes and a decent price point.  I wish I was playing mine right now.UPDATE (10/08/15) - Posting a quick update only a couple of weeks after buying the amp to report that my factory-shipped model functioned absolutely perfectly and sounds great.  I did some research on the tubes (which are Chinese-made and of debated quality), and after verifying from Korg/Vox that these can be replaced without re-biasing, I ordered some Tungsol 12AX7's for the preamp and (matched) JJ EL84's for the power amp.  I will be leaving the stock Celestion speaker as is.  The tube change may or may not make an appreciable difference, but I'm going to try it out, as I have heard several AC10C1 users reporting a noticeable improvement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDD8YKM677PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUT8HMS#wasThisHelpful","R1IDD8YKM677PX","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first BBE pedal, and I came away pretty impressed with this $50 distortion pedal.  I've read some comments that it is like a Boss DS-1 with a better tone control.  At first I thought that was a bit unfair, but the reality is that a better tone control would do a lot to help the DS-1!  BBE isn't particularly clear what they are marketing the 427 as, but I hear a moderate-gain distortion pedal suited for rock and blues.  It uses LED clipping, which results in a warm, amp-like distortion that retains a good amount of bass.  The tone control is quite useful - you can roll off a good deal of treble to pair with brighter amps, or add some high-end presence without turning your amp into an icepick.Construction is pretty solid for this price point.  Heavy duty metal chassis with reinforced jacks and an MXR-style switch.  I believe the pedal is Chinese-made to keep costs down, and there were some minor cosmetic blemishes on my unit.  But if you're looking at a $50 distortion pedal and it sounds great and is reliably built, you're unlikely to care about that stuff.  I own more expensive distortion pedals than this one, but the BBE 427 is a solid keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V7059FAXN8A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9ICM1M#wasThisHelpful","R3V7059FAXN8A2","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a DOD 250 reissue for the same reason I own a Boss DS-1 and SD-1, even if they aren't my ""favorite"" pedals of their type - it's a classic design that has been used by countless guitarists and has stood the test of time.  It's also increasingly going on sale, so it may be a nice value, as well.I have a few ""booster"" pedals, but the line between ""boost"" pedal and ""overdrive"" can get fairly blurry, and the DOD 250 is an excellent example of why that is.  The DOD 250 has both Level and Gain controls.  If you slam the front end of a signal with additional power, the result will be additional gain.  In other words, placing a clean boost before the preamp input of a combo amplifier is more likely to add gain than pure ""volume"".  However, you could use a 250 to boost the volume of an amp (or another pedal) by running it later in the chain, or even in the effects loop.But the 250 also functions like an overdrive pedal in that it has a separate gain control.  Therefore, similar to an overdrive pedal, you can use it to simulate a ""cranked"" amp sound at lower volumes.  The 250 does not have a tone control, but is transparent enough that you can do without one.  I am happy to report that the 250 is warmer than some other boosters (like the MXR Micro Amp, or even an OD like the EHX Soul Food), so it is friendly towards smaller combo amps.Construction on these reissue DOD's is excellent.  They are more ""aluminum"" than ""steel"" in weight, but solid, and I like the oversized knobs.  If you see a good price on one, and think you have a need for a booster or classic overdrive sound, consider checking out the 250 reissue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM514WVQPKV03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTYDBVG#wasThisHelpful","RM514WVQPKV03","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to make clear that this review is of the Mackie Mix5, which is the smallest and most affordable of the Mix series (the review page is combined between the Mix5, Mix8, and Mix12FX, but the latter two have some additional bells and whistles that the Mix5 does not have).  So if you are like me and have a very elementary knowledge of mixers, hopefully this review of this excellent budget mixer will be of some help!I had two primary reasons for seeking out an affordable mixer.  First, I am a guitar player and effects pedal enthusiast, and there are a series of preamp pedals (Tech21 SansAmp/Tri-AC/Character; Joyo Sound series) that are designed to go directly to a mixer and played through studio monitors or a PA.  I have a single M-Audio BX5 studio monitor but had the realization: ""Wait, how would I even hook up a second one?""  Second, I have an assortment of iOS music apps, ranging from virtual synthesizers, to drum machines, to guitar modelers, and needed a better way to play those apps through the same studio monitor(s).  To a lesser degree, I also was interested in the XLR hookup to use with dynamic or condenser microphones (but with some limitations on the Mix5, which I will discuss).The Mix5 is solidly constructed.  It has a mostly metal casing, and is more compact than some of the similarly-priced alternatives from Harbinger and Behringer.  The Mix5 ships with an 18V power supply unit, though as many people have noted, there is no On/Off power switch. This is an annoyance, but the unit is so compact, that I suspect many people will only bring it out when they want to use it anyway.The dashboard is fairly straightforward and free from clutter.  They promote the mixer has having 5 channels, though 2/3 and 4/5 are stereo inputs, so it is arguably more like 3 channels.  Channel 1 accepts either an XLR mic input or an instrument cable (guitar, etc.).  There is also a bass/treble EQ control, which is nice for an entry-level mixer.  One thing I noticed about using the guitar through the mixer was that there was considerably more volume available as compared to running the preamp pedals directly into the speaker.  Of course, the mixer is also a necessity for adding a second speaker and then having a L/R channel setup.  The connections can be balanced or unbalanced - in my case, I believe I have a cable that goes from TS (instrument cable) to XLR (plugs into the monitor).  If you want a mixer with XLR outputs, consider the Yamaha MG06, which I nearly bought, but which costs over twice as much.  Guitar sounded great running through the Mix5, and you can of course throw reverb pedals and other effects in the signal chain before the mixer.  I was also pleasantly surprised how good the guitar sounded simply monitoring with headphones - this was something I could not do with that setup before I had a mixer.The RCA (red/white) in/out connection is quite useful for mixing in different types of audio sources.  3.5mm-to-RCA cables are very inexpensive, and allow you to hook up MP3 players and other audio sources like the aforementioned iPad instruments.  The overall sound levels are displayed colorfully by the green/yellow/red display and to help prevent ""clipping"" of the audio signal.The drawbacks of this device have been noted in other reviews, and they notable criticisms, but also part of the give-and-take of buying an entry-level device.  In addition to no main on/off switch, there is no on/off switch for phantom power.  Also, phantom power offered is around 15V, instead of the 48V needed to use many condenser microphones.  The Mix5 also does not have any on-board effects, such as offered by the Behringer and Yamaha models for a little more money.  Finally, please note that this is a mixer, NOT a recording ""interface"" with USB output to a computer.  If you are looking for a USB interface, I considered the Behringer Q502USB, but decided that I did not need an interface for my PC.The Mackie Mix5 is very basic, but seems to suit my limited needs perfectly.  It retails at $50, so I consider it a great ""first mixer"", and I would always have the option to upgrade to something with more features, if needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W60OZ0NTKAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND1K8T6#wasThisHelpful","R3W60OZ0NTKAD","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's really hard to go wrong with any of the Wampler overdrive/distortion pedals - I own a Pinnacle and Black '65, but there are literally a dozen in the Wampler catalog I'm sure I would enjoy.  But the Euphoria might end up being the one I use the most.  It's incredibly smooth, surprisingly versatile, works well stacked or by itself, and sounds great placed in front of a clean amp, or driving one that's already breaking up.Let's get a couple items related to the pedal's description out of the way.  The ""Euphoria"" is the new name for what was originally the Wampler ""Ecstacy"" (I believe there was a minor quarrel with Bogner over naming rights, since Bogner has a well-known amp called ""Ecstacy"").  But I believe the design and sound are virtually identical.  The Euphoria (in ""Smooth"" mode) is promoted as a ""D"" (Dumble)-style pedal.  Let's be real - I have never played a Dumble Overdrive Special, and neither have virtually anyone who will read this - they are custom-built amplifiers and are sold for absurd amounts of money.  But I had an ""idea in my head"" of what a Dumble tone and gain structure should sound like and, for what it's worth, the Euphoria met that expectation as soon as I tried it out.A ""Tubescreamer"" tone is a good reference point for starting to describe how the Euphoria sounds, though there is actually quite a bit of difference between the two.  Like the Tubescreamer, the Euphoria has a smooth, sustaining high end that operates in the low to moderate gain range.  Unlike the Tubescreamer, the Euphoria offers quite a bit of low end, which can be dialed in or out quite dramatically with a dedicated ""BASS"" knob.  The other reviewers were correct when they recommended to try the bass knob at around 9:00 to 12:00 first.  In front of a clean amp, the Euphoria can stay relatively clean while taking over the EQ structure of the amp to give it ""Dumble"" aesthetics, and still maintain or boost the volume quite a bit.  Turn up the gain in ""Smooth"" mode and you get a loose, tube-like response that can handle everything from rock power chords to bluesy solos.I bought the Euphoria primarily for the ""Smooth"" setting, but it's pretty impressive how varied the tone becomes simply by flicking the mod switch to one of the two other modes.  Wampler describes the ""Open"" (middle) position as the least overdriven and offering the most volume boost.  The bottom switch position (""Crunch"") is the most gainy, and sounds more like a traditional overdrive or distortion pedal.  The three modes are not footswitchable, and I prefer the ""Smooth"" setting as the Euphoria's signature sound, but it's pretty cool that you bring this one pedal to a performance and have three fairly distinct sounds in one box.One of the great ironies of Wampler pedals is that they are $200 boutique pedals made with the needs of professional musicians in mind, yet the powerful EQ controls and low-end response of their dirt pedals really pairs well with smaller, less expensive combo amplifiers.  Many overdrive pedals are great provided that you play them through a cabinet loaded with 12"" speakers and at a ""cranked"" volume level.  The Euphoria (and all Wamplers, really) seems to have been designed to perform at low and high volume levels, alike.  As for the ""D-Style"" tone, I tried a Mooer Rumble Drive and the Euphoria just blows it out of the water.  Even if you don't care about ""Dumble"" tone, the Euphoria is an excellent alternative to the sea of Tubescreamer clones, offering  something unique, powerful, and flexible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJSBFCWR67PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LTAO4#wasThisHelpful","R1VJSBFCWR67PJ","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually had a chance to try out an Earthquaker Monarch about a year ago, and came away very impressed.  So when I saw one on a closeout sale at a local guitar store, I thought it was too good to pass up.  The Monarch needs to be evaluated in light of its specific purpose, which was to mimic sounds of classic Orange amplifiers in an effects pedal.  While I don't have a deep knowledge of Orange amplifiers, I did come away quite impressed with the Monarch's ability to capture that style of tone, while offering a unique gain structure that sets it apart from many of the traditional overdrive and distortion pedals.This is my first Earthquaker pedal, but I have heard lots of good reports about their build quality.  This compact orange box seems to be very solidly constructed.  It has a bit of heft to it, and the switch, jacks, and knobs feel solid and built-to-last.  I also believe the pedal can be run at 9V or 18V for additional headroom.The first thing you will notice about the Monarch is that this pedal is LOUD.  Unity gain on the volume knob is around 9:00 with my setup.  Fortunately, this is they type of pedal that can be run at usable volume even with the Gain knob completely at zero.  I believe that the Bass and Treble controls are active, so they can operate as a boost/cut on those frequencies.  So there is a good amount of versatility in the tone.  At the same time, the pedal does maintain a thick, warm quality to it at all settings.  It could be described as a ""bassy"" pedal, except that the higher frequencies seem to shine through even with a fair amount of gain saturation.The Monarch does not sound like a Tubescreamer or traditional overdrive/distortion pedal.  Orange amplifiers can take on an almost ""fuzz-like"" character as the gain is turned up, and the same goes for the Monarch.  It's worth noting that while this is an amp-in-a-box pedal, the tone coming from the Monarch will never be completely clean.  I ran it through Fender-style amplifier with a completely clean bass tone, and the sound through the Monarch still had some ""chunk"" through it even with the Gain at 0.  But there are a lot of interesting blues and rock tones through the first half of the gain range.  The pedal gets more messy and ""fuzz-like"" as you continue to add gain, yet as loose as the gain becomes it still manages to shine through some of the higher frequencies.To summarize, the Monarch succeeds in fulfilling a somewhat niche goal of capturing the characteristics of a vintage Orange amplifier.  But even if that is not your goal, I think there's room to appreciate the Monarch as a unique tone-shaper that borders on ""fuzz pedal"".  This pedal has plenty of output, is unique from any other gain pedal I have played, and should be built to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHX6F3Y9PN4MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOA691W#wasThisHelpful","RHX6F3Y9PN4MD","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the DigiTech TRIO was unveiled at Winter NAMM 2015, I was about as skeptical as possible.  While the concept behind the pedal appealed to me, I just didn't believe there was any chance it would be any good).  It took months of researching the pedal and reading amateur reviews from other people online to recognize that the TRIO is actually an amazing product.  Yes, it is overly ambitious, and yes, it does have flaws.  But the takeaway from my early experience with the pedal is that DigiTech put an amazing amount of thought into how their customers would actually use the pedal, and the end result is a terrific practice aid for jamming at home and simply learning to play better guitar.The interesting thing about reviewing the TRIO is that there is a kernel of truth to many of the ""bad"" reviews you find on this site and others.  The basic function of the TRIO is to ""learn"" a bass line and drum beat simply by playing the simple chord progression of a song (or, more accurately, one part of a song).  The process isn't always perfect.  The TRIO will create a loop based on the progression you train it with, but the timing and some of the bass notes will invariably be off a bit.  I think some of the bad reviews really expected the TRIO to understand what you are trying to do and to nail the perfect accompaniment for your guitar part every time.  If that's your expectation for this device, then yes, you may be disappointed.But the reason the TRIO works for me is that DigiTech gives you a large amount of flexibility to tweak the band accompaniment parts AFTER you play your training phrase.  You can select from a number of musical genres (rock, alt rock, pop, country, etc.).  Each of those can be tweaked further using a style selector knob with about 12 different options. There is even an alternative time button to double or half the timing based on the same beats per minute.  It's very true that TRIO comes up with bass/drum parts that don't quite fit your idea.  It's also true that with all of these different style options, you're almost certain to find something very close to what you intended, or something that works anyway.The flexibility of this pedal extends to the output choices you have for playing the bass/drum backing track.  You can run a single instrument cable into a single guitar amp.  Or, you can run a TS (unbalanced) cable into a mixer or studio monitor so that you have a separate speaker playing the band part along with the guitar output going to your guitar amp.  Big credit to DigiTech for providing volume knobs for the bass and drum tracks separately.There is even a third option, which allows you to monitor using a headphone jack on top of the device, and hear the bass/drum track along with your guitar playing all through your headphones!  The Guitar FX button on the top left engages a preamp and cabinet simulation so that you get a genre-appropriate guitar tone without having an actual amp anywhere in the signal chain.  For example, ""Rock"" setting will give you a distorted tone through a large cabinet, while ""Country"" gives you a cleaner, jangly tone with some slapback echo.  The tones aren't elite quality, but it's addition nonetheless, which allows the TRIO to be an all-in-one practice tool.  (There is even a headphone volume knob, which can be used in conjunction with the Bass and Drums knobs to control the levels of all three instruments through headphones).Oh, and the implementation of the tempo knob is brilliant.  The ""1x"" tempo is based on how fast you play the learning phrase.  But if the resulting product is too fast or two slow, you can easily adjust with the Tempo knob, and tracks will loop at that new speed.I've read some people describe the TRIO as a ""glorified metronome"".  The truth is probably somewhere between that description and DigiTech's own claim of ""Band in a Box"".  The one feature missing that surprised me a bit was that the TRIO does not include a looper for your guitar parts.  In fact, it has no memory storage options beyond the three song parts that you program at that time.  But now that I have owned and played around with the TRIO a bit, there might have been the issue of just ""too much going on"" if they tried to jam a looper into this device, also.  It should be possible to run the guitar output into a separate looper pedal, and then you would have a rhythm guitar part to go with the bass and drums, but I have not tried this yet.All in all, this was an extremely ambitious project that DigiTech put a lot of love and detail into - for the most part, I think they got it right.  It will be interesting to see if they continue to improve on the pedal with firmware updates through the mini-USB port.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6ZY5YQ40Q14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXBPMYC#wasThisHelpful","R1J6ZY5YQ40Q14","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lots of reviews already for the Korg nanoKey2, so I will try to keep it short...  This is my second MIDI controller - my first is the excellent Akai MPK25 (version 1).  If you are primarily a keyboard player and are okay with the fact that the MPK25 is literally twice the size of the nanoKey2, then I think the Akai is a better option for a more traditional feeling keyboard and sample pad pairing.  (Note: it's also more expensive, retailing around $100, so perhaps not a fair comparison).But I like the nanoKey2 as the ultimate portable option for capturing ideas on-the-go on my iPhone and/or iPad.  Since it's smaller than a USB computer keyboard, you can slip it into a laptop case with the USB Camera Connection kit and the (included) USB cable, and you have everything you need.This does not have the traditional feel of a synthesizer keyboard.  The buttons are velocity-sensitive, but they do not have any real travel or ""spring"" to them.  They are more similar to a computer keyboard response.  The downside of this is that if you are a traditional piano player and accustomed to playing complicated passages knowing exactly where the keys should fall under your fingers, you may struggle to do that here.  But there are definite advantages to Korg's design choice as well.  First of which is that buttons can be pressed in rapid succession, unlike some piano keys.  So if you are planning to use this keyboard to tap out rhythms, it's capable of hitting 16th notes or triplets in quick succession, arguably better than a traditional keyboard.  Also, some reviewers remarked that they actually found it easier to play the black keys (sharps and flats on the upper row) with this type of slimline keyboard, versus a shrunken-down version of a traditional keyboard.  There may be some truth to that - it's nice that all of the keys are of uniform size and feel.At the end of the day, I think the nanoKey2 is well suited to do an adequate job across a variety of needs, ranging from simple monophonic passages, playing simple chords (and recording them as MIDI data), and tapping out beats.  It's not going to be the best tool at any of those things, but certainly an improvement on a small touchscreen device.  MIDI data editing and quantinization should also help to clean up some of the minor errors you commit using this type of input device.  And, best of all, it's extremely affordable and about as small and lightweight as you could expect.  The best controller you have is the one that you actually have with you when you need it, and Korg has made a device here that is actually practical enough to carry with you just about anywhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZZVI9ZPAD16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M8UZG0#wasThisHelpful","RBZZVI9ZPAD16","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll keep this short, since I'm a pedal fanatic but pretty new to loopers.  I reviewed some of the different options, and the three main competitors in this price range are probably the TC Electronics Ditto Looper, the DigiTech JamMan Express XT, and the Boss RC-1 (and they were released in that order).  The total loop time for those three is 5, 10, and 12 minutes, respectively.  But realistically, it'll be pretty rare that I bother to loop an entire song, so even enough time to cover a cord progression of a few bars is probably sufficient.The JamMan Express XT and the Boss RC-1 are functionally very similar, but I opted for the JamMan because I was able to find a used deal and save some money.  The RC-1 has a visual loop indicator that this one does not have, so it's probably the ""best"" of the bunch now.  But all of these function quite well, especially if you practice by yourself and just want a simple practicing aid.The DigiTech has button that looks like an MXR, but is actually a soft press (which is becoming more and more prevalent).  This is important to point out because one concern I initially had was that a click-press button would be too hard to activate repetitively on the fly.  But that's not the case!  The controls are quite simple - first press starts record, press again to end the loop.  The loop will continue playing in ""green"" Play mode.  You can play along with your guitar, or press the button again to engage ""yellow"" overdub mode.  Double press the button to stop playback.  Holding the button down for a few seconds in play mode removes the overdubs.  Holding it for a few seconds while playback is stopped clears the loop.  That's really about it.  There's more challenge in the timing (and learning to play accurately) that there is in that actual operation of the device, which is fairly simple.This is a basic-yet-simple looper that will suit the needs of most people that just want to experiment, practice, or do some songwriting & sketching.  Effects pedals are tons of fun, but this pedal actually has the potential to encourage me to work on both my technical and creative guitar ability, which is long overdue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMSPJ97I27WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQDITGO#wasThisHelpful","R3EMSPJ97I27WJ","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given that I listen to a fair amount of music and podcasts while working, exercising, or doing chores, I have a wide variety of (mostly) inexpensive earbuds that I stash throughout my house and at work.  Some of these are of the higher quality variety (like the Bose earbud set) that could almost compete with the sound quality of a pair of decent headphones, but most of them are budget options, like the kind that would ship with an iPhone or be sold at Target for $25 or less.  This Jadaol set was my first Bluetooth/wireless pair of any kind, and my hope was that sound quality would be somewhere between those extremes.At this price point, however, that was probably unrealistic.  Evaluating these against the other cheap earbuds I have at home (Apple, Sony, Phillips, etc.), these are actually towards the lower end of the spectrum.  The import packaging hilariously announces ""Overweigh Bass"" as a major selling point for the headset.  And there actually is a passable amount of low end for this style of lightweight, plastic earbuds.  But the overall balancing of the audio spectrum is a bit of a mess.  A bit muddled and lacking high end clarity, and just a pretty flat, uninteresting response in the lows and mids.  Listening to these versus a better quality set is kind of like hearing your favorite album on a car cassette player from the 1980's and then hearing it on a CD or high-resolution MP3 on a full stereo.So why not give it a lower review?  I felt it is still worthy stars because it gets most of its other marketing points right.  They ARE extremely lightweight.  In-ear comfort is very person-to-person, but the earbud an separate loop attachment (similar to the Bose) is a good, stable anchoring for the earbuds, and Jadaol includes a variety of different-sized replacements - no small feat for a $21 offering.  I actually felt that the Multi-Function button and +/- buttons on the right earpiece functioned well.  My iPhone 6 did automatically pair with the earbuds after I turned them back on a second time, though the 4-second hold time for the pairing button is a little annoying.Also, they do offer me a truly wireless connection for listening to content streamed from my phone, which I could see as useful for going on walks or working in the yard.  (There are times when you don't want a cord hanging in front of you, as it can get knocked off sweeping, picking things up, etc.).  This style of earplug does a decent job blocking out some surrounding noise, also (though they are not noise ""cancelling"" in any sense of the term).  I just think that due to the limited sound quality, it'd be better used for listening to spoken word/podcast content versus music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20U2VTGE2J5XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR8Y1EO#wasThisHelpful","R20U2VTGE2J5XC","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mini amps really aren't a ""new"" trend - there have been micro-sized amps from Pignose, Marshall, Fender, etc. on the market for several decades.  The part that is new is that some of these mini amps (yes, even the Fly 3 with its 3"" speaker) actually put out quality tone to the point where you would actually want to practice with them.  By contrast, the similarly priced Fender Mini-Twin has become an attractive desk ornament.  But the Fly3 is absolutely no toy...FEATURES - As mentioned above, you are getting 3 watts of solid state power through a single 3"" speaker.  The controls are very basic, but surprisingly versatile.  The clean channel will range from completely clean to slightly crunchy, and the OD channel morphs the tone into a much thicker, gainier overdrive.  Blackstar did not include a reverb because reverb circuitry is very power-hungry, but instead offer a simulated ""tape delay"" which can be adjusted for delay level and repeat time.  This is actually a terrific feature because the delay can be set to simulate almost a ""room-like"" ambient reverb effect.  Or, it could be used as a more traditional quarter or eighth note delay for soloing.  It doesn't have the features of a dedicated delay pedal, but as an add-on to a $60 amp, it's pretty outstanding.The Fly 3 also has a jack that doubles as a line out (with cabinet emulation!) and headphone output.  The Fly 3 really sounds excellent with headphones - plenty of fullness and power.  So, if the small speaker is a concern for you, keep in mind that the Fly 3 doubles as a pretty great little headphone amp.  There is also an MP3/Aux input for playing music with a 3.5mm cable, or jamming along with your favorite sounds.  (Note: the volume and other controls only affect the guitar input - MP3 volume controlled externally).The amp does not come with a power adapter, and it is 6.5V, so you can't use a standard ""Boss"" 9V power supply.  However, they sell an expansion kit for around $30, I believe, that has both the adapter and an add-on speaker cabinet to plug into the back, which doubles the output.  One advantage for the Fly3 over the ID:Core10 is that it is truly battery operated (6 ""AA"" batteries).  Blackstar claims that battery life can vary dramatically (4 to 40 hours!) based on volume of play.  But if it ends up being somewhere in the middle, I think that is acceptable.TONES - The ""ISF"" control is offered in place of a tone control, and I've actually been critical of it on other Blackstar amps.  I previously owned the ID:Core 10, which is basically this amp in 2x3"" configuration, and with some additional effects and amp models - but felt that the ISF on that amp was a weak link, and missed a traditional tone control.  Currently, I have a Blackstar HT-1MC (""Metal"") small tube amp, and the ISF control on there also leaves a bit to be desired.  But for whatever reason, I find the ISF to be much more effective on the Fly 3.  On the ""0"" side of things, it is supposedly doing an ""American"" sound, but to me it actually sounds brighter and more open.  The ""10"" side of the control they claim is ""British voiced"", though I swear it actually sounds more bass heavy and scooped.  I'm never quite clear on what the US/UK ""tones"" are supposed to be, anyway, but the good news is that ISF actually offers a good variety of tones here, especially noticeable through headphones.I'd be lying if I tried to convince you that a 3"" speaker in a plastic housing is going to have anywhere close to the fullness and complexity of full-sized guitar combo.  But at the talk-over volumes this amp is designed to operate with, it's perfectly satisfying.  And the overdriven tones coupled with an ambient delay that can be set to very subtle levels make this amp sound larger and better than it really has any right to.There are some great mini amps now available on the market, but I consider the Fly3 to be a class of its own, given the $60 price point, and EXTREME portability.  This is an amp that could literally go anywhere, and is good enough and versatile enough that you'll actually want to play it.  It's really worth a look from any level of guitar player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E97HIV36P4O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDJXGIG#wasThisHelpful","R3E97HIV36P4O6","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kept hearing people on various podcasts (with no relationship to one another) talking about how much they enjoyed this album, so I finally checked it out.  At first, I was skeptical, primarily because I loved ""Hot Fuss"" by The Killers, but thought that ""Sam's Town"" and most of everything after it was a colossal disappointment.  Also, I'm not usually a fan of the result when the frontman of a group I like splits off and does a solo project.  Finally, I was hearing that the music was heavily influenced by a lot of 80's sounds and musicians that were not real points of reference for me.But so much for all those ""rules"" - ""The Desired Effect"" is just a terrific album from front to back.  You can hear a lot of the same songwriting techniques and chord progressions that were so effective with The Killers, but Flowers actually seems more comfortable in this pop role than he did as a ""rock god"" frontman.

"I purchased the Jensen Jet Falcon 10"" (8 ohm) speaker to see if I could upgrade the sound of my Fender Super Champ X2, which is a $350 hybrid tube/modeling amp.  The stock speaker in that amp is a Fender Special Design 10"", and it is by no means ""bad"" at low volumes, but I had story after story about people replacing it and being happy with the change.  However, it seems like the popular replacement speaker for that amp (and many American-voiced 10"" combos) is the Eminence Ragin' Cajun, a super-efficient, LOUD, behemoth with a gigantic ceramic magnet.  What I was looking for was a more nuanced improvement to the stock speaker in the SCX2.  I did want or need the additional volume to play at home, but a slightly fuller tone, less harsh treble, and increased resistance to breakup/rattling were important to me.After months of research, enter the Jensen Jet Falcon 10"".  The Jet Series is Jensens effort to preserve elements of their classic vintage tones (Jensen speakers were typical of Fender amps in the 1960's), but providing a slightly modern twist with some additional low end response and warmer overall voicing.  This appeals to me also because I have a great love for guitar pedals, so my SCX2 may be asked to cop a Fender tone one day, and then belt out a gainy Marshall riff the next.THE GOOD: Overall, I have to say that this is an excellent speaker.  If you already liked the tone of your Fender-style amplifier, the Jet Falcon is a fairly ""safe"" upgrade in terms of cost and staying true to the original tone of the amp.  Immediately upon installing this speaker, I noticed a fuller low end - not necessarily in the sub-bass frequencies, but in the lower mids.  I think this is a good thing unless your goal is to try and turn your Fender into a Mesa Boogie with a speaker change, which probably will not be successful.  Jensen also promotes the speaker as having a slightly rounded off high end, and I really like that aspect of it as a Strat & Tele player.  To be clear, the sparkling Fender high end is still there, but the high end is slightly warmer and more musical than the stock speaker.  The Jet Falcon also responds very well to gain - it was loving my overdrive and distortion pedals, and this will probably only improve as the speaker breaks in further.  Installation was a breeze - 4 screws in the exact same placement as my stock speaker and replaced the +/- connections by hand without having to modify anything.  It probably took 20 minutes (or less) to make the switch, and I have very little knowledge of how amps work.THE BAD: As happy as I was with the tones I described above, one thing alarmed me a little bit and almost caused me to give the speaker a 4-star review...I believe it is quieter than the stock speaker.  Now, for me, this is arguably a positive thing.  Tube and hybrid amps have a better quality tone at moderate or high volumes than they due at insanely low settings.  But many who make the effort to replace the speaker in their amp are hoping for more power, which is why the Ragin' Cajun is so popular in this amp, and I could see them being disappointed with this speaker.  As it is with me, the SCX2 already had more volume than I reasonably could need, not to mention both a ""Line Out"" jack and an extension cabinet output jack, so the Jet Falcon remains plenty powerful for my needs.Oh, and yes, the Jet Falcon does feature a magical green cone.  Worth mentioning since something like 95% of the speaker cones out there are some version of black or gray.  I think the color is cool and I can't see it through the grill of my amp anyway.  But buyer beware if cone color is a ""dealbreaker"" for you...The Jensen Jet Falcon is reasonably priced and delivers on classic American-voiced tones, with perhaps just a bit warmth and low end response behind it.  Do not buy this speaker if you hate everything about your Fender or similar amplifier, or if your goal is to be as loud as possible.  Do consider this speaker if you are interested in an affordable quality replacement or upgrade for your 10"" combo or cabinet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV7R3QOO7NKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BDKDWQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KV7R3QOO7NKR","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is absolutely no shortage of ""Marshall in a Box"" pedals on the market nowadays.  Some of these are geared toward a vintage ""Plexi""/JMP/JTM Marshall tone (Wampler Plexi Drive; Ramble FX Marvel Drive; Carl Martin PlexiTone), while others do a more modern JCM/Hi-Gain Marshall tone (MI Audio Crunch Box; Suhr Riot).  The ZVEX Vexter Box of Rock has been around for some time now, but I believe it does an excellent job of the former type of vintage ""Marshall"" tone.Two key things to note about this pedal.  First, it is quite bassy.  Original Marshall amps were basically modified Fender Bassmans, and the Box of Rock does a great job of shaping your guitar's EQ to match that aesthetic.  Second, unlike many other Marshall in a Box pedals, the Box of Rock explores the cleaner side of that sound.  There is enough gain available to handle classic rock, and the pedal cleans up quite well with the volume knob, which is useful. But I enjoyed setting up the Gain at about 9:00 and just using the pedal to do a ""Hendrix"" sound.I think the Boost option on this pedal is what really puts it over the top.  It can be run even if the overdrive channel is not turned on, and it offers a great clean boost.  Since it comes AFTER the overdrive effect, when you run the boost and OD in tandem the boost will actually raise the volume of your playing, not just the gain.  This is an excellent pedal and even if you own other Marshall-style pedals, there may be room for this one in your arsenal if you are looking for clean to lower-gain vintage Marshall tones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2570GHVLYF393/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VASAJU#wasThisHelpful","R2570GHVLYF393","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a Tech 21 Trademark 30, and I feel that it is deserving of a 4-star review, though given some of the complexities involved in dialing in a particular sound, I will gladly revisit this review if my opinion improves over time.The TM30 is an entirely solid-state combo amplifier - no tubes involved.  However, it has a unique sound (which, at times, can sound ""tube-like"") due to the built-in SansAmp circuitry, which effectively serves as the preamp.  Tech21 debuted their original SansAmp pedal in the late 80's, and it is an extremely useful preamp-in-a-pedal for use with DI recording, mixers, and PA's.  However, they can also be run directly into the power amp/speaker section of a combo amp, and that is effectively what the TM30 does here.THE GOOD: One of the things that appealed to me about the TM30 was that it is extremely compact and lightweight (only 14 pounds!).  This is a huge plus for gigging musicians, obviously, but even home players and hobbyists like me appreciate having a more portable amplifier than can be tucked into a closet, and doesn't need to be permanently displayed like a concrete fixture in the home.  I believe the amps are American designed and manufactured, and the build quality - while a bit utilitarian - seems to be quite good.  There is a power unit affixed to the bottom inside of the cabinet (which is open back), so you have a perfectly square box to put away with the cord tucked inside.Even though this model is now at least 10 years old, it remains unique in the sheer number of options this amp offers for practicing, performing, and recording.  The TW30 has a proprietary 10"" speaker to play as a combo amp.  There is a headphone jack for silent practicing.  There is an extension cabinet jack to use the TW30 as a head for an external speaker.  There is an effects loop (rare for amps of this size and price), which allows you to plug directly into the power amp section with other pedals.  And there is an XLR out jack for direct recording or plugging into a PA system.  One of the more complete selections of features you could imagine in a 10"" combo amp.The tones offered by this amp are quiet varied, and generally quite good.  The preamp is basically the same as the SansAmp GT2 pedal, so you have TWEED, BRIT, and CALIF settings, which are basically Fender, Marshall, and Mesa/Boogie.  The Tweed setting is my favorite by far, offering full cleans to bluesy crunch to overdrive.  The British setting is alarming thing with knobs at noon, but can be tweaked with the recommended settings to sound convincingly Marshall.  The California setting offers even more gain and low end and can reach 80's and 90's metal tones.  So it's a good variety of sounds compared to more traditional solid state amps, which may have a fully clean channel with perhaps a single flavor of overdrive on a separate channel.The inclusion of an authentic Accutronics Spring Reverb was the amp's ""almost too good to be true"" feature for me.  Most small combos have gone digital, and while I have no problem with most digital reverbs, the spring reverb in this amp is terrific.THE BAD (or less good): Sometimes the amplifiers that promise everything deliver on almost nothing, and I do find the TM30 at times to be frustrating to dial in.  The tone controls are extremely powerful, almost to a fault.  Many amps - such as my Vox Pathfinder 15 - have a very specific idea of how they sound and how to dial them in.  This is not really a strong point of the TM30 - it's not an amp that lends well to setting everything at noon and making small tweaks so you can start playing.  You really need to take note of the Clean/Hi Gain/Hot toggle switch, as well as the cabinet selector (US/UK/Flat).  Tech21 provides a few suggested settings, and there are many found online.  The Mids control, in particular, can make a dramatic difference in the shape of the tone.I spend most of my time using the Clean Tweed settings, which are quite good.  But it's worth noting that the amp really does not offer meaningful clean tones on the British and California settings.  I don't feel like the speaker is a weak point of the amp, but it's also unrealistic to expect it to handle three entirely different amplifier sounds with equally good results.  It does seem capable of handling the low end of the higher gain settings without much speaker distortion or rattling.  But trying to find my own Marshall or MESA sounds by experimentation led to some muddiness.  Tone is subjective, but the best way I can describe my experience with the higher gain settings is that it captures aspects of that tone very well, but seems to ""just miss"" on other aspects.  In terms of volume output, the amp is sufficiently loud for me, but may lack clean headroom, and the volume varies based on settings, since the EQ is cut/boost.  (Note: The presence of the XLR out combats this in live settings, as you could run your 14-pound amp basically as a preamp for a PA system and have all the volume you need).The amp is also victim to a problem common with many analog and digital modelers, there is a fair amount of ""hiss"" or noise as you turn up the gain - mostly on the British and Calfornia settings.  Not particularly noticeable once you start playing, and perhaps not in a live setting with ambient noise, but it can be bit irritating in a quiet playing environment.  I'm fairly certain that the Tech21 preamp pedals have this issue on certain settings also.THE VERDICT: I purchased this amp primarily because I got a good deal on it and because I really missed having an amp with an effects loop.  I enjoy playing with the Tech21 Character/Joyo Sound pedals using only the speaker of the TM30, and the sounds I get with that setup are often better than using the dashboard of the combo itself.  In the early-to-mid 2000's, I think the flexibility of these different sounds was probably more unique than it is now.  Digital modeling amps like the Fender Mustang offer a much greater variety of sounds, and the tone quality has improved considerably since the time when the Trademark amps were a new product.That being said, it remains an incredibly versatile and compact product, and if you can find just one or two ""go-to"" settings that you like, you can generate a nice clean tone that works well with pedals.  The spring reverb is excellent.  I don't know that I would recommend this to many people as their ""only amp"" now in 2015 with the similarly-priced alternatives, but this is a quality product capable of a lot of good tones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZUZDXJGQ9354/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A2ZP5S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZUZDXJGQ9354","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Caline CP-14 ""English Man Distortion"" is a Chinese-made, extremely affordable overdrive/distortion box based on the tones of Marshall ""Plexi"" (or JTM/JMP-style) amplifiers of the late 1960's.  However, this description becomes less useful given that the English Man is an apparently clone of the original Carl Martin PlexiTone pedal, and more specifically, the high gain channel of that pedal.  For that reason, the English Man is focused much more on a ""hot rodded"", higher gain version of the Plexi.  This is so much the case that fans of cleaner, bluesier Plexi tones may feel misled or disappointed by the English Man.  Nevertheless, with a price point at around 30 dollars (including shipping), the English Man is a reasonably well-made clone that excels at it's specific tone of aggressive vintage Marshall tones for heavy rock.OUTPUT - I briefly owned a Joyo Hot Plexi, which may have been based on a similar or identical circuit, but I feel that the English Man is notably superior to that pedal.  The English Man has TONS of output - I found unity gain to be around 9:00 or 9:30 on the volume knob, so it offers plenty of headroom.  The original Carl Martin PlexiTone was popular, but it was a large pedal with a set-in power cord, which is almost unheard of for compact pedals.  Carl Martin has since designed a compact (gold-colored) PlexiTone that features more mids and brings the form factor more in line with other effects pedals.  I have not played the original (black box) PlexiTone, but I can confirm that the English Man has an extremely powerful sound, and sounds convincingly ""big"" with the slightly scooped mids.  It sounded great with several of my guitars, but even my Strat middle pickup produced a convincing low-end response with it, which is not always the case with OD/Distortion pedals.GAIN BEHAVIOR - It's probably unfair to criticize the English Man for how quickly it becomes ""dirty"", once you understand that it is cloned off of a specific high gain channel of another pedal.  This is meant to be a distortion pedal, not an ""amp-in-a-box"" covering the whole clean-to-dirty spectrum.  With the gain at ""0"" you do get output, but it's not a pure clean tone, and not particularly useable.  I also did not find that it cleaned up particularly well with the guitar volume knob, though I find that only a select few dirtboxes really do that ""well"".  But with the gain knob at 8:00 to 9:00, there were some very good, almost ""Hendrix-y"" light gain tones in there.  The pedal retains its signature fullness at all settings, which is nice.  Actually, if you are familiar with the Joyo Ultimate Drive, this pedal reminded me a bit of that one, at least in terms of output and the powerful low frequencies.I do wish that the pedal stayed cleaner a bit longer, but again, this is a clone of a particular channel, and presumably, there were lower gain channels and settings available separately on the original that would cover that.  I considered a 4-star rating, but it does the Marshall rock tones so well (and so affordably), it's better to appreciate it for what it does.  Although the pedal is a tad on the noisy side, I think it's particularly intriguing for people that use lower output pickups or single coils - it always seems to succeed in making your tone ""bigger"".  The tone control is also quite useful, working more like a high-end roll-off, as opposed to the horrible Boss DS-1 style of tone control that can only seem to introduce treble by subtracting bass.I've purchased three of the Caline pedals (Orange Burst and Pure Sky OD's, also), and none of them has disappointed.  The English Man isn't the most versatile distortion pedal ever made, but it does its job well and introduces vintage Marshall flavor with a more modern amount of available gain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO69WQHHP3I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWTB2P4#wasThisHelpful","R2XO69WQHHP3I8","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I HATE being out of tune.  I also tend to get a little heavy-handed with my playing style, and do a lot of string bending, so it's not uncommon for me to have to tweak a ""G"" or ""B"" string after a few minutes of aggressive playing.  So I have no idea why I didn't put much thought into finding a convenient, efficient, and affordable tuning option for my guitars.  Seriously, I own dozens of effects pedals (including two pedal tuners), but what about all of those other times when I'm not using a full pedalboard?Problem solved for less than $10: Enter the Snark SN-5.  This thing is crazy fast and accurate.  I guess I did not fully realize (or appreciate) that clip on tuners work by contact vibration, not ambient sound (like the way the free tuner on you iPhone might).  So you can tune an unplugged electric guitar before you even turn on your amp and hear those awful resonating detuned chords!I think my favorite aspect of this tuner, however, is the speed and stability of the reading.  That's a major problem with most audio-based tuners, as they tend to flutter all over the place.  The SN-5 identifies and holds a reading for the note you are playing, and responds smoothly as you tighten or loosen the string.  It's quicker, more effective, and more affordable than most of the alternatives.  When I ordered mine, I wondered why I didn't already have one.  Now, I'm wondering why I don't have one for every room I play guitar in!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ZANEHG84U78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XNK7AI#wasThisHelpful","R9ZANEHG84U78","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After DOD pedals were absorbed into the DigiTech brand name, I always felt like the HardWire pedal series was a direct response to the reputation of DOD pedals as cheap, unreliable effects for bedroom players.  The HardWire pedals came with a very sturdy ""BOSS-style"" soft switch, and solid metal enclosure with a wide, low, and stable profile, and bells and whistles like Mod switches and metal knobs.  In short, pedals like the Valve Distortion and Tube Overdrive were boutique-caliber pedals at BOSS prices, and you could argue that the RV-7 Stereo Reverb was one of the better pedals they ever made.  As of early 2015, it still seems unclear if DigiTech has formally abandoned the HardWire line in favor of new products, but the RV-7 is a pedal that should stand the test of time.There are a lot of quality reverb pedals nowadays that can cover a variety of reverb styles - including the Boss RV-5 and the TC Electronics Hall of Fame.  Those are excellent pedals, too, but the RV-7 really does a nice job covering everything from vintage spring reverbs, to the subtlety of a room effect reverb, to the lush, deep effects of a hall reverb.  And each of these settings actually seems to range from the very subtle to the over-the-top, which is where many reverb pedals fall short.But what really sets the RV-7 apart in this price range is that the 7 reverb modes are supported by Lexicon algorithms.  Lexicon may be unknown to many casual guitarists, but they are a legendary name in the development of digital reverb and effects.  The rack-mounted equivalents of these effects cost thousands of dollars in the 80's, and even now are usually in a much larger form factor costing hundreds of dollars.  This is true-to-life ambient sound effects in the size of a stompbox, and sold for $150 or less.  Amazing.  I don't know that this is the ""best"" spring reverb I've heard in a pedal (the Catalinbread Topanga deserves some mention), but it's a very good one in a pedal that does 6 other things.  The Lexicon-supported Room and Hall settings are terrific, as is the Plate setting for a bright, 70's-like finish to your muted riffs.  The Reverse, Gated, and Modulated settings along the top are a bit more niche, but all done extremely well.  I truly believe this is the last Reverb pedal I will ever need, and that's not something a pedal addict can usually say with much confidence!A few caveats to point out - the pedal has a hookup for a 9V battery, but it's basically decorative in a high-powered digital reverb pedal like this one.  (By the way, if you were ever stumped how to access the battery compartment on a DigiTech pedal, as I stupidly was for awhile, the hinges on the footstomp portion double as release pins to kick off the cover - press inward with guitar plugs on both sides!)  You will get zero battery life with the amount of power this demands, so you will want a good power adapter.  The One Spot adapter puts out 1700mA, which is plenty of power, but some digital pedals run in parallel have issues with digital pedals.  If this is an ongoing issue, an isolated power source like the one from Voodoo Labs should do the trick.Whether or not these pedals are discontinued, they are still being stocked online and in many stores.  I think it's an excellent pedal with hundreds of dollars of value compressed into a compact pedal, and at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSA0UTM1KRAS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CIZA8G#wasThisHelpful","RSA0UTM1KRAS5","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't add too much given the volume of excellent reviews already available, but this is a very good, affordable burr grinder for coffee that I would rate 4-stars if not for the fact that the design problem with the top screw does seem to be easily addressed with a split-lock or rubber washer (as discussed/proposed in the review by ""Bob M."").  Without that, the handle and top screw will back itself off very quickly, and I could see that causing it to fail with some use.  And I do notice some grind inconsistency as you get into larger grinds, but not so much at a setting appropriate for normal drip/pour-over grinds.If you are new to these manual grinders, as I was, people are not exaggerating when they talk about needing a few minutes to complete the grinding.  I tend to get distracted by things so I am not consistently grinding full speed, but I usually prepare around 4-6 tablespoons of grinds, and the average time to do that for me is probably 3-5 minutes.  Then again, this is not a grinder I use on a daily basis - there are times I want a quick cup of coffee (pour over, Mr. Coffee, or even Keurig), and there are times I want a ""better cup"" of coffee and will spend a few minutes on it (fresh burr grind into the Chemex).

"The Wampler Pinnacle is moderate-to-high gain distortion pedal that I lusted after for a long period of time, and despite the relatively prohibitive price tag (at least for a non-professional musician), owning one makes me wonder why I didn't just buy it sooner.  Unlike some of the other reviewers (and probably the strong majority of Wampler users), I did not immediately fall in love with Wampler pedals.  I tried a Wampler Sovereign, and it was certainly a good distortion pedal, but not necessarily ""$100 better"" than anything else I owned (returned) it.  But after buying a Black '65 (love it) and getting a chance to try out the Euphoria (likely my next Wampler), I gained a new-found appreciation for Wampler as a company, and gave the Pinnacle a second look.  Wampler comes out pretty hard selling the Pinnacle as a ""Brown Sound"" in a box pedal (even including a testimonial from the guy who worked on Van Halen's gear in the manual!), but if the idea of making your setup sound like that tone appeals to you, this is really about as close as you get just by adding a pedal.The standard version of the Pinnacle has about the same footprint as an MXR pedal, and is surprisingly easy to dial in.  Wampler is known for providing a lot of bells and whistles in the form of complex EQ sections and mod switches.  On the one hand, this offers a ton of value in a boutique pedal, which is appreciated.  But in the case of the Sovereign Distortion, I found the EQ options to be a bit paralyzing - there was so much interplay in the switches and adjustments to the mids that I didn't know where to start, or even how to recreate good sounds I stumbled upon.  Not so with the Pinnacle.  Basically, there is a single tone knob that operates as you'd expect, and the Contour knob goes from less to more ""scooped"" as you rotate clockwise.  The Vintage/Modern switch also does this to an extent - the Vintage setting has scooped mids and a darker sound, whereas the Modern sound has more mids presence and perceived output.  I agree with some of the posters that the Boost switch is a little unnecessary on some Wampler pedals, but I do like it here on the Pinnacle.  Brian Wampler indicates that it gives a bit more gain as well as some attack, and he demonstrated the difference with some palm muted chords.  I really did not have a need for the Deluxe version of this pedal, and actually preferred the smaller footprint over having a standalone boost switch.  (I think the double switch is more useful in the new Plexi Drive Deluxe, where the ""Boost"" switch is actually a standalone tubescreamer that can be engaged even with the rest of the pedal in bypass).I won't spend too much time trying to describe the sound of the Pinnacle - if you're familiar with Van Halen's tone from different eras, there's a good chance you find that somewhere in the Pinnacle.  There's a ""sag"" in the low end that really creates saturation in notes and chords, and yet the pedal refuses to be muddy or non-articulate.  Plenty of gain on tap, of course, but while I would not use this pedal to do bluesy vintage Marshall JTM/Plexi tones, the lower gain settings do get closer to that range than I would have expected.  Many Marshall-in-a-box pedals are ""one-trick ponies"" with a specific tone in mind, but the Pinnacle is not that.  It actually has a good degree of range of lower gain and crunchy, to scooped and completely saturated.Finally, for home players and users of smaller amps (which I feel is often an ""underrepresented majority"" in many pedal discussions), I'm happy to report that the Pinnacle does not require a massive tube-driven stack with cabinets to sound ""authentic"".  Obviously, amp voicing and speaker size will have a large impact on the final result, but my first demo of the Pinnacle was on a solid state Vox Pathfinder 10, and even at bedroom volumes with that less-than-ideal setup, the tone I had imagined was there.  The Euphoria, Plexi-Drive, and other Wamplers go a step further with an independent bass control (or bass boost switch), but the Pinnacle has more-than-adequate low end on smaller amps.  It's an excellent distortion pedal on smaller or larger rigs alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYL1LPSN784R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V0LGAO#wasThisHelpful","R3MYL1LPSN784R","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Yellow Fall is my first Donner pedal, but I'm impressed enough with its value to consider buying others.  First, some background - Donner (along with ENO and a few other brands) are basically an effort to burn through inventory used for the excellent Chinese-made Mooer pedal line, and rebranding them as a cheaper alternative.  The pedal casing and chipset, from what I hear, are basically identical to the corresponding Mooer equivalent, though the primary knob has been switched and it would not surprise me to learn that a few other (cheaper) components have been substituted.Still at around 30 bucks, the Donner pedals offer incredible value for the price.  The Yellow Fall ""analog delay"" has a pretty good range of delay (I believe it goes up to 600 miliseconds - many cheap delays only get to 300ms).  The two micro knobs control echo and feedback.  Feedback is very clearly the number and duration of repeats.  ""Echo"" is described in the manual as affecting the tone of the delay.  I'm not sure if this is what it is actually doing or if it is acting more like a ""level"" on most delay pedals, which makes the overall effect more prominent.  However, it did seem to make the echos trailing off seem brighter.Yes, the pedal is digital, but ""analog"" is describing the character of the delay.  There are many modern delay pedals that use digital chipsets to simulate the analog or tape delays of the 60's and 70's.  I think the Yellow Fall does this quite well.  Some people have complained that the repeats sound ""modulated"", but that's sort of the point.  This isn't for a clean, exact digital replication of notes (similar to a slapback delay or U2-style dotted eighth delay) - it has a more warm, haunting character, and sounds great for ambient soloing and chords alike.Also, as has been pointed out, there is an error/mistaken reference in the Donner literature about the 9V jack.  It claims it is ""positive tip"", but what they actually mean is ""negative center"", which is the same as Boss, MXR, etc. and the vast majority of power supplys out there like OneSpot.  There is no ""tip"" on a BOSS-style adapter, either, but that's more an issue of semantics.  Rest assured, it will work fine with the BOSS-style adapters you may already have.  But you will need one, since this pedal is so compact, there wouldn't even been room or a 9V battery to fit in there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ33N9LVGGR9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRRN2RI#wasThisHelpful","RZ33N9LVGGR9E","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first JHS pedal and I am impressed by the care and thought that went into the Twin Twelve are absolutely top notch.  I will definitely consider buying other JHS pedals in the future.  There are just few shortcomings (or design choices) of the Twin Twelve that prospective buyers need to understand before buying.  However, please note that the bulk of this review was written to reflect a 4* rating, but later increased to 5* after I had more time with the pedal.BUILD QUALITY - Like I said, the quality of the JHS stuff is about as good as it gets.  No expense spared on any of the components, and everything feels solid and built to last.  If you appreciate the quality of a Wampler pedal, for example, the JHS is on a similar level, from the sturdy switch, to the firmness of the knobs, and the built-out 9V jack on the top, which I prefer as it avoids getting in the way of the I/O jacks.  This thing has roughly the same profile of an MXR pedal, but is higher and heavier.  I think heavy is a good thing with pedals, as the thicker case means better durability, and they are less apt to get kicked around when you are trying to step on them.  The unboxing experience (if that's your thing) with JHS is very satisfying, complete with red paper ""confetti"", documentation, a JHS catalog, and a bag with rubber stick-on footies and a JHS guitar pick.PEDAL CONCEPT - The Twin Twelve Overdrive is very directly marketed as a Silvertone ""amp-in-a-box"". More specifically, it is the Silvertone 1484, a 2x12"", 60-watt, tube behemoth, which I have never played, but I understand needed to be played extremely loud to get it's signature overdrive sound.  Not even 15 years ago, the idea of a Silvertone-in-a-box would have been pretty laughable, but these very affordable (at the time) amplifiers from the 60's have had a resurgence with the indie rock genre, and specific artists like Beck, Jack White, and Vampire Weekend.The primary selling point of the Twin Twelve is two-fold.  First, owning the actual amp is unrealistic for most, since they are about a half-century old, large, and very loud.  So if the Silvertone sound is something you desire, a $200 amp-in-a-box pedal could be viewed as a relative bargain.  Second, the original 1484 lacked a master volume, so the signature ""cranked"" overdrive tones could only be achieved at insane volumes.  The Twin Twelve pedal adds a master volume to the gain knob, and includes baxandall tone controls that cut or boost bass/treble considerably.SOUND QUALITY & REALIZATION OF CONCEPT - There are definite positives to the direction JHS has gone with the Twin Twelve.  Viewed as a overdrive pedal, the Twin Twelve offers a unique crunch sound up to 11:00 on the gain knob, and becomes almost like a warm fuzz pedal beyond 11:00.  If you're unfamiliar with the Silvertone sound, it has an almost ""lo-fi"" quality to it.  The sound can be quite divisive with guitar players - these really were not considered high quality amps compared to the Fender, Marshall, and Vox amps of that area - they were sold at Sears.  The best description I can give is that the overdriven sound is almost like a Fender with a blown/damaged speaker with maybe a hint of a jet engine in there.  In other words, it's a loose, messy overdrive, yet somehow lends itself to chords and signing mid-rangey notes - just not in the way that more celebrate amps would do it.The primary issue I have with the JHS Twin Twelve is that it's a ""cranked overdrive pedal"", not an ""amp-in-the-box"" pedal - even though they so badly want it to be the latter.  Directly from the JHS website, they promote the following: ""The Drive knob of the pedal is essentially the Volume control of the amplifier.  As you turn up the Drive knob of the pedal you get more overdrive and tube-like saturation just like you would by cranking up the Volume knob on the amplifier.""  In my opinion, that's simply not true.  The entire pedal is skewed towards more gain and more saturation.  With the gain knob at ""0"" there is no output.  The only ""clean"" tones are probably from about 8:30 to 10:00 on the gain knob, even with single coils, and even there you'll find a bit of grit.  To be fair, the tone does clean up exceptionally well with your guitar's volume knob, but doing this also mutes much of the high end chime I suspect the original tube amp would have had.  Again, I have not played a 1484, but JHS's own claim that you had to turn them all the way up to get overdriven tones contradicts the fact that the gain knob on their pedal dirties up in a real hurry.If you can let go of the fact that this is marketed as a pedal that turns your clean tone into a Silvertone 1484, I think there's a lot to like here.  The tone controls are powerful and you can dial a thick, warm tone on small and large amps alike.  And it definitely does not sound like a Tubescreamer, OCD, or any of the traditional tones you'd imagine from a cranked Fender or Vox.  JHS have a unique concept here, and have executed parts of it extremely well.  This may be a bit of a niche product, but for fans of Silvertone amps and some of the artists that used them, the Twin Twelve is a noteworthy addition to the crowded boutique pedal market.UPDATE (04/20/15) - I am updating my review because I tried the Twin Twelve with a broader array of guitars and amps, and I feel that is worthy of a 5-star rating.  That is not to say that ""retract"" any of my earlier comments - I do wish that the pedal offered a wider range of clean Silvertone sounds, but using more vintage-voiced pickups and setting the gain around 9:00 with the volume up higher, you can get some pretty distinctive clean tones out of this pedal.  And, as I said before, it cleans up remarkably well with the guitar volume knob.  Most important of all in my decision to improve the rating - the pedal is very well made, and if you wanted this type of sound, I don't know where else you get it from.  It's a bit of a niche product, but increasingly, I feel it excels at what JHS were trying to do with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M9LZE4RTB99N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PA0M7Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2M9LZE4RTB99N","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The influx of extremely low-priced Chinese clones of popular Western boutique effects pedals is really a somewhat recent trend.  Brands like Mooer and Joyo offer a wide array of effects pedals (essentially based off of ""cloned"" circuits) at price points as low as $30.  And while some of these ""clones"" are duds, some of them at least appear to be made well enough to last for some time.  I've now purchased two pedals under the Caline brand (Orange Burst and Pure Sky), and am somewhat optimistic that these pedals fit into the latter camp.DESCRIPTION - The ""Pure Sky Overdrive"" is apparently a clone of a early version of the Paul Cochrane ""Timmy"", which is a highly-regarded ""transparent overdrive"" that I have not played.  However, I have played and owned some other similar pedals such as the Klon-based EHX Soul Food, and the Joyo Sweet Baby.  ""Transparent overdrive"" is one of those musical ""terms of art"", but it basically means that the pedal is some combination of volume, gain, and dynamic expression while also retaining the essential elements of your clean tone.  By contrast, something like a Tubescreamer would also be a low-to-moderate gain overdrive, but would NOT be considered transparent, since it purposefully cuts out some bass, provides a mid-range boost, and tends to a have a rounding, compressed effect on the high end.  So, while you are unlikely to step on a Pure Sky Overdrive to go from clean tone to full-out rock overdrive, there are many other things a good transparent can do for you - an ""always on"" clean boost, adding just a bit of grit to your tone, or stacking with another overdrive to boost or emphasize parts of its tone.BUILD QUALITY - Reports of failing pedals are EXTREMELY anecdotal, so I tend to evaluate my reviews based on what I can see and feel during the expected use of the pedal.  Judged on this basis, I find the Caline pedals to be outstanding.  In fact, the jacks, knobs, and switch are superior even to the early Joyo pedals, and at least on par with the Mooer micro pedals (though a completely different form factor).  The metal casing is very thick and sturdy.  It's fastened by 4 screws that would need to be removed for 9V battery access, but this is becoming increasingly common (as battery compartment doors eventually break or become lost).  It sounds almost laughable to say, but the knobs on this thing feel similar to my Wampler in terms of resistance and stability.  I'm not under any delusion that the manufacturer hasn't cut costs wherever they could here, but at least from the exterior, you won't notice it.  See the excellent review from @rob for more discussion of the circuitry and other durability pluses and minuses.TONE & CONTROLS - While I need to try it out with a wider variety of amps and guitars, I've been generally pleased with the sound of the Pure Sky.  Again, this style of overdrive is meant to give your tone ""just a little more"".  It will not take your tone to entirely new sonic areas all by itself.  For this reason, I actually feel like the gain settings worked best from 0 to 50%.  Higher gain settings sound little fizzy and less appealing.  But my favorite feature of both the Pure Sky and the Orange Burst are the tone controls.  At the 12:00 position, they are neutral.  But you can then cut or boost Bass and Treble a fair amount.  And since this is a tonally ""transparent"" pedal, you can actually use the Pure Sky to ""correct"" an amp that is a bit too bright, or perhaps needs a little kick in the low end.  I've heard people say that it is effective as a stacking pedal for the same reasons.I will revisit this review later if I find problems or have additional thoughts on how it sounds.  But at $30, this Caline Pure Sky is well-constructed and quite useful for a number of different applications.  I will also note that most of the pictures do not do the aesthetics of the pedal justice - it has an attractive glossy finish is sky blue paint, and the blue LED finishes it off nicely.  Great value for tone experimenters and hobbyists looking for a good transparent overdrive, but want some money left over to own other pedals!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLISX0NCZC3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPLYAGI#wasThisHelpful","R2WLISX0NCZC3W","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: I was careful to be clear which of the 40+ Mooer pedals I was reviewing in the title, since Amazon reviews for ALL of their pedals get lumped together on a single page!)I recently purchased the Mooer Rumble Drive because I was while I have far too many overdrive pedals (it's addicting), I realized that one of those elusive tones I did not have represented anywhere was the Dumble Overdrive Special.  You would be forgiven as a newer guitarist if you had no idea what a ""Dumble"" even is...they were boutique amplifiers made in limited numbers, and original Dumbles now sell for $25,000 to $50,000.  Since that is obviously out of my budget, the idea of a micro pedal that could approximate those tones for less than $100 is fairly appealing.  You've likely heard Dumble tones from guitarists like Carlos Santana, Robben Ford, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and (now) Joe Bonamassa.  But until more recently, there were not a lot of ""D-style"" pedals on the market, and certainly not affordable ones.Enter the Mooer Rumble Drive, a Chinese-made overdrive pedal that was rumored to be a clone of the famed Zendrive, though actual Zendrive users seem to debate whether they sound alike.  This matters less to me, because I am actually quite happy with the Rumble Drive as it approximates what I THINK a Dumble would sound like.  Of course, since nearly 0% of guitar players will ever really play one, who knows, right?Original Dumbles were basically modified Fender ""tweed"" and ""blackface"" amplifiers, and you can hear elements of that American roundness and high end sparkle.  What I feel that the Rumble Drive captures well about the idea of a ""Dumble tone"" is the smooth, singing compression of the upper mids, combined with a low end that is bassy, but also very loose and saggy in terms of its gain structure.  I've seen some people criticize the pedal as sounding either ""lo-fi"" or ""like a modified Tubescreamer"".  This pedal has some similarities with a tubescreamer (and is green, which probably strengthens those impressions), but only really in the way it smooths and compresses the high end.  The low end presence is much more prominent than a Tubescreamer, and it's more reminiscent of an evolved (or devolved) Fender amp being pushed to the limit.  It's a great tone for bluesy rhythms and singing leads.  It's less of an ideal tone if you want tight, syncopated distortion.Finally, I want to add that this is the first Mooer pedal I have purchased, but it will not be the least.  These micro pedals are very sturdily constructed, and while they require an adapter (9V, center negative polarity; like Boss/OneSpot standard), I find them very well constructed and easy to store and use.  I stayed away from the Mooer line for awhile because they were a little more expensive than other Chinese imports and I wasn't sure about the micro knobs.  But everything feels sturdy and built to last, and the Mooers are considered in top tier of craftsmanship as Chinese clones go.  If you enjoy bluesy/crunchy distortion but want something different than ""just another Tubescreamer variant"", check out the Mooer Rumble Drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5JII8TN5SCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3PB136#wasThisHelpful","R2V5JII8TN5SCU","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a pretty lengthy search for a small, low-wattage tube amp for bedroom-level volumes, I had all but given up.  Then I came across a significant markdown for the Blackstar HT1MC, which is the ""Metal"" version of the HT-1 and HT-1R.  While many people are familiar with the HT-1 (and particularly the stripped down HT-1 ""Special Edition"" that is displayed at Guitar Center and often sells for less than $200), there was very sparse information in terms of reviews or video demos of the HT-1 Metal.So, I was taking a bit of a chance, even with the sale price.  But the HT-1 Metal did not disappoint.  Let's get the basics out of the way first - this is a genuine ""tube"" or ""valve"" combo amp (ECC82/ECC83).  With only one watt of power, it fits into a recent trend of amateur and professional guitarists alike searching for low volume amplifier that can capture the rich saturation and overdriven tones of cranked tube amp, but at volumes you could actually practice with or play in a house or apartment.  In my experience, a lot of mini amps attempt this, but few get it quite right.  Often, the low-wattage amps become one-note, offering an overdriven sound but leaving little clean headroom (this was my experience with some of the smaller Vox tube amps).  In many cases, the sound simply doesn't translate well using a speaker of 8"" or even less.  And even if the tone is passable, many of these amps lack basic features like reverb, master volume/gain controls, headphone jacks, and cabinet out jacks.  The Blackstar HT-1 Metal has ALL of the features, but how does it stack up otherwise?SOUND QUALITY - Being exclusively a home player/hobbyist, I've played and owned a number of combo amps with 8"" speakers.  No matter how good the speaker, there is an unavoidable compromise of the lower end bass frequencies with a speaker of that size.  That being said, the HT-1 Metal handles lower frequencies quite well, and considering that this is an amp made to play at or near its maximum volume, there was hardly any rattling or sign that the speaker was overwhelmed.  The clean tones on this amp are outstanding.  Blackstar claims there is a metal ""voicing"" to this model, but with a Strat (or even a hot set of humbuckers) and the right settings, you can get the high end to sparkle.The ""Clean"" channel ranges from completely clean to fairly thick crunch, and it excels for rock and blues.  The ""overdrive"" channel has a nice, thick tone, but does not get so muddy that it loses its harmonic qualities.  I should point out at this point that I am NOT a metal player, and did not purchase this amp because I wanted a ""metal"" tone.  While this amp is certainly intended for low-volume metal, it offers far more than that.  Actually, the overdriven tones on this amp remind me as much of a cranked JCM800, as opposed to a Mesa, Soldano, or other more ""modern"" sound, and for me this is a good thing.This is not an amp for gigging.  While the one amp of power will stay clean enough at decent volume, the most volume you will get from this amp is what I would describe as ""one level above talk-over volumes"", and that is by design.  I have not heard another low-wattage tube amp that does as good of a job as this one at conveying that ""saturated tube"" sound at low volumes, while offering that with both cleaner and overdriven sounds.BUILD QUALITY - I am a big fan of the aesthetics and general quality of the HT-1 Metal.  By comparison, the HT-1 Special Edition feels a bit cheaper with compromises in the tolex, grill, and piping.  The most noticeable feature of the HT-1 Metal is the matte finish black metal grille on the front.  Everything seems to be fastened securely and nothing rattled when I started to push the amp.  The knobs are high quality and the three jacks are metal, not plastic.  Given that the whole point of this thing is to be able to tuck it away in a closet or storage bin, it feels to durable enough to handle that treatment.The amp actually does weigh around 15 pounds, but I set it up next to my Vox Pathfinder 15 (an excellent solid state amp also with an 8"" speaker), and the HT-1 Metal looks literally half of the size of the Pathfinder.  It almost defies logic how they fit the speaker, two tubes, and circuitry for the control panel into this small package, but it makes for a very compact, sturdy little beast.FEATURES - In lieu of an EQ control, many Blackstar amps have a single knob called ""ISF"" (Infinite Shape Feature).  This is supposed to morph the equalization/voicing of the amp from a US to a UK style amplifier.  It isn't without its problems (discussed below), but I will say that amp offered usable tones while avoiding excessive darkness or brightness on most settings.  On-board Reverb was a critical feature in earning my interest in this amp, and it covers a good range from very subtle to ""ambient"".The headphone jack doubles as a line out jack, and it includes a speaker emulation to make the resulting signal sound like you are hearing it through a large cabinet.  I own several modeling amps, and I actually think the HT-1 Metal is the best of the bunch using headphones.  Note that it uses a 1/4"" jack, so you may need an adapter for some headphones, but those are cheap and readily available.  The sound quality was outstanding into my Sony MDR-7506 headphones.Finally, players wishing to use this combo amp as a ""head"" into a larger cabinet will be pleased to hear that not only is there a jack to run the signal out to a speaker cabinet, but it also works with 4, 8, 16-ohm cabinets.DRAWBACKS - I do not have many things to complain about with this amp, but the few complaints I do have relate to ISF.  While a three-band EQ may have been too much to expect for an amp of this size, even a single tone knob would have been preferable, in my opinion.  ISF claims to go from ""US"" to ""UK"", but especially in the clean tones, I do not hear it.  Instead, the ""US"" setting is just thinner and brighter, while going full ""UK"" can get a bit dark and murky.  My favorite settings are probably somewhere in the middle, and the amp does take pedals well, so you can experiment based off a (mostly) clean tone in that way.  I have not tried using an EQ pedal in front of the amp, yet, but suspect that may be of some help.It's also important to be clear that this is not a particularly loud amplifier.  Raw volume is certainly not the goal of the HT-1 Metal, but some users might expect just a bit more volume compared to other tube amps with an 8"" speaker.ALTERNATIVES? - If you like the idea of an affordable, real ""tube"" amplifier, but need a bit more volume and depth, consider the excellent VHT Special 6.  Chinese-made and hand wired, it's a great amp for modding, and I seriously considered one, except that I thought it just got a bit too loud to reach that ""cranked"" sound I was looking for.Also, if you aren't married to the idea that you HAVE to have a tube amplifier, the Yamaha THR-10 (listing at about $300) really is in a class of its own in terms of what it offers for bedroom level practicing.  The THR-10 is a solid-state amplifier, but models classic tube amps in a very authentic way, and is even more compact than the HT-1 (half the weight and the size of a lunch box).  That being said, the two amps compliment each other well, and the HT-1 works better with pedals versus a modeling amp.I wanted to write a lengthier review for this amp because I feel as if not very people own it, and even fewer are talking about it online.  I took a risk in ordering one, and it has met or exceeded my expectations thus far.  That being said, I cannot say that I would have considered buying it at the full price of $350.  It is arguably ""worth"" that much in terms of craftsmanship and overall quality, but only at the sale price was I convinced enough to give it a try.  It's an excellent amp for home practicing and even some recording (either by line out or by microphone).  It's advertised as a ""metal"" amplifier, but it actually excels at a wide range of musical genres, and responded well to several different guitars that I tried with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4I6HR54U05J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW3I3KG#wasThisHelpful","R3L4I6HR54U05J","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel a little under-qualified to give a thorough review of the Full-Drive 2, since it has so many different settings and I haven't had a ton of time with it yet.  But this quite a versatile boost/overdrive pedal, so long as you understand that it is still fundamentally based on a Tubescreamer circuit, and therefore really is not intended to go from ""clean tone"" to ""Brown sound"" all by itself.The ""CompCut"" setting seems to be the feature that really pushes this pedal ahead from the crowded pack of overdrive and boost pedals.  The ""Vintage"" setting, I suppose offers a Tubescreamer-like overdrive with rounded highs and boosted mids.  It can also run at a pretty good volume even with the ""OD"" knob all the way down.  ""FM"" stands for ""Flat Mids"", and boosts the signal without altering the basic EQ structure of your clean tone.  ""CompCut"" is an entirely different animal - my understanding is that does a boost while bypassing the compression circuit.  So you basically a ""clean boost"" that can really accentuate the dynamics of your notes.  It is also noticeably LOUDER than the other modes.  Anyway, difficult to describe, but it's a good example of how versatile this pedal is - it really can cover a good range of boosting options from clean volume increase to smooth saturation.  Again, this is not a distortion pedal, though it has more gain on tap than something like an Ibanez TS-9, which is a classic circuit, but has some limitations in output and flexibility compared to some of the newer innovations in the last 30 years.I should mention the separate stage for the ""Boost"" switch.  Usually, the effect of this will be to add gain, not volume.  I will say that while a lot of people say that Fulltone pedals sound better at loud volumes and with higher-end equipment, the FD2 has a pretty thick tone to it, so it can absolutely pair well with a smaller amp.Build quality is terrific, of course.  Fulltone was once considered a ""boutique"" pedal, but they've gotten large enough to the point where you can find their stuff in stores everywhere, and they've been able to get price points for pedals like this and the OCD significantly lower than specialty pedals that push $200 and beyond.  Very versatile and useful overdrive pedal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQI92UBABU21O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S5V510#wasThisHelpful","RQI92UBABU21O","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the other reviewer here, I ordered this as a replacement for a Squier Classic Vibe 50's Stratocaster, which is a beautiful guitar, but had some light damage to the 1-ply pickguard and appeared uneven.  Turns out this cream colored one was a much better match for the aged look of the pickup covers and knobs - this looks more like the pickguard the CV Strat should have shipped with!  Installation and fit were perfect, except that there actually is one screw whole off by the switch.  Didn't even require a drill to correct it - took a microscrewdriver to start a pilot hole through the finish and got a screw in there no problem.  Note that they sell a 3-ply (this one) and a 1-ply - I opted for the 3-ply because I just prefer the look and stiffness of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF9U44IHMOPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II90A5U#wasThisHelpful","R3EF9U44IHMOPG","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased the Sony MDR7506 headphones after doing some online research on a good pair of studio monitor headphones to use for playing guitar.  Alternatively, I may use them to listen to music on an MP3 player or stereo.  Despite the fact that this exact product has been on the market since 1991, the MDR7506 is almost universally celebrated by audiophiles and music professionals as a professional quality product made to stand the test of time.  Really pretty amazing if you consider the proliferation in popularity of over-the-ear headphones for casual music listening over the past 10 years - Beats by Dre, Bose, and endless other companies are pumping out new products, and yet many will tell you that the MDR7506 is better.I won't do a ""full review"" because I'm not a true audiophile or expert, though I've heard and owned enough to have a decent basis for comparison.  So I'll start by saying that this is a set of headphones I really like, and then list a few things I like and then a few things I'm less sure about:PROS:- Comfort.  I have larger-than-average ears, so some over-the-ear headphones are problematic.  Nothing about the MDR7506 looks terribly comfortable, but something about perfectly balanced design, 180-degree swivel ear pieces and cushioned headband makes this set feel much lighter than it actually is.  Yes, your ears will get hot after wearing them for awhile, but there are replacement options for the ear pads, and they do not press heavily on your ears, which is what I find is usually the source of discomfort- Sound clarity.  Unbelievable.  I got a Bose AE2 set a few years back (which cost $50 more), and thought that set a new bar for me in clarity with headphones.  But Bose, somewhat controversially, does put their own EQ stamp on the reference material you are listening to.  The MDR7506's are ALARMINGLY clear.  As a guitar player, I'm hearing little details and volume dynamic that were never present with other sets of headphones.  In some ways, this is also a ""CON"" in the sense that it will not mask the shortcomings of poorer quality audio (or bad guitar playing).- Cord length & quality.  This is the only headphone set I have with a coiled cord, and for use with an instrument, it is nice to know that I have the freedom to move a few feet in either direction without ripping a cord out.  The cord also seems very durable and is of a much thicker gauge than my Bose or Sennheiser headphones.CONS:- ""Dated"" Aesthetics.  Look, you either care or you don't.  The design is the same as it was in 1991 - these are not meant to wow people in the street.  There is also an exposed cord on both sides that runs from the earcup into the headband, and this is usually covered on modern headphones.  But they are by no means ugly, and I have these primarily for playing musical instruments in my basement - so comfort takes precedence over appearance.- Cord weight.  While the coiled cord has the obvious advantages I cited above, it is something you will notice if you are used to earbuds or thin gauge wires in modern earphones.  Because it is thicker and coiled, there's some ""heft"" to that cord and it is noticeable if it bumps your arm while you are playing guitar, or if it rests on you for long periods of time.  The positive side of that would be that the coiling prevents it from dragging on the floor.- Not meant to ""enhance"" bass.  There are a number of questionable music trends to come out of the past few decades.  One of them is the ""Loudness Wars"", which is the tendency to push all recorded music to be louder and/or more compressed (for sustained loudness, at the expense of dynamics).  Another trend are powerful headphones that will emphasize the lower frequencies at music at the expense of upper end and overall balance.  Let me be clear - the MDR7506 has plenty of low end - I tested it on everything from classic rock to hip hop with 808's and it handled all of it.  But if your preference is rap/hip hop or electronic music that uses heavy drums and sub bass, and you want a set of headphones that will emphasize that over everything else, maybe another set of headphones is for you.  These are studio monitors, first and foremost.  They are meant to reflect the actual balance of musical frequencies in the source material as if you were hearing the same thing live, or through a set of studio monitors, and at that, they do an excellent job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9DDKJX6OWAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AJIF4E#wasThisHelpful","RX9DDKJX6OWAK","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to the Caline brand, but based on this experience for a very modest investment of around $30, I may be looking at one or two others.  Caline is brand of Chinese clones/copies/impersonations of popular boutique pedals that usually cost between $150 and $300.  I've used a fair number of clones, most of them Joyo, and had very positive experiences all around.  I had heard that the Caline pedals were built similarly to the early Joyos, so I thought I would take a (pretty modest) risk on one.The CP-18 Orange Burst appears to be a clone of the Xotic BB Preamp, which was actually a pedal I had barely heard of before I came across this one.  I have not played the Xotic model, but the basic functionality of the Orange Burst is the same, and I'm pleased to say that it's quite good.  More importantly, it offers something a bit different that the boosters and light overdrive pedals I already have, which is terrific in a 30-dollar purchase.The Orange Burst, fundamentally, is a booster.  There's a lot of debate over the technical difference between boost, overdrive, and distortion (my unit actually says ""OVERDRIVE"" across the bottom, but the cliff notes version of that is that by boosting the input gain of a guitar signal, you can create an overdriven sound.Boosters, therefore, are relatively straightforward effects, and I would certain never pay close to $200 for one, as I am a hobbyist, not a professional, working musician.  But the Orange Burst has two features that I find useful and a unique.  First, it has independent volume and gain controls, which means that it operates more or less as a transparent clean boost with the Gain at ""0"" and the Volume turned up.  This is a nice feature, since other boosters (like my EHX LPB-1) may have only a single level or gain control, so you can only really add gain/saturation, as opposed to just boosting your level.Second, The Bass and Treble controls are independent +/-15dB  boost/cut controls for high and low frequencies.  What this means is that if you are using the Orange Burst as a fairly transparent booster, but your resulting sound it too bright (or dark), you can boost or cut the highs or lows without completely changing the overall tone.  I know that EQ control on boosters has expanded in recent years (notably in the MXR Micro Plus), but I'm not sure that some of the other options give as much control as this pedal does at shaping your sound.Plug this pedal alone into a relatively clean tube amp, and you get a pretty amazing range of tonal options - everything from pure clean boost, to bassy Bluesbreaker crunch, to ""gainier"" sounds you would associate with a more traditional OD or Distortion pedal.Oh, and the build quality?  I'm actually quite impressed so far.  The early run Joyo pedals (JF-01 to JF-17) are a fair comparison, though I think the footswitch on this one might ""feel"" even a bit more reliable.  There is a 9V adapter jack on the left side below the output jack.  And while assume there was a ton of cost savings done on the circuit board and pots, the 4 pots have a good resistance to them, and, frankly, feel more comparable to my Wampler than some of the other ""cheap"" pedals I have played.  Having said that, I do think that budget pedals like this are an ""either/or"" proposition: In most cases, you will get a perfectly functioning unit that will suit the needs of players who don't abuse their gear, but there is always the risk of a defective unit or some component failing that is some unknown percentage more likely than it would be on a unit from an establish company with better quality control.  At $30, I feel that's a worthwhile risk, and I'm really enjoying the Orange Burst.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4V1AWESV59BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GC2F0UK#wasThisHelpful","R4V1AWESV59BI","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm generally a fan of Squier guitars, having owned a handful since the mid-90's (some stock, some modded).  But the reality is that there is a quite a wide variety in craftsmanship and playability from Squier model to model, and even year to year.  All of that aside, the Classic Vibe line of Stratocasters really is in a class of its own.  If you imagined a world where the name on the headstock, price, and country of manufacture were completely unknown to the person playing it, I honestly think this Strat would compare favorably to the Fender-branded Made in Mexico and even the American Standard.  Which is not to say that the Classic Vibe is ""as good"" as those guitars, but more to the point that once you hit a certain level of quality, the differences between more expensive guitars are more about cosmetics and reputation than function or sound quality.The Classic Vibe 50's is meant to convey the form factor of a vintage Fender, but adding a few common sense improvements.  For example, the one-ply pickguard has been thickened to decrease bowing.  The truss rod is fully accessible through the headstock.  But it certainly captures the feel of what you imagine one of these vintage Strats would have looked like had you picked one up in the 1950's.The distinguishing feature of this guitar is the neck and fretboard.  Both the back of the neck and the maple fretboard are heavily lacquered, giving a nice glossy appearance.  You really have to see one in person to appreciate how different this looks than even many of the MIM Strats you would pick up in a guitar store.  For some players, however, this may be a deal-breaker because feel a bit ""stickier"" compared a more matte finish.  I don't find it to be a bother, however, and I'm not exactly a speedster anyway.  The quality control on the fret balancing and edges was top notch, and this guitar certainly has far less buzzing than the cheaper Squier models.  Like I said, I owned both cheap and moderately priced guitars, and this one definitely feels more on the professional side of things.The vintage ""Kluson"" style tuners really add to the vintage effect, and I've actually added these to some of my other guitars because I like them so much.  The thinner strings can be a bit tricky as they need to be cut to the proper length then kept in the top of peg while you wind the string.  But you get the hang of it, and the result is a very neat appearance and excellent tuning stability.The last thing I will say about the pickups, which I consider to be one of the stronger parts of the guitar.  There's been some discussion of what exactly they are - my best information is that they are Alnico 3 single coils with vintage-appropriate outputs between 5.8k and 6.3k.  They are either manufactured by Tonerider, or possibly produced in the same factory as Tonerider, and that's a brand of pickup that I've enjoyed on other guitars.  On this Strat, the sound is just terrific.  Because they are lower output, you can nail those glassy Fender Cleans and the neck position is particularly articulate and punchy without flubbing out the low-end of the amp.  I believe they voiced a bit thinner than the CV 60's pickups, but the sound is not ""thin"" by any means.  It's bright, clear, and ""Stratty"" through and through, and the high end clarity is aided further by the maple neck.  I generally prefer Rosewood, but for what this guitar is and what it does, the Maple sounds terrific.This is a great guitar.  The reality is that Squier/Fender sells far less of them then they probably should because at around $350, it becomes easy to dream about a MIM model with Fender on the headstock.  I don't think you would regret going with a MIM Strat by any means, but if honestly are interested in great playing and sounding instrument at an outstanding price, then I encourage you to consider this ""elite"" level Squier, which captures the essence of Stratocasters costing nearly 4 times as much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MRLK9SQKZWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L8IILI#wasThisHelpful","R36MRLK9SQKZWA","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wampler Black '65 Vintage Overdrive is the second Wampler I have owned, and will be the first one I am definitely keeping. (I owned the Sovereign Distortion for all of 24 hours - quality product, but wasn't ""$200 good"" when applied to my gear).  The Black '65 has been around for around 5 years now, and has been a popular standout in Wampler's outstanding pedal lineup.PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION - Wampler does a subtly terrific job through promotional materials, social media, manuals, and even the name of the pedal telling consumers what their product is and what they believe it is trying to do.  This is an underrated virtue for boutique pedal manufacturers, since a single effects pedal can cost north of $200, and often the buyer will not have had the chance to ""try it before you buy it"".  In the case of the Black '65, Wampler is very clearly going for the sound of a vintage Fender ""Blackface"" amp.  Their website suggests it could be anything from a Twin Reverb to a Vibrolux to a Deluxe.  In fact, it probably captures aspects of all three of those depending on how you work the EQ and the amount of gain that is applied.  It should be noted that the Black '65 is one of two ""Fender in a box"" pedals that Wampler manufactures - the other being the Tweed '57, which gets a little grittier and goes more for the sounds of the Bassman and some of Fenders other earlier amps.BUILD QUALITY - I wont speak too much about the build quality of Wampler pedals except that if you've held or used one, it pretty much speaks for itself.  I'm open to trying all kinds of pedals, from industry standards like BOSS and MXR to cheap imports and clones - if it sounds good and is a reasonable value, I'm interested.  But with Wampler Pedals, I can say that provided you are happy with the sound of the pedal, you can feel comfortable that the premium cost does translate to top-notch durability and reliability.  The knobs have a firm resistance that prevents from bumping it from your foot, and the MXR-style footswitch feels sturdy and built-to-last.  I will say that the mod switches on Wampler pedals feel like they could be a weak point if the pedals were dropped or kicked hard, but I have not heard of this being an issue and, presumably, if you spend $200 on a pedal, you will at least try to take care of it.  9-Volt battery access requires removing 4 screws, but most boutique pedals seem to prefer this approach, as battery doors of any kind seem to get lost or broken.  I use the pedal exclusively with a OneSpot power adapter, so this is not a concern for me.  If you get the pedal new, Wampler even sends you 4 little rubber stick-on footies, which is nice since the pedal would otherwise slide around on the floor and get scraped up (unless you use Velcro).TONE/FLEXIBILITY - So with the tonal goals of the Black '65 in mind, the two questions most people would ask are: (1) How close does it get to that tone?; and (2) What are the advantages of having that sound in a pedal?  I love the sound of a Fender Strat into a Fender Twin or Deluxe; it's probably favorite sound in all of guitar music, and this pedal absolutely nails it.  Assuming that clean/reference tone is clean to begin with, the Black '65 can maintain that cleanness on low gain settings, but puts a ""Fender"" shaping on the entire sound.  That sound differs, of course, by amp model and EQ setting, but can generally be characterized as a round, full lower mid-range presence with a notable ""chime"" in the treble frequencies, though not as trebley or ""bell-like"" as a Vox AC30.  The neat aspect of the Fender Twin, in particular is that as you turn them up, you get a nice tube compression/saturation effect that is not necessarily ""dirty"", but not fully clean either.But the real-life Twin and Deluxe are large amplifiers that need to be turned up quite a bit to achieve that tone, and that's where Black '65 comes into play.  With the gain and volume controls, it is possible with the Black '65 to get a saturated or slightly overdriven tube sound at much lower volumes.  Obviously, as one other reviewer remarked, the experience at lower volume will not be a one-to-one comparison, but it's the best version of that sound in a pedal that I've ever heard.  In fact, I run it into Channel 1 of my Fender Super Champ X2, a 15-watt tube hybrid amp that is supposed to model that very same '65 Twin sound - except it sounds noticeably better with the Wampler pedal applied to that channel.  What Wampler got right about this Fender tone (where so many other go wrong) is that a Fender clean tone actually is a fairly ""bassy"" tone.  It needs to have that low end punch accompanying that high end chime, or you only have half of the equation right.GAIN BOOST SWITCH - Wampler prides itself on adding value to their products with detailed EQ sections and mod switches to give multiple sound options from a single purchase.  On the Black '65, the lone mod switch introduces a gain boost, which is really just ""more"" of the overdriven tube sound you get from turning the gain up on the normal channel.  It can be a raucous, and Brian acknowledges (or brags?) that it's actually beyond what you could ever realistically get from overdriving a tube amp.  In fact, the tone becomes so loose and messy that it begins to sound more like a fuzz pedal.  I won't say that the gain boost switch is ""disappointing"", but it feels a bit gimmicky or niche compared to the general intent of the pedal.  Which is not to say that it is incapable of making useful tones, but it is not footswitchable, and you would probably get a better result driving the Black '65 with a Tubescreamer or Booster pedal.SUMMARY - The Black '65 is an outstanding interpretation of classic Fender tone, encased in a durable pedal built to last.  That being said, it should be pointed out that the Black '65, like ANY ""amp in a box"" pedal, is only going to take you so far.  I think it's a misconception that pedals such as this one only make sense for trying to make amp much different than a Fender sound like a Fender.  I think the best results with this pedal will actually come if you have a quality clean tone capable of American voicing to begin with.  That being said, the 3-band EQ should allow you to dial in great tones on any number of amps.  It also excels at delivering saturated tube tones at volumes that won't knock down the walls in your house (or in small clubs).  The warmth and tube-like response of this pedal are outstanding and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of vintage tones from Fender that are clean or slightly dirty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NRBAWNXLI12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045483C4#wasThisHelpful","R15NRBAWNXLI12","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased an LPB-1 because I had a need for a straight ""booster"" on my pedal board.  Boost pedals, as a concept, are an extremely straightforward concept, but the way they impact tone through an amp depends quite a bit on placement in the signal chain, settings, and the type of amp.  With these issues in mind, I struggled a bit to decide between a 4- or 5-star review, since the LPB-1 has some limitations conveying clean, ""transparent"" boost.  But given that EHX has made it extremely affordable ($40) and it functions very well for a particular type of boosted sound, I decided that there was enough ""function for value"" here to warrant 5 stars.Boosts raise the amount gain in your signal, so the assumption by many is that this makes the audio ""louder"".  While this can be true, particularly if the boost is used later in the signal chain, boosts can just as much increase the saturation of the input signal, and hitting the preamp of a tube amp (or perhaps some modeling amps) may also cause it to overdrive.  The EHX LPB-1 has a single knob for adjusting the amount of added gain - there are no tone controls or additional parameters.  But, used with other pedals (and the settings on your amp), tone control in a booster is more of a luxury than a necessity.Choosing between boosters can be difficult because you really won't know how they function until you use them with your own rig.  I opted for the LPB-1 instead of the MXR Micro Amp (itself a single-knob industry standard) because the LPB-1 tends to be warmer and fuller sounding.  On a large, bassy amplifier, this may not be desirable.  But on a 10"" bright combo amp, such as my Fender Super Champ X2, this is a desirable quality.Some critics of the LPB-1 have noted that the LPB-1 will get ""dirtier"" more easily than other boost pedals.  Some have even noticed that there is a mid boost with overdrive, almost like a Tubescreamer.  However, this was a sound I actually wanted, and if you have a amp that can stay clean at high enough volumes, the LPB-1 should add additional saturation and ""fullness"" to that tone, without making it sound like an overdrive pedal.I think the LPB-1 may make sense for a lot of players who use smaller, brighter amps since it is affordable and pairs well with that type of sound.  If your are looking for a boost to stack in front of other overdrive pedals to emphasize for lead work, you could consider the Micro Amp, or something with tone controls like the Micro Amp+ or Blackstar LT Boost.  In my case, I have the Soul Food (also made by EHX), which offers a lot of clean boost at low overdrive settings, but is considerably brighter than this LPB-1.  Between the two, I should have most of my needs covered.  The LPB-1 is a tested and proven classic and a great value for a blues/crunch sound, or to emphasize other pedals by giving them ""just a little more"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MT6R8KQLZOE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IO8XFM#wasThisHelpful","R3MT6R8KQLZOE0","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You would have been unlikely to find a more staunch opponent of (affordable) multi-effects processors than me, until I came across the Zoom G1on.  Multi-effects processors promise the ultimate value - a one-stop shop for all your effects needs in a single package - but invariably fall short.  Well, in recent years, the entry prices of individual effects pedals has gone down considerably due to globalization and the influx of foreign manufactured models like Joyo, Biyang, etc.  Since the late 90's, I had been frustrated by my BOSS ME-30 - it served me generally well, but it offered literally 5 distortion/overdrive options (none of which were all that good), and generally was difficult to work with.  And this was at a retail price pushing $200.At first glance, the Zoom G1on looks like more of the same - small orange LCD interface with two footpedals, a single selector knob, and just a handful of dedicated buttons.  But that's really where the similarities end.  Under the hood, this $50 Zoom G1on is LOADED with functionality, and as a person who owns dozens of dedicated effects pedals, along with other modeling software and some small combo amps, I can say that while this is an unbelievable value for beginning guitarists - even more experienced musicians should appreciate it as a portable practice device and looper.BUILD QUALITY - Again, the aesthetics of the Zoom G1on scream ""early 90's"", but the casing is actually quite durable and the choices they made allow this unit to sell for $50 while (reportedly) running on 4 AA batteries for up to 20 hours.  (9V adapter not included, but if you have any of the BOSS-style 9V adapters around, those will work, or can be found for about $10 online.  It can also be powered by the USB jack).  The bass of the G1on is solid metal, so only the top and sides are hard-molded plastic.  Therefore, the unit has quite a bit of heft to it, and I did not find it tempted to slide around after being tugged by an instrument cable and headphone attachment.  I can't speak to the long-term durability of the buttons, but I've seen bad switches on pedals many times, and none of these seemed like a red flag to me on the G1on.  Heavy stomping could surely damage the foot pedals, but I actually prefer it on a table closer to eye level for practice.  For home use and operated with common sense, I expect it will last.AMP MODELS - While the product is marketed as an ""effects unit"", it should be noted at the start that it operates as a full preamp and cabinet simulator modeling (now) 22 types of popular amps.  These are well-selected, too, offering several Fenders and Marshalls, along with some other classics from Vox, Matchless, and Orange, and modern/hi-gain amps (MESA, etc.) as well.  I haven't tried every amp quite yet, but the base amp tones are surprisingly full-sounding and convincing.  Tube amp snobs will tell you that they aren't as good as the ""real thing"", but in my opinion, they sound very good, and are touch responsive in ways that are at least analogous to how a tube amp responds to your playing.  Through the LCD screen, you also have an impressive number of parameters to control, including level, gain, 3-band EQ, presence, ""tube saturation"", and the output cabinet size and type.  Needless to say, with this number of options, if you have a particular guitar tone in mind, there's certain to be a way to get something at least close to it.EFFECTS - With a firmware update released months after the G1on was released (and factory-installed on newer productions), the G1on now boasts around 100 effects.  Zoom quite blatantly tells you the name and model of the pedal or unit they are modeling, and they have a few of their own effects as well.  Obviously, I can't break down all of them in an Amazon review, but I found them to be quite good.  What's nice is that there are several options of each effect offered, so there aren't just two reverbs - there's closer to a dozen.  And there isn't just a single ""blues distortion"", there's models of the TS-9 Tubescreamer, BOSS OD-1, a booster, and other options.  Some have been critical of these effects as differing from their real life counterparts, but again, that's primarily semantics.  If Zoom's Tubescreamer sounds totally unlike a real Ibanez pedal, yet is still useful, that's still an effect I can work with.  The unit allows up to 5 effects to be chained at once, though two of those spots are often occupied by an amp sim and a noise gate.  Also, you will occasionally get an error message that a certain chain of effects is too taxing on the devices memory resources, and cannot run.  However, these are relatively rare, and only seem to appear with some of the more complex modulation effects in a long chain.  I would rather the device cut things off if it's overmatched than try to run a complex chain and either freeze up or suffer from stuttering and terrible performance.  In general, effects chaining works great, and it does allow you to move effects in the signal chain and even after the amp.USER INTERFACE & PRESET MANAGEMENT - Where multi-effects tend to run into problems isn't so much in the amount of what is offered, but the practicality of how you switch from one sound to another, and tweak the individual settings for each effect, amp, etc.  I'd be lying if I said that the G1on is free from all of these inconveniences - it isn't.  But while the G1on limits you to 100 factory presets that can be overwritten, edited, or renamed, they did make some design choices that make it workable.  From the home screen, the left and right footpedals cycle through banks of presets (Zoom includes a very detailed chart telling you what each is supposed to be, ranging from ""Classic rock lead tone"" to ""Guitar tone of the dude from Maroon 5"").  The banks are arranged A0-A9, B0-B9, and so on.  The 4-way directional buttons allow you to skip to different letter bank for quicker navigation.  Once you are within a preset, you can select a particular effect (such as a delay or overdrive pedal), and then the footpedals will turn that effect on and off.  One of the best features is an ""autosave"" option: the default is to autosave every change you make to the patches so you don't lose those settings going forward.  While some may not want this, I found it useful to weed out some of the totally unusable sounds.  That being said, I do wish it made it a little easier to create and store my own patches based on a simple OD pedal -> Amp -> Reverb pedal setting.  You can do this, but only if you overwrite some of the 100 factory patches.RHYTHM/LOOPER FEATURES - I've seen a surprising number of G1on users who could care less about the amp simulations and effects, and buy the G1on strictly because it has a 30-second looper.  Try finding a halfway decent looper pedal for under 100 bucks - it doesn't really exist.  What's more, this looper can be played along with 68 rhythm patterns that cover a wide variety of genres.  The sound quality of the drum beats surprised me the first time I heard it through my headphones...what a great practice aid!  The looper is operated by the footpedals: you designate the number of beats for your loop, set the beats per minute (tempo), and then you can infinitely overdub your loops, provided the run time is less than 30 seconds.  It does not have ""undo"" feature, however.  This is my first hardware-based looper, and I can see getting a ton of use out of it.DRAWBACKS - While my overall review is a glowing 5-star recommendation, I will mention some negatives about the unit that buyers should be aware of.  Most of these are minor, or can be addressed with a workaround.  As mentioned above, the unit does not come with a power supply (but does come with 4 AA batteries).  It cannot be used as a recording interface, as the USB connection is only for firmware updates and powering the device.  It has one 1/4"" jack for output, whether you are using it to run an instrument cable out to an amp, or plugging in headphones.  For the latter, however, you may need a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter (these are widely available for cheap).The interface has a bit of a ""language"" to editing presets and individuals effects/amps, but I picked it up quickly.  One thing that is a bit difficult to manage is volume.  The good news is that it has plenty of output for headphones.  The bad news is that the output level of different presets can vary quite a bit.  There is no ""volume knob"" for headphones or output to an amp/speaker.  If you are using an amp simulator, there is a volume knob there.  There is a second volume option for overall output of each preset. And then there is a Master Volume that dictates the output of the whole unit, but again, this is in a menu and probably would have been better served as a dedicated knob on the unit.  For the most part, once I lowered the master volume to around 50, I was able to enjoy most of the presets at a decent volume through my Sennheiser headphones.The unit has a tuner, which is accessible by pressing both pedals, and I found it quite workable.  It even has settings for alternate tunings!  However, there does not appear to be any great way to ""bypass"" the entire unit, which limits its usefuless as a ""stompbox"" into a real guitar amplifier.  There is a ""bypass"" effect, so I suppose you could set up an entire preset just as the bypass.  But even in that case, I would expect there would be some coloration of tone running through the G1on, which is unfortunate.OVERALL - Despite those drawbacks, I was absolutely blown away with how much I enjoyed the sounds coming out of my Zoom G1on.  I wouldn't have paid $150 for it, and this wasn't really a device I ""needed"".  But at $50, I simply couldn't put my guitar down.  So often, we get that ""5 minutes of curiosity"" as a guitar player, where maybe we just want to experience playing with an auto-wah now and then, but don't want to necessarily BUY a $70 pedal for that sole effect.  The G1on makes that possible in a way that is extremely convenient and gratifying.  It's also small enough to fit in the front pocket of a gig bag, which means you could enjoy these sounds virtually anywhere.  The rhythm and looper features are great, and there are endless hidden gems (the Acoustic Simulator is possibly the best I've heard, and I generally HATE acoustic simulators).  If properly used and appreciated, it can help become a better player, provide endless hours of fun and experimentation, and maybe (just maybe) prevent you from spending needless money on ancillary effects pedals, since your $50 Zoom G1on probably already has that sound on board.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOJN1JXWQGUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOSJ68C#wasThisHelpful","RTOJN1JXWQGUN","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although we have iPhones that take excellent video, my wife really wanted a handheld video camera so that we could take video of our newborn without worrying about running out of memory space.  And with that purpose in mind, the R500 is great.  I use a Class 10 SDHC card with 32GB of space - it can take hours of video, even at HD quality.  It's also very compact and lightweight (amazingly lightweight), and it does a pretty good job identifying faces and focusing.The problem is just with the quality of the resulting picture - unfortunately, it is extremely grainy in moderate-to-low light.  Which, when you have a newborn, is about 80% of the videos you want to take.  This is a source of constant frustration, since I already have a camera in my pocket (iPhone 5s) that can take BETTER videos than my dedicated video camcorder.  That being said, it performs much better in daylight/outdoors, and I have no issues with design or software of the camera.  I think this is good example of why the video camcorder is basically being phased out as a thing.

"I really hope that the THR10 is doing good sales for Yamaha because, in my opinion, they might have just made the perfect home/portable practice amp.  I would further say that it is the ideal ""beginner's amp"", too, except that at $300 for the THR10, it's just a bit high for (most) brand new players starting out.  But it is worth every penny of that cost.Let's get some misconceptions out of the way first.  This is not a tube amp.  When you turn it on, it glows orange, but this is a stylistic effect (and one I rather like).  Also, this is not a preamp, even though it kind of resembles an Orange Micro Terror or Vox Lil' Night Train.  The THR10 is an all-in-one-stop combo amplifier (some refer to this style as a ""lunchbox"" amplifier).  It is a solid state amp, but also a modeling amp.  It also does not have a ""line out"" of any kind, though there are apparently online discussions about how to add one.  The amp is intended to be plug-in-and-play, though you can use it as a USB recording interface (a lightweight version of Cubase is included), and you could (probably) go to a small speaker using the headphone jack.BUILD QUALITY - Top notch.  The facings and front grate are metal, and the sides are plastic.  It has enough weight to sit on a table and not be bothered by the instrument cable, but is lightweight enough to be extremely portable.  Actually, the metal handle is a terrific idea because otherwise you would have no good way to carry it without disrupting the knobs.  The main power switch is a metal toggle, and seems built to last.  The knobs have enough resistance to them that you won't accidentally change settings.  In other words, this thing is not a toy.  Most importantly, although I haven't really ""cranked"" it yet, this amp seems more resistant to annoying rattling and metal noises when you hit a lower note.  Mini amps are notorious for this, and even my two other apps (a 20+ lb Fender Super Champ X2 and a solid state Vox Pathfinder 15) do this to an extent when pushed.  That just speaks of precise design and manufacturing.(Note: there is apparently an issue with electrical noise on some units that is VERY easily corrected - it literally requires a bundle of wires to be zip-tied away from some other wires.  I haven't had this issue yet, but I am not concerned)SOUND & TONAL FLEXIBILITY (THR10 Model) - Note that this is a review of the THR10, not the THR10C (boutique) or THR10X (high gain), though I did demo both of those models and found them equally impressive!  The THR10 has 5 basic models (plus 3 multipurpose ones).  Yamaha reps have all but acknowledged that they model the following amps:CLEAN (Fender Twin)CRUNCH (Vox AC30)LEAD (Marshall Plexi)BRIT HI (Marshall JCM800)MODERN (Mesa/Boogie)What the THR10 does that is (allegedly) different than other modelling amps is to basically re-create the actual circuitry of those amps with the modelling technology.  The significance of this is that, in particular, the AC30 and Plexi models will reflect the full range of gain for those amps.  (A Yamaha rep even joked that the THR's tone controls on the Marshall amps ""don't really do anything"", since they don't do much on real Marshalls either!).  Therefore, despite having only 5 amp models, I find plenty of usable clean tones between the CLEAN, CRUNCH, and LEAD settings, and they all have their own character.  The BRIT HI model has a good deal of output, and can run from classic rock to some metal.  And the MODERN sounds downright mean, and insanely ""large"" for an amp that is, well, so small!  Remember, this is two 3"" speakers for a total of 10 watts, yet it probably as much or more volume (and better quality) than many 8"" speaker combo amps.People tend to neglect the other three settings, but they also intriguing.  The BASS setting is probably intended for plugging a bass guitar for practice (haven't tried), but it completely functional as a bassy sounding guitar amp (Fender Bassman, anyone?).  The ACO is the acoustic setting, which would allow you to plug an acoustic/electric in and take advantage of the excellent reverbs on board.  FLAT sounds boring, but is extremely useful - this would be the setting you would us to plug an external device (synthesizer) or perhaps a preamp pedal like a Tech21 to use the THR10 more or less like a PA or power amp.What really makes the THR10 great is that they thought of so much of what the home guitar player would want in a single package without just throwing a mess of everything at the user and making it a nightmare to navigate.  It has a built-in tuner, separate effects knobs with Delay/Reverb and Chorus/Flanger/Phaser/Tremolo, tap delay for tempo setting, and a handful of simple amp models that are high quality and extremely versatile.  This one was and is an instant classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVZQWV5P7DEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QLW5XC#wasThisHelpful","R2QVZQWV5P7DEX","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I are extremely pleased with this CamelBak Relay pitcher.  It has a number of marked advantages over the Brita pitcher with cylindrical filter we used previously.  It is a more compact size due that fits in the fridge, but still holds 10+ cups of water.  It's insanely easier to refill because of how fast the filter works, which encourages us to keep it full.  (The Brita could take several minutes to cycle through, and if you tried to pour it earlier, the filter and any water would fly out of the top.)  And possibly most of all, it doesn't deposit little charcoal bits in the water like the Brita did - this was a constant annoyance for my wife, particularly, as she'd find them in her glass of water.  And the filters last for 4 months, which is conveniently marked by the slider dial on top.  They're about 10 bucks a pop, but if that holds true, we'll spend less on CamelBak filters than we did with Brita.I've seen some people noting that it doesn't filter out some minerals.  That may be the case - I haven't put our water through a lab analysis to test it.  But here in Minnesota, the tap water is not that bad to begin with - so whatever items are being filtered out are sufficient to improve the taste.  Highly recommend this pitcher for design and convenience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYSHRGR3UENF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G46CZ6G#wasThisHelpful","R1SYSHRGR3UENF","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sort of addicted to the Vox Amplug series - you can go find my (mostly glowing) reviews of the first generation series.  One of the 1st-generation Amplugs that disappointed me a little was their Marshall clone, which they call the ""Classic Rock"".  It had plenty of power, for sure, but sounded far too muddy for a ""Marshall"" type sound.So, when I learned that the Amplug 2 series had been released, the Classic Rock was the first one I wanted to try.  Fortunately, there is a notable change in tone for the better.  Still plenty of ""big amp"" power, but now a crisp upper end that just sounds more believeable as either a clean or overdriven Marshall tone.  And, really, as a practice tool, high-end clarity is especially important, since you need to hear the notes you are playing clearly to know if you are playing them right.MODE SWITCH - I was a little skeptical when I heard that Vox was adding all sorts of effects and mode switches to the Amplug 2 series.  But it turns out that the changes are almost all for the better.  A button replaces the on-off switch, and switches between three ""modes"".  The manual claims that they are introducing a mid boost from ""off"" (green) to ""lo"" (orange) to ""hi"" (red), which is probably true.  But the most notable change is that the boost settings introduce more gain and saturation.  Which is nice because you really do get a full range of clean to overdriven tones.EFFECTS - The guitar versions of the Amplug 2 all feature a 3-way effects button, which goes Off -> Chorus -> Delay -> Reverb.  Since the new Amplug adds effects (and modes) without increasing the price, it's hard to complain.  Reverb was #1 thing that people seemed to miss about the original Amplug, and it is done pretty well here.  However, you obviously can't adjust the amount of reverb, and it's set to a somewhat aggressive level - almost like if you had reverb on ""6"" on a Fender amp, whereas I tend to have it around ""3"".  So, it's a bit messy if you use it with high gain, but it's there and if you want a big ""hall"" type sound, you can get it.  Delay was present on a few of the early Amplug models (Satriani and Lead, I believe), and it works similarly here.  Delay time is fixed, but it seems to be somewhere in the 300-400 ms range (guessing), and that's a good sweet spot for both lead work and U2-style delay.  I was less of a fan of the chorus, which is aggressive and does has a heavy detuning presence, but chorus is quite subjective and I'm not a big user of that effect anyway.(Note: I was alerted by a comment that there are actually 3 modes for each effect.  I did not discover this on my own and should have read the manual more closely.  My mistake!)BUILD QUALITY - People tend to slam the Amplug for being plastic and fragile (including one reviewer here), but I just don't get it.  The appeal these things is precisely the fact that they can make it for 40 dollars and it sounds darn good.  If they made a solid metal one for 60 or 70 dollars, would I consider buying that instead?  Sure.  But it would also price out a lot of beginners or deter people from owning more than one of these.  I highly doubt that any type of construction would make it break-proof or prevent losing it anyway, and at 40 dollars, it's easier to justify re-purchasing.  In any event I haven't broken one or had one fail yet, though I could see that with a lot of use.  The one structural change to the Amplug 2 is that the plug now swivels to quite a number of different angles.  This helps accommodate different jack positions for various models.  I do find it hard to adjust the dials on a Les Paul-type jack on the bottom of a guitar, since it swivels in the jack if you touch it.  However, that has as much to do with the guitar as it does with the Amplug.Highly recommended for beginners or pros alike looking to practice and keep it to themselves.  I have a newborn so playing my amps is rarely going to happen.  The Amplug is a great option for quiet practice, and the tone is better than you would probably think.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18201RWRUNS6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAUE7QU#wasThisHelpful","R18201RWRUNS6F","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is about my 12th review of a Joyo pedal, so if I'm not an expert, I'm at least ""experienced"".  Most of the Joyo pedals are worth the (insanely low) price of admission at the very least, or outstanding bargains in some of the better examples.  This Joyo JF-11 Equalizer would fall more in line with the latter camp - it can be had for about $35 TOTAL after shipping and free delivery, and it performs as well or better as some of the Boss and MXR pedals I've tried that cost more than twice that.BUILD DESIGN/QUALITY - The design of this pedal is either ""cloned"" or heavily ""inspired"" off of the MXR 6-Band EQ.  It has a heavy duty metal case and an MXR-style bypass switch that I find to be very reliable.  In fact, that was true of all of the ""original"" Joyo pedals, which are numbered from JF-01 to JF-17.  Some of the newer models (numbered through about ""60"", I believe) used a much lighter chassis and less durable switch, but this EQ pedal feels great.  I was not sure what to expect from the 6 slider knobs, but feel well-designed.  Each has that ""notch"" position at unity gain and they light up individually with LED's on the top, which is great for using in the dark.  Pedal aesthetics are more ""icing on the cake"" than something I actually worry about, but I think this is one of the sharper looking Joyo pedals out of their whole lineup.  All that being said, I will have to be careful about just throwing this pedal in a box if I don't want to damage the sliders.  Even my BOSS GE-7 had some bent sliders after years of use, and that pedal is arguably more durable than this one.SOUND - The first thing I wondered about when I plugged the JF-11 in was whether it would add that hissing noise.  I had a Boss GE-7 for many years, and I seemed to recall that being an issue.  At least with my amp (Fender Super Champ X2), I didn't seem notice any hissing noise added by the pedal, which is great!  It's important to note that there is NO Master Volume or Gain control on this EQ, similar to the MXR.  I've never been a fan of using a EQ pedals to boost overall volume anyway, since it adds noise and seems to kill sustain.  HOWEVER, you can increase or lower the volume simply by raising or lowering all the knobs while keeping the shape the same.I actually appreciate the subtlety of this EQ pedal.  It definitely does boost and cut particular frequencies, but it isn't the GE-7 where I only seemed to use the middle 20% of the available settings.  You can fine tune a bit more with the sliders here, which is nice for small adjustments.I think that this EQ pedal is ideal for either an amateur user, users with limited budgets, or players like me who may introduce an EQ to their pedalboard for some applications, but not necessarily all the time.  The ""clean"" channel of my tube/hybrid amp tends to get overly bright, despite the fact that the speaker has obvious fullness on other settings.  This pedal would pair great with other effects to cut just a little of that bite off, without trying to use the ""Bass/Treble"" knobs on the amp.  It's another great value proposition from Joyo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC1AF7ZEN70LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T8KI6M#wasThisHelpful","RC1AF7ZEN70LC","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was on the lookout for a very compact, portable, all-in-one practice amp solution for noodling in my office or any other small room around the house I wanted to play guitar in.  As a very amateur - though somewhat experienced - guitar player and wannabe gearhead, I've owned a number of solid state, tube, and modeling combo amps and switched them in and out as my needs and tastes changed.  If you are realistic about the types of sounds that an affordable amplifier of this size can make, then I truly believe the Blackstar ID Core10 is one of the more complete practice amp solutions imaginable.Let's get a few things out of the way.  First, the size...this thing is SMALL.  Stand a ruler up on your desk.  The Core10 is slightly shorter than that ruler, and maybe an inch wider.  It weighs all of 9 pounds and comes with a detachable shoulder strap/carrying handle.  Chances are that your guitar weighs 7 to 10 pounds, so if you can carry it, you can carry the Core10 as well.  It's also pretty uniformly ""square"" in shape, so you could slide it onto a shelf or into the corner of a closet and hide it quite easily.The phrases ""bedroom amp"" and ""practice amp"" get thrown around interchangeably with no uniform meaning.  For comparison, I have a Fender Super Champ X2 in my basement.  It's a $350 15 watt tube/hybrid modeling amp with a 10 inch speaker, and it probably weighs around 20 pounds.  The Blackstare ID Core10 has two 3"" speakers that are 5 watts each (total of 10 watts of power).  There really is no practical way that you could consider the Core10 a ""performance"" amp.  My Super Champ X2 is probably about the smallest size amp you would consider even for a smaller venue (unless you mic it up), and even then, you would probably opt for a tube amp or something with a bigger speaker.  So if people log on here and post 1- or 2-star reviews complaining about the lack of low end - just keep in mind: they bought the wrong amp for their purposes.But the most important question about the Core10 is ""How does it sound?!""  I'm thoroughly amazed by the quality and variety of sounds that this little solid state modeling amp puts out.  For something that costs 100 dollars, keep in mind that not even 15 years ago, amateur players like me would freely pay 2 or 3 times that price for a multi-effects processor, which would be about the same width as my Core10.  They would then hook that up to whatever crummy solid state amp they could afford (Mine was a Crate GX10...yuck), and you'd have one complicated, relatively expensive, and still poor-sounding gear.  The $100 Core10 assembles amp/speaker modeling, effects, and speakers all into the same box, and it sounds worlds better than that big red POD you were proud of in the late 90's.The limitations of a set of 3"" speakers are obvious, but the sound very ""full"" without necessarily being deep.  But the Core10 seems to avoid two key annoyances that plague most solid state amps with 8"" or smaller speakers: (1) Unwanted rattling; and (2) Speaker breakup/distortion.  In fact, as much as I love my Vox Pathfinder 15 (a now discontinued solid state amp revered for it's affordable tube-like sound), the Core10 seems able to be pushed closer to its limits without degrading sound quality.  The secret may be in the ""stereo"" nature of having two small speakers side by side.  This is particularly noticeable with the addition of reverb, delay, or chorus.The Core10 has 6 ""voices"", which are kind of like different amp models: Clean Warm, Clean Bright, Crunch, Super Crunch, OD1, and OD2.  I had a Strat and Les Paul-style guitar alternately plugged into the Core10, and it handled both quite well.  On some settings, the Strat can get a bit bright, but the guitar's tone knob can help that.  None of the settings were muddy and unusable, though, and it really does simulate a ""cranked"" larger tube amp sound at lower volumes.One controversial feature may be the ""ISF"" control, which stands in lieu of a traditional tone knob.  The ISF does affect equalization, but not in the traditional way.  At ""0"" it has more of a Fender/US sound, and blends all the way to ""Marshall""/UK at ""10"".  At first, I was quite alarmed that there was no way to tame the high end with a simple roll-off control.  But, realistically, the 3"" speakers probably don't push enough air for the difference in low end/high end on a simple tone control to even register.  You will find that the different voice presets have sweet spots that may also vary based on your guitar.  Add/subtract gain and volume, and you'll get close enough to where you want to be.  The ""Clean"" settings do a convincing Fender tube amp at low volume.  Crunch is bright with some tube-like breakup (similar to a Vox), and the three higher gain settings could be part Marshall, ""Brown Sound"", Soldano, depending on your opinion.  It all sounds surprisingly good.While the EQ could have been handled better, the effects suite is brilliantly conceived.  I can't tell you many modeling amps costing many times more than this one force you to use one or two effects at a time (and usually in the combinations that they pick).  On the Core10, reverb (which is always on for many players) has its own control button, which can be run separately with modulation (chorus, tremolo, etc.) and delay.  You really have everything you need in this one little box to approximate just about any guitar sound you can reasonably think of.  No, it wouldn't sound as good as a 30-pound tube amp, but that was never the point.Some final notes: the amp is powered by an external power supply, which is a round plug cable into a box, and out into a wall plug.  It's actually nice not to have a power cord permanently sticking out the back, but you do have to bring the power supply.  The headphone jack is okay - it retained the sound quality but needed to be turned up quite a bit to match volume.  It also does some type of line out speaker emulation but I haven't tried that.  Also allows you to plug in an MP3 player to jam along with, but I haven't tried that either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIYY5X03FBL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J072XOA#wasThisHelpful","R1XIYY5X03FBL6","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an iPhone 5s, having previously owned a 4s with an Otterbox Commuter.  The Otterbox is outstanding for protection, surviving probably over a dozen drops.  However, it started to crack along the edges and was getting a bit ragged towards the end.I opted for this Spigen Tough Armor and am impressed by it so far.  It is really as slim as you can get will still offering ""real"" protection.  That being said, cases are usually 5-star ratings until one fails and they become 1-star ratings.  But so far so good.  The back of the case is very hard, and has a softer inner lining to absorb shock.  The best design feature is probably the bit of air pocket they have in the corners, which is probably the most frequent fatal impact point on smartphones.  The phone slips in and out of the case without too much effort - if it were TOO easy, the case wouldn't protect the phone.  The screen is exposed, but there is a rim around the front so that a drop on a flat surface should not impact the glass.My favorite feature is probably the oversized buttons for volume and power.  The buttons on the case are larger than the actual buttons and work well - some cases make it very difficult to press the buttons.I've seen some complaints about scratching on the case, but c'mon.  This is a 20 dollar item meant to protect an $800 item.  If the scratches become a huge deal to you, buy a new case.

"With electronics, there is a counter-intuitive-yet-true statement that products trying too hard to be a ""ahead of the times"" will more quickly end up ""behind the times"".  The DigiTech iStomp - which is undoubtedly a well-constructed, quality product - may well fall victim to that truth.The iStomp is digital effects pedal that simulates ONE effect pedal (distortion, chorus, compressor, reverb, etc.) at a time.  The effects are stored in the StompShop, which is an iOS (free) app, and then uploaded to the physical stompbox in a process that takes about 30 seconds.  Once uploaded, no connection is  required with the iOS device - the pedal will work the same on stage or in the middle of a cornfield (supposing you have the 9v power supply attached).The quality of the effects, in my opinion, is actually quite good.  Some of them suffer a little volume drop, but the overall results are excellent. I'm a recovering pedal addict, so a single unit that can switch from reverb to flanger in 30 seconds is a whole lot more appealing than having to BUY a reverb AND a flanger pedal, only to use the latter once in a blue moon.But from a meta perspective, the concept begins to fall apart.  Since the pedal can only be one thing at one time, it doesn't have practical versatility for anyone desiring effect changes in the middle of a set list, or even an intense jam session.  There are sticky labels you can place for some of the more popular effects, but otherwise, you have no idea what the four rotating knobs actually do, unless you have memorized it.The interface with my iPhone was fairly simple, but it often asked me to unplug or restart the device because the connection was lost.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I feel like that process needs to be almost idiot-proof.  Also, I do not believe that my unit came with the new Lightning cable, so newer Apple devices will require some type of adapter.  If the company fails to support software updates, it could be difficult or inconvenient to switch effects in the near future.Then there's the issue of pricing.  I believe the early prices for this item were in excess of $150, perhaps even $200.  Since I bought it as a clearance item, I paid only a fraction of that, and am very pleased with the value.  But I can't give it a 5-star review in good conscience knowing that the vast majority of owners bought earlier and paid more.  While multi-effects processors have their own shortcomings, they offer considerably more flexibility that a stompbox that can only be one thing at one time.  Also, the StompShop downloads were only recently made free (with a few exceptions).  Prior to that, you had to pay extra for many of the effects, which was a further hidden cost.  Finally, there are iOS programs (such as JamUp XT and Agile AmpKit+) that offer full amp modeling, effects suites, and recording/DAW options for the same or less money as the iStomp.  It's easy to see how DigiTech may have talked themselves into the higher price point a few years ago, but the landscape has changed dramatically, and there are more low-cost effects options available today than ever before.All of that negativity aside, if you see one of these at a good price, absolutely give it a look.  The selection of effects is quite good.  Even if you set it up as only one effect pedal (such as reverb) that you didn't have, there's some potential value there.UPDATE (Feb 2015) - Over a year later, the iStomp remains a useful ""swiss army knife"" if I want to fill in a sound that I don't have a particular pedal for.  This is particularly the case with the modulation (chorus, etc.) and reverb effects, of which there are several.  For example, if I want a good Spring Reverb pedal for an amp lacking reverb, spending $150+ for a Catalinbread Topanga (which is excellent) does not make a ton of sense, but I can load a 'verb onto my iStomp and it's actually really good.I would also note that subsequent to my review, I emailed DigiTech and requested all of the labels (8 pages I think), and they sent them to me for FREE within a few days.  The labels are adhesive but removable, so I was very pleased with that support, especially for a now-discontinued product.  (Don't know if this is still available).The iStomp continues to work with my iPad2, which is now on iOS 7, but I cannot say if it would work on newer devices using a 30-pin to Lightning adapter.  I suspect there will be compatibility issues in the future, so there may come a day where you cannot find your cable, and you're stuck with whatever pedal you last installed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RL6NS90R6LTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00708NMWS#wasThisHelpful","R2RL6NS90R6LTG","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The G-Pop Bluetooth speaker was actually given to me as a stocking stuffer - I didn't request it or know about it before hand.  However, as it turns out, it's actually a pretty decent little Bluetooth speaker!The budget Bluetooth speaker market is actually somewhat crowded, and it can be pretty tough for consumers to sort out the bargains from the outright garbage.  I actually own a Monster Clarity unit (which is more expensive), and while the Monster is probably a little better, it isn't by much.  Also, since the speaker is arranged vertically, it's extremely portable and compact - great for a tight fit behind a computer monitor or something.My favorite aspect of the speaker is that it pairs automatically and immediately with my smartphone, which is something many other BT speakers don't do without a button press (or several).  It doesn't have a stunning amount of bass, but it does have ""enough"".  This speaker is best used if you are sitting/standing somewhat close to it.  I also wish that it would get just a little louder, though it is perfectly fine for podcasts and most music.Not everybody can afford (or would want) to spend $200 or $300 on a Beats or BOSE Bluetooth speaker.

"Fender actually has a few of these mini amps.  I've tried out the ""Super Champ"", and while none of them has particularly ""good"" sound quality (even for the size), the Super Champ probably performs better than the Mini '57 Twin.  That being said, the Mini '57 is the most attractive of the three with actual wood casing and a fabric/tweed exterior.  Even the knobs are semi-realistic in appearance.Unfortunately, the benefits don't extend much beyond the appearance.  The amp gets reasonably loud but has a very flat, solid-state nature to it.  It overdrives quite easily, but not in an appealing way.  Since this mini amp tends to be more expensive than similarly-sized alternatives, I expected a little better.That being said, I most wanted it as a desk-topper or conversation piece for my office, and it accomplishes that goal just fine.  We're just in an era now were very small speakers (even inexpensive ones) don't have to sound absolutely terrible.  For example, I have a 30-dollar bluetooth speaker next to the amp on my desk, and the sound quality (particularly low) end of that speaker annihilate anything coming out of the Mini '57.  But it's an attractive decoration that reminds me of my guitar hobby, so as long as that's the intended function: mission accomplished.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDEHGNF5EI38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B2Q2MC#wasThisHelpful","RRDEHGNF5EI38","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really can't say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM.  Not even 3 years ago, I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a ""novelty"", and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as ""gimmicks"" or ""toys"".  Now, as of 2013/14, we have so many quality modeling programs, recording DAW's, and AudioBus to connect them to one another.  Whether you're a budding professional, or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers, the Apogee JAM (usually around $99.99) deserves a serious look.PROS -Extremely easy to use and widely compatible --> No batteries required.  You get a small plastic converter with an 1/4"" input (for guitar cable) on one end and a digital output for 30-pin connector, Lightning, or Mac cables, all of which are included.  Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS (GarageBand, Agile AmpKit, AmpliTube, JamUp XT) will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the box.Crystal clear digital sound --> The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input.  You'll hear your guitar as it's meant to be heard, and with far less hissing and junk in the background.Considerably less feedback --> This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade.  My Positive Grid JamUp Plug wasn't disappointing me in sound quality, but there was so much additional noise that went with it, it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit+ to feed back.  High gain settings (even something basic like a Marshall JCM900) were practically unusable.  Even with clean settings, I had the noise filter turned WAY up, and that still didn't thwart the feedback issues.  The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly.  When I first plugged it in, I wasn't even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background.  What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface.  The JAM's improvement in avoiding feedback, alone, made it worth its price.No ""crosstalk"" - When you do multi-track recording with a headphone jack splitter, you get a bleed-over effect referred to as cross-talk.  Basically, you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track, but due to poor circuitry, this also gets fed back into the ""armed"" track you are recording.  Some people are bothered by this more than others, but it makes quality multi-track recording quite challenging.  I haven't noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever, since it is a digital connection.  (You can still monitor your playing using the iPad's headphone jack separately, obviously).Gain control and LED gauge --> Not a feature unique to the JAM, but I love how it's implemented.  When you first plug in the device, the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up, but not being utilized by software.  Once the input is active in software, the light becomes green.  However, as you play and hit harder notes, the light may change to yellow/orange, or even red.  If it is getting into the red, your input level is too high, and may overdrive the signal.  You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial.  I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts.  Works well.CONS -Price point is a little high --> Admittedly, I wasn't thrilled about having to spend $99.99 for what I was already doing with a $20 headphone jack.  That being said, I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best.  If I knew it would be as good as it is, the price would have been of little concern.  Also, there aren't really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaper.Lightweight plastic design --> I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM, or that it is made out of plastic.  At the same time, the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table.  I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor.  But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it, and it's a problem you can address with common sense.Highly recommend the Apogee JAM.  It's a mid-level priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123H2R4KIXHZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z8VQ2O#wasThisHelpful","R123H2R4KIXHZA","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually bought the JamUp Plug about a year ago.  At that time, I'd seen all the commercials for Apple's GarageBand, and I wanted a cheap interface for my iPad.  I hooked it, and it worked well enough, but the guitar aspects of the GarageBand software failed to hook me.  The JamUp Plug stayed in my drawer all summer, hardly ever used.  Fast forward several months later, and decided to purchase the JamUp XT Pro software that is actually created by Positive Grid.  Wow.Let me say first that I'm not a professional/gigging player by any means, but I have about 15 years of experience and a decent collection of combo amps, pocket amplifiers (including the excellent Vox Amplug series), and effects pedals.  I can honestly say that the JamUp Plug paired with Positive Grid's native software offers amazing tone and range of sounds for the vast majority of players out there.Device Function/Use - The JamUp Plug is extremely easy to use, if a bit fragile.  It is made of lightweight plastic, and plugs into the 1/8"" headphone jack on your iOS device.  The best (and IMO, only) way to use the plug is to lay it absolutely flat on a table with the 1/4"" input jack and 1/8"" headphone output weighting it down in place.  If the plug is allowed to move at all while playing, you will get a ""static""-like interference.  But follow that procedure and you won't have many issues.  Since it goes through the iOS audio jack, it is widely compatible with recording software such as GarageBand, AmpliTube, etc.  But I honestly think JamUp's own software is the best out there.  You can play it absolutely free with a few base amps and effects, or upgrade (usually $20) to the Pro version.  I strongly recommend the latter.  There are additional bundle packs for $9.99, or individual amps for $4.99 or pedals for either $2.99 or $4.99.  IMO, virtually all of them are of excellent quality and reasonably priced.Amp Models - The amp lineup offered by the JamUp XT Pro software is quite impressive.  Positive Grid has renamed them, but they appear similar to the real-life counterpart, and the descriptions in their store will tell you the exact brand and model of amp they are modeling.  The options range from vintage clean amps (Vox and Fender classics from the 50's and 60's) to high gain classic/metal rock (Marshall/MESA) to modern boutiques (Bogner and artist signature models).  While I love distortion pedals when playing through an amp, I found that the gain options on the modeled amps in in JamUp XT were so accurate that I didn't miss my stompboxes.Effects - My hope is that Positive Grid continues to add new pedals for future purchase, but even the lineup you get in the free version is quite strong (models of the MXR Dyna Comp, Ibanez TS-9, Boss OD-3 Overdrive, Noise Filters, etc.).  Not only can you work the settings and turn the pedal on/off as if it were a real pedal, but you can move the effect around in the signal chain.  This even applies to noise filters and placing items in the effects loop.  I've heard some people complain about excess noise or ""hissing"", but if you work with the Noise Filter pedal (included), you can cut most of that out.There's also a 2-track recorder in the Pro version, which can be expanded to 8 tracks for $4.99.  It isn't as full-featured as other recording software, but it's significantly easier to use, and allows for basic exporting via email or to iTunes.Please note that I dedicated a large portion of this review to the software accompanying the physical JamUp Plug itself because I consider these to go hand in hand.  There are probably more expensive adapters out there that are less delicate, but for $20, the JamUp Plug absolutely does the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANRO4Y728Z73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IDWPJ8#wasThisHelpful","RANRO4Y728Z73","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received this item as a gift, but I own SEVERAL of these Amplugs.  I'm disclosing that up front because I'm a fan of the whole Amplug concept in general, and find the overall lineup to be stunning good in sound quality.  These are inexpensive pocket amplifiers that go directly into the 1/4"" jack of your guitar, and then output a 1/8"" headphone jack/line out.  There is also an audio in jack for jamming along with an MP3 player (which, remarkably, I have yet to try).  I find the different models diverse enough that I consider it as a low cost (and low space) alternative to owning different combo amplifiers.  With that background in mind, I turn to my review of the Night Train Amplug, both as an overall product and as compared to other Amplugs.Thus far, my favorites in the Amplug series are the two I consider the most versatile: the AC30 and the Twin.  Both of those are capable of going from a fully clean to fully distorted/overdriven sound, and some cool sounds in between.  The Night Train is also capable of this wide range.  In fact, since the FX switch flips the mode from ""bright"" to ""thick"", you can even flip to the latter mid-song (provided you can reach the switch) and it's as if you're hitting a distortion pedal/overdrive channel.  The ""thick"" channel is considerably higher gain, and actually may be one of the more saturated gain offerings out of the entire lineup (the ""Metal"" Amplug would be another example, obviously).On the ""bright"" setting, you can set the gain basically at ""0"" and still have an audible usable clean tone.  With humbuckers, it's a tone that ""wants to be dirty"" pretty quickly, but you can absolutely keep it clean.  I found some of the best results were actually using some of the mid-gain settings on the bright channel and working the guitar volume down to clean it up.  This particular unit seems to respond well to guitar volume inputs.I may update/revisit my review after I've had some time with it and tried it out with some different types of guitars.  So far, however, my impressions are quite good.  I believe that the Vox Night Train is one of Vox's newer amplifiers, and they're usually offered with a lower wattage mini-head and a single cabinet speaker.  I have played a real Night Train once or twice, but not extensively.  The Night Train Amplug has a more aggressive, deeper tone than something like an AC30.  I thought that the Classic Rock Amplug (which impersonates Marshall amps) was a little too muffled for most guitars, and the Night Train offers a nice alternative within the same ranges of gain and tonal application.  It could definitely handle jazz, blues, rock, and maybe even some types of metal.  This might not be the first Amplug I'd recommend, but if you're a fan of its full-size counterpart or have a thing for collecting affordable, quality practice aids (* raising hand *), I doubt you'll be disappointed.Update: Got a chance to play it some more with a Strat, as opposed to a Les Paul - I stand by the 5-star review!  The Night Train has a unique sound that can fool you into sounding vintage, but can also get a bit raucous.  The gain structure is probably more similar to an overdriven Fender than a Vox.  With the single coils, you obviously have a wider range of usable ""clean"" or ""barely dirty tones"".  But it worked well with both styles of pickup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUPFGXUHCNIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NEMR18#wasThisHelpful","RQUPFGXUHCNIA","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the reviews for this item, there seems to be a lot of debate over what the Fender Mini Tone Master is and how we should evaluate it.  Is it a toy, or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier?  Do we review it compared only to other ""mini amps"", or do other small combos costing under $100 creep into the discussion?  Well, I bought one for myself and the conclusion is this: It isn't the best way to practice guitar quietly at home, but it's also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you'd expect.APPEARANCE/DURABILITY - Actually, the aesthetics of the Mini Tone Master are one of my favorite things about it.  This is a $40 conversation piece that I wouldn't mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies.  It just so happens that it's a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also?  The component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap, yet are put together in a convincing way.  Take a step back and you'd swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather.  The ""grill cloth"" over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers.  Actually, while the amp is cheap, it's also fairly durable.  In fact, I just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review, and it seems to be working fine.  (Phew!)  It should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a 9V battery or a 9V DC adapter (a BOSS pedal supply adapter will work, for example).  While the battery option is obviously nice for portability, the red ""ON"" light seemed noticeably dimmer with 9V's, and I can't say how long the battery will last.  If you plan to have it in one place most of the time, the adapter is the preferred way to go.SOUND - The concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it - a one watt output with TWIN 2"" speakers.  Given that each speaker is smaller than the ""tweeter"" on a large stereo speaker, you won't be surprised at all to hear that there's virtually no bass in the sound.  It sounds like a poor 10W solid state amp, only shrunk down to a few inches.  At the same time, that's kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier, and it puts out a fair amount of sound.  I opted for the Mini Tone Master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones.  Low Gain/High Volume produces pretty good clean tones, and with humbuckers and the gain turned up, it can get a bit raunchy.  Unfortunately, the tone control either does nothing, or behaves completely irrationally.  I haven't figured out which yet.  I had it at ""5"" most of the time, but it didn't seem to cut much treble as I turned it up.  Actually, it got the brightest around ""7"", and then almost became more muffled beyond that.  But again, for a $40 mini amp, my expectations were not that much to begin with.  I do like the four knobs, and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on-off flat toy switch.I expected the speaker to overdrive/break up if you pushed it too hard, and not in a ""tube-like"" manner.  That wasn't necessarily the case, but there are other problems.  Something internally rattles after the volume goes above ""4"", and it's not the speaker being overpowered.  This is a common issue with cheap amps, and I might even pop it open to see what is rattling around.  And the sound quality isn't objectively ""good"" by any means, but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style.ALTERNATIVES - The primary reason I rated this 4* instead of 5* really isn't any of the issues above (I am happy with the amp), but it's limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home/quiet practicing.  My favorite of these, by far, are the Vox Amplugs, which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers.  The sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality (and volume/fullness) than anything this mini amp could do.  Also, they are offered at $40 or $50, so it's simply a better value.  Another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software.  While sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps, the possibilities for effects, modeling, and recording are endless.If you think about recent improvements in small size Bluetooth speakers, you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the Mini Tone Master offers.  At the same time, those speakers can cost up to $200, and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp.  Your opinion of it will depend on your expectations, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a cool little device.  And, in my book, anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PKO3AH3ZPD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LPSNRQ#wasThisHelpful","R19PKO3AH3ZPD1","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of Les Paul copies on the market, including those from Epiphone, which is affiliated with Gibson.  However, the Agile AL-2000 might just be a more faithful ""copy"" of the Les Paul form factor, and is an impossible value coming in at just over $200.In size, weight, and material, the AL-2000 is almost identical to an actual Les Paul.  The body is solid mahogany, and you can tell.  Nothing about this guitar feels ""cheap"" or compromised - it just so happens that the people from Rondo Music were able to put together a very faithful representation of a classic guitar style using most of the real components and sending the manufacturing to South Korea.  The AL-2000 is also offered in an astounding variety of finishes.  These include classics like sunburst or cherryburst, as well as unique ones like translucent black, tiger flame, and blue flame.  My guitar weighed in at a solid 9.2 pounds, and the vintage flame top is as appealing as many $1,000 guitars.In terms of playability, I've been quite impressed so far.  I neither expect nor require a perfectly playing instrument.  Most budget guitars (or even some nicer ones in need of some TLC) have some minor issues, such as string buzzing.  My particular model has just a hint of string buzzing when you use the lower frets, but I'm fairly confident I could fix that with a bridge or truss-rod adjustment.  Again, these are issues that most amateur players probably wouldn't even notice, and are certainly MUCH worse on similarly priced guitars.The Grover die cast tuners are excellent - they literally feel like what you'd find on a $1,000 instrument.  I've had no problems tuning or keeping the instrument in tune.With all of that out of the way, the question remains: how does the guitar SOUND?  With most budget guitars, the pickups and electronics are usually the weakest link.  Fortunately, these are also easiest and most cost-effective changes to make.  I will say, however, that the switches and knobs function perfectly, and I'm actually quite happy with the ceramic pickups thus far.  There's a perception out there that alnico magnet humbuckers (which are more expensive) are always superior to ceramic pickups.  While ceramic pickups are cheaper and a little more harsh, I've had ceramics that just SOUND better than some alnicos.  And if that's the case, why are you really looking to make a change?  The humbuckers on the AL-2000 sound great to me.  They operate quietly and have a nice voicing and punch without being too overpowering on the amplifier.But again, if you don't happen to care for the sound of the pickups, the ""bones"" of this guitar are still unbelievably good for the price, and it would make an excellent modding platform.  I always thought I would end up with an Epiphone Les Paul someday, and they are nice guitars.  But many of them cost twice the price of the AL-2000 and, in my opinion, they just aren't better guitars.  If you want a step up in the features, I believe the AL-3000 is similar in most respects, but features alnico pickups, a better string nut, and an ebony fretboard.Excellent guitar and an amazing value!UPDATE (12/16/2013) - I was so excited about this guitar that I raced out and wrote the review above right away.  I'm happy to report that my opinion of the guitar has not diminished in any way since.  I own other budget guitars, like Fender Squiers, where I can honestly say that the thing ""sounds much better than a 200-dollar instrument"".  At the same time, there's little flaws and corners cut that remind me it's not the ""real thing"".  Not so at all with the Agile - it's such a solid, well-crafted instrument that, in my mind at least, I'm playing a freakin' Les Paul!  The stock ceramics even sound great to the point that I'm keeping them in there indefinitely.  The fact that they may be a little brighter than a more expensive humbucker is a blessing in disguise - I'm finding great uses for all three pickup settings and appreciating that the neck pickup isn't as muddy as other humbuckers.  Lovin' it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B925QMZ9PEU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ARJHG6#wasThisHelpful","R2B925QMZ9PEU1","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I struggled a bit with whether I considered this a 4-star or 5-star pedal.  For now, I'm rating it 5 stars, even though I feel like I need to do some work with it to fully connect.  But the fact remains that it happens to be very good at what it does, which is offering a variety of bottom-heavy metal distortion sounds.The construction of the Hardwire pedals is top-notch.  The knobs have metal tops and have micro-notches built in as you turn them (well, at least on the gain).  It's a good, reliable feel to dial them in.  That being said, one of the challenges of this (or most) metal distortion pedals is that it can be quite intimidating to dial in the right sound.  High and Low EQ settings are self-explanatory, but add on top of that a midrange knob AND a mid frequency shifter, and you can mess things up pretty quickly by switching just a setting or two.  There's also a Tight/Loose mod switch that makes a noticeable difference on how ""messy"" the distortion effect sounds.  ""Loose"" gives you a sloppier, more saturated tone, while ""Tight"" is punchier and more percussive.Overall, the pedal sounds great.  The output isn't absurdly high, but it will get plenty loud enough.  Unity gain really varies depending on the mids setting (more mids make it quite a bit ""louder"" sounding), but is usually around 55 to 65% of the Level.  Some ""metal"" pedals do an 80's Marshall tone that has plenty of gain, but not a tone of low end.  This pedal can offer all the bass your amp can handle.  It's also quite versatile given the variety of EQ settings.Like I said, I need more time with it, and so far, I've had better luck finding rhythm tones than lead tones.  But it might also benefit from being paired with a Tubescreamer or other overdrive.  Think of the TL-2 as a more modern-sounding, improved version of the BOSS Metal Zone.  It's readily available to try out, and if you like Metal, there's a good chance it will do the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KE32T6G5ZSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CJ2R04#wasThisHelpful","R28KE32T6G5ZSS","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The humbucker-sized P-90 is a great innovation, because there are plenty of affordable (and less affordable) guitars that have the mounting and routing for a humbucker pickup, and adding a P-90 is a great way to get a different type of sound than either a single coil or humbucker.  While there are other quality alternatives that cost a little less (including the GFS Dream/Mean 90 and Tonerider Rebel 90), you will not regret spending the extra money for the Seymour Duncan Phat Cat.CONSTRUCTION/MOUNTING - Duncan pickups are made in the U.S. and have an excellent reputation for quality.  The braided cable in something you'll never see once the pickup is installed, but it makes grounding and soldering much easier than cheap wiring, which tends to melt away.  The screws and springs hold the pickup nicely in place, and did not take up any more real estate than the humbucker I removed.TONE QUALITY - The Phat Cat bridge pickup sounded outstanding.  I actually placed it in a Squier Bullet Telecaster, which is routed for a bridge humbucker.  I wanted more of a brighter tone, but one with some fullness and attitude.  The Phat Cat definitely fits that bill.  Some people have commented that it doesn't fully achieve the sound of a ""real"" soapbar P-90.  That may be true - I don't have a ton of experience with soapbar-style P-90's.  But if you evaluate the tone of the Phat Cat on its merits, instead of comparing it to something else, it's excellent.  One of the reasons I like it in the bridge position is that it has the low end of a humbucker while retaining some of the brightness of a single coil.  The output is close to 8.5k (or thereabouts), so it won't overly push your amplifier compared to other ""vintage"" output pickup.I should note that there is some noise or ""hum"" associated with this pickup - it is a version of a single coil pickup, after all.  But Duncan does a good job with the shielding and casing, so the noise is pretty minimal, even with some distortion.  It's a great sounding pickup with a lot of punch.  I definitely recommend it if you'd like something a little brighter than a humbucker, and it really pairs well with a lot of different types of music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLBDF72XL7S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002GY986#wasThisHelpful","R3KLBDF72XL7S6","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review may be a work in progress because I just recently found and bought this Bullet Tele.  Previously, the $179 Affinity Tele from Squier was one of the more affordable options, but I didn't like it enough for the price.  If you pick up the Bullet Tele with reasonable expectations, I think you will be quite happy with it.The key thing to mention about this guitar is the humbucker in the bridge position.  Traditionally, Telecasters have a raised bridge pickup that creates that bright, vintage ""twang"" you know and love.  The humbucker is a high output, ""thicker"" pickup.  Yet, placed in this style of body, it manages to produce a similar tone (and without excess noise).  While it might not get you all the way to the jangle of a standard Tele, it will be more versatile for heavier types of music requiring distortion.  I think the humbucker actually lends more versatility to the instrument, but other people may prefer the traditional thinner sound.  To me, that sound can be ice-picky thin, and a bit abrasive at times, so this is a neat compromise.The body is lightweight, but not cheap feeling.  The biggest surprise is the black hardware and tuners.  Unlike the ""trapezoid"" tuners you see on many cheap Squiers, these ""Gotoh""-shaped tuners seemed to tune and hold tune nicely.  Even the nut looks halfway decent.  Again, this is a $119 guitar, so you are not getting high-end electronics or wood components.  But unless you're a snob about those sort of things, this guitar plays great, and is a great option for budget players, or people just looking for an affordable ""change of pace"" instrument.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3VF3PT6RFL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FG5RPDE#wasThisHelpful","R1X3VF3PT6RFL3","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently picked up the TC Electronic MojoMojo Overdrive at a steal of a price, but I'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price.  I own many different overdrives, including light overdrives in the ""Tubescreamer"", and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous (Blues Driver, OCD, Joyo Ultimate Drive, etc.).  To me, this is closer to the Tubescreamer family, as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive.  Actually, the separate knobs for Bass and Treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the Digitech Bad Monkey.BUILD QUALITY - Outstanding.  It has an ""MXR"" style click button press, but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last.  The 9V jack is on the top, out of the way of the I/O jacks.  The battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw/button that you can easily get open with your fingers, or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver.  The thing is dense and build solid as a rock.  I always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush-resistant, and tend to get punted around by your cables.  Finally, the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback, and several of them are actually notched to settle into the ""12"" position, which is a nice touch.TONE QUALITY - Obviously, the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review.  I would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a ""5"" and absolutely loved it, as several previous reviewers did.  But based on the pedals I have used and my experiences with the MojoMojo, it feels more like a ""4"" to me.  The tone is very warm, almost to the point of being muddy.  Whether the mod switch is a ""boost"" or a ""cut"", the pedal is bassier in the ""up"" position.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely appreciate the abundance of low-end frequencies, but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through.  I could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments.  It does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character.  However, if you'd like a similar effect with a much more expressive (and brighter) output, try the Mad Professor Sweet Honey Overdrive, or its ""clone"" companion, the Joyo Sweet Baby Overdrive.EASE OF USE/VERSATILITY - Many overdrives only have the single tone control, so I was excited to see controls for Bass and Treble.  Still, I feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps, and very muddy with others.  I will update my review if my feelings change, as I have a few different combinations I want to try out.  I feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion.  This is much the way you would use a Tubescreamer.  I will say that it is one of the more ""tube-like"" overdrives I have tried.  Hit the notes lightly, and you get a clean, transparent tone.  Attack them harder, and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup, much like a tube amp.  However, if your hope is simply to plug into the MojoMojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones, you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal.UPDATE (10/28/2015): Revisiting this review after I sold my original MojoMojo, and then found it used for cheap enough that I said ""what the heck?"", and purchased it back.  Actually, I think my original review was pretty consistent with how I still feel.  Both the MojoMojo and Dark Matter Distortion are routinely sold for $49.99 now, and I think they are great values at that price.  The tone control on the MojoMojo is a little disappointing to me - it isn't like control on a Wampler or JHS where you can dramatically alter the pedal from dark to bright.  This is a dark-sounding pedal, period.  But it comes to life a bit if you use it as more of a clean boost and turn up the Level - that really seemed increase the expressiveness of the upper mids a bit.  And I do think there are some ""tube-like"" qualities to its sound, including the sag in the gain structure.  Might be a nice pairing with an ice-pick bright amp, but don't mistake it for a one-size-fits-all tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WHWZFQO2D4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OK1G64#wasThisHelpful","R11WHWZFQO2D4K","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Korg Pitchblack is probably, along with the BOSS TU-2/TU-3, considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass.  Both the TU-2 and Pitchblack are excellent, and I don't really have an opinion yet as to which is better.  However, there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners.  The primary draw here is the bright light-up display with wide color bars.  The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide).  But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off, they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi-tones.  You could argue, therefore, that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on/off light.  The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass.  When you step on the pedal, the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off.  The switch is also of the ""soft button"" variety, similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques.  It has a nice feel to it, though it could be easier to bump if it's in a high traffic area.This is a great tuner at a reasonable price.  It really comes down to user preference, but I've heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQBZF4KYM1YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015RIN6U#wasThisHelpful","R1NQBZF4KYM1YE","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I should make clear that I'm generally not a fan of descriptions like ""Vox in a box"" or ""Marshall in a box"", as if an effects pedal can magically turn your entry-level combo into an expensive tube amb or stack of 4x12's. It can't, and your amp will still have many of the same shortcomings no matter what you plug into it.That being said, digital emulators have come a LONG way in the past decade or so, and there are so many more attractive (and affordable) pedal options that can drastically change your sound, even compared to the 1990's. BOSS has a massive lineup of venerable effects, such as the DS-1 Distortion and SD-1 Super Overdrive. In 1995, they released the BD-2 Blues Driver (an instant classic). But they've struggled a bit over the past 10 years to debut any new products to match the success of their older industry classics. As a result, many tone enthusiasts have come to snicker at BOSS products, opting instead for handmade boutique pedals costing $150 or more.I really hope that the BC-2 Combo Drive (along with BOSS's excellent Marshall emulator, the ST-2 Power Stack from 2010) helps to reverse that trend and gets some serious attention from novice and pro players alike. BOSS has struggled to pick good names for their pedals, and the Combo Drive is a perfect example. The name suggests that this is some sort of distortion or overdrive pedal, but gives little other information. (In fact, BOSS's own website categorizes the BC-2 along with other Distortion/Overdrive pedals. In reality, the BC-2 simulates a whole family of VOX amplifiers, starting from the jangly riffs of The Beatles and ranging to the slightly distorted arpeggios of U2's The Edge, and the screaming high-gain solos of Queen's Brian May.After owning this pedal for nearly a year, I have learned how to work the controls a bit more, and it really does a good clean boost (with maybe just a hint of gain) if you have the sound selector all the way at ""CLEAN"".  The key is to turn up the volume at lower gain settings, much like you would with a Tubescreamer.  I actually run this thing into other Vox amps (Valvetronix and a 15W Pathfinder) because it just offers ""more"" of that hollow, boxy, Vox sparkle.  It really does an outstanding job of hollowing out the mids and giving a vintage Vox sound, even more so than other boutique pedals marketed to do the same thing.  My only complaint would be that it can be a bit noisy on some of the higher gain settings, but this is true of many distortion pedals, and can be remedied with other equipment.  Definitely check this pedal out if you are a fan that classic Vox tone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRIMUJUF9NPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P4NV9I#wasThisHelpful","R1BRIMUJUF9NPM","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick, but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness, which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing, but they do wear down and fray on the edges, and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming, while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJWN4BX5TS59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D02RQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SJWN4BX5TS59","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the opportunity to pickup a T-Rex Tonebug Distortion for a great used deal.  I had no idea what to expect, and after doing some research about it on the internet, reviews seemed to be quite mixed.  After getting it home and plugging it in, I was initially disappointed, but gradually came to appreciate its value, with some notable caveats.  Here's some the positives and negatives from my experience with the Tonebug Distortion:PROS:Build Quality - Unlike many ""budget"" pedals, T-Rex (out of Denmark) has made a very sturdy and reliable pedal here.  Solid metal casing with good weight to it, and a metal switch that turns on and off with a ""soft"" press, as opposed to a ""click"" (comparable to the switches on the Vox Satchurator)  The pedal is slightly wider than a BOSS or MXR, but the I/O jacks and power adapter jack (9V or 12V) are all on the top, which reduces the side-to-side width on a pedalboard.  I actually prefer the I/O jacks on the sides, but others may prefer them in this arrangement.  The cables can be a bit of a tight fit, but it feels very durable.  The 9V battery compartment (if you use one) is on the back and is accessible without screwdrivers, which is a plus.High Output/Clarity - One of the immediate things you notice about the Tonebug Distortion, which saves it from being a ""terrible"" pedal, is that it offers plenty of output.  Unity gain is easily achieved at 12:00 (or possibly lower).  Tone, and distortion/overdrive in particular, is very subjective, but as long as you have a pedal with enough headroom to match or boost your amp's clean signal, there's the possibility that someone will have a use for the pedal.  I found that the tone had impressive clarity for distorted power chords, and could be an ideal match for combo amps/cabinets with larger speakers that tend to sound ""muddy"" with distortion.  This pedal also has quite a bit of output on tap, and operates at high gain quieter than something like a BOSS DS-1.CONS:Lack of bass - Several of the reviews I read criticized the Tonebug Distortion for being ""too bright"", but I don't believe that's the case.  The emphasis on this pedal is more in the upper midranges than the highs.  It doesn't sound screech or ""ice-picky"", yet at the same time, it lacks the low end that many other distortion pedals offer (and modern guitarists prefer).  If you are looking for a pedal to make your smaller amp sound ""big"" - this probably isn't it.  It will get very loud, but won't add the low end mimicking that 4x12 cabinet sound.  The prevalence of upper mids is a mixed bag, because it really increases the perceived volume of the sound and would probably cut through the mix in a live setting, yet it leaves you wanting more on the low end.  You can roll back some of the brightness with the tone knob, but it won't add much to the low end.Low versatility - While I don't expect every distortion pedal to have a mid-range control, and excessive EQ knobs can make some distortion pedals unwieldy to use, this pedal probably could have benefited from one.  While it's tone does something like an 80's Marshall sound, the inability to scoop the mids prevents you making it sound meaner and muffled.  This is unfortunate because it actually has quite a bit of gain/sustain on hand, but you can't voice it to sound ""more metal"".  For soloing, that sustain definitely comes in handy, and it's more musical than many other ""distortion"" pedals.  But, again, the lack of more EQ control means that you either like the voicing or you don't.  At times, I thought that there was a weird ""parked wah-wah pedal"" sound when I was playing higher notes, and you really can't change that.  This is very much a mid-to-high gain distortion pedal, and you cannot roll back the gain for any type of clean boost.FINAL IMPRESSIONS:Immediately upon plugging it in, I came up with the closest comparable pedal I had played, which is my Joyo US Dream (itself a clone of the Suhr Riot).  Both of them that 80's Marshall high-gain sound, though in a side-by-side test, the Tonebug Distortion had less low end than both the Joyo US Dream and a BOSS DS-1.  However, some may prefer it over those pedals anyway, and it certainly is better suited for soloing than the fizzy, thin high-end of a stock DS-1.Ultimately, it didn't turn out to be the ""dud"" that I thought it could be, but it also isn't a total winner.  There are a lot of excellent distortion pedals on the market for under $100, including this year's new MXR Super Badass Distortion.  I can't recommend the Tonebug over a pedal like that, but for the right price and the right user, it could be a good match.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V0OKAXT6NO6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ILPHHE#wasThisHelpful","R2V0OKAXT6NO6I","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a poorly-kept secret that the key to metal distortion tones is found in tweaking the midranges.  When it comes building a good metal distortion pedal, however, the Joyo Pocket Metal proves that, sometimes, less is more.  There is a crowded field of competent metal pedals out there, including the venerable Boss Metal Zone and MXR Fullbore Metal.  But while the assortment of midrange knobs on those pedals theoretically makes the ""perfect tone"" possible, it also leaves you constantly bumping and tweaking with knobs, which always seem ""just a bit off"".Fortunately, the Joyo Pocket Metal is a pedal that rocks as soon as you plug it in.  There is no tone control for bass/treble - this has been replaced by a single ""Mid"" control.  Still, you get quite a bit of versatility ranging from scooped (muffled, thumpy) mids, to boosted (punchy, clear) mids.The Pocket Metal has gotten considerably less hype than many of its excellent Joyo counterparts, but I think it deserves more praise.  Having been recently disappointed by the low output of the Joyo Hot Plexi, I was pleased to find that the Pocket Metal is plenty loud.  You also won't miss having an independent bass control - it has plenty of low end.  Actually, the Mid knob can do quite a bit to emphasize or de-emphasize the ""thump"" effect of the low end, as well.I also was quite happy with how the pedal responds to higher notes and lead guitar playing.  While it isn't quite as melodic as many high-gain overdrive pedals, the individual notes are well defined and can sustain quite a bit with the ""Dist"" knob turned up.  Also, while the pedal produces some noise, it's quieter than I expected it to be given the level of gain.The build quality is what is - probably better suited for home players and recording than a live setting.  But at this price point, you get no compromise in tone quality or simplicity.  I'm not a huge metal player, but this just became my go-to pedal for all things metal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKOBBHS5M854/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VHQ6YY#wasThisHelpful","R2DKOBBHS5M854","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay is a relative newcomer on the pedal scene, but has become instantly beloved by professional, semi-professional, and amateur guitarists alike (I would be in the latter category).  As a longtime user of the Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, it was a bit jarring trying out the Carbon Copy.  But after playing with the controls a bit and appreciating the pure quality of the tone it produces, it quickly won me over.There isn't a great way to explain the difference between digital and analog delay other than to say that the former is more precise and percussive, while the latter provides more warmth and ambience.  The ""Mod"" button is suppose to add additional modulation to the tone, though I don't hear a dramatic difference.  But no matter what setting you use, there is something undeniably more ""real"" about the delay effect of the Carbon Copy versus other delays I have used.  Rather than repeat your notes verbatim, it almost sounds like a haunting middle ground between the reverb/echo effect of a large hall and digital delay.The range of this delay, fortunately, is quite wide.  I believe it goes from 20 to 600 milliseconds.  To give you some perspective on that, slapback delays (such as rockabilly ""Stray Cats"" echo) are very short, probably under 150 milliseconds.  Rhythmic ""U2"" delays are usually around 350-450 ms.  Then there's even longer delays with a lot of repeats, a la Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.  This pedal is capable of all of those (though the ""U2"" style delay is better achieved with digital).  One note on that though - whereas the DD-3 uses three different knob range settings to cover its delay time, everything from 20-600 ms is covered with one sweep of the Carbon Copy's knob.  This makes it very convenient, but also a bit touchy.To summarize, the Carbon Copy is outstanding alternative to digital delay and at an attractive price point.  It covers the sounds of delay pedals over twice as large (and expensive), and belongs on any delay aficionado's pedalboard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPG2IVOWB24WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016ZZKJO#wasThisHelpful","RPG2IVOWB24WZ","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually came across this pen randomly when we were in an airport in Germany.  I have the clear one but thought the yellow color was cool and unique, so I ordered one for use at work.  Fortunately, I grabbed 4 of the M63 refills when I bought the pen, since they are a bit on the pricey side.  Definitely not expensive compared to other ""nice"" pens with refillable ink, but expensive if you're accustomed to using disposable pens like Pilots.  It would be nice if there were more options to buy the ink in bulk, but they at least seem readily available (at about about $5 per) through Amazon and other vendors.I can't say yet how long the ink cartridge will last.  However, the pen writes quite nicely.  People are correct about the ""thicker"" band of ink, but that was actually a draw for me.  It's probably somewhere between a 0.7 and 1.0 mm pen you would buy here in the U.S.  It writes very smoothly with a thick, uniform line.  What you prefer really depends on your writing style, but I have a pet peeve against thin-ink rollerball pens, so this seems like a good fit for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1PTP8KBDQKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R309TC#wasThisHelpful","RA1PTP8KBDQKW","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm rating this album 5 stars even though it's not the ""best"" work from A7X simply because it's a very solid album from front to back, and probably deeper than ""Nightmare"", despite the title track of the latter and some good singles.  I don't think it makes any sense to hate A7X for being one of the few ""metal"" acts that can sell albums, or arguing over whether they're metal or not.  Ironically, you hear BLATANT callbacks to Metallica (""Sad But True"") and GNR on this record, and those were two groups that people often criticized at the time for not being ""metal enough"".  At the end of the day, buzz words and genres don't matter if you're just a great band.

"My 4-star review (subject to change) is based on the fact that the Chromecast, in a year's time, could be an amazing fully functional value at $35.  But that all depends on what type of app support and additional functionality they build into.  As an early adopter, I'm not disappointed, but it's not quite an elite device right out of the box, either.The important thing to recognize about the Chromecast is that streams independently from your WiFi connection, but is controlled by another device (PC, Mac, iPhone, Android, etc.) on that WiFi network.  That's both good and bad.The good is that streaming on something like Netflix seems to go extremely well once you get it started up.  You're also free to close the app and do other things on your phone, even if you used the app to start the video.The bad side of the design choice they made is that there isn't any real ""remote"" for the Chromecast itself.  Android and Apple may offer one soon (much like the Apple TV ""Remote"" app), but at launch, none is available.  This can make navigating content a little clumsy.  It's best done with a smartphone running a supported app, but the only supported apps are YouTube, Netflix, and Google Play, which is a woefully underpowered lineup.Of course, you do have the ability to stream from the tab on your Google Browser, BUT, it needs to be a laptop or other computer on the WiFi network.  For most, this will probably be the case, but our house computer is a wired desktop, so no go.  I expect this device to improve a ton in the near future, and if it does, it's a great addition to the marketplace.

"I have to disclose that I'm a bit of a Joyo rube, as evidenced by the nearly dozen or so of them I now own.  So given that I bought the pedal, and am generally very happy with it, it pains me to give anything other than a 5-star review.  Still, they can't all be 5* pedals, so I think a 4* rating is more appropriate for this pedal that does one specific thing pretty well, but nothing else.My biggest gripe with the Plexi Drive isn't with how it sounds, but more with the fact that it's a sound that's readily available on dozens of other pedals, even those under $100.  In terms of gain structure, it reminds me a little of the MXR '78 Badass Distortion, except that it isn't as hot/bright, and it offers a little more gain.  Users of this pedal will find that it depends heavily on the quality of your amp's clean tone, which becomes increasingly true as you use dirtboxes with less gain/saturation (which tends to smother or ""hide"" the underlying tone).  For this reason, subjective opinions on how it sounds may vary from rig-to-rig.But all that being said, the pedal does rock.  Turn it on over as clean a tone as possible, and you can hit crunchy power chords with good mid-range punch and clarity.  It also has a nice low-end presence that some other distortion pedals lack.  The tone doesn't behave differently by changing the amount of gain, however.  You get that vintage Marshall crunch with low gain settings, and then the same tone with more saturation as you turn it up.  It does pair well with a good overdrive, such as the excellent Joyo Sweet Baby OD.  Not necessarily good or bad, it just ""is"".The build quality is good enough for most people, but certainly not to the level of a BOSS, MXR, or even some Biyang and older Joyo pedals.  Everything works great now, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of these Joyo switches fail in 5-10 years.  At this price point, though, that's not an unreasonable risk to take.It was easier to purchase the Plexi with the prices falling to the $35 to $45 (U.S.) range, as opposed to nearly $60.  But unlike the other Joyo products, which offer boutique-caliber clones, the Hot Plexi didn't ""blow me away"" as a unique value.  But it sounds great, dials in simply and reliably, and is cheap, all of which make a great option for budget players or dirtpedal-obsessed hobbyists (raising hand).UPDATE (09/21/2013) - Re-visited my review; going to revise it to 3 stars, as much as that pains me.  Perhaps I'm being too hard on this pedal but for me, the number one rule for any distortion box (and especially on specifically dedicated to hard rock, aggressive, distorted Marshall tones) is this: It can't get QUIETER when you step on the pedal.  The whole point of distortion pedals is that you need it to be on unity gain or INCREASE your volume easily.  I have this turned all the way up, and it's barely at unity gain on any setting.  That's unacceptable.  Did the side-by-size with the MXR '78 Badass again, and while the Hot Plexi has a great sound (arguably) even better, it's not useful to me once you perceive it to be ""weak"".This is not true example of the Joyo lineup, many of which are great products and have TONS of power on tap.  The Crunch Distortion and Ultimate Drive have absurd amounts of output.  This Hot Plexi is simply a near miss, and a slight disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DODF9GNRS23D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VHOBIC#wasThisHelpful","R1DODF9GNRS23D","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have somewhat of a minor addiction to the Vox Amplug - I have the AC30, Twin, Satriani, and Classic Rock.  And, really, since they're surprisingly cheap and allow me to play at times and places I never could before, they're arguably a better investment than most guitar equipment.I had read good reviews of the ""Metal"" for awhile, but not really being a huge fan of metal rock, I passed on it.  Having tested it out, however, you could make an argument that if you could only own two of these, the Metal should be the 2nd one.  (FYI, the other would be the AC30 or Twin, which covers the completely clean-to-overdrive range).A few things you should know about the ""Metal"" Amplug: first, it is an ""always-on"" distortion.  There's really no cleaning it up with the volume knob, but that isn't really the point.  It's meant to be played loud and hard, even if it is a bit of a one-trick pony.  Also, I've heard it impersonates a ""Mesa Boogie"" type of amplifier, but I haven't played one, so I can't say.  It has plenty of volume on tap, and you can hit power chords and leads with nice depth and saturation.  It's extremely satisfying to hit a big chord and hear such a gigantic sound coming out of a plastic headphone amplifier.  You don't even need top-notch headphones to enjoy it - I use a pair of $20 Sony's and love it.Some people might be skeptical because ""Vox"" is not generally associated with ""metal"" guitar, but don't let that dissuade you.  These fully-analog headphone amps are outstanding, and each is unique in its own way.

"It's tough to say what we should make of the back story of this album, which is that two artists whose voices and timing so beautifully matched (but were happily married to other people, and never romantically involved), apparently now cannot stand one another.  They called off a tour and the duo is, for all intents and purposes, disbanded.  Lover's quarrel?  Spousal jealousy?  Creative differences?  Who knows.In the meantime, their sophomore album is beautifully crafted and follows logically in a musical sense from ""Barton Hollow"".  The songwriting an musicianship is very good, but it's the vocal performance that sets them apart - I could listen to these two do an album of covers.  In fact, they effectively cover Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"" and Etta James' ""Tell Mama"" towards the end of the album.

"Wow.  I have been impressed with a lot of Joyo's products, but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended, and hasn't disappointed.  I held off a little bit until the price came down, but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny it's sold for, and then some.As the description says, this is a ""mild overdrive"".  It won't give you the ""Brown Sound"".  It's not meant for metal.  It's almost like adding a tube-amp ""gain"" knob to your existing rig, add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone.  Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out.  Unlike many ""tube"" overdrive pedals, this thing has tons of volume on tap.  You can set the ""Drive"" to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost.  Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock.  But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone, as opposed to an ""effect"" that transforms it.  In that respect, it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD-3 Overdrive, which is a vastly underrated pedal (though the OD-3 probably offers more gain).The Focus knob is interesting - it doesn't act exactly like a tone knob.  As you turn it up, it doesn't remove bass, but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone.  The lower settings are bluesy - the higher settings are bright and dynamic.  But chances are, both will sound good.There are some concerns you could have about the build quality - the switch may not be built to last 20 years, and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying.  I also wish they'd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side.  But those are mostly minor gripes.  It's an excellent overdrive and an incredible value.UPDATE (Feb. 2015) - Looked back at this review, since I haven't used the Sweet Baby Overdrive as much as I thought I might when I bought it.  Not necessarily because of anything to do with the pedal, but more because my amps tend on the brighter side of things, and it is important to understand that the Sweet Baby is a brighter-sounding overdrive pedal.  There is no ""tone"" control per se, so you cannot do a simple roll off on the treble if you don't like how it sounds.  Actually, a much better comparison for this pedal is the EHX Soul Food, which is as Klon clone, and was released a few months after my review.  Both pedals are light/transparent overdrives that are not really meant to be cranked up for singing leads.  Both of them trend toward a brighter sound, but also excel being ""stacked"" with other overdrive pedals for that reason.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S25B9F5E81X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q28BHE#wasThisHelpful","R2S25B9F5E81X0","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rogue Analog Delay is well-constructed and feels very high quality given the price.  It's similar in size to an MXR stompbox, though the knobs are more reminiscent of a BOSS.  Delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entry-level pedals.I really have no complaints about the Analog Delay in terms of how it performs and sounds.  It does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about 320ms, or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats.  It's just too bad that they weren't able to stretch out the delay time a little longer, perhaps to 450ms or 500ms.  Once you get into that territory, there's a much broader array of things you can play, including the U2-style phrasing repeats.  That being said, a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway.But it isn't fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy, and if you're looking for something cheap and surprisingly high-quality to provide ambiance, the Rogue will do just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2AU73P5S56T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049Z4UQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1T2AU73P5S56T","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen some lukewarm reviews on this pedal, and I just don't get it.  For a pedalboard-friendly, durable fuzz pedal of ANY quality to sell in the $40 to $55 range, there's not much to hate.  It just so happens that the Fuzz Star absolutely delivers in the tone department as well!People have said that this is a Muff clone, and that may be the case.  The key things to know about it is that you get tons of output (unity gain at around 9:00 or 10:00 on the Level), and a fair amount of tonal versatility between the tone knob and three-way switch.  I don't want people to get the impression that it's ""three pedals in one"" - the mod switch changes the brightness and gain structure a bit, but doesn't fundamentally change the sound.  But with a Stratocaster, there were all kinds of useful tones with the different pickups.  Even the bridge single coil, which can be ice-pick bright with many pedals, did a nice job of opening up the Fuzz Star.If I had to nitpick about anything, the pedal does generate a fair amount of excess noise, though this is basically a characteristic of every fuzz pedal ever made.  It may also be too bass-heavy for some rigs, but again, that's highly subjective, and even desirable in my case.  If you're new to fuzz and don't think you want to drop 80 bucks or more for one of the iconic name brands, do some research on the Biyang Fuzz Star and check it out.  I certainly was not disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UI9XBNF4TEYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OKXBB8#wasThisHelpful","R1UI9XBNF4TEYK","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no question that ""Yeezus"" isn't the Kanye album anyone expected.  Given that Kanye was becoming a first-time father about the time the album came out, and the origin story of the album involved a lot of time in Paris staring at lamps, ""Yeezus"" wasn't expected to be so...angry.Yet, even though I considered myself a pretty casual Kanye fan in the past (the divisive ""808's and Heartbreak"" was my favorite Kanye album before this one), I really think he's made an interesting album here that I can't stop listening to.  How many new albums in ANY genre can you honestly say that about.Which is why the aggregate 3-star rating on Amazon baffles me.  If you just Kanye to begin with, you probably should be buying his album, let alone throwing a 1* review at it.  If you're a Kanye fan that liked the poppier stuff and sped up gospel hooks, I don't think those things are dead - they're just being put to the side a bit.I have no idea how Kanye intended this music or his lyrics to be interpreted.  But it's pretty clear to me that ""Yeezus"" is a musical persona, not actually Kanye himself.  The anger, aggression, masculinity, and pure ""id"" in the lyrics is Kanye lashing out - both honestly and satirically - about the life of a mega-celebrity consumed by always wanting ""more"".But probably my favorite thing about ""Yeezus"" is how much CONTENT it has for being around 40-minutes.  Not that I hated all the skits and ""throwaway"" tracks on ""The College Dropout"", but it's refreshing once in awhile to have an album get to the point and stay on that point for 9 straight tracks...followed by ""Bound 2"", which is more of a classic Kanye song.  I understand the hate, but it's way overblown.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T426M1723QTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CV5ZPA2#wasThisHelpful","R3T426M1723QTK","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The M75 ""Super Badass"" Distortion from MXR is a pedal rolled out quietly, but might have a lot of guitarists talking about it for a long time.  The name of this pedal is similar to the '78 Bad Ass Distortion, but whereas that pedal offered bright, crunchy rhythm tones best suited for classic rock, the M75's potential is far greater.First, it's worth noting that there's plenty of volume available on this pedal.  That's a shortcoming of many older distortion pedals, particularly those that offer higher gain.  Unity gain on this pedal was probably around 11:00 to 12:00 with most settings, which is exactly where you'd want it to be.The most pleasant surprise with this pedal might be what it does with the Distortion set at around 8:00 to 10:00 (turned way down).  Whereas most distortion pedals would be quiet and fizzy at that setting, the M75 behaves more like a clean boost or mild overdrive.  You could even simulate a Tubescreamer or other popular overdrives by adjusting the EQ.With the Distortion at 12:00, the result is a Marshall-like distortion with good saturation.  However, it seems to work well for lead guitar as well, as the higher notes are smooth and compressed.  Turn the Distortion up even more, and you'll get a bit of noise, but also a lot more gain if you want it.The 3-band EQ, and particularly the mids knob, are what make this pedal so easy to customize.  You can make it sound pretty mean by scooping out the mid range, or you make it punchier and aggressive by turning the mids up.  I was actually pretty happy with the settings all around 12:00 - it has a nice low end sound without being too overpowering.  If you have the volume down (or are playing with humbuckers), the sound can be a bit muffled on some settings, but that seems to open up quite a bit as you turn up the volume.  This pedal absolutely loves Strats, but the truth is that it was difficult to make it sound ""bad"" with any guitar, amp, or setting I tried.In terms of durability, the familiar build quality of the MXR pedals rings true here as well.  The casing is sturdy, if not terribly heavy.  The knobs are easy to reach, but firm enough that it would be hard to disturb them by accident with your foot.  The metal ""button"" switch works best if you're on a firm surface, but feels very reliable.The release price of this pedal is $99.99.  While that's not cheap enough to consider it a ""budget"" pedal, I would argue that you're actually getting a ton of value for that price.  I've tried $200 boutique pedals that weren't anything special, and were promptly returned.  This pedal is a definite keeper.UPDATE (10-28-2013) - Surprised to look at the date of this review and find that it was over 4 months ago.  I stand by all of the praise in my review.  I still go back and forth on overdrive pedals (Tubescreamers, OCD, Joyo Sweet Baby, OD-3), but the Super Badass is the unquestioned king of distortion pedals I've tried.  I even sold my MXR '78 for other equipment because this pedal was so much more versatile.  By now, almost everyone has noticed, but this is a great pedal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJJ26FRRORYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHIYQG6#wasThisHelpful","R3PJJ26FRRORYR","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually came across this album on Spotify and listened to it on a whim.  Even though I already own ""Conditions"" (2009) and ""The Temper Trap"" (2012), I had no idea this album existed until I got the chance to listen to it free, and now I will be buying it immediately.  (There's probably a lesson in there somewhere for the record companies, but I digress).""Acoustic Sessions"" is reminiscent of the 90's trend where heavy rock/alternative bands would do an ""Unplugged"" album with acoustic instruments.  In a roundabout sort of way, it sort of works with indie rock groups too, since there's a lot of electronica and post-production that goes into their music, but, fundamentally, most great songs can be boiled down to ""three chords and the truth"".""Acoustic Sessions"" surprised me by how much I liked the stripped-down version of these songs.  If there's one criticism I would have of their first two albums, it's that a lot of songs sounded kind of similar, almost as if they were in the same key and rolled into one another.  This album was a nice mixture of pieces from both albums, and they took on new life with the guitar and vocals isolated.  Actually, I hear a lot of similarities with The Antlers now (check out ""Hospice"" if you haven't already), which is a GOOD thing.I'm not always a fan of bands re-releasing old songs on EP, but this is actually a nice addition to the collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL6QCSP5EY88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUUQQ2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2BL6QCSP5EY88","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dexter occupies amongst adult dramas on television nowadays.  Often dismissed as too ""campy"" or ""nerdy"" by serious television critics, the show has been hiding in the relative anonymity of Showtime for seven seasons.  And, following an excellent Season 4 marked by John Lithgow's chilling performance and a stunning death in the final episode, even the diehard Comic-Con fans would admit that Seasons 5 and 6 were not all that strong.  Season 5 explored Dexter's insecurities about being a single father, only to more or less abandon that plot by bringing on a scantily-clad Aimee Garcia as Harrison's full-time babysitter and de-facto-mother.  Season 6 had some moments (and big payoff in the final scene), but the writing of Colin Hanks' character made him into a flimsy and ridiculous adversary.(SPOILERS follow this portion of the review - you shouldn't be reading here anyway if you don't want to be spoiled :)Season 7 opens where Season 6 closed - Deb has gone to the church to confess her real, not-so-brotherly love for Dexter, and instead walks in on him performing a ritualized murder.  I appreciated that they only spent one episode with Deb coming to the full realization that Dexter is a serial killer, and undoubtedly, the most prolific serial killer in American history.Jennifer Carpenter's performance as ""Deb"" has always been a high point of the show, but she OWNS this season.  Frankly, as much as we've seen Dexter grown and change over six years, there's only so much mileage to be had out of his redundant monologues.  The fact that Deb now knows what Dexter is, what she chooses to do with that information, and the way it destroys her emotionally is very intriguing new element to the show, and one that will undoubtedly continue into the 8th and final season.Yvonne Strahovski's role as ""Hannah McKay"" was another good addition to the show.  While her character was not always interesting, she provided the most interesting romantic partner for Dexter since Rita, and possibly ever.  It was also a role that got better as the season went on as we got to see more of Hannah's dark side, and her character became less one-dimensional.Some fans might lament the absence of a true ""Big Bad"" from start to finish, but the Ukrainian mob angle set the tone for much of the season, and it could be argued that Laguerta's investigation of Dexter and Deb made her the ""Big Bad"" for Season 7.  There were still the usual shortcuts in logic, and lazily constructed plotlines, but this is not a police procedural, a la ""The Wire"".  Season 7 was excellent, and opens the door for a fantastic finale to what I have always found to be a clever, thrilling, and innovative show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICN9SSX7YQ68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00915G6WQ#wasThisHelpful","RICN9SSX7YQ68","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am by no means a ""Daft Punk expert"" or a huge fan of electronic/dance music, but I've liked some of the Daft Punk's more recognizable singles over the years.  Fans of Daft Punk were disappointed by some of their recent work, but I'm a fan of this new album.  The length and format of many of the songs on the album might not lend well to single format, but there are a couple of tracks that standout, particularly ""Get Lucky"" and ""Lose Yourself to Dance"", which feature Pharrell Williams.  Julian Casablancas of The Strokes fame also appears on ""Instant Crush"".The word that comes to mind to describe this album is ""funky"".  I really liked the retro use of guitar, as opposed to constant electronica.  I've seen a few reviews referring to the album as ""disappointing"", but again, I didn't really have any expectations going into it.  There might also be a generational difference in how it's perceived - there are a lot of musical call-backs to the 60's and 70's, which was before many listeners (myself included) were even born.  But we've seen other groups use electronica to explore past eras of music (Cut Copy and the 1980's comes to mind), so it's a welcome effort.If you view it as fun experience from start to finish, as opposed to worrying about genres and radio singles, I think you'll really enjoy ""Random Access Memories"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3KD0Q0XCUGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C061I3K#wasThisHelpful","RZ3KD0Q0XCUGA","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Describing The National's music in words, or listening to it in 90-second preview clips, is an impossible task.  Apart from Matt Berninger's baritone delivery, they don't have a lot of musically distinguishing features.  Only when you take the time to appreciate the album as a whole do you recognize the subtle cleverness of the lyrics, the psalm-like use of repetition, and musical conveyance of the song's meaning.  ""Alligator"" (2005) and ""Boxer""(2007) were instant-classic indie rock albums about troubled relationships, life as a young professional, and the surprising isolation of life in a big city.  ""High Violet"" (2010) was a good album, but lacked the energy and focus of those earlier two masterpieces.""Trouble May Find Me"" is an excellent album from start to finish, and with time, and may end up as some of The National's best work (time will tell).Lyrically, the album is beautiful, dark, profound, and absurdly hilarious all at the same time:""I'm trying, but I'm gracelessDon't have the sunny side to face thisI am invisible and weightlessYou can't imagine how I hate this""(Graceless)""I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a parkYou didn't see me I was falling apartI was a television version of a person with a broken heart""(Pink Rabbits)If you've never heard The National, check out ""Alligator"" and ""Boxer"" immediately.

"I have to start by saying that 2010's Pickin' Up the Pieces is one of my favorite albums released this decade.  I grew up around a lot of Motown music and there's a vintage vibe to that album that other groups might have tried, but none as well as Michael and Noelle.  So, my 4* rating might be a bit deceiving, since I will probably listen to this album much more than other albums I would rate a 5*.Some people have complained that the album lost a lot of the vibe that was present in the debut album, but I felt there was enough there to make it a diverse and enjoyable experience.  ""Spark"", in my opinion, is the song that easily stands out as the most similar to the type of sound that created the original interest in the group.  ""4am"" is also a strong track, and Noelle is featured about as much on this album as the last one, which still probably isn't enough.It's baffling to me how some bands are punished for trying a new sound (Fitz), while other albums (like Vampire Weekend's 3rd album released today) are celebrated for it.  I think ""More than Just a Dream"" strikes a pretty good balance.  They remain an interesting group, even if they never may fully recapture the album of their first album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KO3GHW210IS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BF3AVPA#wasThisHelpful","R2KO3GHW210IS5","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's clear that Vampire Weekend wanted to go in a different direction with this album.  Many people will reward them for that, citing the ""evolve or die"" argument.  But if you were a fan of Vampire Weekend's first two albums (as I am) and excited for this new release (as I was), there's the potential for massive disappointment here.My primary source of disappointment (and the reason I decided to become the first 3* reviewer) is the total absence of notable guitar work on the album.  As a guitar player, I'm obviously biased, but I feel like Vampire Weekend had a few hallmarks to their sound that make them identifiable as a band.  One of those is the ""faux harpsichord"" progressions, which still appear on this album.  They also have some beautiful piano parts layered underneath Ezra's vocals.  But the guitar riffs - a variety of vintage, almost ""surf""-like undertones - are almost completely gone, and that was one of my favorite aspects of Vampire Weekend's music.  Take virtually any notable VW song (A-Punk, Oxford Comma, Holiday, Cousins, etc.), and there is heavy guitar work that makes up the identity of those songs.  (The beautiful piano work on ""Taxi Cab"" would be a notable exception to this rule).  That VW has chosen to virtually eliminate guitar from the formula and become more a piano/electronic band doesn't make them ""bad"", but takes away an important element of what made them great.As a secondary complaint, I would note that there's real lack of energy in this album.  It reminds me a lot of all the things wrong with U2's ""No Line on the Horizon"" - excellent musicianship, but ask yourself an important question: ""Had this been the FIRST album from this band, would anyone have noticed them through the crowd?"".  It's possible to make a ""darker"" album without compromising the energy and formula that made your band appealing in the first place.My view appears to be a minority opinion, but I thought the first two albums were 5* all the way.  I'm 31 and I didn't consider them to be ""immature"" records in any sense.  I will stick with the album to see if it ""grows"", but normally when you hope for an album to ""grow"" on you, you're basically waiting for it to become something it's not.There's an assumption out there that individual bands need to ""grow up"" with us and become more serious and contemplative with us, as we presumably are also doing with age.  I don't agree with that.  I think that notable bands and artists ""stand"" for something, and allow you to seek that out if that's a mood or sentiment you want to experience.  It's possible for a band to start as something and become something else.  U2 has been everything from a Christian band to an Electronic/Dance band.  But if you want ""something different"", nobody's putting a gun to your head and forcing you to play Vampire Weekend.  Summers in Cape Cod are nowhere to be found on ""Modern Vampires"", and I kind of miss it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9ST35ZS18F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB22GQM#wasThisHelpful","RQ9ST35ZS18F6","ADH0O8UVJOT10","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADH0O8UVJOT10?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case.  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments.  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case.I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch.  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly.  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top.  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps.  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine.

"The Behringer UCG102 device is an aging (yet affordable) piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the USB port of a computer.  This opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones.  For the budget player, it could be argued that a mere $32 investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilities.However, while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly, there are some significant problems here.  First and foremost, there is the problem of getting the device to work, getting the software to recognize it, and configuring it to run without significant ""latency"" (which is a delay effect where you don't hear a played note immediately when it's played, which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible).  The UCG102 runs on an ASIO driver.  They include an older version with the software, and you can snoop around online and find other options.  But that doesn't mean it will necessarily work with your software, or work well if it does.  For example, Audacity is a popular ""freeware"" program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer.  I've been told that Audacity doesn't work with ASIO drivers, and when I got it to record, the latency issues rendered it unusable.You do receive two other software options with the device.  The first is energyXT2, which I believe includes a license for the compact version.  In theory, this program should work like Audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects, in addition to drum and bass track loops.  However, I have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program.  I'm sure it CAN work, but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out, that's really not ideal for a budget product.The second item is a trial disc with Guitar Combos by Native Instruments.  So far, this has been the most impressive of the options offered.  You can demo three different amp simulators (Vox, Fender, and Marshall) and then enter a code to unlock one of the three.  I like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp, which allows you to dial in some realistic tones.  It's also the only program I've been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in (there are problems with recognizing mono vs. stereo).  I adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to 8 miliseconds, which is just into the range where I don't notice it as a problem.  Still, while the models sound good, I'm not sure how often I would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recording.Shortly after ordering this device, I discovered that my sound card has a blue ""line in"" audio jack on the back.  By running a simple 1/8"" to 1/4"" audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card, I can do direct recording, which is monitored through my computer speakers (no latency) and sounds great.  Even better, this method works through Audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks.  If the UCG102 worked as advertised, it would be a more convenient way of doing this, but I simply can't recommend it for most people.

"I have had C.S. Harris's 'Sebastian St. Cyr' historical mystery series on my to-read list off and on for several years. I have read five of the writer's earlier romances under the name Candace Proctor and enjoyed her style of writing. Still, I was hesitant to start this series about forbidden love and second chances during Regency times.And now I could kick myself.WHAT ANGELS FEAR was an interesting introduction to the seamy side of London in the early 1800s. Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, had returned home from the war after selling out ten months earlier. He appeared to have a death wish and was biding his time when a young prostitute was murdered. Too soon, he became aware that an unknown person had chose him as the fall guy.Except the villain did not realize that he picked the wrong man.Like so many first-books in a series, a good amount of the story was spent setting up introductions to various characters. Some people that I am sure will return in the following mystery-thrillers. And while I slowly read each chapter capturing names and their importance, I found myself tempted to peek at the end of the story. But I didn't.Mrs. Harris's PhD in European history, her time spent at archeology sites around the world and having travelled abroad, gave her an edge when writing WHAT ANGELS FEAR. I felt I was actually with St. Cyr when he was jumping over roofs while escaping the constable and his men. Or at his side while making his way at the Rag Fair to acquire clothes to disguise himself. Or listening to his young protégée in the cold, frosty air.The author dropped little info-nuggets about the political battle between the Tories and Whigs before Prinny was placed on the throne. Maneuvers, subterfuge and ploys were found everywhere. But the murders that took place were gruesome and graphic; something I could have read with less detail.The 'Who Murdered Whom And Why' question provided plenty slivers of friction. Sebastian's socially-impaired family, an unforgotten love and some governmental conspiracies dripped from the pages. Watch for the clues!~""When one lived a life that was, essentially, a lie, appearances were everything.~","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXC0Q38UG9T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451216695#wasThisHelpful","R1NXC0Q38UG9T2","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Velda Johnston wrote a number of mysteries with a clean secondary romance in the late 1960s and 1970s. Like THE PEOPLE ON THE HILL, many of them contained very dated material. I was actually surprised I didn't hear any of the characters mention the words, 'groovy', 'bell bottoms' or 'flower power'.The lingo was that outmoded.The mystery was tepid at best especially since the author revealed early on that the supposed hero was blatently involved in a murder. 'The People' were somehow engaged in the matter, too. The question that kept me in pursuit until the end was the big 'Why?'.Karen was written like many of the heroines of that era: alone, naive, and young and in love. David was smart, attractive and could easily bend others to his will. And then there was Bill Bailey. He was the intelligent outsider with just the right acquaintances to help him assist Karen. The actual romance was very low-key, it was practically nonexistent. The relative absence of cell phones, GPS and the Internet almost made this feel like a historical piece of fiction. The author did do a wonderful job writing an atmosphere that had an ominous presence and was slightly creepy; there was just enough doom and gloom for those of you that enjoy this type of genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OSBFO3Y4WEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0396062814#wasThisHelpful","R30OSBFO3Y4WEP","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this story at the 'math.cornell.edu' website for free.It began with the statement: May 7th - I love my garden.  Well, so do I.The story was first published in 1898 but the years soon melted away. Her memoir was loaded with those funny long sentences containing plenty of commas, semi-colons and dashes that were in fashion back then. It covered one year in the life of Elizabeth von Arnim. The moral to this story? Truth is often stranger than fiction.Elizabeth married a widower twice her age and referred to her first three children as the April baby, the May baby and the June baby. Her husband was called the Man Of Wrath. Elizabeth was considered by the villagers to be an eccentric because *gasp!* she could spend her day out of doors with a book. Apparently, during this era, reading was an occupation for men; for women it was a reprehensible waste of time. Shhh, don't tell anyone but I have been guilty of this.Like Elizabeth, when I am outside, my thoughts sometimes drift to my childhood. For her it was about daisies and daffodils and her eleven o'clock bread. Her father whom she passionately loved, her grumpy grandfather and her enchanted years between two and eighteen.In her garden she reminisced about happy frogs, owls having conversations and roses. In my garden you could find a murder of crows, a knot of toads and some gopher tortoises digging holes. With some beetles, crickets and spiders.I loved the author's first lesson on buying (too much) seed and trying to grow morning glories. The invention of cabbage salad and the superiority of the Teuton (her husband?) and 'the music he makes after eating his meal'. And her quick explanation of the dejected gardener who walked around with a spade in one hand and a revolver in the other. He went mad and was sent to an asylum. Fortunately no one was shot. Or buried.The utter randomness of Elizabeth's semi-autobiographical memoir may turn off some readers. She begins her tale in the present but regresses to the past roughly halfway through. She blends family and flowers, weather and food. Then she witnesses the treatment of women by their laboring husbands and was lectured by the Man Of Wrath on the acceptability of beating your wife. These women accept their beating with a simplicity worthy of all praise, and far from considering themselves insulted, admire the strength and energy of the man who can administer such eloquent rebukes. Further, the story goes on, with the politics, prejudices, vanities and weaknesses of the German people at the turn of the century. I am not sure what happened to that happy garden and when the diatribes became commonplace.Sadly, I don't have a housekeeper, handmaiden, workmen, painters, a gardener and his assistant, a cook, maids, nurse and someone to brush my hair in the evening but my garden is still a far-away corner in my kingdom of heaven.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3KDB1VW9HMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1438285493#wasThisHelpful","R3B3KDB1VW9HMO","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thoughts can be unhealthy when you assume you know the truth.~~~~~~Deliciously dangerous, Ruel MacLaren had but one goal: to become rich. He learned some valuable lessons in Australia, California and Africa before traveling to India. He knew Lady Luck was on his side; it was just a matter of time.With exquisite good looks, women loved his attention. No matter where his adventures took him, he never had a problem with the fairer sex. That is, until he met the practical and unassuming Jane Barnaby. Like him, she was a survivor.~~~~~~J A N E: A simple but not-commonly used name made up of four letters. In many ways her name matched her personality. She was strong, sensible and not afraid to say no when the need arose. Ruel was fascinated with her.~~~~~~Initially, Ruel came across as an unashamed but happy anti-hero. His older half-brother Ian, the Earl of Glenclaren, had finally found him after a long search. Now that their father was dead, he wanted Ruel to return home to Scotland but his brother's hardy response was the word NO.Opposites in both appearances and personalities, Ian understood that his brother was battling his own personal demons but he believed his beloved country manor would heal him. He had no intention of leaving until Ruel changed his mind. Ian would just bide his time.In the meantime, Ruel and Jane first met when they were locked in a room at a brothel. Even though Ruel would have loved for something physical to happen, he became aware very soon that Jane's thoughts were about escaping not only their prison but him. And the more often she said goodbye, the nearer he wanted to be with her.The chase was on.~~~~~~Ruel and Jane were deep, complex and wonderfully played. Their romance felt both gritty and strikingly sensual. Ruel was bewitched.The long and the short of this romance? It was 505 pages of not-so-large font. It covered several years with the (hated) misunderstanding. The chemistry was awesome at times, bordering on the erotic side. Ruel was scrumptious one moment and a cad later on. I had some issues with this.Jane? Why, Jane, why, is all I will say. Some reviewers mentioned this was a bodice-ripper. IMHO, it was not. Tension? Yes. A misunderstanding that caused unneeded angst?  Of course.  And all of those secondary characters with their secondary problems and their secondary solutions? Yes. Needless-to-say, there was a lot going on.~~~~~~For those of you that love exotic settings, some steaminess and can handle the length of the story, Iris Johansen's tale of soul-mates, **GOLD** and the island of Cinnidar was actually pretty good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWROAN141WTSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553299689#wasThisHelpful","RWROAN141WTSG","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe this is the 14th book in the Gaslight Mystery series that I have read. And the author still has my attention!An acquaintance of Sarah Brandt's father was found murdered at the hoity-toity Knickerbocker club. And who does Mr. Decker call on to try and solve the case? *Gasp!* Frank Malloy. For those of you that are unfamiliar with their relationship, suffice-to-say, they tolerate one another for the sake of Sarah. But I wouldn't be surprised to know that the room they are in drops several degrees when Malloy and Felix are together.Besides Frank, Sarah, Maeve, Catherine and Mrs. Ellsworth, we get to see Mrs. Decker once again. Her personality is evolving, continually, for the better. I loved the sly morsels and innocent looks she imparts when trying to 'assist' Sarah and Frank. The big difference this time around is Sarah's father is more involved with the plot and I loved it! We get a few glimpses of the very formal Felix Decker and the byplay between him and his wife. I think he was actually jealous of Frank's attention to his wife for one moment. :))Decker glanced at his wife.""No, I won't leave you two alone,"" she said. ""And you might as will let me stay. It will save you the trouble of telling me everything later.""Decker sighed, and Frank had to bite his lip to keep from grinning.As I mentioned in an earlier review, Ms. Thompson takes a look at the darker side of NYC in the late 1800s. The author takes you behind closed doors; it might be in a rich man's home or a slum-like tenement of New York. No subject is too tender for the author to cover. With MURDER ON FIFTH AVENUE I saw a turning point between Frank, Sarah and the Deckers, all for the better. There were even a few humorous moments not present in earlier stories.Just remember to read the books in order. Each story reveals important pieces of information that move all of the relationships along: not just Frank's and Sarah's. The continual change with Maeve and Catherine. The increasing importance of Mrs. Ellsworth. Mrs. Decker with her timely and educational visits to Sarah's home. And I loved when the author shared moments with Frank's son, Brian.I am even looking forward to seeing more of Felix Decker and the young Italian police officer, Gino Donatelli, Frank's intelligent protege. Like others, my only criticism is the oh-so-very-slow acceleration of Frank's and Sarah's romance. I wanted to see so much more before now!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ND7GEDJZC1G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255379#wasThisHelpful","R2ND7GEDJZC1G8","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sandra Brown is known for writing about alpha males: dark heroes with a crack in their facade. Men whom have secrets but try to pretend that nothing is wrong. FRICTION was one such story.Crawford Hunt, a Texas Ranger, had gone back to court to retrieve his parental rights for full-time custody of his young daughter, Georgia. He had voluntarily surrendered it several years earlier after his wife had died in an accident. They were dark days and he was the first to admit he was not a suitable father at the time but he went through the necessary counseling. He also provided the other requirements to make a comfortable dwelling for his child. He was ready to bring Georgia home.Judge Holly Spencer was presiding at court when Crawford petitioned her to remove his daughter's guardianship from his former in-laws. They were good people but their bias prohibited him from taking a permanent role with fatherhood.Before a decision could be made, chaos broke loose. A gunman had entered the courtroom shooting the bailiff and attempting to shoot the judge. Before he had time to think, Crawford's instinct kicked in and he ended up saving the adjudicator.Unintentionally, Crawford gets involved with Holly.There were plenty of the usual plot devices but that was to be expected when the entire story took place over just a few days. I knew what to expect of Crawford but I expected Holly to be smarter and stronger; after all, she was a judge. Lastly, if you can get past the thought that for 99.9999% of us this would never be a part of our reality, FRICTION was a good-hearted but somewhat mellow blend of romance and suspense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADO23P5AZQIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145558116X#wasThisHelpful","RADO23P5AZQIR","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"RETURN TO FOXDALE or Terra de Zorro, an ancient country estate in Spain, had all the makings of an entertaining modern-gothic romance. An beautiful young woman, a cynical Irishman attracted to her, an odd relationship with a vain mother that was used as a plot device and stolen art. First published in 1980, it has all the earmarks of an older contemporary romance with the exception of the foreboding atmosphere. Hence, the feel of a mysterious modern-gothic.Caroline Mesner’s childhood memories of a pleasant life at Foxdale with her Scottish father puttering in the garden were the foundation of her parents’ marriage. Vera Solane, an opera singer, loved her husband but needed the freedom to travel with little commitment. Somehow this relationship worked for the two of them. Unfortunately for the young Caroline, after her father died, she spent the next ten years with the Clarkes in London. With no word from her mother except periodic gift-giving, Caroline managed to lead a quiet but contented life.Then Vera suddenly needed her and Caroline returned to the elusive Foxdale.The upside to this story was the interesting ‘visit’ to Spain from long ago. It made me think that the author either lived there for awhile or had an extended vacation in the country. I enjoyed reading a romance with a different setting.Regrettably, it didn’t help with all the clichés. The mute driver, the slippery cliffs, sounds that only Caroline hears, the disappearing portraits, the odd attraction between Vera and her new husband and, of course, two men vying for Caroline’s love. Just who should she trust? I kept hoping it would get better. Eventually, everything was resolved with a much too-tidy ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JS7PE7VYQCHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373500661#wasThisHelpful","R1JS7PE7VYQCHG","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Uncle Simon, her ruthless guardian, intended on selling it even though he did not legally have the authority to do it. Kate made some verbal threats but was sent to live with her godparents in London.Shortly after her arrival, she attended a ball and was saved from a nefarious nobleman by the Black Devil himself, the Duke of Sommesby. From there on out, just accept the author's premise with her version of acceptable speech and manners during the Regency era.I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Enoch's ANGEL'S DEVIL but I had a hard time appreciating this story.

"Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to start this story on a Friday evening. That way you won't risk your job or school because of lack of sleep when you go in, if you go in, Monday morning.It is sometime in the not-so-near future in a galaxy far, far away. Deviana Morris or Devi as she prefers to be called, is a kick-a** heroine with plenty of moxie, just enough foibles and a smidge of deviation that attracts her to danger in hordes.And let's not even talk about her body armor.Ok, let's talk about it.Tight yet conforming with self-cleaning interlocking pieces that fit over her body like a shell. She even has a name for it: the Lady Gray because of its shimmery color. It adds six inches to her 5'6"" height and 150 pounds to her weight. But she is in awesome physical condition so she has no problem with jumps, punches and kicks. Now add her state-of-the-art helmet that allows her to see around herself in a 360 degree circle and Sasha, her anti-armor pistol, with Mia, her plasma shotgun, and what have you got? One lean, mean, fighting machine. Oh, and don't forget Phoebe.Her goal? To skip the unnecessary years it would take to become a member of the Home Guard. She wants to become a Devastator; one of the super elite who work directly for the Sacred King: the Baddest of the Bad. And all she has to do is spend one year as security detail on the ship, The Glorious Fool.One measly year.I thoroughly enjoyed this riveting sci-fi adventure with all of its eclectic characters. The best way to sum it up is in the author's very own words:""One summer day in 2011, I decided I wanted to read an action-packed space romance.

"""Enter, sir; you are the first to arrive...""Initially mistaking the building for a tavern, a stranger was invited in from the cold. It was 1905 and the gentleman was welcomed; supper was to be served at nine. The young man, Hugh Austin, cheerfully observed the furniture, a painting and various knick knacks temporarily forgetting his hunger.Some others arrived until he witnessed and was enamored by a beautiful young woman, Eunice Westonhaugh. She appeared to be carrying a package. Before long, he learned that a will was to be read by Mr. Smeads, the lawyer. The doors to the rambling mansion were closed and locked with latecomers shouting to be let in.They weren't.The stranger learned that because he had not been invited, he was shuffled off to another area of the home. Though he could not see everyone he still could hear what was said. To inherit, each person had to be honest, righteous and lead stainless lives. He heard the young lady say she had ""sinned"" -her 'package' was an infant- and told to leave.The entire short story was told in four parts: An Open Door, With My Ear To The Wainscoting, A Life Drama and The Final Shock. The lesson learned was ""shelter does not always mean refuge"".It reminded me, somewhat, of an old Agatha Christie movie, 'Ten Little Indians'. The gothic-like eerie home, darkness, cold, and innocence vs evil. At ninety one pages, it can be easily read in one sitting.

"Eighteen years ago, Maya Vega gave birth to a baby boy but she was told he was stillborn. Her extended family forced her to leave Columbia. Even though she was so young, she had never forgotten what happened to her.Respectable, smart Maya Velaquez was being primed to run for a local judgeship in her now-home of Texas. Before the day was over she received an unexpected visitor, Shepard Reyes, brother of the deceased Renaldo Reyes who was her son's father. He wanted to know if she was aware her son might be alive.Bitter anger surfaced on both sides with questions but, still, they parted; they were left with the uncertain feeling that things were not resolved. Those unforgotten memories and a photo would soon change Maya's life. She headed back to Columbia to find out the truth.I had a difficult time connecting with all of the characters. Shepard was 45 years old and had been an inquisitive and active family member but had never resolved this puzzle. He had preconceived notions of Maya; he judged her without knowing anything about her situation and I had issues with this. I wanted more suspense and fluency with the plot. Because of this and some minor editing issues I can't give the story more than three stars for 'okay'.If you are looking for a better romance with the 'jungle love' theme try Theresa Weir's 'Amazon Lily', Dana Marton's 'Camouflage Heart', Glenna McReynolds' 'River Of Eden', or Linda Howard's 'Heart Of Fire'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q97J0MI51F0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373711492#wasThisHelpful","R1Q97J0MI51F0O","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To sum up GARDEN SPELLS with a sentence from the story: ""You are who you are, whether you like it or not, so why not like it?""This whimsical women's fiction has a little of everything. Relationships with insecurities, the character-driven townspeople and some homespun magic. It is about an apple tree that blooms in the winter and throws apples when it feels like it. An elderly woman that gifts everyday items to various townspeople for a purpose: an explanation that will come to the receiver some day. A man searching for answers as to why his lover no longer comes home at night. And it is about growing plants with their healing properties.It is about the effects of gossip, the love of a sweet man and why children are sometimes more mature than adults. It contains more than one dysfunctional family, sisters learning to share their secrets and the importance of being a good mother.When I opened this book I felt as though I had tumbled into the small-knit community of Bascum, NC. I would have been friends with Claire Waverley, visited with Evanelle, babysat Bay and snubbed Arielle Clark. I would have listened to Fred, had Sydney cut my hair and had a serious sit-down with Tyler and Henry. And I think I would have been welcomed as their new neighbor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHR3KNTJA6XCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553805487#wasThisHelpful","RHR3KNTJA6XCA","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It was the best night of her life.""Socially awkward but super-smart 'Liz' was determined to break out of her mold. With a fake ID, a short red dress, and a wild haircut she hooked up with her new friend, Julie, before entering Warehouse 12. She intended to dance, have fun and just plain enjoy herself: everything her rigid mother would not permit her to do.Unfortunately, before the night was over, her life would change. Forever.At the age of 16-almost-17, Elizabeth Fitch observed a couple of people murdered and one of them was a member of the Russian Mafia. On the run, she became a witness for the American government.  You can't help but love the fragile but respectable Liz.  Because of what happened, she was willing to testify and put her life at risk.Then something unexpected happened.Twelve years later, police chief Brooks Gleason met Abigail Lowery and her mammoth dog, Bert, for the first time. Both attracted and curious, he was well aware that something was just not quite right about this intensely quiet woman. Though Brooks could turn serious on a moment's notice, he also could be light and silly if required. And acting as the good Southern boy man that he was, he told his mama about their introduction.You can't help but love his mother, and free spirit, Sunny O'Hara. She immediately figured out how alone Abigail must be and decided to do something about it. And who else but Sunny would compare the color of Abigail's dog's eyes to her son's?Some reviewers had issues with Abigail's 'female Spock of Star Trek' personality but I had no problem.  She was raised under abnormal circumstances.  I liked that her character was quirky and I loved that Brooks accepted and dealt with 'her baggage'.I enjoyed the community of Bickford, Arkansas: the innkeeper who was running for mayor, the old family with money and trouble, the waitress, the town drunk and Brook's receptionist.  People with manners using 'sir' and ma'am'. I thought her characters' idioms were spot-on. Their expression and dialect matched what you would hear in today's old South including referring to anyone north of the Mason-Dixon line as a Yankee.I loved the chemistry between Brooks and Abigail/Elizabeth/Liz. I loved that Liz had anxiety issues and yet she was someone Brooks never wanted on his bad side. They played off each other but in a good way. It was exciting*steamy*interesting*believable. It reminded me of a puzzle with all the pieces fitting tightly together by the time you were finished. I just can't say enough good things about this story.  THE WITNESS is why I love reading romances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QHWOB8Y6KW6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159126#wasThisHelpful","R3QHWOB8Y6KW6V","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KISS ME WHILE I SLEEP was the third book in the 'CIA's Spies' series but was a mediocre 'ending'. Like some of Ms. Howard's other stories, there was a slow build-up. Necessary information, an explanation of Lily Mansfield's past and the introduction of a new setting.  I had to read almost half the book before the hero and another assassin, Lucas Swain, were introduced.Lily Mansfield was a contracted agent (assassin/killer) with the CIA. She was suppose to follow certain rules. If you broke the rules, you were terminated; it was that simple.She broke the rules.Lucas Swain was sent to put a stop to the damage. He had a method to finishing the job or so he thought. And here is where I had a problem with the story: two assassins with years of being told when and whom to kill and yet they came across as very human. And the immediate chemistry and semi-trust they formed? For some reason I just didn't buy into the premise.The story was nice. It was pleasant but things just went a little too smoothly. I didn't feel the rush or sparks that a good romantic suspense story should have. The upside? I learned more of Frank Vinay's background; he was a character in the first and second books in this series. But if I needed to recommend this story to complete the 'CIA's Spies', I would say it wasn't necessary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5KTA5XT8ZKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345453441#wasThisHelpful","RK5KTA5XT8ZKB","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me just say that Linda Howard knows how to tease the reader before pulling her/him in.  KILL AND TELL begins, with what appears to be, a demented veteran bent on killing someone.  Instead, he is killed.Dexter Whitlaw was at one time a young husband and father.  Then he joined the Vietnam war and became a sniper; he was good at it, but something happened.  Years passed and his wife remained faithful but Dexter rarely returned home.  When he does he is not the same man.Karen Whitlaw, a nurse, had been notified by the New Orleans police department that her father had died.  She had recently lost her mother and the pain was still constant.  What little memories she had of this man were, at best, bittersweet.  But she knows her mother would want her to claim his body so she left Ohio for the south.Before long, she has entered into a world of intrigue and danger unlike she has ever known.  Ms. Howard's first story in the 'CIA's Spies' series builds slowly with the backdrop: a not-so-innocent package, paid assassins and politics.  Several characters are introduced  that will continue on in ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN.The suspense remained steady and there was plenty of action.  The downside was that it took awhile for our hero, detective Marc Chastain, to surface but when he does: watch out!  An uber-alpha male, he was not afraid to take on anyone and everyone to keep Karen safe.  The ongoing question was just who could Marc and Karen trust?There was some dated material but the story never suffered from it.  The chemistry was good and somewhat edgy; Marc had a caveman mentality.  At times, I was just shaking my head.If you enjoyed the earlier-written Kell Sabin series or any of her older books, you should enjoy this group of stories.  This was just what I needed after recently reading some duds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W69DC1B0B42N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743475488#wasThisHelpful","R1W69DC1B0B42N","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the fourth space opera that I have read by Linnea Sinclair. She is known by her fans for following a formula in most, if not all, of her books: alpha male, strong smart heroine and at least part of the setting is held in space. Like in most sci-fi stories there is a familiar jargon unique to the plot that the reader must learn. Tel-Tal, biocybe, U-Cee, Psy-Serv, Novalis, characters with the last name of Kel-_, Galaxus, Definator and so on. And it took me roughly a third of the story to become comfortable with all of this space lingo.GAMES OF COMMAND was first and foremost an action adventure with a side of suspense and two moderate romances. The primary characters, Admiral Branden Kel-Paten and Captain Tasha Sebastian AKA Lady Sass, are old enemies from the days before the Triad formed a peace agreement. The title refers to the competition and one-upmanship between these two soldiers. Their 'love story' takes a long time to come into play. Poor Kel-Paten.At the same time Chief Medical Officer and empath Eden Fynn forms an alliance with renegade soldier and captive Jace Serafino. Who was also telepathic and had a dual personality. What a guy!Oh, and did I mention that Kel-Paten was humanoid but primarily made from cybernetic parts? Referred to as the Tin Soldier, he had pined for Tasha for years without her being aware of his true feelings. His 'innocence' and a damaged past formed his personality. He lacked the social skills that others were taught in childhood. He was expected to perform as an effective machine. Reading about Kel-Paten was the reason I finished this book.Then there were the kitty-like 'furzels', Tank and Reilly, whom refer to Tasha and Eden as their mothers. Protection was imperative. And lurking in the background was something invisible and nasty.My problem, as with all of Ms. Sinclair's stories, was the length. GAMES OF COMMAND is 525 pages and honestly, I thought the gist of the plot could be delivered in under 350. It was just way too long. Then I found out that ""the characters and some scenes in this novel were originally part of the book COMMAND PERFORMANCE and several short stories that were part of the Alliance Command series"". So I am going to put the blame on the editor of her publishing firm. If they did a better job, I would have rated it higher.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2DX3TRPH176/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553589636#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2DX3TRPH176","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allison Scott had all she could do trying to establish her name as a photographer in the greater Minneapolis area. Jason, her previous boyfriend and one-time model, left her high and dry after stealing her portfolio of his photos. Not to mention her heart. She was determined to get on with her life sans handsome men. That was, until Rick Lang entered the picture (no pun intended!).Allison had to complete the cover art for an upcoming book and she was on a deadline with very little money. Her friend and business-owner of North Star Agency, Mattie, recommended Rick along with several others. The moment Allison saw his black and white photo, she knew he would be perfect for this job.As different from Jason as night was to day, Rick was down-to-earth, unpretentious and just plain nice. He didn't put on any airs; what you see was what you got. Allison, on the other hand, was insecure and came across as childish. I found her unlikable.I read some of LaVyrle Spencer's historical romances years ago and I enjoyed them. FORSAKING ALL OTHERS was her first contemporary romance and was initially issued in 1982 as a Second Chance At Love publication.  It was her fourth book and you could tell that she was very much still working on her craft.  There might have been an enjoyable story in there trying to get out but there was little character development and the heroine's continued vacillation turned me off.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCBZVK5QS83V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786234563#wasThisHelpful","R1DCBZVK5QS83V","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I had gone through a nightmare cold/flu season in 2013.  We are both healthy individuals and practice good hygiene but we still seemed to catch everything.  Both of us even had a flu shot!  The only thing I considered was that our resistence was low.  On top of it, what others were getting over in a few weeks, it took us months; this included several visits to the doctor.In early 2014, I saw an article by the pharmacist Suzy Cohen praising this product.  She wrote that the kill rate of FluNada was tested by 2 independent labs and found to be 99.9% effective.  I decided to look for it locally and found it at a Winn Dixie store.  I bought two bottles, one for each of us.  Every time our throats started to 'tickle', we felt head congestion coming on or either us began to cough I brought out the Flunada.  Within 24 hours whatever symptoms either of us had, they went away.I even told our adult kids about Flunada and the success we have had.  Two of them are in the healthcare field but none of them have tried it. Guess who was sick last year and in 2015?  Hint, it was not us.As others have stated, it burns for about 30 seconds when you first spray it in your mouth and nose.  We can live with that.  As far as being addictive as one reviewer stated, I know of no such problem.We follow the directions to the letter.  I always make sure the bottle is clean after use before I store it.  We have not had one cold or bout with flu since buying Flunada.  I swear by this product now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZSQ04E72SO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CCVWHW#wasThisHelpful","R3QZSQ04E72SO2","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Closer to 4.5 starsFrom the opening, the story grabbed me from the start. It was told in first person by a young mother: ""We called him the Professor. And he called my son Root, because, he said, the flat top of his head reminded him of the square root sign."" It was unusual in that all of the main characters were without proper names: the Housekeeper, the Professor, Root and the Widow.It was a beautiful, interesting story that captured every moment; I soon learned that time was a very precious commodity. It focused on the fascinating and complex relationships between vastly different members of one household.The Housekeeper was a young single mother with a latchkey ten-year-old son. The Professor had a head injury that allowed him only eighty minutes in the present time before everything started over. At one time, he had been a brilliant 64 year-old mathematics professor at Cambridge. Her son, 'Root', was the glue within this odd family. And the introduction of baseball became a common backdrop.Just imagine the extreme difficulty it must have been for everyone? Instead, the three formed some very special friendships. And the romance? Because it was very much a love story but not what I would normally consider. The romance was a love of numerals: the ability to look at numbers and glimpse at ""the answers in God's notebook"". It taught me that pauses, instants and spells could be explained with math and it showed me that nothing was trivial.I would have loved to have learned more about the Housekeeper's and the Professor's past. The author shared a few flashes of days gone by. They were brief and it left me with questions; it was just enough to hook me in but I wanted to know more.The story had a calming influence while I read it. I found myself trying to tackle the mathematical problems the Professor gave to the Housekeeper and her son. And though I am not a big fan of the sport, I enjoyed reading about their love of baseball. THE HOUSEKEEPER AND THE PROFESSOR was a refreshing, original and compassionate story that I would encourage everyone to try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3SBNWCSC446/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312427808#wasThisHelpful","R1T3SBNWCSC446","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsCLEAN AS A WHISTLE takes poetry to the next level. And it is another reason to never overlook old books. The scenery is drawn in muted browns and the author's love of natural history pours over each page. But the amusement of the story is in its simple goofiness.

"How could you not like a hero whose first name was Blue?Dr. Laurence 'Blue' Reynard ""with a bourbon voice, smoky and gold and dangerous.""  He was a charmer and a ladies' man.  He owned a ""rat-dog"" named Sasha and an elderly cat on death's door called Piwacket.  He was a guy that seriously grew and studied orchids and was a lover of old music.  His speech was loaded with ""blurred Southern vowels"".After corresponding with him in a blues music newsgroup on the Internet, biographer Ellie Connor took up Dr. Reynard's offer of a cottage on his property in Pine Bend, Texas.  She was a music historian.  She could research and write her story on native blues singer Mabel Beauvais: a rising star whom mysteriously vanished one day long ago.  Ellie was expecting someone much older than the devilishly handsome Blue.  And Blue found himself attracted to her.""Ellie rolled down the window, letting in the thick midday air.  Wind blew her hair back from her serious, intent face.  Blue imagined she was imprinting details, and as if to give that theory credence, she inhaled deeply, lifting her nose like a dog scenting the air.  He smiled.""Besides writing Mabel's narrative, Ellie had another puzzle to solve.  Tied with this land, she hoped to locate whom her father was.  Her mother was a product of the late 1960's hippie movement.  She had spent a long summer in Pine Bend, then returned home to western Louisiana: unwed and pregnant.  After leaving Ellie with her mother, she took off again.  She died from an overdose of drugs leaving Ellie to often wonder what her father's name was and could he still be alive?IN THE MIDNIGHT RAIN was a breathless romance between two unlikely characters.  It contained plenty of secrets packed with moments of angst.  The townspeople pushed the story along with sultry nights, haunting music and old-fashioned gossip.  In a few ways, it eerily reminded me of a modern-day gothic.Like molasses, I read Blue's and Ellie's story slowly. The author's strength was found in her crisp wordplay; the sentences flowed with spot-on descriptive words.  I sunk into the mystery of this enchanting story and didn't want to climb out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XXIDH4STXNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061030120#wasThisHelpful","R10XXIDH4STXNL","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miss Clara Christopher was a rolling stone.  Orphaned ten years earlier and poor as a church mouse, she charted her life amongst relatives and friends.  Clara visited only those people whom needed her. At two and twenty, she felt she had roughly three years left before she would have to find work: perhaps, as a paid companion.At present, she was temporarily residing at the Lucker residence: Branlea.  Her cousin, Baron Oglethorpe, was marrying Lady Prissie Lucker and Clara was helping prepare for the wedding.Two years earlier she had met one of Prissie's relatives, Mr. Ben Allingcote, at a house party.  There was an instant attraction; they had formed a flirtation.  Or so Clara had thought, for the night ended abruptly.  Later on, Clara found out Ben's father had died and he was made the new Lord Allingcote.Now she had found out he was to attend the wedding ceremony but with another young woman, Miss Nel Muldoon.  Young, pretty Nel whom adored attention. Precocious, flippant Nel whose fits and starts were the bane of Ben's existance.Little did Clara know the various hoops Lord Allingcote had jumped through since their unexpected separation from two years before.  She was kept in a state of confusion for a good portion of the story while Ben was on a mission.WINTER WEDDING was a gentle romance. It started out slowly but like a fine wine, it got better with age.  I enjoyed the witty dialog and clever nuances that are not often found in traditional regencies.  Just don't overlook the hidden gems of conversation between these two people.  Jealousy rears its head in the most unlikely places but it will put a smile on your face. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLGNXAOE0A2FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449217868#wasThisHelpful","RLGNXAOE0A2FU","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read in December, 2014""The danger lies in keeping secrets.""When I first started IN CONFIDENCE I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the story. I was looking for a good contemporary romantic suspense but I had never read anything by this author. It began with the prologue set five years before the remainder of the story: Cameron Ford, a true crimes writer had lost his teenage son to suicide. Divorced for awhile, he lived in New York while his ex-wife and son lived in Texas. When he arrived at the funeral he wanted answers and, in a nutshell, blasted his son's high school guidance counselor. Rachel Forrester should have known!Cam had settled in Rose Hill, Texas and five years went by when he witnessed his elderly neighbor pass out on her lawn. Long-story-short, the lady had a medical condition and was Rachel's mother. Rachel was now in the middle of a divorce from her lowlife adulterous husband. Before long, she and her children moved in with her mother.A very slow-paced romance built between these two unlikely people and I had no problem with that. At the same time, Rachel's son Nick was juggling high school and playing sports: the same thing Cam's son had done before he killed himself. Cam fought a war with his memories.This was a long story at 443 pages. When I read a suspenseful book I want to feel a rush and a fair amount of intenseness. I find it helps to keep the plot flowing at a rapid pace. At times, I found it lacking in the storyline. I knocked off one star because the author could have easily edited out, at minimum, about 100 pages. There was just too much unnecessary filler.The positives? I enjoyed seeing Cam's grumpy character get past his deep distrust of women and, in particular, Rachel. Once they acknowledged themselves as allies, their burgeoning romance was actually sweet. Especially the way Cam treated the sensitive Rachel; her husband had certainly done a number on her. Also, writing teens into a conspiracy can be tricky but I thought Ms. Young did a good job. And though I may have initially steered away from the very dark storyline, I found myself invested too far; the mild suspense was good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PL6CJX6RGM3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778320243#wasThisHelpful","R2PL6CJX6RGM3D","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alistair Munro, the Duke of Bridgwater, was bored with his life. All of his friends, along with his sisters and brother, had married in recent years and had children. At thirty-four years of age, he had his title, wealth and possessions but little else.He was returning to London after being entertained by those same friends when he saw a young woman walking on the side of the road. Though her clothes were very plain, THE PLUMED BONNET she wore was garish. Because of the disinterest he was feeling, he had his coachmen stop and he offered her a ride.Miss Stephanie Gray knew it was wrong. But she had little money and was hungry. She could not afford to stay at an inn and she was very tired. She had nervously slept last night for only a few minutes at a time on the side of the road. So she accepted the gentleman's offer to take her to the next village.When they first met, little did Bridgwater and Miss Gray know how their lives would come together. He was entertained while he listened to her talk. After his initial kindness, he thought she had formed a ruse and was going to offer her his protection as his mistress. But she proved him to be out of line and so, instead, he asked her to become his wife.Miss Gray knew that it was wrong but circumstances forced her to accept his offer. The newness of their relationship, the gap in how they were raised and what each was expected to bring to the marriage caused issues with communication. At times it was heart wrenching. The weeks before the wedding were filled with angst and minor misunderstandings. The time afterward was bittersweet. Alistair wanted, no, needed Stephanie to love him but he had never been taught how to show affection. How to reveal his feelings. For Stephanie's sake, he was willing to learn. But was it too late?#1. The Ideal Wife#2. A Precious Jewel#3. Dark Angel#4. Lord Carew's Bride. **My Personal Favorite So Far**#5. A Famous Heroine#6. The Plumed Bonnet#7.

"THE FAMOUS HEROINE was the fifth romance in the Stapleton-Downes series and was Lord Francis Kneller's story. At the beginning, Kneller was still having a hard time getting over his one true love, Samantha, from LORD CAREW'S BRIDE. He had proposed to her numerous times but she had always turned him down even though she dearly loved him. As. A. Friend. Instead, she happily married landscaper-extraordinaire Lord Carew.Kneller had returned to London and had been approached by the Duke of Bridgwater, another secondary character from LC'sB. He wanted Kneller to partner Miss Cora Downes on her first dance at a ball that all of them were to attend. The Duke's mother was sponsoring the young woman; she had saved her great-nephew's life. Cora, extremely rich but a tradesman's daughter, had become the lady's protégée. Her Grace was determined to find Cora a husband.Cora was Amazonian in height with large feet, attractive but not beautiful and had a habit of saying and doing things that, for lack of a better word, was non-plussed. Kneller was fascinated by Cora's common sense, her laughter and easy-going personality. Still somewhat depressed over Samantha, when he was in Miss Downes' presence his moodiness cleared.In turn, Cora had never met anyone like Lord Francis. Simply put, Kneller loved color in his wardrobe. The ton kept a careful eye on what he wore and he was emulated. The best words to describe him would be a clotheshorse, fashion plate, and a macaroni: a dandy. But not in the way you would typically think. He was also very much a man: he practiced at Gentleman Jackson's gym and had several mistresses in past years. Of course Cora did not know any of this; she innocently thought of protecting him.As I have said in some of my other reviews with this series, I highly recommend you read the books in order of sequence. Various characters are introduced and I believe most everyone would enjoy the stories if they are read in order. THE FAMOUS HEROINE was a tale of opposite's attract. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing these two good people suffer through quirky moments and eventually surrender to love.#1. The Ideal Wife#2. A Precious Jewel#3.  Dark Angel#4.

"When Blanche Amberley first met Sir Edmund Brandon it was loathe-at-first-sight.  Sir Edmund had bought the Amberley family estate when her father had capitulated to dire financial issues.  Somewhat unfairly, Blanche considered Brandon the enemy.Sir Edmund was a wounded soldier and had been searching for peace in his life.  He had recently considered marriage and was seeing Lady Hetherington.  She was lovely to look at but had a nasty and vicious temperament.  Up to this point, she had done a wonderful job of keeping it under cover.Blanche was also considering marriage but to the local banker's son.  Antony Mortimer was good-looking and a smooth talker but I sensed he was a shady character.  Blanche was initially unaware of his many deals that were under the table.This traditional regency had a fair amount of suspense.  Blanche and Edmund went full-circle with their feelings.  When push came to shove, Edmund was both judicious and fair.  Deprived of his assistance, Blanche would have been up the creek without a paddle.A CHRISTMAS COURTSHIP was a clean romance that shared a villain and a villainess.  These nasty reprobates did a decent job causing chaotic disorder to the Amberley household.  With a brother on the run, the military giving chase and various characters with no redeeming qualities, this historical fiction had something for everyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IY5LMRTYIEKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451167929#wasThisHelpful","R1IY5LMRTYIEKW","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'TWAS THE NIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS exemplified the emotionally tortured hero. Physically abandoned at the age of eight, Pierce Waverly tried to understand why his parents no longer loved him. Fast forward twenty-five years later and he was now the Earl of Devonmont. His father had died two years before and his mother had been sending him weekly letters since his father's funeral. All of which had gone unread into a box. Now he was informed by his mother's companion, Mrs. Camilla Stuart, that Lady Devonmont was gravely ill; he decided to visit with her one last time.The story was tagged as part of two separate series but I had no problem with this as a read-alone. Several secondary characters found in other stories played only a minor part. The romance was inspired by the real poem 'Twas The Night Before Christmas originally published in 1823. And, though listed by others as a Regency or Victorian romance, it actually fell between both eras: 1826.It was heart-wrenching when Pierce dwelled on his boyhood. You understood to some extent why he behaved the way he did. His self-esteem had been shattered. At the same time, I felt like I was reading a historical romance with contemporary overtones.Camilla Stuart was written as a strong and outspoken heroine. Pierce thrived on her unusual personality. If you don't take this romance too seriously and can get past Pierce's issues, it is a pleasant diversion for a cold afternoon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6A5DW0KYLR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476708223#wasThisHelpful","R2J6A5DW0KYLR3","A2QA5L9WUYVATT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QA5L9WUYVATT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a little on the rough side as far as story and illustrations are concerned, the story, although a continuing set of stories that are somewhat connected  and therfor difficult to know who they are and their personalities, I think the author takes a little too much for granted as far as the reader knowing the series. I believe, and its only me, that each book describes every character to some extent even a small bit and then tell the current story it would be clearer, at lest to me. This book states these are stories 28-30, most readers know nothing of 1-27. I know authors,especially authors looking to get started need encouragement because the book is their ""baby"".

"This I think is one of the coolest ideas that I have come across, this LED headlight. It's not something I would want to wear around the neighborhood [unless the power was off, which would make this very handy. This was sent to me in exchange to check and write a review for Amazon. I would never have thought to buy it for myself but once it came all of a sudden I had a lot of ideas of how to use it. The first thing I did was turn off the lights in the bedroom so as not to disturb anyone else and this is the perfect comfortable private reading light. We live in a home with no basement so the pipes are right under the house, I tried using a regular flashlight but I couldn't use my tools and hold the flashlight at the same time and this was just right, infact its just right for anything where you need light and both hands. The lamp is about an inch around and light, it has two brightness levels and a third that flashes, the button is easily accesible to control it.. It uses 3 AAA batteries [not included] and the LED lamp is stated by the manufacturer to work 100,000 hours. We've used it for night fishing and getting back to the cabin while carrying all our equipment. When I really thought about it this inexpensive product is really a smart inexpensive buy. I wouldn't have bought it for myself but I'm really glad I've got it and I would most definately buy it now. Riding a bicycle at dark would also make this perfect, lots of uses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W3AND41XZWSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSHHTNG#wasThisHelpful","R3W3AND41XZWSY","A2RMIA6EPNE1NG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RMIA6EPNE1NG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm sorry but this particular paint is terrible, it has nothing to do with the colors, they are bright and fun to play with. The problem is this kids paint does not come out of a lot of clothing, any white cotton forget it you'll never get it out, colored clothes on the other hand will mostly come out if it's washed 2-3 times before drying it. Maybe we were wrong but we were under the assumption based on the web page description that the paint came out. You may want to have the child wear a paint shirt that covers their clothes.Also be very very careful of your furniture, use it at a playtable, we dumbly did not at first and the blue and red paint are very difficult to rub out of expensive wood furniture.

"In this country where almost all toys are geared toward children adult accessories for sexual fun is ignored and not talked about very much, but there are millions of adult items like this sold around the world. One of the problems with buying these especially online is that a person has no idea of the quality,what they are made of,how to clean them or lubricating by people that are not embarrased to review them to review them.This item is a butterfly vibrator made of silicone, these are the most popular of all adult items according to the 2 major adult products, runs on 2 AAA batteries. This is not cheaply made but very dependable, it has a variety of intensity for a womans g-spot and clitoral stimulation. This was sent to us in exchange for a review that is truthful and informative. If using lubricant check to see if it can be safely used on silicone because some can't and can ruin it.

"We travel with our dogs to shows in different parts of the country. We a small suv and the grooming table,and  crate for taking into the show area,all of these foldup and we need everything the dogs use to fold up. Bringing 2 large stainless steel bowls take up more room. We were sent this bowl in exchange for  reviewing right before the golden retriever show in Cleveland. The bowl is about one inch tall when folded down and when extended it will hold 5 cups of food or water, there is a metal clasp that will hook to  your crate at showtime or anytime you need it to, the material used is food grade silicone and actually can be washed in the dishwasher. When we take both dogs in the car along with their stuff, and our luggage and a 4 yr. old we're packed to the roof.

"Most body builders know that powders work much quicker than tablets, usually with larger doses and gets into the blood stream quicker, no soy binders, olive oil etc.Nitric Oxides role is to relax or dilate blood vessals so blood flows easier through your system and along with it oxygen. This enhanced oxygenated blood supply is where the muscles respond to. There really isn't anything as important to building muscle, whether a body builder or someone trying to keep muscle tone, this is it. Nitric Oxide works throughout your whole body from your brain to your sex organs and enhances blood flow all over. That little blue pill you may have been taking is based on delivering nitric oxide to the male to enhance sex. The same nitric oxide loaded into this powder. I've tried probably 15-20 brands,always tablets, and decided to give this a try. This is far superior than anything I have taken and its helped me and I believe it will help you.

"Very nice quality crosses black for man and rose gold for the woman, they are hypoallergenic, stainlesss titanium tungsten steel and will not rust. For me this is more than just jewelry but a sign of my Christianity which I am proud to display, and the one I had just came apart. The chain is of medium width and strength. The womens cross itself is slightly smaller than th mans. The reason I did not give it a five star rating is because the womens chain is very short, too short for my wife because it would ;look like a choker, which she doesn't want.

"Being a groomer of dogs, double coated large dogs these are very good at getting the dead fur from deep down inside the coat. This one is comfortable to hold and make grooming easier. The fur you get off is fur that doesn't end up on your clothes or furniture and I really believe your dog, or cat enjoy being groomed, maybe not at the time your doing it but the way they feel when your done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZTP7TXNMZ8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MM2XGGE#wasThisHelpful","RZZTP7TXNMZ8Y","A2RMIA6EPNE1NG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RMIA6EPNE1NG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a groomer and former shower of dogs at AKC pet shows I was sent this deshedding tool to check over and review in exchange for an honest review, and here it is. This is a 50 millimeter comb made for a smaller to medium size single or double coated dog, it has a detachable replacement head, it is comfortable to hold and easy to run through your favorite animals hair. For the price they charge right now, this is a deal, animals really need that dead ur off of them, they don't like the extra heat and possible soars that can occur with matting and poor grooming cause. Its a small investment to keep your pet from shedding so badly and it helps keep their coats looking nice and shiny between baths. As far as bats, right after the animal is dried and the fur hasn't had as much time to mat back up run the comb through the fur and the next day when their fur has had a time to fully dry another good brushing is called for because thats when the dead hair is most likely to come off the easiest. Small investment for solving kind of a big problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3JQN175ZIG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9VJWGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1K3JQN175ZIG8","A2RMIA6EPNE1NG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RMIA6EPNE1NG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another quality deshedding brush for any size dog and has detchable, replaceable heads that are easy to put on and take off. It comes in the 100 meter sizeand its depth is probably works best in this groomers opinion for short and medium double coated dogs, since I have a large double coated dog I would prefer the tool to be a little deeper. For the price and comfort and width of the brush it is a very good value in a quality brush. Double coated dogs need something like this to get the dead coat close to the skin out without hurting the dog, of course, this can also be used on long haired cats where the hair is everywhere. All the fur you can get off is less fur on furniture and clothes. Worth the money.

"Being a dog owner and groomer for 15 years this in my opinion is a really great idea . It is very sturdy and feels good in the hand [I have arthritis in my wrist and no pain after using this slicker] There is a button on the backside of the brush that pushes all the fur out of the bristles, so its quick and you never have to touch it, it will push all the hair out-very smart. I would recommend it for shorter hair dogs that shed a lot, especially white fur which seems to cling to everything in your home and your clothes. I wouldn't use this brush for double coated dogs, there are many models that work better for that, some made by Dele. Since the skin is so close to the fur you won't need much pressure and you'll really be surprised at how much dead hair comes off, too much pressure will hurt their skin so it just takes a light stroke to get a lot of hair-Best slicker brush I've seen.This sample was sent to me for an honest review and this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQDTMG0K9MQVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ZZCNGM#wasThisHelpful","RQDTMG0K9MQVA","A2RMIA6EPNE1NG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RMIA6EPNE1NG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 9 year old nephew loves this book of magic, which is really a series of 30 heavy cards,about 4 x6 inches large.One side shows a child doing the trick as its done correctly and how its supposed to look the other side shows and tells in some detail how the tricks are done. It tells you the level of difficulty and for the under 9 set the parents will probably be doing most of the tricks but my guess you'd need at least a 3rd grade education to read the magic directions. The biggest problem is' the small print on the directions, hard for this grandpa to read but my grand nephew has no problems. This is really quite fun and some easy and some tricks more difficult. This is not a cheap little magic kit and you'll have to supply your own props but they really are clever and fun. This was sent to me for a fair and honest review from Poland.

"I love this foundation.  It feels wonderful and light and looks very natural.  It applies, blends and builds beautifully.  The coverage was more than my favorite BB cream, but still light enough for me - I just have some redness to cover and no blemishes and this was fantastic.  I love the format of a liquid foundation in a sponge which is perfect to take along.  I wasn't wild about the tiny applicator that comes with it and tend to use a regular makeup sponge to apply because that seems more sanitary and easier to control.  The color was slightly darker and more orange than I expected, so I'd like to try a neutral shade instead of a warm shade.  In mid-summer, this is probably my perfect shade.  This foundation isn't terribly long wearing or bullet proof.  I wear glasses and I found it rubbed off onto my frames about the same as any other foundation I've tried.  It also rubs off onto my phone.  I didn't notice any oxidation and the color stayed true all day.  Hooray!

"I've been a long-time fan of Canon printers and this one is very nice.  It's smaller than previous models.  Quite short and not as deep.  The problem is this reduction in size comes at a price.  The paper tray is very shallow - probably half of my previous printer so there's much more refilling paper.  They've also eliminated the rear-feed slot.  As a crafter, I really, really need that rear feed tray for thicker cardstocks.  This is a huge disappointment.  Looking at the Canon website it appears they've done away with rear-feed on all the printers - even the ones marketed as crafter's printers.  That's simply ridiculous.  If your needs are more general (photo and plain paper) printing then this is a nice printer.  The wireless printing works easily when you have a wi-fi network to act as go-between.  If you want to print directly to the printer from your phone or tablet, it's a lot more difficult.  You have to get the Canon print app on your device and then hunt for the printer with your device's wi-fi and pray it works.  Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  There are a lot of ""cannot connect to printer"" errors.  It's also hard to choose your document to print from within the app.  Most of the documents and webpages on my phone wouldn't print.  I was able to print photos.  What's worse, is you can't easily switch between wi-fi and direct printing.  Ugh.  Hopefully they can improve the app and solve these problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJPRJLENJT82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZCCU#wasThisHelpful","R1WJPRJLENJT82","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm really impressed with these.  I was buying the Tidy Cat liners in bulk but the price shot up to a buck fifty per pad.  Currently these are about half that.  I use about 3 pads a week for my two large cats.  I have two Breeze boxes, but they both prefer to pee in one box and poo in the other.  So the pee builds up fast!  I have to change the liner about every 3 days or I have a real mess to deal with.  UGH!  But, the Breeze system is simple and seems a lot cleaner for the cats.  I immediately noticed with this pad that it held a lot more liquid than the other pad.  I just changed pads after 5 days and the pad was full, but not overflowing.  By this time, a Breeze pad would have been completely overflowing.  The problem was so bad, I would keep a larger puppy pad under the breeze box 'just in case'.

"This is a beautiful and very functional suitcase.  Four wheels make it very easy to push as you walk.  The inside is constructed with a light beige lining that makes it easier to see the contents.  While most suitcases are essentially a deep box with a shallow lid, the Tumi Alpha 2 is the equivalent of two shallower boxes.  This allows you to pack in two layers without having to rummage under to top layer to get at things.  It's a very functional design.  One side has a zip around lid with a large pocket.  The reverse side of this lid has a small roll to fold garments without crushing.  The other side has a very clever bag that zips to the case along one short  edge and clips to the case along the other. This bag can be removed and functions as an accessories or delicates bag with its own hanger and two zippered pockets.  The smaller pocket is velvet lined for jewelry.  At first I assumed it was a toiletry bag but it does not appear to be waterproof.I was able to pack 4 days of cool season clothing (jeans, hoodies, etc)  into the case by expanding the zipper gusset.  The lining is made of very densely woven material.  There are two long zippered pouches in one side of the case for smaller items.The outside of the case boasts two pockets and a hook for attaching a smaller bag. It comes with a strap for hanging the bag that slips into the hook.  It also comes with a combo lock.The bag handles are very close to the bag and unobtrusive.  It's also a bit difficult to get your hand through.  You really only need them to lift the bag because it also has a telescoping retractable handle for pushing and pulling the bag.  All in all this bag is very functional and really quite beautiful.  I've always used Briggs & Riley luggage which I think is exceedingly well designed.  This bag is not as utilitarian as a B&R bag but the finish and appearance are more elegant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WP6Q812C26D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXNG0ZW#wasThisHelpful","R5WP6Q812C26D","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It can be hard to find stamps that aren't boring or too twee.  I love my Silhouette Cameo and I really love the ability to customize cutting and print files.  Initially the Mint was kind of a let down.  It comes with a machine, cable, 4 ink bottles and two stamps.  My machine for review did not come with the CD so I needed to download the software.  I was really hoping that the Mint would use the Silhouette Studio software that I already have.  Instead, it uses a similar but pared down software of its own.  At first the software was much too primitive, but the last update has drastically improved things.I had seen a video showing the incredible detail that this machine is capable of creating on a stamp, so I used the software to create a return address label with a simple graphic.  I also used the software to create a Christmas themed stamp for gift tags.  It's pretty easy to run the stamp material into the machine, but I was having trouble getting the machine to accept it.  I tried several times, and eventually got the machine to recognize it.  The second one went through with no problems and since then it has worked every time.  It’s worth noting that you put the stamp cartridge in from the back of the machine and it spits the finished product from the front.  This seems counter-intuitive to me because every single craft machine I have ever used fed material into the front of the machine.  I think they should label the machine and make the instructions a bit more clear for dummies like me.I removed the stamps from their carriers and went to stick them to their respective stamp blocks.  I mistakenly thought the stamps were not separating from the film.  I figured out I had made a huge error when attaching the stamp to the block.  The bottom of the stamp is not meant to be adhesive, it is supposed to be glossy - I was under the impression that the glossy bottom was a film that should be removed.  Not so.  Instead, you have to lift the little cap off the stamp top to reveal an adhesive pad underneath.  You stick the glossy stamp bottom to this and it effectively doubles the cushioning of the stamp and adheres it to stamp cartridge.  You can then apply a sticker of the stamp to the lid for identification and remove it from the stamp block.  I don't think the instructions are very clear on this at all.  The manual doesn't mention or show pulling the lid off.  I had to watch a third party video review of the machine to see this.  I believe that the extra cushioning makes a better image too.Once I stamped away the excess ink, I was able to get an impression, but it wasn't very good.  The impression was blotchy and uneven.  The ink seemed to bleed an oily residue into the paper leaving a wet ring around the stamped area.  The font I had chosen for the return address stamp was too thin to give a good impression.  I was surprised because I had seen the video with the very finely detailed stamps.  What a bummer.  My other stamp used a thicker font, but even that would not stamp evenly.I bought 4 more stamp blanks and I tried again.  I had much more success.  I found the blue ink seems to work much better - the color is vibrant and crisp and does not leave an oily ring around the image.  I tried really shaking the black ink because I thought it was separating.  It seemed a little bit better, but still not as crisp and saturated as I'd like, but the oily residue is gone.  The attached picture shows a 30mmx30mm stamp that was created with 3 pt lines and stamped with blue ink.In general, I do expect there to be some learning curve with a product like this, but the cost of the stamp material is so high, that I am really not that eager to try again.  At present, the stamps and inks are not even Amazon Prime items which is a huge disincentive for me to purchase them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBKDCBUPPNB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSQX63O#wasThisHelpful","R2BBKDCBUPPNB4","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(This is what was broken on the one I received).  There is a brown blob of solder or epoxy on the bail.  The crystal has some epoxy residue on it.  The box it came in doesn't even look like a real Swarovski box.  The foam inside looked like pieces of scrap.  There was a frayed white ribbon in one box and a white ribbon held together with a staple in the other box.  Both boxes came with a strange silver chain in the box - none of my Swarovski ornaments have EVER had a chain with them.  The foam inside the box and the ribbon do not look like the usual Swarovski packaging.  There was no little booklet that always comes with the ornaments.  There is no label that identifies the item.  The outside of the box has what appears to be a typo in the web address (an L instead of an I in Swarovski) and the font looks completely different than the genuine box.  There is no year tag on it.  I will be filing a complaint with Amazon about the MarketPlace seller Ann-shopping and demanding a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353PAV8B5JCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5YQPEC#wasThisHelpful","R353PAV8B5JCM","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hubble baby monitor comes with two cameras and a monitor unit.  The cameras will record sound and video and monitor temperature, movement and sound.  The video recording works in the dark as well. The camera can be remotely controlled to pan side to side and up and down.The cameras will connect to your home's wifi network to provide remote viewing via a smartphone application.After using the Hubble for a month we are impressed by the utility of it.  The only difficulties were getting the cameras to connect to the wifi -- it seemed unable to see our hidden network.  I got frustrated and gave up.  I came back around to it a couple days later and was able to connect easily.Monitoring from the app is okay but not great.  Of course there's a delay, but very often the app will complain about a low bandwidth connection.  Occasionally there is trouble connecting to the camera feed.  Other times it seems to work flawlessly.  I think they're still sorting out some of the details.I love the fact that up to 4 cameras can be added to the system.  The Hubble is compatible with different Motorola cameras.You can customize the alerts the camera sends you and for a small subscription fee you can have video footage saved on the Hubble website.It's a nice set up and I'd recommend it whether you want to monitor a baby, your pets or just general activity in your home while you're away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R8G5FRKWKPRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EM6PYM#wasThisHelpful","R2R8G5FRKWKPRI","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am so excited about this pot filler faucet. It is a perfect match for my Delta Trinsic kitchen faucet.  It is heavy, with smooth articulation (not unlike that charmer I met at the bar last Thursday).  It's a very nice addition to the kitchen!  It has two shut offs.  One at the wall and one at the free end.  This is a common feature of pot fillers and meant to prevent accidentally watering your stove I guess.  I had to get a plumber to install the supply line and then it's a simple matter to install it.You might wonder if you even need a pot filler faucet.  I admit I was in the Negative Nancy camp and figured why get one if you still have to lug steaming pots back to the sink -- what's the point.  Well, listen carefully my friend.  Two words.... Pasta Insert. That's right, a perforated basket inside your pasta pot, you pull the basket up, draining the pasta. You leave the hot water on the stove to cool down and deal with later.  No pot of scalding water to lug across the kitchen.  Hooray!  If you have limited mobility or strength you can bail out the pot or have someone else handle it.  It is also handy for those times when you need to add just a bit of water to a pan while cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1UKSMBFKTAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NT5T91Y#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1UKSMBFKTAX","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So . . . if you, as my mom would say, ""spend a penny"" sometimes when you sneeze or cough this might be a good product for you.  I've been a little lax on my kegel routine and now I face the inevitable consequence of old age and iffy bladder control.  If I have a particularly amusing luncheon companion and a few too many raspberry cosmos I might regret not planning ahead.  Anyway, this looks and works like a tampon - except it's the biggest tampon you have ever seen.  Frankly, it's a little daunting.  It's not a thick wad of cotton though, it's some sort of futuristic plastic gizmo encased in a gauzy sac.  Part of me wants to open it up and know what's in there, my more rational side says ""NOPE!, just leave it alone"".  The mechanics are similar to a tampon, but the gizmo presses on the urethra through the vaginal wall and suppresses inadvertent leaks.  This kit gives you three sizes to try.  Size one was not effective for me, size two worked okay and size three work no better than size two.  You can still urinate normally while using the Impressa.  There are times you might not want or be able to use a liner, like if you're at the beach or wearing a g-string at your pole dancing class, and this would fit the bill.  I wouldn't want to use it every day, but I can see the utility of it.  It was not at all clear to me whether or not I could flush it after use, but then I also need bifocals.

"The Margaritaville Key West Frozen Concoction Machine is a behemoth of a blender/ice shaver hybrid.  It's a solid machine and very large.  The blender jar is glass with a pour spout and a tight sealing 'lid'.  The lid has a big hole in the center for the ice to go in, so it's not for say, keeping the bees out of your 'Rita.  The machine is simple to use - a certain volume of liquid is blended and a certain quantity of shaved ice is added.  Then it blends again.  This is done automatically depending on how many drinks you're making.  It has settings for one, two or three drinks.  You can also blend independently or add more shaved ice.  The machine is loud and very large.  I have this sitting on my countertop right now, but unless your kitchen is gargantuan or you reside in a party house, you probably won't leave this on the counter all the time.  It does not fit under my upper cabinets with the ice bin attached.The problem I had with the machine was that with the second use, the ice shaver became jammed and no amount of effort would unjam it.  It was very Undude.  I attempted to follow the instructions for disassembling the ice hopper, but wasn't able to - pushing a tiny button underneath the hopper head while turning the hopper to to unscrew - it's just not possible for one person to do this.  I enlisted the help of my husband and even the two of us working together were not able to loosen the hopper head.  Unfortunately this means we will never be able to disassemble the machine for proper cleaning or to replace the blade.  It also means that if it jams during use you are S.O.L. until the ice melts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJAYHCY4T60E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ5CVKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HJAYHCY4T60E","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course it leaves an impression on the paper that is still slightly visible, but the ink is gone.

"We've had our Vertuoline for about a month now and are pleased with the coffee.  I had made up my mind to get a Citiz machine but we went to a local retailer to check it out.  They were pushing the Vertuoline pretty hard and Mr Fuji liked the idea of a bigger cup.  The coffee is good.  Quite good.  Far better than the average coffee shop.  Far far better than the average K-cup.  Not as good as the very best espresso I've ever had to be sure, but for simple morning coffee I am well pleased.  The machine is designed well and easy to use. In my opinion their traditional machines are sexier looking.  Vertuoline looks like it was made to compete with Keurigs.  You do have to push the head down pretty firmly while locking it so folks with strength issues may not like it.  The pods are expensive.  No doubt about it.  We have used $65 worth in a month for two people and a couple days of house guests.  You order them via the Nespresso app or website and they show up literally two days later.  Very convenient.  There are a few stores in very large cities where you can buy pods, but I can't even buy pods at the store where I purchased my machine!  They sent me off with two starter packs and a wave.Over the month, I have gradually found myself reaching for the smaller espresso pods instead of the larger coffee pods.  They have a much richer flavor and make a superior latte.  For this reason, I wish I had gotten the Citiz machine.  There is a much wider selection of coffees in the original line.  Oh well, Mr Fuji still uses the big pods for his cuppa.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIPAPAXONUD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILLV49G#wasThisHelpful","R2VIPAPAXONUD0","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case seems well made and durable and protective.  It is easy to insert the laptop, but there were no instructions with my case.  One side has clips for the corner of the laptop and the other side has elastic straps across the corners.  The straps hold the corners of the laptop screen and I find them slightly distracting since they cover a small portion of the screen.  I flipped the case around to put the straps on the keyboard side and the clips on the screen and it looks much better (I suspect this is how it was designed to be used), but then the side with the clips pulls my screen back and tips over the laptop.  There is nowhere to put a charger cable.  The zippers hang up on the corners of the case.  If your goal is protection and quick access to the laptop, this is a good case.  If you are looking for something a bit more functional, keep looking.

"I am impressed with this little vacuum.  It has great suction and seems decently made.  The wand is metal and telescoping.  I feel the wand is just a little bit too short.  It's decent for floor vacuuming, but not quite long enough for the tops of my draperies and the corners of the stairwell.  These are the type of tasks a canister vac should be able to easily accomplish.  It's small and lightweight, so it makes vacuuming the stairs quite easy.  The dust bin is easy to empty and reattach.  The retractable cord is very nice, but short - like all canisters.  The hose attaches to the wand with just friction - there is no fitting or mechanism to keep it attached.  There also isn't really a handle, just a curve - this contributes to less control and greater hand fatigue.  The head is suitable for bare floors and has an adjustment that will lower or raise a brush along the leading edge.  There is no rotating brush so it really doesn't work well on carpet.

"Once I got this set up, it worked quite well to warn our dog from straying down the driveway and rushing the fence. The base unit can run on a rechargeable battery unit or directly plugged into an outlet.  The collar unit is also rechargeable.  There are 16 levels of correction, with 1-15 giving a brief shock after a warning beep, and level zero giving a brief vibration after the beeps.  Since I refuse to subject my animals to anything I won't endure, I tried it on myself to see what it was like.  I am obviously not covered in fur, but even on level one, there is a noticeable, but not painful jolt.  My dog started on the audible only and ultimately needed a level five correction to register when he was going nuts barking at a passerby.  He is a very high energy dog with a very thick coat (Aussie).  Since then, we have backed it off to a three and he does well with that level.  My other dog is already familiar with wireless fence collars and all he needed was to hear the beep from the other dog's collar.  Dog #2 is part share-pei and has rather sparse fur and thin skin is extremely sensitive to things like this and I really don't think it's the best tool for him.  I'm also concerned about using it on Dog #1 when Dog #2 is in earshot of the beeping.  He thinks he's doing something wrong, when it's really the other dog approaching the line.  If you have two dogs of similar behavior and temperament, this will work, but I think it's too traumatic for our second dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JWBVO6H2SXK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFW0LHM#wasThisHelpful","R3JWBVO6H2SXK7","A3LL8PH49PZUG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LL8PH49PZUG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been on a Delafield binge lately, and so far, this one's my favorite.  There's not much of a plot -- characters are American and British tourists on the French Riviera (I assume Cote d'Azur is on the French Riviera).  We follow them for several days as they bathe (1920's talk for swimming), dine, converse, fall in and out of love, and watch one another.If you're looking for characterization, and for a glimpse into another time -- a time that was shading from Victorian repression into our more modern, free-wheeling world -- this is it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UE65RXBLIICV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JECXW0A#wasThisHelpful","R2UE65RXBLIICV","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My hair dresser noticed it and asked what happened.I used to have to apply extra product to get even a little bit of body, but I don't need to do that now.

Even for something as quick as a grilled cheese sandwich, I had to constantly dial it up.  And it heated very unevenly.

"I'd recommend this, but I think it would have benefited with more information about what was happening in the rest of the country (and the world) during the Harding years.  It would have added some much-needed context.  There were brief mentions of Prohibition, current movies and music, but I felt a vacuum.  I'm not sure why ""The Jazz Age"" was part of the title.  The way the book was written, it could have taken place at any time -- the Jazz Age ""feel"" was missing.  It's all about Florence, her family and friends, and the detail is almost Dickensian.Florence was an admirable woman in many ways -- ambitious, thoughtful of others, independent, ahead of her time -- but the author doesn't stint on describing her faults as well as her virtues.I do have a new appreciation for the hard work involved in being First Lady -- the day to day functions and events.

"A truck driver in Alberta, Canada picks up a hitch-hiker and drops him off in a small town diner.  At the diner, the hitch-hiker strikes up a conversation with Ida, a waitress.  He asks Ida to tell him her life story.  It's the end of her shift, Ida has nothing better to do, so after he agrees to pay for her time (twenty bucks), Ida starts to talk.This is a very short book -- all the better for re-reading, which I think was the author's intention.  The hitch-hiker might not be what he seems, and maybe Ida isn't either.Ida gives us the highlights and lowlights of her life -- an ordinary childhood in a charmless but harmless family.  The only real highlight is Ida's friendship with the younger Lucy, a Native American from ""the Reserve"".  Their personalities are very different.  Ida is content to let life happen to her, almost like a dumb animal, which Lucy doesn't understand.  Lucy leaves town very early, while Ida hangs around, lets herself get pregnant and marries a young man who she never bothers to get to know.  Tragedy follows and Ida commences to wandering.It's difficult to explain why I liked this book so much.  Might be the honesty, might be admiration for what Riis has done in creating Ida, on the surface an ordinary, unlikable and not very interesting character.  But in the end, she's almost Sphinx-like, maybe even a creation of the reader.  She can be viewed in different ways, depending on the reader's own personal experience.  I liked her, but I don't think I'd want her for a friend.This was an amazing book and definitely meant for more than one reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZ6EM1E1N04Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0888946414#wasThisHelpful","RYZ6EM1E1N04Y","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was raised as a Protestant and am as familiar with the Gospels as any other non-student of religion.  What prompted me to read this book was an interest in the historical Jesus as opposed to the Biblical Jesus.  I was also interested in the history of the early church and how the gospels came to be written.  The only other book I've read that touches on this is Gospel by Wilton Barnhardt.I've read some review comments criticizing Aslan for cherry-picking from the Gospels to prove an assertion, while at the same time criticizing parts of those Gospels as inaccurate.  I also have a problem with this, but I don't think he has an agenda, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  It may be that the parts he relies on for truth are reinforced by other sources.I don't think the book will convince anyone, one way or the other, about the truth of the miracles or the resurrection.  Neither do I think the book will test anyone's faith.  The book has value as a history of that time and place, and of early founders of the Christian religion.It's well-written, well-organized, and engaging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH06QAEKQ36B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006922X#wasThisHelpful","RUH06QAEKQ36B","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is exactly what she did, and it's extremely entertaining and enlightening.Ellen Wright put the book together from 75 hours of recorded interviews -- probably not so much ""interviews"" as listening to Roni tell her story.

There's no hint of leading questions or censorship or an agenda or puffery.Roni is humble about her amazing talent and her success but it's an honest humility -- there's no ""Aw shucks, ain't no big thang.""

"I've read a lot of Holocaust books -- fiction and non-fiction -- so I wondered if there would be anything new in this memoir.  This was new, not just because of her situation -- a Jewish woman married to a Nazi party member -- but also in her description of what it was like to be one of the thousands of slave laborers working in Germany and occupied countries.  I suspect that very few slave laborers managed to survive, and those who did probably didn't want to revisit that experience.One caveat though, about the ""Nazi Officer's Wife"" in the title -- it's deceptive.  Edith's husband was a party member when they met but he wasn't high in the party and he wasn't even in the army until they'd been married for some time.  So a reader looking for insight into what it was like to be married to an officer or a high-ranking Nazi party member won't find much in that regard.The book is rich in detail without wallowing or sugar-coating.  Her memories feel very honest, not imagined or colored.  We meet Edith and her family and friends when she's in her teens and this background makes what happens later very affecting.  She's strong and resilient but is often insecure and afraid, and rightfully so, of course.  We follow Edith after the war, when she worked for the Communist regime.  That was something new to me and while I'm glad it was included, I started to wonder if this woman was ever going to find peace and security.It's one woman's story of survival, very well-written.  It was hard to put down, and I'd love to read more about Edith's life after she left Europe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38EYZ8FZ0CCGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ID6NDQ#wasThisHelpful","R38EYZ8FZ0CCGG","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a short novel, more of a psychological study really, about a young man, his ego, and his mother.Philip Verrian is 37 years old, never married, and lives with his mother.  Philip has found his first success as a writer.  He's written a serial for a magazine and is getting some positive attention from readers and critics.  He receives a letter from a young woman who claims to be dying and asks him to reveal the ending of the serial.  (I'll bet George R. R. Martin is getting similar letters.)Philip takes the letter to his publisher, who thinks the letter would be good publicity but he wants to make sure it isn't a hoax.  He investigates and learns that it is indeed a fake.  The young woman who wrote the letter apologizes, explaining that it was a youthful prank, but Philip's having none of it -- his ego is wounded.  His response is scathing and unforgiving.  He feels a little bit guilty about taking it so seriously, then puts it out of his mind.Most of the rest of the novel takes place in a country house, where Philip has been invited to spend a week by a vapid but wealthy older woman who's trying to make a name for herself in society.  On the train to the house, Philip encounters a young woman who intrigues him.  It's not a spoiler to reveal that this is the same woman who wrote the letter -- Howells makes this obvious.  The rest of the novel details what happened during that week and a brief time after.So -- there's not much plot.  What kept me reading was Howell's observations about Philip and the people he encounters.  Philip thinks he knows himself, and that he knows women.  He doesn't see how he's been poisoned against women by his mother.  She's really quite smart, and mothers who want to keep their sons close could take lessons from her.  In addition to watching her machinations, I also enjoyed Howells' digs at this egocentric writer.The title of the book puzzled me so I looked up ""fennel"" and ""rue"".  Fennel is a main ingredient in absinthe, often used in literature as a powerful mind-altering drink, and rue has been used to induce abortion.  I'm not sure what to make of that, except that fennel might represent Philip's mother's sly control of her son, and rue as representing independence and freedom of women to control their bodies.The kindle edition has some formatting issues and a few typos, but not enough to really detract.  If you like psychological studies, and fiction set in the early 20th century featuring people of a certain class, I think you'd like this very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJUG2JMHBSGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8132046919#wasThisHelpful","RAJUG2JMHBSGR","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First review:This was on my wish list and I received it as a gift.  I'd return it, but I don't want to hurt my daughter-in-law's feelings.My issue with the lamp is how quickly the switch heats up.  The switch is the round bulb on top of the lamp -- you twist it to turn the lamp on and off.  It shouldn't get hot.  I'm using a 60 watt bulb as instructed, but after 15 minutes, the switch is very warm to the touch.  No other lamp I own has ever done this.  You should be able to touch everything but the bulb in a good quality lamp.I hate to toss it, because other than the switch, I like the lamp.  The base is heavy and it adjusts to any angle you need.Update: I switched to a small CFL bulb, and there's no more heat. The lamp has a sturdy base, which means that the lamp itself won't move when adjusting it.  I like the on-off switch -- the switch is the whole round top of the lamp.  That means there's no fumbling around at the base of the bulb like other lamps.Thanks for suggesting a different bulb.

"""Amazing"" is an overused adjective, and I apologize for contributing to the overuse, but the word fits.  I've read a lot of fiction (and some nonfiction) set in the American West of the 19th century.  This is one of the most original and satisfying.  Lafferty tells the history of the Choctaw people (and other Territory Indians) in the 1800's by combining real individuals and events into the life of one very extraordinary man and his family.At times it reads like a fable, like something from mythology; at other times it reads like a contemporary journal.  The language is brilliant. The characters are larger than life but believable.  There is not a slow moment in the book, although there are passages devoted to reflection and memory.  It's funny and sad.More than any other book I've read about the Native American experience, this book makes me realize what was lost when the People were destroyed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTZDDCG9SD1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806123494#wasThisHelpful","RPTZDDCG9SD1X","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't reading fantasy in the 80's but I've read quite a bit of it since then (old and new), so I was curious about how this book would stack up.  I was also curious about how it would compare to more recent urban fantasy from the likes of superstars like Tim Powers and Neil Gaiman. It's an odd thing, but sometimes we read the new stuff before the old, and the old suffers in comparison, even though it was those works that led the way.War for the Oaks reads like new, which is as it should be, for a book that's revered as a classic.  I found the story of Eddi and the phouka and the faerie war compelling and original.  The musical interludes made me wish there were an audio version, so I could hear their songs.  It was also a musical education of sorts.  I didn't realize there was so much improvisation in rock music, and next time I listen to Van Halen, I'll appreciate more what they were doing.Ms. Bull's writing totally drew me in.  I've only been to Minneapolis a few times (for ball games and concerts) but I've never visited the parks or walked the streets.  She made me feel like I was there, and when the scene switched from the ""real"" world to the faerie world, I believed it.I especially loved the characters of Hedge and Meg, and wanted more of them.I would have given the book 5 stars and maybe I should have, but I would have liked more points of view.  What were the people listening to Eddi's music feeling?  What happened in the faerie courts?  What was Willy going through, and Stuart?  There was a lot of drama to see there, and we missed it.That said, I'd definitely recommend the book, although not this particular edition. The binding made it difficult to hold -- I had to hold both sides of the book to keep it open enough to read at the spine.  I tried cracking the spine (so sue me, it's my book) but it wouldn't crack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWH85YIUO10F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765300346#wasThisHelpful","RWH85YIUO10F6","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In After I'm Gone, Laura Lippman introduces us to Felix Brewer, a very successful bookie, his partners in crime (an attorney and a bail bondsman), his beautiful wife Bambi, his equally gorgeous mistress Julie, and his three daughters.  She also introduces us to ""Sandy"" Sanchez, a retired and recently widowed detective who investigates cold cases.When the book starts, Felix is leaving the country to avoid a prison sentence.  Ten years later, his mistress disappears.  Did she join Felix?  That's what some people thought. Many years after her disappearance, her remains are discovered and Sandy takes the case.  The story jumps back and forth in time, from 1959 when Felix and Bambi met, to the present, with stops in between to examine the lives of the wife, mistress, and daughters.How Felix's disappearance affected the lives of the women he left behind was more interesting to me than the mystery of Julie's murder.  These women were were all fascinating, if not always likable.  There's a delicious gossipy feel to their stories, like an upscale soap opera, but with some depth.  Equally fun was going back to different time periods, politics, fashion, all the things that make the past come alive.And Sandy -- great character, and a good detective, and it looks like we'll see more of him in future novels.The only reason I didn't give the book five stars was the basic premise -- that a fairly young man with a family he loved would leave everything behind to avoid a relatively short prison sentence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK893LABRVK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062083392#wasThisHelpful","R1NK893LABRVK3","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And if you enjoy Smith's writing style.  He doesn't hold the reader's hand. You'll be scratching your head, wondering how (and if) the pieces connect. This was true in Gorky Park, Polar Star, Wolves Eat Dogs, and Tatiana. (I've missed three Renkos but I suspect it's the same with those.)Renko is the quintessential world-weary cop -- and a Russian. He's seen it all. He holds no hope.  His vision is clear, no illusions.  To say he's fatalistic is almost an understatement. (Seriously, why doesn't he emigrate?) He still cares, but it seems that he has to force himself. That means that unless there's an intriguing mystery, the reader won't care either. The first mystery -- whether Tatiana's death was a suicide -- isn't nearly as intriguing as the mystery of the notebook found in Tatiana's apartment.I liked most of the book, especially the action in Kaliningrad, the almost comical Russian mafioso, and the attempts to decipher the notebook. What kept me from giving this four or five stars was an unnecessary subplot with a couple of characters who could have been left out without hurting the story.  (Anya and Maxim)We won't know the importance of this chapter in Renko's life until Smith finishes the series.  I do hope he keeps writing about Renko and Russia, and about Zhenya and Victor, but I hope the next book has more focus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0Z32ROSBTQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439140219#wasThisHelpful","RX0Z32ROSBTQR","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this coffeemaker for our town's community hall.  We don't often have events where we need 100 cups of coffee, but we have a few and the machine needs to be reliable, and easy to clean.This machine fills the bill.  It came with clear instructions.  You wouldn't think instructions would be important -- everyone knows how to make coffee -- but they are, especially when it comes to cleaning.  Cleaning is important.The machine brews 100 cups in a little over an hour.  It doesn't need a paper filter. The location of the spout means that three or four cups will be left at the bottom.  There may be some grounds there but if you don't need that last little bit, you won't have grounds in your cup.The machine comes with a metal gadget for cleaning the space where the stem fits.  A scouring pad (not included) should be wrapped around that tool and used to clean that part of the pot.It's a very attractive unit.  The lever allows a constant pour if you're filling thermoses.  There's a handy drip tray.  The spout sits high enough to accommodate even larger mugs.We're very happy with this machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUK2ZNN8CKBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N7BUMW#wasThisHelpful","R1XUK2ZNN8CKBE","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"O'Farrell has created a flinty, difficult, and frustrating family, and I enjoyed every minute with them.  Gretta and Robert are Irish and live in London.  They've been together for about thirty years (my guess, it's not explicit).  Robert is recently retired and he and Gretta have settled into a routine. The routine is disturbed one day when Robert leaves to get a newspaper and doesn't come back.Gretta and Robert's children are Michael, Aoife (pronounced ""ee-fah""), and Monica. They're all frustrated and struggling, at turning points in their lives. Michael is worried that his wife is about to leave him. Aoife never learned to read and has managed to hide this all her life. The stress of her deception has colored her life choices and is affecting her job and her relationship.  Monica is trying to be a stepmom to kids who won't let her into their lives.What impressed me the most about the novel was its economy. In just 300 pages, we're shown how their childhoods have made them into the adults they've become. All this and a mystery too -- where did Robert go and why?Also impressive was how well these people know each other, how to push each other's buttons at the same time that they recognize the importance of their relationships.This was a very satisfying novel on every level.  Richly drawn characterization, realistic dialogue, mundane details that put me in the kitchen with them, watching and wishing I could help.  Great book, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53RQS07Q94AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385349408#wasThisHelpful","R53RQS07Q94AI","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only unsympathetic character in this book is the one who insisted that everything go her way, the one who insisted on control, who couldn't appreciate what she had. I hated her -- she had no redeeming qualities -- but I think she was a necessary contrast to the more likeable characters. It's not that the other characters were too sweet or too good -- they weren't -- but they were able to look at themselves and others clearly, and adapt, empathize, appreciate their lives. If everyone in the book had been as sympathetic as Sadie and as insightful as Joanna, we wouldn't appreciate them as much.The older I get (I'm 68), the more I'm interested in the last stages of life, not just how I'll deal with infirmity (should I last that long), but what I'll leave behind, what's left undone, will my husband and kids and friends know how much I loved them.With that in mind, McCorkle's book is comforting. The residents of Pine Haven haven't crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's. They're living and dying the best they can, and that's all any of us can hope for.The book was a joy to read and I was glad to know these people.  All of them were interesting and well-done. You won't need the chapter headings (character names) to know who you're with. They're individuals and their voices are unique. I wasn't bored for a minute and wanted more at the end.  I can't ask for more than that in a book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOSTUJFYZ2CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565122550#wasThisHelpful","RUOSTUJFYZ2CN","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected this book because I'm interested in the post WWII time period, all the change and growth, the rise of labor unions, the influence of organized crime. I also enjoy mysteries, true crime stories, and the experiences of immigrant families. So this book was quite a trifecta for me.It's based on the real life story of two brothers who emigrated from Ireland, worked hard, and found success.  Older brother Charlie becomes Mayor of New York City after WWII. Younger brother Tom becomes a District Attorney.  The brothers are close, but they move in different circles and they don't share the same politics. Tom becomes involved in the labor movement, while Charlie courts the city's movers and shakers.Then comes a crackdown on organized crime, and a mob informant, under heavy police guard, manages to fall out a window and die. Tom is sure the man was murdered, and that his brother knows the truth.The story moves back and forth in time from pre-war NYC to 1953 in NYC and Mexico as Tom investigates the man's death. Baker evokes the places and the people (big and small) with rich detail.  The behind-the-scenes look at the politics, the games, the deals felt authentic.I would give the book 5 stars, but for the subplot of Tom's affair with Charlie's wife. Their scenes didn't feel real, but were more like something from a 50's melodrama. Maybe Baker added it to make Tom more human, more nuanced, give him a fault, keep him from being ""too good"".  Tom's character needed to be fleshed out.  He's more of a witness than a participant.At the end, I felt more connection with the places, and with the minor characters, than with Tom and Charlie.  Charlie was weak and ambitious, Tom had convictions but no strength. Neither are likable, which can be fine in a novel, but they needed to be fleshed out.I can find no fault with Baker's writing style though -- clean and gorgeous at the same time. I felt like I was there, and I feel that I have more of an understanding of that time and place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZGXY5LGYP1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061885990X#wasThisHelpful","RNZGXY5LGYP1A","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure that stories this short could have much of an impact, but they do.  It turns out that we don't need a hundred pages of build-up to make a satisfying read.  Many of the stories left me wanting to know what happened before the story started.  With those, I made note of the authors' names so I can be on the lookout for their full-length works.The collection has a nice mix of suspense, comedy, and a little bit of horror.  With some, you can see the end coming -- ""Aha! I know where this is going!""  That doesn't diminish the thrill. Some of the stories made me smile, some had me going ""ewww"".This would be a great collection to have on an e-reader.

"The writing style is Young Adult/Tween, which doesn't match some of the very adult subject matter.  It's too simple -- this happens and then this happens.  There's no depth to the language or the characters.  The reader is left with nothing to think about except what happens.  But a lot happens, so if you're in the mood for story, the book will satisfy.William is separated from his mother when he's five years old.  He spends the next seven years in a Catholic orphanage.  On a yearly outing to a movie theater, he sees a photo of Willow Frost, a singer/actress who William believes is his mother.  With his friend Charlotte, who is blind, he leaves the orphanage to find his mother.The story then switches to Liu Song/Willow Frost.  I thought the simple style might change when the story moved to an adult's point of view, but it didn't.There's a fairy tale/fantasy quality to the story, orphan boy with a plucky friend, Willow Frost as Cinderella complete with evil stepmother, bad people trying to hurt them, good people showing up at opportune times to save them -- lots of melodrama.If this is something that appeals to you, then you'll like Songs of Willow Frost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZQX82XOKN61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345522028#wasThisHelpful","R1RZQX82XOKN61","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the memoir of a young man whose mother was murdered by her fifth husband.  Nine days after the World Trade Center attacks, Justin's mother Debbie was shot dead in the trailer she shared with her ex-cop husband.  Justin was twenty.  Debbie was in her early 40's, an intelligent, strong, creative, hard-working woman with a history of success at everything but marriage.It's a common enough story -- husband murders wife, happens every day.  What makes this memoir uncommon is Justin's unflinching honesty, about himself as well as his mom.  There were times when he had some decidedly uncharitable feelings about his mom, and at the risk of sounding like an immature little s***, he shares those feelings. Speaking ill of the dead? Yep, he does that. But when he talks about the love his mom had for him and his older brother, you know he's not shining on.  He knew she loved them and that she did the best she knew how.  Still, he doesn't make a martyr of her, or of himself.  They both had flaws.The other reason I so liked this book was because of how well Justin describes his survivor experiences, dealing with relatives, reporters, detectives, support groups, trying to restart a life after such a traumatic event, and trying to figure out why it happened. I think knowing what he went through could be helpful to someone working their way through such a loss.The side story about Tombstone and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral -- I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I suppose it ties in to the gun culture and the frontier, lawless atmosphere of that area.  Would Debbie have been shot if she and her husband had settled in Des Moines or Minneapolis?  I can't say, but I think yeah, probably.All in all, very satisfying and well-written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZIDY216UZJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068622#wasThisHelpful","RXZIDY216UZJY","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Memoirs involving the extremes of family life and human behavior can be riveting, but there's a lot to be said for exploring ordinary families.  There's no incest, adultery, treachery, or murder in Lee Sandlin's memoir of his Midwest family.  Instead we're treated to a couple of small but intriguing mysteries: Why are great-aunts Hilda and Helen, great-uncle Eugene, and Hilda's husband Marty growing old together in the family home, and why do they never share anything from their pasts?Most families enjoy nothing better than talking about ""the good old days"", sharing stories of their youth, regaling the kids with their travels and adventures, passing down lessons learned.  Not in this house.  Oh, the young cousins who spent their summers in the family home got lessons, but the main one was ""Don't talk about yourself.""Sandlin makes that clear in the prologue -- the elders didn't share personal information -- it just wasn't done.  Lucky for Sandlin and for readers, he manages to flesh out their lives, beginning with GGG-grandparents who emigrated from Germany in 1850.  Sandlin traces the ups and downs of the family fortunes -- nothing spectacular but typically American.  He takes us through most of the 20th century, and it could be the history of any family. The daughter who never married, the son who went to war and came back changed, the unhappy marriage that lasted until death -- it's all so ordinary but so fascinating.Sandlin's prose is clear and precise and descriptive.  The book is full of everyday details that bring to life the time and place.  While he may have been puzzled by his reticent, sometimes cold relatives, it's clear that they were loved.  Well, except for great-uncle Marty, maybe.I'd recommend this to anyone, especially if you grew up in the Midwest in the mid-20th century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1181WZDLW8N26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034580676X#wasThisHelpful","R1181WZDLW8N26","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed Franklin's three other novels -- all with different subjects but all with a deep understanding of the people and places he writes about.  I wasn't sure if this one would be different, what with having his poet wife as co-author.  Would the clean prose style change?  Would there be a plethora of unnecessary adjectives, flowery language, etc.?  (That shows how much I know about modern poetry -- which is nada.)Not to worry.  Franklin uses the Great Flood of 1927 as a backdrop to a fast-paced novel about revenue agents, moonshiners, and an abandoned baby.  The characters are believable, the dialogue is realistic, and Franklin's description of the flood and its aftermath had me holding my breath.I'd recommend this both as a thriller (of sorts) and as an historical record of the flood and what came after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEJL03K0X0PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062069187#wasThisHelpful","R3PEJL03K0X0PR","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Too much action"" isn't a common complaint when I'm reading an adventure novel.  But when the action leads nowhere, or goes in circles, I'll complain.  Laurence and Temeraire and their friends and foes are all over the map here, literally.  They don't stay in one place long enough for the complicated plot to make any sense.Further, Novik introduces some potentially interesting characters in Kaneko and Junichiro, but never makes us understand their motivations. Kaneko is pledged to help a stranded traveler but then he has to kill himself or fight a duel with him?  What's that all about?And the amnesia?  Puh-leeze.  Amnesia -- especially such selective amnesia as what Laurence had -- it's a crutch and like a crutch, it should be used just for a short time.  This went on too long.I loved the first four books, was okay with the next three, but this one was a disappointment.  Three stars though, for short passages that reminded me why I love the series -- it's all about the bromance between Temeraire and Laurence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1S9UXNNOLOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345522893#wasThisHelpful","R1L1S9UXNNOLOO","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sixth Ethan Gage adventure is my first.  I chose it because I love the Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian and the Temeraire series by Naomi Novik -- also set during the Napoleonic Wars.  I was a bit apprehensive that this was sixth in a series, but as it turned out, I didn't need to be. Like other good writers of series books, Dietrich gives enough background so the reader isn't lost and confused.  I do wish I'd read the earlier books -- if they're as good as this one, I've been missing out.The writing is brisk and witty, peppered with appropriate quotes from famous people Ethan Gage has known -- most notably, Benjamin Franklin.  There's plenty of action, on the fields of battle as well as in the drawing room. Ethan is smart and competent, but not too smart. He has a high opinion of himself but it's mostly well-deserved -- I quite like him.My only complaint -- and it's more of an observation than a complaint -- is that there's very little tension.  For a novel set during such perilous times and with characters in such precarious situations, the survival rate is astounding.

"I've been pleased with other Febreze products so was glad to see a carpet powder product.  I've used other carpet powders and the scents are too strong.The big test for this product was a corner of the living room, where an old much-loved cat had a few accidents.  Cleaning the carpet (Bissell machine and carpet cleaner) and enzyme cleaners and vinegar solutions would help for awhile, but I noticed that if the temperature and humidity were just right (summer), the odor would come back.  I'll replace the carpet someday, but in the meantime, the Febreze powder seems to be neutralizing the odor.I use it every time I vacuum, and there's no lingering scent of any kind.  That's what I want.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R385KXSGT7VW3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DBRDH6#wasThisHelpful","R385KXSGT7VW3B","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was curious about ""fangipani"".  It sounds like an Italian dessert or a tropical fruit, but nope, it's a plant, in the plumeria family.  The scent is lightly floral, very pleasant.

"I chose Terro because it's the only product that solved my son's ant problem.  He lives in the Pacific Northwest, and I've seen ants crawling in a line on a wall in his kitchen.  He put out a Terro trap and the ants were gone overnight, and they stayed gone.I live in Iowa, and don't really have much of an insect problem -- our winters are too harsh.  But in spring and summer, we'll get tiny little gnats.  This season, they chose to hang out on the back door, on the inside of the door.  I sprayed the glass and the Terro killed the gnats on contact, but within a couple days, they were back.  So I'm questioning the residual effect.  If I have to spray every day, this product isn't much better than any other.I'll use it again in the fall, when the Asian lady beetles and the box elder bugs show up, and I'll hope for a better result.  If I can kill those buggers before they get inside, I won't mind spraying every day.One plus is that it didn't leave a messy film on the glass of the door.***Revising my review -- the gnat population has gradually decreased after two sprayings.  I haven't seen any for several days.  It could be a seasonal/weather/temperature effect, but I suspect it's the Terro, doing its job.Updating to add that I've been spraying the metal pole where we hang a hummingbird feeder.  Since I started doing that, there haven't been any earwigs in the nectar.  Before, we'd have earwigs almost immediately after filling the feeder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8J9W9V1O561/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPWZTBM#wasThisHelpful","RF8J9W9V1O561","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the 1960 movie starring Robert Mitchum and Eleanor Parker was quite good, it raises questions about the actions of the characters.  As is usual, the book expands on the characters and explains their motivations.The Hunnicutts are Wade, landowner, legendary hunter, and womanizer, much admired by everyone except his wife Hannah, the ultimate martyr.  Son Theron idolizes his father and loves his mother.  When the story begins, Hannah has died.  Her coffin is taken to the graveyard, where three gravestones stand.  The stones mark the dates of death of all three Hunnicutts -- the same day, fifteen years earlier.  She's been dressed in a sequined gown from the 1920's, and in the coffin are written instructions that she be buried without ceremony.  Her grave had been dug years before but has to be cleared of leaves and branches.So you're hooked right there.  How did Wade and Theron die?  Why was Hannah's date of death the same as the others?  Why the sequined gown?The novel is set in a small town in Texas but could be a small town anywhere.  Humphrey gets everything right.  There's enough plot to keep readers interested, but it's more of a character study, focusing mainly on young Theron.I'd recommend it for readers of any age.  There's no explicit sex, violence, or language, and it's an excellent picture of life and morality in the 40's and 50's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZTRZBB5ES0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807120677#wasThisHelpful","R2MZTRZBB5ES0G","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Shining Girls, we meet serial killer Harper Lewis and Kirby Mazrachi, the only one of his victims who survived his attack.  The story begins in 1931, when Harper stumbles upon an abandoned house, a house through which he's able to travel through time.  Harper has already been shown to be no stranger to self-serving violence, and the house allows (encourages?) him to feed his need.Harper chooses his victims by their ""shine"" -- they're special, if only to him.  He visits them when they're young, leaves them a memento, and tells him he'll be back.I almost didn't choose this book.  I don't like violence, blood and gore.  There's a lot of that in this book, but it's not gratuitous.  While I was reading it, I thought back to Stephen King's short story, The Body, the story on which the movie Stand By Me was based.  There's a set piece in the story.  One of the kids tells of a pie-eating contest that ends with everyone vomiting.  That's gratuitous -- writing for effect, to cause a reaction.  Beukes doesn't do this.  Her descriptions of the murders are effective -- we feel the victims' fear and horror, but it doesn't feel voyeuristic.The pacing was just right -- moments of terror followed by breathing space, and even some humor.  My only quibble is that I would have liked to know more about Kirby's recovery -- she seemed almost dissociated from what happened to her.I'm not sure I understood the ending, but I was satisfied.  I'm a big fan of time travel fiction, and this one is in my top ten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OT1RB3K4CWTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316216852#wasThisHelpful","R1OT1RB3K4CWTO","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Or True Blood meets Homeland!  This sequel is just as much of a mash-up as the original (Niceville).The story has a little bit of everything and it's all entertaining, thanks to Stroud's ear for dialogue, a pace that never flags, and realistic characterizations.  There are good guys and bad guys, good cops and bad cops, real ghosts and ghostly shadows, a bottomless pond, and bad deeds from the past that bleed into the present.The focus is young Rainey Teague, the boy from Niceville who disappeared from a sunny street after looking into a mirror and who turned up ten days later, alive, in a sealed crypt.  Something wants to be reborn in Rainey, and it's up to his guardian and her cop husband to prevent it.Along the way we revisit the players in the bank robbery from the previous book, and meet a few new characters, just as deadly, and just as interesting.  I especially like that Stroud's evildoers (some of them anyway) are almost likeable.Some of the story threads are concluded here but Rainey's story isn't finished.  I'm looking forward to the final installment.The story is safe for readers with delicate sensibilities.  There's a lot of violence but it's not gratuitously gory, and there's no explicit sex or bad language.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYPCOKP0SD50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700968#wasThisHelpful","R3FYPCOKP0SD50","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actually, there's more than one implausible premise in Boyne's wonderful book.  The first is that a peasant boy is plucked from his village in 1914 and taken to St. Petersburg to live with the imperial family, the Romanovs.  The second is that he acquits himself quite well.  Despite having no formal education and no contact with anyone outside his small village, Georgy is well spoken, intuitive, courteous -- never a false step while living in the royal household.  He becomes a confidant not just of two of the royal children but of the Tsar himself. (The third implausible premise is for the reader to discover -- I won't spoil it.)I think the historical aspect of the story is simplified, but then Boyne's purpose isn't to tell the story of the ill-fated Romanovs, or the Russian Revolution.  It's a love story -- not a romance -- and as a love story, it's very well done.The story moves back and forth in time, and this movement provides the only real tension in the book, since we all know how things turned out for the Romanovs.If you can get past the implausibilities and accept the story for what it is, you'll be rewarded with a fascinating (but simple) inside look at life in that time period.  It can almost be read as alternate history, or as a fantasy (farmer's son fights the evil wizard).This is only my second Boyne novel, but I expect I'll read them all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGK20ESRKXBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590515986#wasThisHelpful","RAGK20ESRKXBW","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the story starts, Scott McGrath, an investigative reporter, is on the skids professionally because of a television interview.  McGrath had become interested in the films of cult horror director Stanislas Cordova, and that led to an anonymous phone call from a man who told McGrath that Cordova ""does something to the children.""  McGrath became convinced that Cordova was a child predator, and he said so on national television.  Lawsuit. Career over.Five years later, Cordova's talented and beautiful daughter Ashley is found dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft in an abandoned warehouse.  Suicide?  Apparently so.  McGrath's interest is reawakened.  He revisits the material he'd gathered before and sets out to find whatever he can about the reclusive Cordova.  He's assisted by Nora and Hopper, two young people whose lives had been touched by Ashley.  The three of them try to piece together Ashley's last days.  They'll meet others who knew Ashley and who knew and worked with her father, and for me, meeting Cordova's people was the best part of the book.What was missing -- and what made me want to put the book aside several times -- was tension.  I was almost finished with the book before I started to care how it ended, and my caring was mainly curiosity about how Pessl would wrap things up.  The three searchers were invested -- they had to know what happened to Ashley and why -- but I really didn't care one way or the other.  I was curious, but that was all, and that's not enough.I was left with an empty feeling, like I'd been on a roller coaster ride, but one that had a very slow rise to a peak that was never more than a few feet from the ground.That said, Pessl's writing is fine, not overdone, her metaphors are apt, the dialogue is realistic.  A hallucinatory scene toward the end of the book was very well done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36BXZ8JUM5TAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006788X#wasThisHelpful","R36BXZ8JUM5TAY","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's how Jon Stewart described the book, when Mr. Packer was a guest on The Daily Show.  That comment, and Mr. Packer's wit, enthusiasm, and articulateness convinced me to try the book.I don't read much non-fiction, especially the socio-political variety.  It seems that most of these books -- the ones on the best seller list anyway -- are written by people with an agenda.  I don't want to be proselytized -- I want to be educated, and equally important, I want to be entertained.  Mr. Packer's book does this.I was most intrigued by Tammy's story.  Tammy is from Youngstown, Ohio, and she lived through the demise of the steel mills and the loss of thousands of good jobs, the destruction of a once vibrant community.  I worked in a factory for twelve years.  I wasn't on the assembly line but my job put me close to people on the shop floor, as well as management and the union.  Packer got all of that exactly right.  The factory where I worked closed two years ago, 2000 jobs lost in a small town.  Even though the plant was profitable, the owners saw fit to move operations to Mexico.Because he got Tammy's story so right, I have to assume the other viewpoints are equally accurate.  Connaughton's experiences in Washington were enthralling, and depressing.  I've never been so deep inside our political system.  Can we just throw them all out and start over?Readers who are more astute than me will find more to analyze in the book than I did.  But even for an average person, like me, who hasn't paid a lot of attention or who doesn't understand why we are where we are, this book will go a long way toward that understanding.  The writing is clear and compelling, and the people are fascinating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8M4TUOCDWFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374102414#wasThisHelpful","R2L8M4TUOCDWFJ","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Son is the story of three members of a family that settled in Texas beginning in the 1830's and continuing to the present.  Meyer focuses on three outstanding members of that family:  Eli, the first white child born in the territory, captured in a Comanche raid when he was ten; Peter, Eli's son, a disappointment to everyone, including himself; and Jeanne Anne, Eli's great-granddaughter, born too late, who might have been happier if she'd been a male.All the praise for this book is well deserved.  I've read many novels set in the American West -- novels that romanticize and novels that wallow in the violence.  Meyer doesn't romanticize and he doesn't wallow.  He relates the story of the McCollough family with all their strengths and flaws, and they have plenty of both.As historical fiction, this is the best kind.  There's no unnecessary exposition -- Meyer doesn't explain, he shows.  This makes the book feel contemporary, like it was written by someone living in that time and place.  There is a lot of story in this book -- adventure, risk-taking, power-seeking, revenge.  I wasn't bored for a second.  There were scenes that made my heart ache, and Meyer wrote them beautifully.  There's also fun and humor, and some interesting tidbits about actual people, although they're not always named.  I chuckled at Jeanne Anne's encounter with a famous novelist.The story moves back and forth in time but it's not difficult to follow, and the story is well-suited to that structure.  If it had been told in a linear fashion, the revelations at the end wouldn't have had such an impact.  Meyer's writing style is clear and his dialogue is realistic.  He treats his characters and his readers with respect.I can't recommend this book enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLEWRVX0ITNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062120395#wasThisHelpful","RZLEWRVX0ITNZ","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young Victoria McQueen escaped from Charlie Manx, who ""rescues"" children from ""bad"" parents and takes them to Christmasland.  Years later, Manx kidnaps Victoria's son.  Plot in a nutshell.I was relieved when the book began with Charlie in prison, and in a coma.  Whew!  He was caught. He can't hurt anyone now.  That was a clever way to start the story, giving the reader a feeling of safety, all's right with the world, it's okay to relax.  Story over?  So soon?  Nuh uh.Joe then takes us on some rides, with Victoria as she uses her magic bridge to find lost things, and another with Charlie Manx and Bing Partridge, Manx's henchman, as Charlie seeks revenge.  Along the way we get to know Vic and her family, and her friend Maggie Leigh, another young woman with a magical ability.The book is long but not unnecessarily so.  I can't think of a single scene that should have been left out.  Everything adds to the story, to characterization, to atmosphere. There are no plot holes -- everyone behaves logically, for them.  The ending is extremely satisfying.  (Read the Note on the Typeface at the end, after the Acknowledgements.)I was almost scared off from reading this book because of review comments about explicit violence against women and children.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.  The evil of Charlie Manx and Bing Partridge had to be described, and Joe managed to do this without making it feel like a wallow.  Throughout the book, he showed sympathy for the victims -- more than what we see on the evening news.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QZDF2GBSR6PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062200577#wasThisHelpful","R2QZDF2GBSR6PA","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bird ""water cooler"" is cute, and it's well-designed.  I like that the manufacturer made it with a handle grip -- easy to hold while filling, easy to carry.  The bottle is about nine inches tall and it's sturdy plastic.  It couldn't be easier to fill and use, and I'm hoping the birds like it.We also have a standing bird bath/water feeder.  It's heavy (made of concrete), and has to be moved when we cut the grass.  It also needs to be cleaned every single day.  If the birds come to this hanging feeder (and why wouldn't they?), I think I'll re-purpose the other one, maybe use it for a planter.UPDATE:  While waiting to figure out where to hang the feeder, I set it on the ground under the oriole feeder, and the orioles are drinking from it.  I might just leave it there.  We have an unusual number of orioles this spring -- counted ten at one time today, so we're getting a second oriole feeder.

"I've read a lot of books about slavery but this was a new setting for me.  I was surprised to learn that the South African government imposed rules to protect slaves.  I wasn't surprised to learn that the rules weren't followed.  Somehow, the institution of slavery is made even more despicable -- that people in power recognized that the slaves needed protection but still allowed slavery to exist.I enjoyed most the chapters from Philida's point of view, especially when she relates the stories she grew up with, the myths and folk tales from her childhood.  She's observant and her observations are a joy to read.  The POV chapters from Cornelis and Francois were technically easier to read but more difficult because these people were less honest.This isn't a quick read, and for me at least, it wasn't a ""can't put it down"" kind of book.  Some parts move smoothly while others needed a more careful read.  And a map would have been helpful.

"What a marvelous book.  Two mythical beings arrive in New York City in 1899, the Golem newly created, the Jinni just released from a thousand-year imprisonment. I didn't know what to expect and worried that this might be a standard fantasy romance. Nope. It's about living in a new world, free will, responsibility, control, hope, sacrifice, ambition, God, fear -- all that good stuff.A Golem is a slave, strong and indestructible, without a will of its own.  Otto Rotfield wanted rabbi Yehudah Schaalman to make him a wife, and asked that she have intelligence and curiosity.  Schaalman made the Golem and turned it over to Rotfield with written instructions on how to waken it and how to destroy it.  Rotfield boarded a ship for America, with the Golem in a box in the cargo hold.  He wakens the Golem during the voyage but dies shortly after.  The Golem arrives in New York alone, newborn in a new world.The Jinni likewise wakes in a new world, in the typical way a Jinni wakes - by being freed from a container.  He has no memory of who imprisoned him or how long he's been asleep.The first part of the story has us following the Golem and the Jinni as they adapt to living with people, hiding their true natures.  But the Golem and the Jinni weren't the only characters who had to adapt.  Their existence affected the lives of everyone they encountered, and it wasn't always for the better.  They helped and they hurt, they were thoughtful and thoughtless, responsible and careless - just like ordinary human beings.  They fight against their natures, just like ""real people"".The real people in the story are just as interesting as the two supernatural creatures, and they all have a reason to be in the story.  And there's plenty of story.  The Golem and the Jinni are pursued by a powerful man who knows what they are and has his own uses for them.Wecker's prose style is clear, simple, and smooth. It's almost too readable.  I'm a fast reader but decided to slow down, to more fully appreciate her word choices.If there's any justice, the book will be a huge hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXCVMXYO437LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062110837#wasThisHelpful","RXCVMXYO437LE","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy to assemble, just three pieces -- a two piece handle and the cleaning head.  The two parts of the handle screw together -- it did take some muscle to get them tightly together -- and the head just snaps on.I've used this every day in the week that I've had it.  I've used it on carpeted floors and bare floors.  It's especially effective on bare floors.  With other vacuums, even those with a bare floor setting, stuff sometimes shoots out the side.  Not this one.It seems to have plenty of power -- it picks up small rocks with no problem.  The 40-minute runtime is accurate.  I've used it at least that long and haven't had to recharge.What I really like is that it will lay flat, which allows me to get under things that I used to have to move.  What I don't like (and this is probably standard with stick vacs) is that the smaller head means more passes to cover a floor.  For this reason, the Rowenta will be my spot pickup cleaner.  I'll still use the big vacuum prior to shampooing, or when I have to vacuum the entire floor.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price.  A cordless stick vac is a convenience, not a necessary tool.  If I had to choose between a stick vac and a regular vac, I'd have to choose the regular vac.Also, if you have pets, hair will get wound around the brushes, even more so than with a regular vacuum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWO041IO1PPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X6ATXC#wasThisHelpful","R1IWO041IO1PPY","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This table gets points for design, especially the curved legs, and the top, with slats instead of single piece construction.  Water won't puddle and it will be easy to clean.  The powder coat finish means it will stand up to the elements.The table came in two sturdy cardboard boxes, one inside the other, with styrofoam on all sides, and everything wrapped in plastic and taped.  The legs and the center piece are wrapped in heavy paper and also taped.As another reviewer mentioned, the assembly instructions are useless, and unnecessary.  The legs attach to the table using eight short screws and washers, and the brace attaches to the legs using four long screws and washers.  A special tool is included to tighten the screws.  My husband complained that it would have been easier if he could have used a ratchet wrench instead of the special tool, but that's a minor nitpick.  Assembly was a two-person job.  At the point where two legs are attached, we needed one person to hold the legs in place while the other person started the screws.  I don't know if this is the case with all the tables, or if ours just had a couple of holes slightly out of place.Don't lose any of the screws because extras are not included.The table is sturdy, attractive and lightweight, and I can't imagine that it won't last ""forever"".

"At about 40 cents each, this is a good value.  The pens write smoothly -- I've tried ten of them, and they don't skip.  The ink dries quickly.  No smudging, even if you immediately run your finger over the ink.The color choices are interesting.  About ten of them are what I'd describe as a brownish-mauve.  Plenty of pink and purple if (like me) you have granddaughters who love pink and purple.  The ink has a shine, almost sparkly.  The colors include gold and a silvery grey.  The colors are muted -- not what you'd call primary colors. The orange is more apricot or peach; there's a ""normal"" blue but also a teal and a baby blue.What I really like is the rubber barrel grip near the point.

"This book is an eye-opener and deserves to be ranked with other groundbreaking novels about social issues.  Askew makes us think about the issue of undocumented workers (I can't say ""illegal aliens"" anymore) without preaching at us.  She does this by showing the impact of thoughtless lawmaking on one struggling family.  And what an interesting family it is.The story is told through several different points of view.  There's ten-year-old Dustin, an orphan (white mother, Mexican father) being raised by his grandpa Bob; plucky Sweet, Bob's daughter and Dustin's aunt; Grandpa Bob, who didn't think much about Mexicans until his granddaughter married one; Monica Moorehouse, an ambitious state Congresswoman; and Luis, a Mexican man trying to find his sons.All these voices are well-done and realistic.  The characters' actions and motivations all make sense.  None of it feels like a Hallmark channel movie, and in lesser hands than Askew's, it might have gone in that direction.  And there's plenty of story here.  Sweet evaluates her life and her marriage, Dustin goes missing, a pastor finds strength.  Parts of it are funny but there's also tension.  The book was a ""page-turner"" and I looked forward to picking it up every day.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I wanted more nuance in the characters of the Congresswoman and the sheriff.  They were a bit stereotypical.  I know that there are people in Congress who think only of the next election and that there are small town sheriffs who abuse their power.  Askew did so well with the likable characters, I wanted more from the unsympathetic ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGIUUIF7JEU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062198793#wasThisHelpful","RNGIUUIF7JEU0","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know how in the movie ""Casino"", Robert DeNiro's character explains in a voice-over how casinos operate, how they catch cheaters and dishonest employees?  That was some good background, helpful to a viewer.  The difference between Ace Rothstein and Roger Hobbs is that Ace knew when to shut up and let us enjoy the movie.I thought about ""Casino"" when I started reading this book.  Hobbs goes into detail about armored cars, moving cash between banks and casinos, and he gives us a minute by minute countdown of the heist that's about to take place.  That held my interest and the details were warranted.  But even after the heist, Hobbs kept doing this -- giving us unnecessary details of mundane activities.  These details didn't add atmosphere or build character, they were filler.Hobbs leads the reader by the hand, doesn't seem to trust us to figure anything out for ourselves, and what's worse -- he tells us everything about everyone.  How someone can share so much detail and still leave the reader feeling empty is beyond me.  After awhile, you feel like a five-year-old who can't be trusted to dress himself.If you want to read something that doesn't require you to think for yourself, read this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E147BSREY3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307959961#wasThisHelpful","R1E147BSREY3E","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don Robertson is one of our most neglected writers.  Only a few of his books -- the books forming Morris Bird Trilogy -- are in print.  All his books are worth seeking out.  My favorites are ""Paradise Falls"" and his Civil War novels.In ""Mystical Union"", Robertson looks at the marriage of Barbara Sellers and Donald Pilgrim.  There is no plot to speak of.  The book is written in short chapters, skipping back and forth in time from the early 1900's to the 1970's.  We hear from Barbara and Don and from their friends, lovers, and relatives as they consider their lives and the choices they've made.  They think what might have been and they make peace with themselves and each other -- or not.  The point is that they're thinking, and they're very perceptive.  At one point the pragmatic Don looks at the stars, thinks about all the things he doesn't know and doesn't understand, and he wonders if we're seeking the right kind of knowledge.  It's one thing to understand the stars, quite another to understand people, even the people we're married to.  It's hard, and sometimes it's worth it, sometimes not.  Don recognizes this.One of my favorite passages in the book is from Barbara, looking back at her life.  I think it's a good illustration of Robertson's style and of the mood of the book -- not fatalistic so much as examining:""So then let it all go, Barbara.  Forget it, Barbara.  The girl is gone, Barbara.  Your sister Phoebe never would talk with you about any of it, and your sister Rosemary never even would have understood it, let alone talked about it.  So mourn then alone, Barbara.  The days of promise, of latticed shadows, of roofs and dollbabies and erasers and paint sets and silly hairy dogs. Phoebe lives alone now in a house that is full of caged birds.  Rosemary watches soap operas and loves her children and her husband, even if he doesn't have much of a chin.  They are what they are, and they accept.  So then do the same, Barbara.  So then mourn whatever you like, but accept the walls that crowd you, nudging your shoulders.  If it all is debris, then it all is debris.  At least you see it.  At least you understand the choice you made.  At least now and then you spy an edge of what you missed.  That just may be an accomplishment.""Robertson knows the Midwest and he knows small towns and small town people.  He looks at all of it without blinders -- there's no sloppy sentimentality  He sees the limitations but he also sees the value.  His writing can be raw, even vulgar, but it's honest.This was an intriguing book and one I will re-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19S6JY0W8FEYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399122370#wasThisHelpful","R19S6JY0W8FEYC","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Standard rubber mats have a solid surface -- those mats get slippery.  This mat is different.  The surface feels like fiber.  It's soft and cushiony -- very comfortable.  There are tiny holes in the mat and suction cups to help it adhere to the tub.  If you shower in your tub, this mat is much safer than a rubber mat with no drainage holes.Because this mat isn't made with rubber, it has no rubber smell.  It's machine washable and contains an antimicrobial agent to inhibit growth of mold and mildew.  The size is perfect for a standard tub.  You can move around without stepping off the mat.The label warns against use on a textured surface; the suction cups adhere better to a flat surface.  My tub has some textured strips but they're starting to wear, so the mat doesn't slip.If you're using a standard rubber mat in your tub/shower, consider replacing it with this one.

"Twenty-five years ago, on impulse, teenager Jon Willing and his two best friends stole money from drug dealers -- a lot of money.  They thought they were smart, that if they didn't spend the money conspicuously, no one would suspect them.  They went on with their ordinary lives, finished school, got married, moved on.  They kept in touch with weekly phone calls, and it looked like they'd gotten away with it, until one of them didn't answer that weekly phone call.  The chase is on.What elevates The Accounting above the standard thriller is character.  There's plenty of action but what kept me reading was learning about Jon.  We learn about Jon as Jon learns about Jon, as he figures out for himself why he did that dangerous, impulsive thing, and how that act formed his adult life, shaped his personality, affected all his relationships.  This insight was fascinating, and original.  However, he's not totally sympathetic; he's a mortgage broker, after all, and has more to answer for than robbing drug dealers. To his credit, he understands this.The book is peppered with Jon's thoughts on the economy, life in suburbia, Little League, conspicuous consumption, raising kids, country clubs and golf.  Some of this made me think and some made me laugh out loud.The book is a ""page-turner"".  When the action slows, there are interesting characters and often witty conversations.  (If it's filmed, there's a role tailor-made for Conchata Ferrell.)I'd recommend this to anyone, with a warning about graphic violence and some torture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR79VPWH1WCL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099358#wasThisHelpful","RR79VPWH1WCL0","AVHLBVRZI8ZEX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVHLBVRZI8ZEX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is however well made and I ordered it when I gave up on the NFL producing one of the more elaborate hats that have been offered for other Super Bowls. I guess the NFL really does not like the Patriots. Still a nice summer weight hat that brings my collection of Super Bowl Victory Hats to 4.

"Perfect for heating precooked frozen meats. Takes about 28 minutes and leaves them as fresh and juicy as the day they were cooked. Far better than microwave or long-term thawing which tends to toughen and dry meat. I've used it for fish, meatloaf, and chicken. Also excellent for steaming vegetables which take less time and can be added about ten minutes later. The lid is a bit fragile and mine needed a little super glue at the two-year point, but overall an excellent value. I use it daily and highly recommended it.Update: Hairline crack developed in plastic lid after two years of daily use and then handle fell off. Warranty only for one year and the cost of replacing the lid was almost as much as the complete unit.

"I've used two of these for two years and the first one died today. They have been used to charge my iPhone 4 and one charge (from 20% to 100%) just about exhausts the capacity. Best features are small size and built-in iPhone 4s and earlier connector -- will not work with iPhone 5 and beyond.  For this price, there cannot be much quality control and while mine were both good, it should not be surprising if you have to exchange a DOA. I would recommend buying two or more and returning the DOAs. If you expect more than this from a five dollar charger, you are living on the wrong planet. Much larger and more expensive chargers sold on Amazon have as much as five time the capacity and will also charge iPads. I purchased one by Jackery for that purpose and it works quite well. It does, however, require a not-included connector cable that is compatible with your device so that it will work with iPhone 5 as well as other smart phones, but not as convenient for iPhone 4 use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHB4KIYPV7RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XIBJKG#wasThisHelpful","R1GHB4KIYPV7RY","A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It charged to 100% and looked fine at first, but then the problems came. First, the remaining battery indication percentage was extremely erratic. It would remain at 100% after many shots, then suddenly show 50% or less, and then suddenly fail completely. It also failed to hold a charge when left in my EOS-6D overnight. I've purchased several other STK batteries and find that about one in three are duds, but the price and Amazon's easy return policy at first appeared to make it worth the risk. That changed when I learned that the voltage on this battery is higher than on the Canon battery and according to Canon can damage your 6D camera. I measured the voltage on both and found the STK to be .8 volts higher than the Canon. There are several different types of Li-ion battery cells (LCO, LMO, etc) and this battery may use a chemistry that accounts for the voltage difference.

"This is my second try at a cheap wireless remote for my 7D and I'm very happy with it.

"What they do not show in the pictures is a huge cable/connector collection that is not weatherproof and cannot be disconnected from the camera after wireless setup. This leaves you with the choice of either drilling a large hole (1-inch plus) in the side of your house, or building a special weatherproof enclosure (almost as big as the camera) to house the cables and connectors outside. In theory; all that should be needed after wireless setup is a very thin DC power cable that would require only a 1/8 inch hole to be drilled through the wall and require no extra housing for cables and connectors. I don’t know how much they saved by not designing the setup cable to be disconnected before outdoor installation, but they have certainly lost one customer for failing to do so.

"I've used my 5200 every day for the last 2-1/2 years and was surprised when it started to act up a bit. It would still work, but would occasionally surge to a higher speed when set for a low speed. I had not expected this as I have friends who have used theirs more heavily for five years or more with no problems at all. When I called Vitamix customer service, I discovered that the 7-Year warranty is golden. A very courteous and knowledgeable rep listened patiently to my description of the problem and told me that I would need to send it in to the factory. She then emailed me a prepaid UPS label which I affixed to the box -- which I had thankfully kept. The repaired and refurbished blender showed up at my doorstep 10 days after I dropped it off at the UPS store. Not only did they fix the problem, they gave me a new container and lid. Nothing that I could see was wrong with the old one. I've never before had such an experience with any warranty.While this is by far the best blender I've ever owned, I have dropped it one star because I have to use the tamper on about every fifth smoothie. It's a matter of what you put in it and how it is packed, and not a big deal to tamp it down. Just once to get it started and it does the rest on its own. It's also too tall to fit under my cabinets, but again not a big deal to take the container off for storage. They now make a wider and shorter one with the same capacity that should solve both of these minor problems and I might consider it if I ever need another blender. I've had enough bad experiences with cheaper blenders (Kitchenaid and Breville) that I would not take a chance on any other brand. Breville, by the way, was the absolute worst. In spite of the much higher price of the Vitamix, I have found it to be the least expensive on a cost per smoothie basis: $480 / 7-years x 365 days = 19 cents per smoothie; even if it goes belly up at exactly 7 years. I expect that it will last much longer.Strongest points for this Vitamix are ability to blend almost anything -- stringy oranges, frozen bananas, flax seeds, calcium pills, etc. and easy cleanup.Interesting Experiment: Smoothie too warm? While the Vitamix was out for repair, I used an old KitchenAid blender and noticed that my smoothies were colder than they had been in the Vitamix. When the Vitamix returned, I tried this experiment: Fill 1/2 with water and run for one minute at highest speed -- measure water temp before and after, then repeat at variable speed 7.  Result: Water temperature increased by 14 degrees at highest speed, but only 7 degrees at lower speed. I learned that the higher speed was overkill for my smoothies and now blend them at variable speed 7 with an occasional high speed burst. Alternative is to add a little ice. This is not a flaw of the blender, but a simple illustration of the First Law of Thermodynamics -- more kinetic energy equals more heat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1GTSR3D8GH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G53V7O#wasThisHelpful","R1L1GTSR3D8GH7","A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the original two pairs of 512MB Modules in my Dell 8300 for a total of 2GB before this upgrade. After swapping out one pair for this 2GB upgrade I expected to see a total of 3GB and that is what the Crucial system scanner shows that I have. Windows XP (SP 3) however only shows 2.5GB of RAM under computer-properties. Don't have a clue why this would happen, but the system does seem a bit faster anyway. It is possible that you need to reconfigure the system BIOS to recognize the full 3GB, but there are no instructions for that.UPDATE: After installing two more sticks of Crucial 1GB for a total of 4GB, Windows XP Pro (32bit) is still showing only 2.5GB of memory available. All four sticks are identical 1GB Crucial, and I've determined that they are all working properly by inserting them one at a time. I also have the latest BIOS A07 installed. Going to setup at boot up shows that all 4 sticks are properly installed.

"If you don't mind downloading the instructions from the web, this referb unit is the way to go. I purchased mine from Dealville and it was delivered in about four days.

If you screw up in the initial connection to your PC, use the reset button on the extender and start over. The button must be held in for about five seconds. This extender is especially effective in situations where your Wi-Fi router is at one end of your house and coverage is weak or nonexistent on the other end. Just put this device in a spot where you already have good coverage near the middle of your house and it will do wonders. It creates a second network with an extension of _EXT on the end of your old network name. The new network has the same password as your old one and will be picked up automatically once you've signed in on your iPad or iPhone. The download speed will probably be about 40% slower than on your primary network, so that you may be better off on the original network for NETFLIX HD movies.

"I almost gave this thing away when I found that it would not work with my New iPad (3rd Gen) and USB flash drives, or with CF Card Readers. It also failed with several SD cards with an indication of too much power required. I then discovered that it does two things very well: Retrieving photos (even RAW format) and videos via USB directly from my Canon EOS 7d to my iPad, and transferring videos and photos from my iPhone 4 to my iPad. It allows me to select the photos and videos that I want to transfer and my iPad displays them (even the RAW Canon images) in all their glory. It does the same for images and videos on my Sony Cyber-shot HX30V when a micro-USB cable is substituted for the mini-USB cable, and does so without the compression loss of Sony's Play Memories Wi-Fi app. The second connector that is supposed to read SD cards is worthless since the iOS upgrade that limited power to external devices. Bottom line is that this kit only works with self-powered devices, but is so handy to use with my EOS 7D, Sony HX30V and iPhone that I'm glad I did not give up on it. I'm told that it works with most other Canon and Nikon cameras, but you need to read more reviews to find out if it works with yours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYGKOSGQ8OOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K1EYM6#wasThisHelpful","R1VYGKOSGQ8OOX","A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this is a solid printer with full control over printing options when used with a PC, the lack of control when printing from an iPhone or iPad make it prohibitively expensive for AirPrint. Because you cannot preview or select the particular page you wish to print from Safari, or any other app that I've tried, you must print the whole document. To make things worse, you cannot select B&W when you do not need color. As a result, you typically get two or three color pages when all you need is one B&W page. When you consider the price of replacing all four cartridges, this makes it outrageously expensive to use AirPrint. While the HP website indicates that some iPad and iPhone apps allow you to select a page range, I have yet to find an app that offers that option. Also, I find nothing on their website that indicates an option to select B&W vs color. If AirPrint is to become a truly usefull feature, Apple needs to work with app developers and printer manufacturers to offer more control options.Finally, I'm a bit disappointed to find that the two-sided printing is not automatic. While the specification does say that it is manual, automatic two-sided printing is a standard feature on many less expensive printers -- such as my four-year-old Brother Laser.In summary, this printer is easy to set up with iPhones,iPads and Win 7 PCs and produces high quality documents.  The limited AirPrint control and functionality however makes it less than a bargain.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIFQ12FCZAEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044XSNHG#wasThisHelpful","RWIFQ12FCZAEX","A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review started off as a five star two weeks ago, but things have changed. The first problem took the form of erratic ""remaining capacity"" readings from my Canon EOS 7d. It might read 65% after a shooting session and then magically return to 100% after sitting around for an hour or more. It would, however, return to 65% after one or more shots, so I decided to live with this and did not change my review. A week later, it does not fully charge on my Canon charger. After charging overnight, the charger lights were still blinking and the capacity read only 57% in the camera. This has now happened twice. Most recently, the battery failed in the middle of recording a 10-minute video clip when it should have had plenty or capacity left. I haven't decided whether to go through the hassle of asking for a replacement as I don't know if the replacement would be any better. As much as I hate to pay Canon's inflated battery price, I guess I'll stick with them. Too bad as this looked like a really good deal.Update (7-25-2012): After two months, I decided to give Sterlingtek's one-year guarantee a try and called their customer service to find out if it was worth the trouble. They sent a replacement the next day with no grief or hastle. It arrived by Fedex Express and has worked perfectly through three recharge cycles. Given their guarantee and responsive customer service, I now consider the price to make it worth a try and would recommend buying directly from the company. I will update this review if the replacemtnt gives me problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GT9CLIUQ29UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DEHVC8#wasThisHelpful","R3GT9CLIUQ29UD","A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UFAKH7Y8VH5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This should be called the Premium Heart Rate Monitor PLUS Soft Strap. While it would be nice to order the strap only (it is the item that wears out), I have not found a way to do that. As for this monitor/strap combination, it is the same one that comes with the Forerunner 610 and I find it much better than my old Polar monitor/strap. It is a lot more comfortable and does a much better job of ignoring interference from power lines and other sources of electromagnetic interference. I've yet to see a single spike in areas where my old Polar monitor routinely went berserk. I was very lucky to order it before Amazon recognized that it was more than a strap and increased the price by 50%. Even at the new price, I would recommend it as a replacement strap plus spare monitor. My one gripe is that it is not compatible with my Precor Treadmill or Life Fitness elliptical which both work with my old Polar monitor.

"I wish that I had read more reviews more carefully before I bought this thing. It was fine for about six months and then the problems started. First it started beeping at odd times while on the charger. Then the screen froze. Then the charger started to discharge the watch rather than charge it. While I expect Garmin to send a replacement, a closer look at the other Amazon reviews tells me that the replacement will probably not last much longer than this one did.

"I already had a 12-foot pull-cord type pruner which is great for larger higher branches, but nearly impossible to handle on small lower branches that require a near horizontal reach.

While it is perfect for soft wood (new growth, etc) up to 1/2"" in diameter, I would not recommend it for larger harder branches and would not expect a pruner this light and handy to be used for such heavy duty work. The cutting blade is extremely sharp, so that surprisingly little force is needed.

"This armband is far too much trouble for me to actually use. First, I must remove the bumper case from my iPhone 4. Next, the phone must be squeezed into a very tight armband compartment. So tight that I initially thought they had sent me the wrong armband. After doing this, you have a visible display in an awkward viewing position along with buttons that sometimes work. For those who need to have their iPhone display in full view (at least for passers-by) throughout a run, this may be necessary, but that is not a requirement for me. The iPhone's audio beeps and rings, along with the Nike-GPS app's announcements of pace and time at half mile intervals are all I need or want.

When I stumbled upon this Amazon version, the price seemed too good to be true. I was pleased to discover that it is exactly the same product.

"From what I can tell these batteries are ok, but I haven't used them long term so I cannot vouch for their reliability.  I do have some comments that may be helpful for fellow Amazon customers:  I switched to Amazon Basics alkaline batteries several months ago and have found that brand to be the best value.  One of the main reasons I prefer Amazon's brand is because of their frustration-free recyclable packaging.  GoGreen touts how green their products are.  Why then wrap the batteries in difficult-to-open clamshells?  Also their recycling program leaves much to be desired.  It isn't exactly free, as you must ""earn"" a certain number of points to get a free mailing label.  It's a hassle.  GoGreen's labeling displays the ""VetCanDo"" logo, whose mission includes bringing manufacturing jobs back from overseas.  But these batteries are made in China, so I think that's hypocritical.  I realize my review is more about the manufacturer and less about the batteries.  But I will continue to purchase Amazon's brand because I know they are good and reliable, less expensive, and much easier to open.  On a positive note, the GoGreen's batteries came with an excellent ""use-by"" date of 2021.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZMKJ2F4DU65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWP0C94#wasThisHelpful","RPZMKJ2F4DU65","A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, who doesn't use surge protectors nowadays?  This surge protector will accommodate four electronic devices, as long as the total load doesn't exceed 1800 watts, plus the added feature of two USB chargers.

It's nice to be able to plug all my computer geek stuff into the same power strip and keep our phones charged at the same time.

I had the first one mounted on the same pole for two years and I had no birds in my yard.

"This steam mop is useful in a lot of ways, especially if you have large kitchens and bathrooms.  Not recommended for floors such as laminate or unsealed hardwood floors.  A couple of nice things about this mop are:  It stands up on its own.  No more propping it up against a wall.  Extra long cord.  Comes with over a dozen attachments:  brushes, scraping tool, window squeegee, grout cleaners and lots more.  Has a mesh bag to put all these attachments in.  Easy to use.As far as its operation, the steam mop works like any other steam mop I've owned.  Put water in the reservoir, wait 30 seconds for it to heat up, and SLOWLY mop the floor.  The steam will continue for about 20 minutes on one tankful (about 13oz).  This unit comes with two microfiber pads, one of which is more coarse than the other, for harder to clean surfaces.  When I used it, the mop easily erased spilled dried coffee stains from the floor.Something unique to this mop is its ""easy scrubber"" that attaches to the rear of the microfiber pad which helps get sticky stuff up.And of course, the big draw to this mop is that it has a detachable hand-held pod for surface cleaning and sanitizing.  Great for kitchen and bath counters.I found filling the reservoir to be sort of awkward because you have to lie the mop on its side to add the water.  No big deal, just different.  Also, I found it pretty hefty and some may think it's too heavy to handle on a daily basis.Overall a very versatile cleaning tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9Q8Z0R1NX8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LS47SA#wasThisHelpful","R2I9Q8Z0R1NX8D","A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C9Q3KTNNLJJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the best leadership books I've ever come across.  This book actually tells the writer's story of success.  Exactly what he did.  No stratified concepts or theories with no practical, specific stories.  Capt. Marquet actually tells very specific, seemingly small and inconsequential stories, about running his submarine and managing the people onboard.  One of the best parts of this book is that, in his situation, he was stuck with these people that were performing poorly and couldn't just replace the personnel.  He was forced to deal with the people he had and make them better employees.This book really shines for mid to mid/high managers because he uses examples where he is levels removed from the people, but still has interactions with them and has to make decisions influencing their lives without being their direct supervisor.  There is good stuff to be had here for first line supervisors, but this book is really the perfect learning experience for those a level or two above that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AUCB2I1I7CUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846404#wasThisHelpful","R2AUCB2I1I7CUB","A2E1OU9011O1KE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1OU9011O1KE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing is awesome! Tested on iPhone 6, Android, and PC. Works great with all of them. On Windows 7, I had to wait a few moments for it to install drivers, but it was plug and play.  Purchased from J-made (Amazon listing) in Japan and saved a ton (about a third) over Amazon and other sellers and still received a US unit shipped from Japan.  Choose expedited shipping and received it in about six calendar days.This thing does not require any intervention from you (aside from selecting the correct input and adjusting the volume knob) and does not require the onkyo player software to work. It improves all sound on all three sources.  I can now crank up my volume and there is no hiss and the music is much punchier, clearer, and more distinct.I listened to the sources with my Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 ohm headphones and my Sennheiser HD600 300 ohm cans as well.  My wife tried it and her words were ""Wow, you really can hear more than without one""Surprisingly, it is very noticeable even with low quality 128kbps files.  You can clearly hear that they sound like garbage, but they sound like better garbage.Side benefit was that using this into my car's Aux input had drastically increased the sound quality of the music I listen to on my commute.  Night and day difference.This is the single best consumer audio purchase I've made.  Very pleased.  Everyone who listens to a lot of music on the go should get one of these.*Update*  Absolutely love this but wanted to comment to explain that this ""comes"" with the Onkyo DSD hi-res player app.  I was very confused at first because I downloaded the app from the app store and installed it.  It asked me for $10 to upgrade the player to DSD and hi-res ability (the player plays low res files for free).  I was very upset as the box says that the player is included.

"The double sided tape on this was a little too weak.  Mine just fell off the wall one day.  Had to install with screws.  Fortunately, installation is a snap since you can drill and screw right through the front because of the dispenser opening.  This makes real installation a snap due to just being able to eyeball this and still have it mount straight!  The idea is great, and we love having this at home to tidy up the old box and bag we used to use to store grocery bags for our dog walks.  Why only three stars?  Well, the tape mentioned previously is one reason.  The other reason is that the bags tend to just bunch up at the top and not fill in the bottom dispensing area all that well.  It works fine until you develop any decent amount of bags when it starts bunching.

"Set up was fairly simple.  Got it set up and running quickly.  Google Cloud Print worked well.  Suddenly, within a month, the printer stopped working over wifi, disappeared from the networks.  Couldn't get it back up after a whole day of trying (and I used to do this for a living). Works over USB still, but bought this for wifi and cloud print!!!  I suspect the wifi card went bad.  Don't know why.  Also, this thing draws a ton of power and causes the lights on the same circuit to flicker constantly...maybe related to whatever crapped out?  Maybe I got a bad one?  Maybe UPS dropped it?  Either way, I'm very disappointed.  Contacting Brother support to see about an exchange.  Will change if a replacement has no problems.UPDATE: After spending two days resetting and trying over, I got it to connect.  Not sure why the first several tries didn't work.  Very frustrating but it eventually did come back online.  A search of their support forums shows that several people had weird problems with its deep sleep mode knocking it offline.Next UPDATE:  The unit apparently defaults to a dynamic IP address (I learned this with a lot of searching online) which causes it to go offline all of the time.  If you can get this to stick to a single IP address, the offline issue goes away.  Apparently, Windows connects to this using some wireless printing standard that makes it jump all over the place so services like Google Cloud Print lose track of it and it needs to be reconnect and reregistered repeatedly.  I learned to log into the printer using a web browser to reconnect it to my services when I do this, but it is a real hassle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1K0WL4DZ8M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZS5EEI#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1K0WL4DZ8M6","A2E1OU9011O1KE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E1OU9011O1KE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing looks great and the cutouts are perfect and gorgeous.  This only problem I have with this is that the fit on the buttons (volume, power) is a little off...too easy to accidentally trip the power switch, a little too difficult to use the volume-up button.  It's not like it made the phone difficult to use, just the occasional look at the phone to make sure I'm pressing what I want (unlike some cases that are easier to use by feel).  Overall, a really nice case.  Nice matte finish that isn't sticky, glossy accents look great.UPDATE: After living with this case for a few weeks, I wanted to update my review.  I said that the buttons were a little off... they are not... they just really make it easy to accidentally push them.  The fit is great and it has worn well without blemish, but the side buttons are a little too hidden to use easily by feel and they really increase how easy it is to trip them.  Much less effort than without the case. I am constant turning off my screen by accident.  Overall, its what I like in a case: slim, protective, and good looking.

You can't move the monitors around once you get them positioned with this bracket.  Very sturdy once tightened.  Very difficult to get set up with one person.  It's too hard to line up and tighten by yourself.These things mount in just about any position, but must be tightened to that position and then the monitors will not move.

"Very secure attachment to the headrest.  Clever design.  Very easy to snug in any tablet and twist to any location.  I'd give it 5 stars except for one design flaw:  You mount the one bracket to the headrest - rock solid.  You mount the tablet in the other bracket - again, solid.  You then slide the tablet bracket into four small slots on the headrest bracket...these grooves are only about 5mm deep.  Any bump (like your kids might do) on the bottom half of the tablet knocks the tablet up and out of the grooves and it falls to the floor.  Annoying.

"This shoe rack is a useful space saver. It makes sense to keep shoes on a little shelf and this rack holds 20 pairs of shoes.The instructions are brief, but the diagrams look clear. I admit, I have not yet been able to assemble the rack. I will need to try again with a little help. The instructions say to press the rods into the little plastic cups with your fist or a mallet. I tried my fist -- ouch! I tried a rolling pin and it did not work. It seems like the little rods might be a little wide for the little ""cups"".I won't downgrade them more than a star for my lack of DIY skills. However, I have previously assembled a shoe tree similar to this that was all metal. However, it may require two people to get the correct angle.The frame is plastic. It is moderately firm -- not the weakest plastic but not the sturdiest either. I really was not sure whether it would survive hammering. But it did survive my rolling pin. The rods are metal. I have some concerns about the durability. But it is a shoe rack, how sturdy does it need to be?Finally, I looked at the retail price. I realized this is at least as expensive as the shoe rack I have. The one I have was easy to assemble and has lasted at least 5 years so far. I cannot really suggest this one over it. Sadly, I bought it in a shop and never saw the brand. The design is similar to this but all metal.

"I wanted to love this as I love coffee and I love cold brew coffee. The bottle is attractive and looks like it is good quality.However, in practice...I have made cold brew coffee in a normal French Press coffee pot and also in a mason jar (strained with a cheese cloth). Both of those methods yielded stronger coffee and they both worked faster. I grind my own beans, so maybe my grind isn't right for this bottle. The strainer is very fine and it took a couple days before my water looked like coffee. Sadly in that time, the bottle sprung a leak and leaked coffee all over the bottom shelf in my refrigerator. You see, the bottom of this bottle comes off. It has a rubber real, but this is how you fill the strainer or how you clean it (the bottle top is too small). After a couple days they seal started to loosen. The coffee did taste nice, but honestly, I probably will not use it again.

"I like spinning workouts but find them very uncomfortable. I am just not built right for sitting on the cycles and always feel bruised for days after. These shorts help.

"​This mop system is useful and clever.I found it was easy to assemble. It came with a very short instruction sheet that included photographs.The buckets uses two spinning actions -- one to clean the mop and the other to dry it. While assembly was easy, I had a slight learning curve in learning to use the mop. Specifically in getting the spin action to work correctly. This was easily fixed, I just overlooked one detail in the instructions that prevented me from getting a straight angle when spin drying the mop. Once it worked, it was very much like a salad spinner.On the plus side: The kit includes 2 mop heads, a duster, and a scrub brush as well as the mop and bucket system. It is feature rich. The spinning action does remove the extra water from the mop. And it worked well on my floor. The mop head can be angled to clean different spaces.Any downsides? I feel the bucket is a little large for my apartment, but this would be a plus for those who live in larger houses. I also feel the mop head is a little flimsy. During my first use of the mop 3 strands fell off. I could see a head lasting about a month at this rate, maybe a little longer depending how clean it stays.Overall, I am pleased and impressed with this mop system.I received a complimentary mop to review.

"I have been curious about a salad spinner, but hesitant to try one. I thought of them as a novelty one-trick pony type item that would take too much space in my small kitchen.I was partially right and partially wrong! In truth, this salad spinner from Brieftons works wonderfully. I use it to remove excess water from freshly washed salad leaves, herbs, kale and other vegetables. Yes, I use it for other vegetables too. I have used it almost daily since receiving this salad spinner.I find the lever and button system works well, however, this is the first salad spinner I have used.I was partially right as it does take a little extra space in my kitchen.

"When I opened the package I expected to love this dispenser. The idea is great. It is a glass bottle with a shot glass dispenser at the top.In reality, it was a huge mess and disappointment. I could not get it to work. I think most likely something was wrong with mine, but I reached out to the company and received no response. Considering that I received a sample of this item to review, the fact they did not respond really does not make me trust their customer service for paying customers!Anyway, when I press the buttons there is a large air opening (between one and two inches) on each side (see on the diagram where the grey button it). Oil sometimes comes out. And no oil makes it to the shot glass. When I turn it upside down and press the button oil gushes out all over my kitchen counter. There seems to be no way to cleaning dispense oil into the little shot glass.I think most likely I received a faulty or damaged product. It happens. But usually if that happens the company offers to replace the item. This did not happen in my case. I could not exchange it as I received the item free to review. I tend to think if a company ignores their reviewers, they might do similar to their customers. So I guess buy at your own risk.If you receive one that works -- it is an attractive dispenser and it seems like it would be a nice way to control or measure the amount of oil you use. This would be a great cooking gadget for someone on a diet who likes to track or monitor their food consumption.I received a free Oil and Vinegar Dispenser to review.

"This gift pack includes three lovely lotions from LeliaSea Cosmetics. I have previously reviewed a couple of them individually and as a set they make a delightful gift.All three are lightly scented and elegantly textured moisturizers.

"This protein powder is delicious and blends well into my smoothies.I am not sure I like Stevia, and it is sweetened with Stevia. So I didn't give it 5 stars, but I know a lot of people love Stevia. However, despite that,  it is one of my favorite protein powders.I typically use protein powders to boost my smoothies and sometimes while cooking. I used this powder to make a vanilla coffee protein shake. I used cold brewed coffee (made the night before), 1 scoop of this protein, and about 4 ounces of Coconut/almond milk. I blended using my blender. The result was a thick shake that reminded me of a coffee milkshake without the sugar and as much fat (and it contained 25 grams of protein!). This is a nice treat, or a morning pre-workout pick-me-up. I drink coffee in the morning anyway and have difficulty exercising on am empty stomach.

"These Leather Gardening Gloves are adorable, durable and seem true to size. I ordered my normal size and they fit well.I originally thought I would use them for golf as that is one of the uses mentioned. My hands get cold in the cooler months and thought I would like to wear gloves on both hands. While the appearance is sporty, I feel the leather on the palm is too thick for that use. If they were sold as golf gloves I would give them 3 stars. However, they are described as gardening gloves.I have used them for workouts as well. Mainly for kettlebell and weights. I have some workout gloves that I generally prefer, except the set of weights I own is very rough on my soft hands. This pair does solve that issue. Normally I prefer fingerless gloves for workouts to maintain grip, but the exception is when I use the weights I have at home due to the rough texture of the handles. If you have a similar set of weights, you might like more protective gloves like these. Otherwise, I would leave them to gardening and work where your hands need protection.Finally as work and gardening gloves. These gloves are cute and protective. I usually lose some sense of coordination and flexibility with work gloves. These are not bad as far as work gloves go. The glove fits well and is flexible.I received a free pair of these gloves to review.

"I have used a basic basal thermometer for a while and this is definitely an improvement.I like that the display is a little larger than a typical thermometer. This thermometer allows me to program a date and time. Both of these features make it easier to track and record my daily readings.The backlit display is also useful since I take my temperature first thing in the morning in a dark room.Overall I am pleased with this thermometer. The readings seem similar to my previous thermometer so I have no concerns about the accuracy. My understanding is the thermometer has an alarm clock. I think that is a nice feature, but I haven't figured out how to get it to work. It could be that I am not hearing the beep.

"This Vanilla Bean powder is amazing. I love vanilla. Not all vanilla, some cheap vanilla is just sweet but lacks flavor (it's okay but is obviously the reason people use the term ""vanilla"" to describe ""duller"" tastes). I tend to prefer items containing a pure vanilla extract or an infusion from vanilla beans. There is a huge difference! I feel that good vanilla is equal to good chocolate. Of course, it is all just personal preference.  That is why I was eager to try a vanilla bean powder.So far, I have enjoyed this powder in smoothies and in coffee drinks. I have not yet baked with it. In coffee, I have had two ways -- I added it to brewed coffee or I have added it to coffee grounds during the brewing process. Either way works. I usually add it just because the other person who drinks the coffee does not like flavored coffees. Though I personally prefer adding it during the brewing process because the vanilla powder does not fully dissolve (it is kind of like cinnamon or powdered ginger in that way).In coffee, it adds a rich vanilla scent, smooths the flavor so it seems less bitter, but does not add much sweetness (unless you also add sugar or sweetener). I associate the taste and smell of vanilla with a sweet flavor, but it is nice and different to enjoy unsweetened vanilla coffee.I also add it to fruit smoothies or Greek yogurt with fruit. In this case the vanilla is sweetened by the fruit sugars and is more similar to the flavor I am accustomed to. This powder blends really well with banana's for a sweet treat without guilt. (I know some people avoid fruit due to the sugar, but I do eat fruit daily).The powder is very fine in texture. On problem I have is that sometimes if someone opens the bag too quickly some floats out and I have a small mess to clean. This happens a little more than I would expect because people want to smell the contents of the bag. Other than that, I am impressed with the vanilla powder and expect to purchase more when I run out.I received a free sample of Sunny Day organics Vanilla Bean Powder for review.

"I found these storage boxes easy to assemble, attractive and they seem fairly sturdy. I think they are great for a variety of purposes such as containing cosmetics, bottles, craft items, small electronic gadgets, and more.They seem to be made of cloth covered cardboard. The bottom is a thin fabric until you insert the base square. I wouldn't recommend this for super heavy-duty use. But once assembled, it is a decent and attractive storage option.I used mine for small computer, phone and electronics accessories. I was able o fit my Cocoon GRID-IT! Organizer Case, Blue (CPG7BL) inside to keep my cables and chargers tidy. I put other electronics accessories inside the box. My very messy desk area is a lot neater now! I think a couple sets would be wonderful for closet organization too.The only things I wish were different -- I would love lid and for the material to be just a little more sturdy. In truth, it is just as I hoped and expected. I knew it didn't have a lid, just in hindsight it would allow stacking. And the material is durable enough given the purpose and price range.I like that these boxes fold completely flat for storage. I may be folding-challenged in that often items that advertise as foldable are not easily folded (by me). These boxes are easy to fold.

"I just love this microphone because I sometimes use my iPhone or iPad to make videos. The built-in sound is not quite good enough. I needed a microphone that would enhance my voiceovers or narration without picking up too much background noise. I feel this microphone does the job well (for my purposes anyway).With the included adapter, it was pretty much plug and play! I am reasonably good at getting my personal tech to work, but it is nice not to have to spend extra time getting something to work.Sometimes the cushioned microphone cover slips off. When that happens the mic picks up extra sound from my breathing or any wind. However, I am satisfied when the cover is on the mic. I had recorded a test using the audio notes app on my iPhone and this mic definitely was an improvement over the built-in mic. I will duplicate the in the near future for a video example and upload it to this review when I get a chance.I think this microphone is great for hobbyists like me who need to improve their i-device sound for video recordings (or for audio recordings), but also need an affordable option. The only downside (other than the mic cover issue) is that you cannot hear what you record without headphones. This isn't a big issue for me, but maybe for some of the pros and podcasters. I also reviewed another USB microphone that I think gives slightly better sound, however that other mic is at a higher price point, is not as easily adapted to a phone and is larger and less convenient. There are always trade-offs. I like and will continue to use both -- this microphone I will use when recording with my phone.I love the lavalier design as it clips nicely in place.I received a free iPro-Max Microphone for review.

"These flameless LED candles provide tranquil, soothing lighting. They are controlled with a remote control that offers a choice of about a dozen colors and a few modes including one that cycles through all the colors. Overall, I am pleased with the color options and mood provided by these LED candles.These are my second LED Wax candles. The first I used and reviewed is very real looking. These are not as authentic looking, but they are still a lovely lighting feature. I am happy with them and feel they are a good value.I do have one issue and that is the battery power. Each candle requires 3 AAA batteries. (Not included, be sure you have 9 AAA batteries on hand). Sadly, the first set of batteries (Amazon basics) only lasted less than 2 weeks before the candles started blinking abruptly (not soothing at all as it is a fast blink like an emergency signal). I thought something was wrong and emailed the company, but received no response at all. I decided to change the candles and that fixed it. I was running the candles for about 2-3 hours in the evening starting at dinner time for about 7-9 nights before this happened. The battery life seems poor.

"This is a simple device that is designed to help your golf swing. It simulates a golf club. The shaft is flexible, and there is a small weight at the end. It has a slightly off balance weight like a club, and it feels very much like one. The difference is the shaft is slightly flexible, and there is no club head. This allows you to practice your golf swing at home with less fear of hitting objects.I like to practice a few minutes here and there, and I also like to practice a little during commercials. I also do a little practice during my workout warmups. So far, so good...I am a beginner level golfer. I have had a few lessons and I play every week or two when time and weather allow.  The course I most often use does not have a driving range, so any pre-game practice is putting and chipping. I found that my longer distance swing has improved a lot.

I am happy with my existing products but decided to try since I received this gel for review. I used a little aloe gel with a little argan oil (mixed in my palm). It seems like a very light gel that made my slightly frizzy (chlorine damaged) hair seem smooth and shiny looking. I don't think it has much holding power for serious styling, but may be a nice natural alternative for a little hair taming.I received a sample of La Lune Naturals aloe Vera Gel for review.

"I find this style of garlic and ginger grater easier to use for ginger than a press. It is also easier to clean than a press. It doesn't mince garlic as finely as my press, but I like a lot of garlic so it isn't a problem for me.I found this tool easy to use and easy to clean. It also seems very durable (it is made of stainless steel). I am impressed with the functionality and simplicity. I like that it can be used both the grate and to mince garlic and ginger.

"This set comes with 3 bars of soap. The soap is attractive and presented well in an organza bag. I mention this because they make a lovely gift.Each is individually wrapped. They smell amazing. I like elegant soaps. I am using one of the bars and find it moisturizing and pleasant to use. I like starting the day using a lovely soap in the shower. Some harsh soaps dry my skin too much, but I haven't had that experience with the Safron Dream soap from this set. The soap appears very nice quality. I have used other Sublime Beauty products and so far they have all been quality.  I am also using the lotus Simplicity as a hand soap and it is also lovely. I like soaps that contain shea butter as they tent to be less drying to the skin.I expect the other bars of soap to be wonderful, I will update if I learn otherwise. I find that a bar of soap this size typically lasts a couple of months if I keep it in a draining soap dish.So far, I highly recommend this set based on my experience with this brand, the presentation of the items, the ingredient list and my experience using the two of the three bars.I received this soap set for free to review, all opinions and experiences described are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E30KZOLWLKS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011D74FIG#wasThisHelpful","R1E30KZOLWLKS2","A2U9XJLVW3HLYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U9XJLVW3HLYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do my laundry in a shared facility in my apartment building. So it is hard for me to test whether these dryer balls shorten drying time since I always have to enter a certain minimum dry time to even use the machines. However, when I do a load of towels and cotton items my clothes do not get completely dry  within the minimum time. With these dryer balls, my towels do get completely dry. So I do believe that these wool dryer balls can improve the efficiency of a dryer and save a little energy.I was impressed with how soft and fluffy my towels were. Since they were mostly cotton, static was not much of an issue. However, I feel my workout clothing have less static when I use these dryer balls. I do not use dryer sheets for a variety of reasons. Some irritate my skin, I feel the extra chemicals are unnecessary for me, and that is one thing I don't want to spend money on (I am a little cheap when it comes to household and cleaning supplies).

It is surprisingly heavy for the size and is decorated with a little crystal.I personally prefer a slightly bigger pen just because it feels better in my hand.

"So far I love everything about this baking dish. It is attractive and stylish. It has a simple, striking design on the bottom of the dish and on the handle. This dish also seems durable. And it is made in the USA! I buy and use plenty of products that were manufactured abroad, but I do keep an eye out for made-in-the-USA products.I wish I had a smaller version of the same. This dish bakes about 6-8 servings of casserole. It is wonderful to have on-hand.

"Using this band, I was able to do pull ups for the first time ever. I reviewed a different, lighter-resistance band but I really needed a little more assistance and this band is perfect for me now.It is easy to use the Bold Tribe Pull Up Band. I took mine to a park playground and was able to figure it out right away. You simply loop the band on your pull up bar then step into it (or kneel into it). The resistance of the band supports some of your body weight to make it easier to do a pull up. I like this because other exercises can train the muscles, but it really helps to practice technique. I have heard being able to do pull ups is partially about using the right technique and partially about strength and coordination. I found that to be the case with push ups. I recently built up enough strength to do on toes push ups for the first time in my life. I find with compound body weight exercises part of the challenge is getting various muscle groups to work together and hold form. Good form makes it easier, but it takes practice and conditioning. I think this band will help a lot with developing my ability to do pull ups!I received a free Bold Tribe band for review.

"These socks from Fuego are comfortable and supportive. I have a white pair and a black pair.I wore the black socks on a day when I was on my feet all day for work. I walked miles wearing them.

"This is the best spray bottle I have used so far. I like to make home made bath, beauty, personal care and sometimes cleaning products. (By home made cleaning products I mean mixing vinegar, water and a little essential oil or other very simple classic combinations). I have a few plastic bottles that I use for my cleaning supplies and tat is fine. They are designated for the purpose.I use this glass bottle more for personal care/beauty items. I like that it is glass so it is easier to clean than plastic and doesn't retain scent from the strongly scented oils I sometimes use. Also, since it is a dark amber color it prevents light from breaking down the ingredients. The bottle also contains a mini-strainer to keep the nozzle from getting clogged up. The sprayer is adjustable and so far works perfectly.Any downside? Well, it is glass (both a plus and minus). Since it is glass, I have to be a little careful where and how I use it. Right now I have a homemade shaving oil in it and I use it in the shower when I shave my legs. Glass bottles, oil, water and small shower shelves -- uh, scary combination! I have to be careful.I received a free Emmi's Essential bottle for review purposes, all opinions and experiences described are my own.

"I like to burn candles, but there are some places it would be nice to have candle light without concern over safety.I have been intrigued by the new LED wax candles. I once received a plastic LED candle as a present and it works fine in a lantern but looks very fake. Not this one! I am surprised at how real this looks. I was even scolded for having a lit candle so close to the houseplants on the window sill!The fake ""flame"" is a thin flat metallic flame shaped bit (technical term!). Up close it looks fake, but it does sway with bits of air. When the light is on the effect looks like a flickering, gently swaying flame. It is quite clever! In pictures and on video it looks real unless you zoom in really close from above.This electric candle is perfect to add atmosphere , soft light and decoration in areas where you do not want to use actual candles. I am impressed with how real and elegant this candle looks.Any downsides: Maybe the price (it may seem expensive compared to candles, but it should last much longer!).

"I knew the second that I opened the bag that I would love Purple Tractor Coffee! The aroma revealed a warm, rich tasting coffee.I enjoyed Purple Tractor as did everyone I shared it with. Flavor preference is so subjective. I typically like stronger flavored coffees. I usually do not like bitter flavors, but for some reason I don’t mind certain bitter flavors such as dark chocolate, olives or a nice cup of coffee. To me, Purple Tractor was well-balanced and not quite as bitter as some stronger coffees. It is labelled as a medium roast so this isn’t entirely surprising. I did find the beans look a little darker than some medium roast coffees and even darker than a few “dark roasts” I have tried!Yes, you shouldn’t judge “a book by the cover”, but I like the labeling on Purple Tractor. They identify the source of the beans, provide nutrition information (the information is pretty typical for coffee, but this is among the first I have seen printed on the packaging), and it lists the roast date. Sometimes I look for this information about other coffee and don’t easily find it. Kudos to Purple Tractor!I prepared this coffee in my French Press and also in my Moka pot and it worked well with either method. I didn’t try cold brewing The Purple Tractor.  I wish I had as the smooth flavor seems like it would cold brew beautifully.I found these beans fairly oily. I typically like moderately oily beans, though I know some prefer drier beans so I just thought I would mention this.I recommend The Purple Tractor “On The Move” blend whole bean coffee.

"I have another pair of in-ear headphones that I love, but the DH keeps taking them. So I needed another pair for myself. These work perfectly for my purposes so far.I have used these earphones to listen to spoken word narration, television programming, and music on 4 different devices.  So I have used them in a variety of situations over the past few weeks.I really prefer the sound of these headphones over my Bluetooth headphones. Don’t get me wrong, I love the convenience of my Bluetooth speakers and headphones. I just find the sound smoother and more immersive with the wired in-ear headphones. So these are the earphones I am most likely to reach for when relaxing.The Audiosharp earphones very comfortable, the set came with 2 replacement ear buds in different sizes.The set also included a velcro cable “tie” to help keep the wires from getting tangled.  It also comes with an attractive little storage case. I like how easy it is to neatly keep these earphones in my bag.The cord is very flexible and rubberized. This is my first set of earphones with this style of cord. I don’t have an opinion about this type of cord, but I just thought I would mention it.Audiosharp’s in-ear headphones also features a built-in microphone with simple controls. I tested the microphone on a voice memo and it did sound better than using the built in microphone. It is certainly a handy feature if you need to make or take a telephone call! There is also a little mute red  button which comes in handy.My Conclusion: The Audiosharp in-ear headphones has a nice sound during sedentary and lightly active activities (I would not recommend them for running or vigorous activity). They are comfortable and easy to keep tidy with the included case and cable tie.  These earphones are my new carry-on bag, travel essential.I received a free pair of these earphones to test and review.

"This coffee is medium mild and reminds me a little of Folgers or other drip coffee that was my first exposure to coffee. I like it, but it really isn't my favorite. I prefer a darker, richer, more full bodied coffee. However, my mom really liked this coffee so it is a matter of personal preference.I tried three types of coffee from CoffeeCrazy. My favorite was the Espresso, followed by the French Roast followed by the Colombian. I do like that it is organic and fair-trade.This is a highly drinkable coffee, just not one that I am that excited about.

"I really like the coffee I made from these beans. I have brewed it in my French press, Moka pot and cold brewed it.Sadly, the beans are not as dark nor as oily as other espresso beans I have used. I would describe this as a medium roast, medium bodied coffee. I still like it, though would prefer it to be a little stronger or fresher. It is really nice in iced lattes though. The cold brewed coffee is really smooth and not bitter -- though I don't object to a hint of bitterness in espresso!I like that it is fair-trade, organic and non-GMO.

"I am a big coffee lover. I usually prefer strong, dark roasted coffee. French Roast is typically one of my favorites.This whole bean coffee smelled amazing from the moment I opened it. However the first time I made it in my French Press is was very weak compared to other French Roast Coffees. I ground it to the normal level and used the normal quantity (1 coffee scoop per cup). To get the desired intensity, I had to grind it a little finer than usual for the French Press and use a little more. Then it made delicious coffee, but I went through the 12 ounce bag rather quickly. I am sure my issue is likely a matter of personal preference.Since then I have tried a couple other CoffeeCrazy whole bean coffees. Overall, I am highly impressed with this  line especially the Espresso Roast (review coming!). The French Roast is my second favorite of the three varieties available from CoffeeCrazy. I recommend it for people who like French Roast that is a little milder. I have used three methods to prepare this coffee: Mokka pot, French press and cold brew. My main issue was with the French Press method, but I used a finer grind for all three methods of brewing. I especially like that this coffee is both fair trade and organic!I received a free sample of this product to review.

"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 4s to an iPhone 6. After investing in the phone with decent memory storage, I wanted to protect my investment. I have been able to use my 4s for years by keeping it in a case and using a screen protector, so I know these things do pay off over time.After installing this tampered glass screen protector, I feel like I upgraded my screen protection along with the phone. The protector is smooth and feels wonderful to my fingers while using the touch screen.I was a little worries that it might look too blue. But I only saw the slight blue tint when I held the protector up to a light at an angle (before applying it). According to Gshine, this protector not only protects the phone's screen, but it helps protect the eyes from blue light from your phone's monitor. I wanted blue light protection as I understand it is a little easier and less tiring to the eyes over time. I am not sure how true these claims are as I have only used the protector for a few days.However, I do know that my phone looks nice, I barely notice the protector. As mentioned it also feels nice to the touch and the screen is still very responsive. My phone fits well within my case. And best of all, I know that my screen is somewhat protected against scratches. Overall, I am very pleased with this screen protector and will probably buy another if I need to. (Touching wood that I won't). I attached some pictures I took of my unboxing and also my phone with this screen protector installed.I highly recommend this screen protector. I notice from the other reviews that some refer to anti-spy protectors, I do not have the anti-spy. My review refers to the plain, anti-blue light protector. If I later find the protector is not as durable as I would expect, I will update. But so far I could not be happier with this product.I received this screen protector for free from the seller to test and review.

"Self-massage and Myofascial Release are important parts of my fitness routine. I typically use a foam roller, a massage stick and massage balls. I like having different options for different purposes. I like to use balls to massage smaller muscles and my feet.These massage balls have a rubber texture that grips the skin just enough. They are just the right size for the intended purpose. I should note they are rather firm. I have another set (different brand) that are softer. I think the firmness can be a pro or a con depending on your sensitivity. This type of massage does hurt a little especially when you are new to it. It gets better if you stay consistent, but beginners might want softer balls (depending on the area).I like to incorporate foam rolling and massage into my workout warmups. When I do this, I find I am more flexible and don't seem to get as bad of sore muscles.I am pleased with this set of Massage Lacrosse Balls. I especially like to use them for my feet and shoulders.

" 4:03 MinsThis set is a lot of fun. It is great if you like vigorous, body-weight exercises and circuits. It is also wonderful for those who like to compete whether they prefer to compete with themselves or with others. This set is a creative and fun way to get a HIIT workout.The set comes with a few decks of cards (some containing exercises, some interval ratios, and some to enhance the game play and competition. I have only played this game with myself, but I can see that playing against others would take it to the next level.Each card contains a short code and a QR code so you can easily watch a short video if any exercise is unfamiliar to you. This is so wonderfully creative as it is hard to figure out an exercise from a line drawing on a card. The illustrations are clear, but it helps to see the exercise in motion. I like how there are so many variations of exercises, sequence, and interval structure so there countless workouts. It can be different every time you play.I highly recommend this if you like this type of training and also like the idea of gamifying your workouts.I received a free set of the HIIT game for review.

"I have mixed feelings about this camera. It is not quite right for me, but may be perfect for others.First the good...*It is very affordable (at the time of writing this review it cost about $10)*There is a tripod mount connection at the bottom*You can adjust to zoom (within reason)*There are 6 small LED lights on the front and you can adjust the brightness. The lights give a cool, almost blueish light.*You can use it with no sound or as a built-in microphone (use just UBB for no mic or to use your computer's built-in mic or also use sound cord to input the cameras sound to your computer).*You can use it to take still pictures by pressing a button on the topI think this camera would be great for a PC desktop user with a computer with no camera who wants to skype, chat, do Google Hangout and more. Especially if that person needs a budget camera. It isn't right for me because I am a Mac user. I was able to get the camera to work with certain apps (mainly ManyCam and Google Hangouts). I like that I could adjust the zoom (a plus), but in truth the images did not look as good as my laptop's built in camera. I would tend to say, if your computer has a decent built in camera, you probably do not need this unless the positioning of your camera is not idea (you can position this how you want) or your camera auto-focus is not good. It might be nice if you want a second  web camera for alternate views.The Bad (other than my own compatibility issues:*It did not come with instructions, the camera was simply in the box.*The camera is very light weight plastic and I actually managed to break it when testing it for this review. (I do not know how, it still works fine but I broke the base off the camera.)*It seemed a little more difficult to set up and use than it should be, possibly because of the lack of directions.

"I enjoy the Rockridge cookbook series as an affordable cooking reference set. I don't regularly do home canning, but have fond memories of my grandmother canning in the Summer and Fall. This is such a useful book to have on hand when harvesting a garden, buying seasonal vegetables or visiting a local you-pick. It covers the basics for small batch home canning. By small batch, the recipes and instructions are for about 3 - 6 pint jars. This is perfect for me. I also like that it touches on the topics of low sugar and low sodium canning--as those are my biggest concerns with canned foods (other than safety of course!).I also like that although it is a book that covers the basics it has a few unusual (to me) recipes including Rosehip jam. Most of the recipes do feature more common ingredients so it is great for taking advantage of seasonal specials. The recipes include jams, jellies, conserves, condiments,  sauces, pie fillings, salsas, chutneys, pickles, and canned fruits and vegetables.As someone who does not have a lot of space in my kitchen, I like that the book focuses on small batch canning. I also like that it mainly uses basic techniques. There are some distinctive recipes, but I suspect it will be more interesting to someone new to canning.I received a complimentary download of this book for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B055BHO35SU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQJ0F68#wasThisHelpful","R1B055BHO35SU7","A2U9XJLVW3HLYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U9XJLVW3HLYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From my Goodreads:Imagine a world where the books we read are considered catalysts for the minds of serial killers. A world where the ideas we express and publish are considered so dangerous, that even stories like Little Red Riding Hood would be taken off of shelves and burned for its ""violent content.""Imagine a world where libraries and those who recognized this overblown censorship enlisted to fight for our freedom of expression. Where lives were in danger over censorship unlawfully imposed on us. You might be thinking, ""Why in the world would you be willing to die for books?"" Well, then you have a lot to think about dear friend. As silly as the concept is, if you actually look into it, this concept of censorship is happening around us all the time. If you don't see the connection of how branding our entertainment as evil influences over our minds, that humans are so weak willed that they would emulate what books had depicted, then you fail to see what makes this story so important.Kasahara Iku has been waiting to read the last book in a series for 10 YEARS. When she finally gets the chance to buy it, the Improvement Special Agency (part of the Media Improvement Committee who are doing the censorship) storm in to the bookstore. Iku slips the book under her shirt, but suddenly, an enforcer grabs it from her. Iku desperately fights to keep her book. To anyone who understands the pain of waiting for a conclusion to a series, to have their rights violated, I am certain you can understand Iku's feelings and actions, even if the concept of the story might still sound absurd to you. Just as she is shoved to the ground, someone catches her. This man becomes such a prominent figure to Iku that she vows to join the Library Defense Force after he saves all of the books from censorship and returns her the book she had been waiting for 10 years to read.Problem is, she never saw his face. She remembers the feeling of his arms as he caught her, his heroic rescue of the books, and his victory. She equates him to a prince for she is a huge romantic, and after evaluating her choices in college, proceeds to enlist to the Defense Force. Iku is the first woman ever to put the Defense Force as her first choice, she's driven, and she's extremely tall for a Japanese girl, towering over her instructor. Her instructor, Doujou, seems to always be finding ways to criticize her, and Iku disdains him. It isn't until she gets to know her instructor better, that she realizes he might care more about her than she ever knew, and that her ""prince"" might be closer than she thought.Toshokan Sensou-Library Wars in English-started as this Light Novel series, then inspired a manga series, an anime, an anime movie, and a live action movie with a sequel based on the second light novel coming out October 2015. I watched the movie first before realizing there were other ways of watching the series but instantly fell in love. The acting was amazing, the characters were great and the romance wasn't in your face. Just like this book, everything was well done.Those who have read light novels before will probably tell you how poorly written they are. I have to disagree. You must take into account the fact that this is written in a different style to fit a different culture. Whereas most YA books have plenty of detail, light novels tend to speed forward. They don't waste time describing the color of someone's eyes or how their hair looks or what exact brand of clothing they own, or what kind of tree this is etc. They spend time developing the characters, making you understand the world and politics and rules set up, and make you dive into the thoughts of the characters. It was a different experience. Light novels treat you as intelligent. They assume you as the reader can interpret the surrounding of the story without too much detail. They treat you as an intelligent person. This is not to say that YA treats you as someone of no intelligence, but I have noticed now just how excessive the use of detail is in our books.The translations of this book were done by Methiliel, who has provided a PDF of this light novel. This book not licensed in English so there was no way to read it until now. I have to give this translator a huge round of applause. Written Japanese is extremely difficult-believe me, I'm learning it-and the cultural nuances that are not voiced are very difficult to notice unless you already know Japanese. Thankfully, there are footnotes where necessary to inform you of things you should know, such as events in history or why a characters is speaking a certain way and WHY that is important. Methiliel truly deserves so much more attention for this and I cannot thank her enough.Now, the ROMANCE! XD In Japanese culture, PDA and such things are not so common. It's embarrassing and not done in public, so it is a HUGE deal when two character's set up as potential love interests touch someone-not in a dirty way, you dirty minded people! ;)-or let them cry on their shoulder, or speak in a tone too familiar or call them by their first name. Imagine calling your professor or boss by their first name without a title suddenly and without having known them for long. That's pretty awkward, so when Japanese people call someone by their first name, that's a HUGE deal. It basically implies that the speaker sees you as a true friend-or more than a friend-and is hoping that you as well reciprocate and will become more familiar with them. Sort of. It's really complicated but all you need to know is that this is a monumental thing. As such, there was no kissing in this book, but dear lord that sexual tension was enough to nearly set my computer document file on fire. They needed to do this. And I almost thought it would happen.Thankfully, what romance there is, is subtle and in no way overrides the plot. The characters all have a part and grow, and characters you think you will hate end up becoming better than you thought.My only complaint is that after I finished, there was no ending like in the movie. What!? Yep, I honestly believe the movie was better in the last part. As great as the original work is, this is one of those rare cases where the movie did something better than the book. We had this huge showdown. I thought it was going to happen because of what happened near the end, but nope. If you want a REALLY well done fight scene that has romantic tension, a kickass female protagonist, and a real sense of danger, see the ending part of the movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KQQCG0T179V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4043898053#wasThisHelpful","R33KQQCG0T179V","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On my Goodreads:The blossoming love Izark and Noriko have for each other grow and we see the ups and downs to their relationship. Izark is anxious and overprotective and Noriko can't bear to part from him. And this all ties in to their past experiences so well that it makes this completely believable.After staying at a little village, the Seer declares that the evil is moving. Without hesitation, the two leave and are soon attacked by Keimos. And Keimos not only is stronger, but something terrible has consumed him.Lord Rachef has finally made his move. Whilst displaying animal cruelty, good looks and a stylish side ponytail, he traps Izark in a battle with Keimos. Izark tries to protect Noriko but she is taken away and when Izark catches up, new revelations are made.One of Lord Rachef's own appears as though he will betray him after the inhumane slaughter of the Chimos and Gorya replaces Tazasheena as Lord Rachef's personal Seer, much to her dismay.The fight scenes were well done. So well done in fact, that I started to think maybe this series was a shounen. The panels were fluid and sharp, with minimal monologues and just enough of everything to set the tone.Noriko doesn't shy away from violence either, ready to pounce on Tazasheena in order to escape. Unfortunately, it seems that Noriko has nowhere to go, for Izark is 16 miles away in Mt. Purple Spirit fighting for his life-and for Noriko. Yet, Noriko might just save him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U73TPTPSIPMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421502208#wasThisHelpful","R2U73TPTPSIPMZ","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love Kpop, other cultures, hate racist characters, and want a very well done book about a girl who moves to Korea and gets involved with a hot guy and the Kpop industry...please look elsewhere. I hate giving authors bad reviews. They pour their hearts into writing, but sometimes it has to be done.I am sorry to say that like many others who were so excited about a book like this being published, that this book did not make me happy. I LOVE Kpop! I love reading about other cultures and experiencing the beauty of another culture with our main character...Grace was not the character for this role. I do not tolerate racism at all, so to read about a main character who had her head so stuck in her own little vision of how the entire world should behave sickened me. Yes, she is a teen, but she is still racist. I have provided some lovely quotes for you later on if you would like to see them.Let me begin by saying I really am glad that Kpop is getting more recognition and that the author is a really good writer. However, what she wrote offended me.There were a few good things about this book: The other characters besides our main were likable and had a lot of good to say regarding our main character's racist views on Korea. The writing was well done, and this is about Kpop! That's where the good ends.Our main character, Grace, is a girl who like many, is going through some tough times. To escape these troubles she literally googles a place to move and when she finds Korea she just leaves. She doesn't research anything about the country!!!! And then she begins trashing the Korean culture and trying to force her American ways onto Korea. At first I thought this was a flaw in her character and that she would overcome her mindset and embrace another culture...she did not. To make matters worse, she says a LOT of racist things that I could not believe what I was reading. I want to say that the author was trying to make this a coming of age YA romance, but Grace never matured.She attends a boarding school and obviously being in another country, they would not speak English!! (Or at least, not everyone since English is taught in school.) Grace cannot believe that there is another writing system other than the alphabet and that Korean people can read them. The romance was cute at times (which were seldom), but Grace was unbelievable. She chastises Jason-the love interest-for liking Kpop, calls Kpop a fad and refuses to say anything positive about it.Actual quotes to prove my point about Grace's racist thoughts:“But you think I should make it more like your American music?” he asks. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”""I can't help but notice the obnoxiously neon READY TO WHERE splayed across her shirt, and I wonder if she thought it was ironic or if this girl has zero concept of the English language.""""As we head to the dorms, I think back to meeting Sophie's brother this morning. He said something about a band room. Does that mean people play music here? I mean, normal music, like rap or hip-hop or folk. Or is it only traditional Korean stuff?""""I'm not sure what I expected-that they would be good? Pop is the name of the genre. That never bodes well for the quality of the music. But I guess I hoped since they're a big deal, they would be more than your average bubblegum band.""""I'm guessing that if you guys are famous like Sophie said, it's mostly based on pretty faces instead of actual quality of music.""Grace refuses to acknowledge that any other music besides American music is a thing. She trashes Kpop and mocks it and refuses to adapt to Korea. And get this: Grace is supposed to know a lot about all kinds of music. Yep. Which is why she doesn't think Kpop is music and that all Asian music is just traditional....Not only that, but Grace tries to correct Jason and his band that his music is not American and therefore, not good. If they would only play American music, then they would be hits!!!! Too bad Kpop is a huge thing Grace, because your point is invalid. All music is to be appreciated and if it is not the music you listen to, then try and respect it at the least!!! Jason even yells at Grace and tells her to try and be more sensitive about other cultures! This is why I don't think the author intended to make a racist main character. Yet Grace never grows out of her viewpoints. And Grace takes his advice as an offense. She thinks that what Jason was telling her was that she needed to stop parading America around...are you kidding me?For us k and j-drama fans, Grace once again lends her opinions on the subject. She made me insanely mad. Naturally, getting used to a foreign culture is shocking, but Grace handled it terribly. She criticizes Korean food, the drama, the music, the language, everything that is NOT American. Girl, you signed up for a foreign country...what did you honestly expect?All in all, I really did not enjoy this book. I was so excited to hear a book about Kpop was being published. And then I get Grace and her unbelievable perspective. I wanted a book where a young woman explores another country and comes to embrace it. Instead, I got a book with a racist, closeminded, ""white savior wannabe"", stereotyping, white girl. As a white girl myself who really appreciates other cultures and loves Kpop and dramas, etc. I was livid. And it was not just because the book dissed Korea. No. This book made me extremely mad. Racism is a terrible thing that should not exist but sadly does. And Grace not only starts out racist, but she ends the book without having changed.I am very sorry if you love Korean culture, or other cultures and dislike racism. If you are one of those people, you might be very angry at the many things Grace says during this book. The only saving grace was the secondary cast who got mad at Grace and tried to get her to adjust her mindset-which never happened-and the writing. Some might be able to look past these ugly things, and I hope that if you still givethis book a chance that you find it much more enjoyable than I did. If you're unsure, maybe try the library. I cannot recommend this book.(One thing I have to say is that Kpop and Korean society is pretty racist too. Now please hear me out as a fellow lover of Korea and Kpop! There is always a darker side to every single country. Korea has it's flaws. And one of them is that Koreans( NOT ALL) are racist to those with darker skin color. Kai from EXO has been give a rough time as have members of SNSD who mocked one of their members for their darker skin. One of my best friend's moved from South Korea to where I go to school, and as much as we love dramas and Kpop and how much I love the culture, she has told me far too many times about this issue in Korea. I am pointing this out because I have been accusing Grace of racism when the same thing is pretty evident in other cultures. I am not bashing Korea, please hear me out. I am just trying to be fair here when I have already bashed on Grace -which should be addressed. Racism is a terrible thing. We are all human beings and respect is something we all need to give to each other. Racism is in every country and it cannot be escaped. However, we can make an effort to change how we see each other for the better. Thank you for your time. I apologize if you did not like my review.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSCJ37Z1XGJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052599#wasThisHelpful","R3QSCJ37Z1XGJP","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this early from a preorder at Rightstuf. Review is also on Goodreads. Very slight spoilers. I just go a little more indepth than the synopsis does.DISCLAIMER:If you have triggers, please be careful with this volume. Chapter 107 is very controversial and I believe this was handled maturely, but it will make some people very uncomfortable. Nanami is not raped, but she does get assaulted by Kirihito, and it is very hard to read for the few panels that are presented.Nanami has been growing as a character, and as such, I was expecting something to test her greatly. This is one of the darkest volumes Kamisama Kiss has presented. That gorgeous cover I praised earlier before reading disguises a volume that has a very controversial chapter.It begins with Tomoe and Nanami going to school and both of them realizing that in order to become a part of society, your academic standing holds a lot of power of you. This is very true in Japanese culture. Nanami wants to go to her first and last school trip with her class and after Mikage demands that she score 80% on all her tests to go, she studies diligently. We get to see Tomoe's thoughts regarding Nanami which adds a lot to their relationship. And it looks like Ami x Kurama might happen :DThen the volume changes when Nanami leaves with her class. A storm is brewing and their flights are cancelled. When Ami is kidnapped by Unari, claiming that Kirihito has stolen the Robe of Feathers from her, Nanami must agree to return it lest Ami remain a prisoner.Kirihito's life is slipping and he needs to get his body back. With the Robe of Feathers he can do so, but he is dying. He asks that Nanami be taken to him. Only she can help preserve what little life he has left-but in doing so, Nanami will likely die. Nanami is not stupid. She would do what any person would given her situation. She is forced to help him, and from there, the controversial moment I mentioned happens.The way it was handled is to let the readers realize that Kirihito/Akura-Oh is NOT a good person. If you were a fan of him like I was, it finally is clear that he will never change. He is selfish, vain and a brat. And I can guarantee you that this pairing will never happen. I don't understand why fans assume that any forced kiss or something like that means love. That is sexual assault, and the author makes it clear to the reader that this is not something we should be praising in manga. So many shoujo glamorize assault as being love, but this series draws the line. Nanami is not just kissed here. I will not go into details, but if you still ship these two, I cannot agree with you.If he were to start changing his life, doing his best to right his wrongs, etc. then I could consider him in a positive light. In volume 7 we saw that he was dealing with a lot of turmoil and I was invested in him. But he shows his true colors too many times later on for me to root for him.I am so glad that this series is not glorifying harassment or trying to make d-bag guys out to be love interests. This is a great example of a shoujo series that does it right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2REB2DX4KSO7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421579707#wasThisHelpful","R2REB2DX4KSO7A","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased at Rightstuf, review on GoodreadsAh Mutsuki...I really like him. He's the most complex of all the Rose Knights, but it seems the canon pairing is going to be Kaede x Anise.In this volume, we have a showdown to win an ""Arcana Card"" at an idol competition against Rhodecia. It's obvious from the first meeting with Yako and Idel that they are possible enemies and are up to no good. The way the competition went was just way too unrealistic. Anise and her group have to come up with acts on the spot, instead of practicing for them. I would think that a flyer would be given out before or online somewhere for them to prepare for it, but this is not the case.I won't spoil anything, but Idel and Yako obviously are enemies of a sort and have their own powers. Out of nowhere new enemies just conveniently show up to cause trouble at the perfect moment. And Aya Shouoto is starting to tease readers with many possible romantic pairings. Every knight gets his moment here-except for Tenjo-so if you are dying for some romance between Anise and one of the Knights, here is where that all starts.Here's the thing: I like this manga, but I don't ever think I will come to love it. It's enjoyable for passing time, but really, it lacks that ""spark"" that most series have that draws you in. Yes, Anise is a good heroine, but the way the plot is thrown in circles along with some poorly placed humor and sudden romantic teases makes me really annoyed. However, this a shoujo series that presents a very addicting kind of story so each volume you read makes you want to keep reading it. The art is absolutely stunning and I really like having this on my shelf. I am glad that this was licensed and I can see why so many fans wanted this released.This is not a serious manga. Earlier in my review of volume 3, I mentioned that this was like Ouran Host Club in that it wasn't trying to take itself seriously. If you are, you will be disappointed. Even if you don't take it seriously the flaws stick out so obviously it makes me wonder at times what the point of certain things are there for.I like the manga, but there are so many flaws. The pacing is all over the place with oddly timed humor and then romantic tension. If Mutsuki and Anise were the canon pair, as cliche as it would be, I honestly believe it would be a good thing for the series. He is a complex character-more so than the other Knights-and his initial dislike for Anise and slow acceptance of her is written well. Not only that, but in this volume he is starting to regain his memories, and it doesn't look like he has the best past. If he and Anise were to get together, they would have a lot of hurdles to jump. And I really want to see that, but unfortunately, Kaede is quickly becoming the love interest.If you are looking for more manga to read that are shoujo or fantasy, or just another series: Kamisama Kiss, Akatsuki no Yona, Requiem of the Rose King, A Silent Voice, From Far Away by Kyoko Hikawa, Horimiya-being released soon, Ouran High School Host Club, Pandora Hearts, Dawn of the Arcana, Library Wars, Noragami, Maid-Sama!, Your Lie in April, Emma, Dengeki Daisy, Orange-just announced to licensed, Skip Beat!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNNWBQ3W4EWSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421573695#wasThisHelpful","RNNWBQ3W4EWSZ","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in shock. The good kind, because my ship not only set sail, it sailed the flipping world.So Noriko is finally told that ""Hey, you know you're the Awakening"" and she immediately realizes ""Oh...no wonder Izark didn't let me near him. He's been suffering because of me this whole time, but he's been too nice to push me away!"" And I was crying along with her because the FEELS were getting too intense.Noriko does the right thing. Izark is rushing to save her from this crazy self serving woman. Mind you Noriko was nearly sacrificed earlier and not only does she get away, but she freaking rushes over and embraces Izark who's gone almost bat-shit-insane. Thank goodness though that for some reason her Awakening powers snapped him out of it. Or the power of love. And don't worry, this is not done in a cheesy way.Crazy woman not only tells Noriko the truth but she intends to capture her. So Noriko goes all whoop-ass on her. She gets away and then BAM Izark runs after her. Crazy woman leaves the scene and Noriko basically tells off Izark for keeping everything a secret-and I agreed with her-and Izark tries to calm her down but he's in the wrong here no matter how you try to say it.And then BAM!! Noriko runs away cuz she ain't got no time for this-let's be honest, I'm sure we all would do the same-and Izark finally mans up and declares his love for her.And the BEST part? He cries!!! Do you know how attractive it is when a man can let out his emotions and be vulnerable? In the US, it's expected that men be men, so NO feelings! Excuse me. We are all human and crying is not limited to the female population.And LOST IN TRANSLATION!!! Yes, I am learning Japanese. No, my Japanese is not the best. However, as I was reading the scans along with my Japanese copy, I noticed some things that made a huge difference in dialog. When Izark is asking Noriko to stay with him and falls to the ground, he says ""頼む"" pronounced as Tah-No-Moo. This is a literal way of begging someone. So instead of how the translators made Izark say, ""Please"" Izark was literally saying ""I beg of you!"" or ""I'm begging you!"" THAT is so much more romantic.There were other nitpicks I had with the translations, but for the most part, those didn't really affect anything. I just wanted to point out that one dialog choice. I only own the Japanese copy for volumes 7, 9, and 12. As such, I had to find other ways to read those volumes, but I did support the author.

"Dear God, this volume! SO, Noriko discovers that Izark is the Sky Demon (and this is NOT A SPOILER) and says the most adorabley embarrassing thing ever to him that night. Girl has guts. Later, some angst happens when one of the guys, Banadam, starts to make the moves on Noriko. I thought I wouldn't like him but turns out he's a pretty swell guy.HOT DAMN THE SEXUAL TENSION! Izark! We finally get to see more of who he really is. For such a badass, sexy young man, Izark has dealt with a lot of crap in his past. So, he is very anxious and doesn't know how to show a side other than his usual badassery. This volume deals a lot with progressing the romantic relationship between he and Noriko, and I have to admit, I was getting all them feels. Usually when shoujo tries hard to raise tension between two characters, it fails. But this was glorious. I squealed, I got my heart broken, I was yelling ""Izark, do something!"" and I was engaged.For once, I was not annoyed or angry when the whole ""Rescue the girl to stir romance"" arc popped up. I was ready for it, and then that last page. Like WTF!? OMG. Now, it's not a bad kind of WTF, but more of a genuinie HOLY CRAP WTF!? because I did not see that coming and like yeah...I'm kind of anxious. But it's super late and I need to sleep but the sexual tension between these two, and the plot and the FEELS are taking over my life right now.And can we take a moment for Izark and his obvious crush for Noriko? Like sure it was angsty as hell and he's soooooo in denial, but I can't help but freak like a fangirl over this. This is everything a shoujo should do. I feel what the author intended and I am shipping these two so hard, fleets will soon join.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYD20W6CWT64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591169720#wasThisHelpful","R3DYD20W6CWT64","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not only is Noriko a great heroine, but the love interest, Izark, is wonderful. He has a bad past but IT WORKS and let me tell you, I cried. When has YA done that to me? When has YA given me a troubled love interest with a dark past and made me FEEL, made me CRY etc? NEVER.So after escaping the White Mist Forest, I realized why I love the protagonist. SHE KNOWS HER LIMITS. She is smart. She knows when she needs to stay out of the way and when to act. This is something every protagonist in manga, books, or movies needs to do. They should use their brains as intended. Noriko uses it, and that's why she is successful and not an annoying character.And the romance!!!! It is not overwhelming or angsty. It is well done and made me shed tears already. As you probably guessed early on (and due to the blurb on the cover spoiling it) Izark is the Sky Demon. His parents didn't just raise him for money and ostracize him like I initially believed. His mother tried to kill him. And she scarred him for life and that's why he's such a precious baby that needs love and omadkgkdgjjg.It's pretty obvious now that Izark is hopelessly in love with Noriko and does not realize it. And after their little scene, Noriko discovers what Izark is, and you know what? She couldn't care less! It's like that scene in volume 6 of Fruits Basket guys. Exactly like that, except this time, there's a kiss scene.And that bonus chapter where we learned more about Izark nearly broke my heart.If you have never read this series, get out there and do so! Unfortunately this series is out of print (so some volumes can be upwards of $100), so I was lucky to purchase what I did.

"Izark is to be pitted against 17 men to save the reputation of Lord Nada, but being the suave badass that he is, Izark simply handles them like a boss. Of course this wouldn't be as awesome if we didn't start to see development with our heroine. And development she gets!Not only is she starting to fall for Izark without even mentioning it (we see her blush several times) but she is becoming even more adept at his language. SO much so, that when they and a group of unlikely allies enter the White Mist Forest and are faced with a terrible monster, she is able to alert the group and stop them from harming each other. Thank God Izark was there though, because poor Noriko would have been pounded into the earth by one of the group since he was losing his cool.Noriko and Izark make a very good team, make great friends, and so far are starting to show feelings for one another. Izark is that quiet and handsome guy that just becomes adorable when he gets embarrassed over Noriko. She messes up with the language as expected, and mistakenly calls him ""Honey"" when trying to congratulate him in an earlier volume, and since then everyone has been questioning their relationship. He thought leaving her with Gaya was best, but now that he is with her again, you can see that he secretly adores her-or really is dense and does not understand his feelings. Thankfully, the angst is not strong in this series. It's just written that well.Trust me, even if you are stingy about art style, read this manga. It has a very clean and pleasant style for an older shoujo and is easy on the eyes. Though I don't believe you should disregard something because the art may not be your thing until you've read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJP2Y7H9EHE5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591167701#wasThisHelpful","RJP2Y7H9EHE5R","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much shorter because a one shot by the same mangaka was put into this volume.Izark reckons that he must drop off Noriko at a place that he trusts before continuing on with his life. Contrary to what he said earlier, it seems that he now trusts that Noriko won't let it slip that she might be the Awakening, and entrusts her to a friend of his. What follows is a very tear-jerky scene where Noriko thanks Izark for everything but he can't bare to look at her and leaves. Thankfully, we get to see his perspective and this clears up the confusion.Noriko has been in this world for 3 months and has made a HUGE leap in learning Izark's language, which really impressed and motivated me. I am learning Japanese and if I could learn to speak how Noriko could after just 3 months I would be very happy. It works though since she is surrounded by that language and has to learn it to survive and it's a breath of fresh air to see a complex issue being developed.Later, Noriko's caretaker is threatened when politics and stuff get in the way and soon she finds herself needing Izark to help. Too bad he's been taken captive by a Duke. And it seems Izark might be more attached to Noriko than he thought ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CULFHFSORF06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591166039#wasThisHelpful","R3CULFHFSORF06","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When was the last time you realized WHY you loved reading? When was the last time a possible couple in a book made you jump and squee and hope they fell in love and became a couple? And when was the last time a book sucked you in-completely?It's better than Vicious. I have read Miss Schwab's other works, The Archived and Vicious but NEVER have I really went WOW!!! Viscous was great-don't get me wrong, but A Darker Shade of Magic made me remember why I love reading so much. It was almost as if I was reading Harry Potter for the first time. It was entrancing, had memorable and loveable characters-but with this book, it had so much more.Schwab's talent has poured through her books, but I truly believe that THIS is the kind of books she needs to write. It seems so Schwab in style and how in-depth the world building was. I LOVED Kell. He has to be the most, suave, charming magician I have read about-think Howl from Howl's Moving Castle-and his relationship with Lila started out rocky to say the least.Eventually they become accomplices, allies and then friends...and TELL ME THEY DON'T HAVE CHEMISTRY. HOLY wow, I was just dying for them to kiss or get together-and I usually can't stand much romance in books because they seem so FORCED and bland and there is no freaking chemistry anywhere.I can't say much if you don't spoilers but what I can say is that this book surpassed the hype it built up. I LOVED IT. I took my time in the book, became a part of the world and felt that feeling of loving reading all over again. I forgot that I had a life LOL. I was so immersed in this book, only my college tests could guilt me out of reading for too long.If you haven't read any of Schwab's works, if you haven't read A Darker Shade of Magic, if you've lost that love of reading, pick up the cure. A Darker Shade of Magic is everything I could want in a book and more. And it just might be the same for you.Although...I wanted Kell and Lila to have more romance but what we did get was good.Keep in mind that this book was more on the action side than character side, but I never felt bored because Scwhab took care with the character's and made them interesting and complex. It was fairly predictable, but it was meant to be that way. Overall it truly was worth the money and the time to read it, and I loved every moment of this fantastic book.From my GoodReads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MN3Z9795OZ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765376458#wasThisHelpful","R2MN3Z9795OZ7W","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On my Goodreads and purchased at Rightstuf:Requiem of the Rose King was one of my most anticipated manga of 2015, and it lived up to my expectations. Based on an early draft of Shakespear's Richard 3, this manga follows the tragic tale of a character named Richard, born into the world an intersex person. Richard is born with both the body of a male and a female, and for this reason, his mother cannot bear to look at him. It would not be an exaggeration to even say she fears and hates Richard, for she purposely abandoned him in the woods where witches are rumored to reside and accuses him of basically being demon spawn. THIS IS NOT YOUR  TYPICAL SHOUJO. THIS IS DARK AND GRUESOME AND VERY DIFFERENT.The story is set in medieval England against the War of the Roses, and our characters are stuck in the middle of it. Here, we follow the House of York and Richard's father, who is trying to take back his crown from Henry Lancaster, a devout Christian. The art is beyond gorgeous, and you can actually tell that the characters are European! The women are not damsels either, especially Queen Margaret, wife of Henry Lancaster. She takes charge of the war for Henry, who is tormented by the sins his soldiers commit.Joan of Arc is twisted into a mischievous spirit, and for those who are religious like me, it would be best if you don't take offense at a lot of the liberties this manga took regarding faith. Saying that, religion is a prominent part of the manga, but it isn't shoved down your throat either so both atheists and religious folk can enjoy the story. Regardless, this was set in a time where religion was a big part of life.For a shoujo manga, this certainly isn't your typical story. We follow an intersex character who is burdened with shame, depression and self-loathing, and a heavy focus is spent on the characters and how they are faring against their situations. The art is absolutely beautiful and I found myself staring at many of the pages for a long time, completely amazed. There were times where it even seemed very Tim Burtony in its style. It's not Vagabond, but it truly stands above most manga in art. If you like witty dialog and politics, strong women and controversial topics, breathtaking art and something new, I highly suggest you give this a try.If you liked: Rose of Versailles, Pandora Hearts, dark shoujo, medieval England, gorgeous art, Tim Burton, you will probably really like this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R60NIF3EA42F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421567784#wasThisHelpful","R1R60NIF3EA42F","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my Goodreads. I received this early from Rightstuf due to preordering this.Kiss of the Rose Princess isn't a shoujo that takes itself seriously. And you shouldn't take it seriously either. Most would agree that as far as shoujo is concerned, most of it isn't something to be taken seriously. Then we get outrageous, pun-filled series like Ouran and Kiss of the Rose Princess that really go far out to make fun of itself, the reverse-harem and shoujo in general. This is the shoujo I like. I want something to make me laugh, recognize cultural puns, and just relax. And most importantly-not have to nitpick the series because it's not trying to do anything to make you go ""Wow! So original!""Then we get series like Kamisama Kiss, where the plot and characters are so vital to the series as a whole that I can both relax and enjoy it, but also take a serious look at the development of the series. And for a serious shoujo, Kamisama nails every point. I have no gripes with that series at all. (I am biased, lol).With this 3rd volume, Kiss of the Rose Princess once again tries to make a gloomy and depressing atmosphere only to twist it around and make fun of high school physical exams!! You know, the one where your measurements are taken? Nope? Yeah, only in Japan.And Tenjo steals this spotlight, but of course, this is all for a plan Anise put into action. See, Haruto realizes he needs to stop being a butt, and something happens that I won't say here since its spoilery. Most of this volume has a lot of spoilers I can't really go into, but what can you expect? LOTS OF ROMANTIC HINTS. Seriously. Anise finally learns the details of the ""true contract"" she needs to make with her Knights and it involves the good old romance present in just about every shoujo reverse-harem ever. But there's a reason for it, so I am not complaining.If you have a favorite Knight, you'll definitely be getting some feels and posting this all over tumblr since Anise looks like she'll be romancing them all. But...it's pretty obvious who her true choice will be.Another funny volume with gorgeous color pages in the beginning. Just don't expect this series to be too serious. Think ""Ouran"" and you'll most likely enjoy this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22O6G3748U1JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421573687#wasThisHelpful","R22O6G3748U1JD","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my Goodreads. I received this early from Rightstuf due to preordering this.I didn't expect to love this series. I never expected such a GREAT ending. Julietta is a GENIUS. This is the ending of the time-travel arc.I have read a LOT of shoujo, but it never hit me in the feels, and I always was annoyed with the heroine. Kamisama Kiss gave me a SMART, SPUNKY, LIKABLE AND ENDEARING protagonist that I wanted to see succeed. And it gave me a love interest that wasn't just the jerk with a heart of gold-he was so much more than that. I adore Nanami, and after seeing the anime-as good as it was-I can honestly say it truly doesn't do the manga much justice.The characters CHANGED and grew and I loved all of them! Even the side characters. I wanted the best for them all, and Nanami did not let anyone trample her. She stood up for herself and kicked butt, which is something rare in shoujo these days:(I never thought the mangaka could pull off such a complex story with ease. And I loved every moment of it. Thankfully, this series is continuing, but it truly felt like a conclusion to the series as we finally learn the secrets as to why Mikage left the shrine, who Nanami is, etc.There's comedy, romance, adventure, action, a PLOT in shoujo!!!! and tons of Japanese mythology. Add in great writing, art and characters, and I was sold. No really I spent too much on this series. BUT THAT's OK! :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKAF90O5YX6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421577259#wasThisHelpful","R1BKAF90O5YX6F","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone learning Japanese, it is ESSENTIAL to get the most you can out of what is offered. If you have Genki or Tobira or any textbook, you will eventually come to the conclusion that while they get you started, you are still lacking skills in that language. So what can you do? Pick up Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication.Unfortunately, this includes romaji right underneath the kana, so if you're trying to break away from that habit, you're going to have a difficult time unless you either cover up the romaji or black them out. If you are going to Japan and have no knowledge of the language, then this is basically your Bible. Take it with you!! Textbooks tend to cover the ""polite"" form of Japanese, which is nice but when that's all you know, your'e not going to be able to really voice your thoughts on something. This book definitely clears this up. I've had this for about a month now, and already I feel more polished in Japanese.What else can you get to improve your skills? Japanese Graded Readers. I have a review for this, and honestly, they have been extremely helpful! You are given a chipboard box with little books that are in color and written in Japanese. The difficulty goes up with each level and each set comes with a CD so you can follow along with the native Japanese reader. You can also pick up what are considered some of the best manga for beginners: Yotsuba, Shirokuma Cafe, and Chi's Sweet Home. Granted, as easy as they are, this will still be difficult for non-native Japanese. You probably won't get most of it right away, but don't let that deter you! You can do it!What if you don't care for learning from manga? Try a novel by Yoshimoto Banana like  ""High and Dry"" or pick up a picture book from a Studio Ghibli movie. I got Howl's Moving Castle in Japanese and it's a steep learning curve, but definitely helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJNR5WKVE521/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1568364202#wasThisHelpful","R2RJNR5WKVE521","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THIS is what I needed! I really am striving to learn the language, and when you are faced with reading, it is extremely difficult compared to speaking the language. This is for the ultimate beginner-except you NEED to know your hiragana!!! Kanji is included so you aren't bogged down with endless kana, but don't worry if you can't read kanji, there is furigana!You get 6 very short stories-somewhere around 13 pages each-and they are thin, portable and not too intimidating. The books are bright and colorful, and it's easy to understand most of it purely from context if your vocabulary is poor. The listed recommendations to succeed with these readers is listed on the back: For 0, you should know around 350 vocab and around 400 sentences. I don't use Anki, have only started to study with Genki and at most can read some Yotsubato and Chi's Sweet Home-but not the whole thing. THIS is what I needed.Since I have listened to a lot of music, seen anime and j-dramas, I was able to recognize a lot of the words and since this is very basic Japanese, it was very easy.I can read hiragana and some kanji, but the most difficulty I had was when I didn't know some words. A dictionary like Denshi Jisho is recommended if you need to look up a word.The stories: Sakura, Daizu-about Soybeans, A dad late for work, Ichiro going to school, Yumi and Maria, and the last is about your friendly policeman, Ryou-san, I really enjoyed the last one personally.The CD: can play on your computer. Don't know about the car, but I will update this review when I found out. The readers are native Japanese, and switches between a woman, and a man, and sometimes an old lady or little girl and boy depending on the story. Ryou-san in book 6 spoke very fast compared to the other readers. The voices were clear and I had no time following along.Is the price worth it? YES! Not only did I have fun reading, learning new words and reading out loud along with the readers and on my own, I found out how far in my studies I am. In fact, I felt really smart because I finished all 6 in around 3 hours, but of course the time it takes to complete it will be different for everyone. I happen to be a little more advanced in Japanese than I thought I was, which really boosted my confidence.If your'e taking the JLPT, in school, want to read Japanese, I honestly have to recommend this over Yotsubato and Chi's Sweet Home if you know your hiragana. The CD really helps your pronunciation, the stories aren't too long or too short, and you really feel motivated when you realize how far you have come! If you feel you aren't making much progress, it's most likely that you don't have enough vocabulary, grammar and sentences under your belt, but don't worry! You can only get better!! Highly recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OL9A04DZP7O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4872177118#wasThisHelpful","R3OL9A04DZP7O4","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my Goodreads: NO SPOILERSElliot...I am so so so so so sorry...I have no words to express what just happened to him. It was possibly one of the most tragic things I have read about, or seen on tv, or in real life. Death steals so much from you than just that person, and to know that someone close to you might be the cause for your endless suffering...what do you do?We watch how Elliot and Leo met, and it wasn't the best of impressions. But they have worked through their differences, and are no longer the ""commoner"" and the ""aristocrat"" or the ""valet"" and the ""master."" Despite what Elliot's family thinks of his friendship with Leo, they both care so much for each other. To fangirls of them, I can't agree with this pairing. They are like brothers to me. Or the best of friends.And Reim...oh Reim....Break is frustrated with himself, causing him to hurt others as he tries to make up for what he lost 2 volumes ago, while Oz and Alice are cornered in a dangerous situation.And I am sitting here, begging my characters not to die...2 already have, and yes, they are from the main cast...so NO none of them are safe. Anyone and everyone can be killed, and I just hope my favorites somehow survive.I want all of them to, but it's futile to wish for that, after seeing those people die. Another great volume, but riddled with sadness, death and betrayal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13FG5IXI72H00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316197335#wasThisHelpful","R13FG5IXI72H00","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my Goodreads: Very slight spoiler for those that have not read volume 11. It's about Break.My heart just cracked.To lose your vision, that is my greatest fear. I rely on it so much, and to have it taken from me, I don't know what I would do. Break obviously has come to care for Sharon, so much more than he himself realizes...and he can never look upon her again. And this ballroom scene, it broke my heart. He realizes he needs to tell her, after faking his blindness, and when he does, he fears it will cause her anguish...and yet, it plays out so beautifully.Elliot accepts Oz as his friend, and shares a touching moment with Oz, while Leo faces his own monsters in the background.And to lighten the mood, Alice and Oz have a moment on the dancefloor.Pandora Hearts is going to ruin me should anything more happen to my characters. I proudly admit to crying during Break and Sharon's moment.

"From my Goodreads:You know that the main characters are no longer safe when one of them goes blind, one has no idea who they are, and when they all suffer terribly some point in their lives. I am convinced now, that my characters are no longer safe from death, and that is why I am terrified to keep reading.Pandora Hearts has broken cliches in manga. It has put forth a strong emphasis on sticking to the plot as well as forcing the cast to grow up, change and become better people, or worse people than when you first saw them. It makes you see the whole cast as human, and even the ones that make me curl my lip and hope they die a gruesome death, have a painstakingly clear humanity to them.We see how Gilbert received the Raven, how Vincent is preying upon Ada for something we don't yet know of, and that the ""Heady Hunter"" is back. The Head Hunter was briefly mentioned in volume 3, and since then, has not been spoken of. Everything resurfaces, so when reading, make note of everyone, everything.And ELLIOT!! I knew that something bad had happened to you, that you couldn't escape the fear and loneliness of the cast, and I am sorry that it's true. The Head Hunter is after the Nightray family, and so much misunderstanding has come of it to haunt Elliot after it shattered his family.Sharon is suffering knowing that she loves Break dearly, and is doing all in her power to move forward and help him. She breaks down and cries, and she is human, and seeing her emotions stirs the others to do what they must. Even Reim san cares deeply for Break, and Break himself, the poor soul, feels tormented by his fading presence.I urge you to give this a chance. Pandora Hearts slowly unravels and breaks you apart, but don't worry-it's not all that bad :D","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RAJUANC5L3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316197297#wasThisHelpful","R30RAJUANC5L3K","A18324KM7XB5IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18324KM7XB5IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my Goodreads, NO SPOILERS:Pandora Hearts, essentially, is a love story-of many kinds of love. And it's not a mushy one. It is tragic, dark and filled with violence, self-sacrifice and friendship, romance and betrayal. And it works.This volume, has to be the BEST I have read so far, and that's saying A LOT, since every volume thus far has been exceptional.Love and romance, friendship and trust is basically what Pandora Hearts is. It is a love story.Pandora Hearts is a series where you think you know the answer to something, but you don't. And it's a very well told story. Every detail has meaning, every word, everything, is connected. The characters all are so real, and I have become 100% invested in them to the point that should any of them die, I know I will hurt. All of them mean something to me, and that is something hard to do as a writer. To speak to your reader and make you root for them, even the bad guys...speaking of!!I thought I HATED Vincent-well, I still hate what he did, but WOW talk about character depth! I felt soooooo bad for him, I understood him, and the worst part is, he really wasn't at fault...I am very pleased with how this series has kept up it's superb story telling, art and suspense.

"I actually read this book after I read the second installment of this series, Scarlet Heat (Born to Darkness), and I glad I did. It was not horrible, but the heroine at times made it unbearable. There were times that Addison seriously got on my nerves, and I did not understand Corbin's fasciation with her. He truly was a patient individual. My frustration came from her stupidity, or naiveté, and her selfishness. I understood that she felt guilty, but she was not at all realistic of the situation. It is as if she was blind to danger, and did not care the consequences her actions had on other people, i.e. Corbin, and even at times her best friend Taylor.I was able to get a gist of her personality in the second book, but to me this was a full on gust of wind in this one. At times I was like, girl! Seriously! Come on! I understand she had loyalty, but it was as if she had it only for Taylor and herself. A lot of us may not like certain people, maybe even to the point of detesting them, but we still know how to at least fake it. Even if we do not feel like faking it, we know how and when we should. She didn't! Even though she is not real, that is something that I really did not like about her, because she was aware of the stakes when it came to certain people, and it was as if she did not care that she could have ruined Corbin's life, even to the point of him not having one. That was beyond it for me, and therefore solidified it, for me, how much of an unlikeable character she was.Aside from that, the story was nicely written and super easy to follow. To be honest, even though she has great stories I wish this is how Laurann Dohner would write. Even if you do not like certain characters, you can always appreciate the written talent of Evangeline Anderson and how fluidly realistic her style is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QN1P81L7VM4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOVLVCU#wasThisHelpful","R2QN1P81L7VM4E","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked this installment of the New Species series. Moon is an extremely likable male protagonist who is definitely an alpha male, but is not an overbearing one. Joyce Yard is a likable female character as well, as she did not seem TSTL (too stupid to live) or get on my nerves like some of the female protagonists in previous installments of this series have.I liked reading the friendship between Harley and Moon. We saw that a tad bit in Slade's story, but for me it was the most personal that I have read thus far.I will say that I have noticed something about Laurann Dohner's books that I could not put my finger on, but I now know what it is and accept that it is just something I will just have to get used to. in a majority of the books in this series, I felt that her writing was not as smooth or as polished as it could be. But reading this edition, I noticed that what it is are the constant, back to back questions or statements that characters in her stories will make. To me, I cannot see a real life conversation being this way (especially when it involves those who are supposed to be involved as professionals in specific fields - i.e. doctors). I noticed it especially in Justice and Obsidian's books, though I have read it in a couple others as well. To make it short, there are constant paragraphs where one character will ask question-question-question, or statement-statement-statement. However, it is not read (at least to me) in any type of fluid realism. especially when it comes to those who are supposed to be professionals, I came away surprised at times for some of the questions they would ask. A lot of it was common sense, or did not require a statement of (obvious) observation.Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and thought it was a great follow to Shadow's story. To me, it is up there with the stories of Fury, Slade, Tiger and Shadow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PSSOAJ65H4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR2LPPY#wasThisHelpful","R33PSSOAJ65H4R","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To me this story was all over the place. One thing I believe many who read this genre can appreciate is the length, because to find a story that is almost three hundred pages of this content and this price can be hard to find. But the story itself is something else.Firstly, the story was a little hard to follow at times. I was able to get through it, but some things just did not make sense, in regards to order of occurrence, actions of the main character, etc. Also, there were multiple spelling as well as grammatical mistakes. They were not overly overbearing, but once I kept seeing some of the same errors happening, my eyes were on alert.When it comes to the heroine of the book, Olivia, she was confusing to me a bit, which did not make her entirely likable. Even though she is captured by monsters and ""gifted"" to one, it seems as if she were more agitated with the few humans that were there instead of the monsters. Some may think under the circumstances she may fear one over the other, but in this situation she had no power at all, but she still felt a way to the humans, and instead did not even think to try and associate with them, or try to level with them so they could see her as a human being as well, and feel sympathy for her.Also, a lot was just not explained for me. How did the few humans get there, and why would they stay? Where exactly were they? What was going on with the portals? Where did they get Olivia's constant inventory of clothing? Then the ending to me felt a little rushed, and which was where Olivia ultimately got on my nerves. I do not want to give it away, but there came a point where she could have been actual help, but all she did was yell and scream; she would not even move out of the way. And then Leo was something I did not expect, and was dramatically rushed.Overall it was ok if this is something you are into, but it could have definitely been structured better so it actually flowed, and emotionally and logically made sense; to me that was not the case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1UFXJDW9DP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQR3YY0#wasThisHelpful","R1I1UFXJDW9DP8","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is just like Gingerbread Run, except for the fact that it is a dinosaur instead of a cookie. The graphics are not great, and the controls are even worse. There are even times where the ground is not very clear, so you could be falling off a cliff not because of bad trajectory or your own personal mishap, but because it is hard even telling if anything is there.

"This app is similar to the likes of Stickman Run, in regard to it being a blatant copy of Temple Run. However, Temple Run is free (besides the themed ones). The icon of this app is cute and crisp, but that does not translate to the actual game. It is very unclear as well as hard to maneuver.

"So this game opens up to a pretty interesting rocky background scene with the play menu in the foreground, which has the words play, options, high scores and about vertically displayed. When you click 'options,' you have the choices of changing your username, having the layout be left handed or right handed, customizing the joystick sensitivity, and then change the music and effects volume. Your name has to be six characters or more, however, for it to stick. There are also other things like visual effects and the ability to show hints that you can turn off and on.When you play the game, the decision to choose what level immediately pops up. There are 50 levels in the game; however, all but level one are locked. Each level also has a title, and the title of level one is aptly named ""Journey Begins.""So basically, you have to guide the ball to exit to complete the level. To move the ball, you put your thumb on the joystick below and slide to desired direction. Again, if you are left handed, you can change the layout within the options view. During gameplay, you can change the camera angle by sliding your finger horizontally around teh center of the screen.Verdict:This game plays great on my Kindle Fire, and I'm sure it will on my S3 as well. At first this game was a little confusing to play, and even though they had a few hints made available, those were only directional in regard to the objective of the game which is to navigate until you reach the next level. You have to play this game as if your Kindle, phone or tablet were a joystick. What I do like is the fact that each tile you are on is lit, so depending on the angle you have on the game it helps in determining where you are rolling, or in regard to the later levels where you are before you gauge the jumping range. I also like the fact that you can change it if you are left handed, which I think not a lot of people think about. Though you have the ability to change the sensitivity in the options area, there is no clear indication labeled to determine each extreme. It is basically a guessing game until you play the game. Even though I messed around with it, the controls were still not easy to utilize at the end of the day.Also, the rounds are timed so when you fall, instead of waiting for the visual to show the ball falling and then going back to the beginning, just click on the screen. That way you are not wasting vital seconds just looking at the screen.It is a good game, it is just the controls that bring it down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VCM9LEEVMA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YV077U#wasThisHelpful","R33VCM9LEEVMA2","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is playing great so far. What I appreciate are that the controls are nice, and you get that 3D aspect where it feels like you are flying. That is one of the best parts for me, as it is amazingly fun, and I can see a lot of people gravitating towards this game for that particular reason.

"This train game turned out to be both enjoyable and challenging. It does sort of get a little hard to put down once you get the hang of it. This has the potential for hours (or days) of game play, especially if you are really competitive and would like to try and get a perfect score on each level. The new levels might cost a bit more to unlock, but I do understand the developer's need to generate extra revenue, but at the same time if I purchase this game, why should I have to pay more on top of that? It would be different if, like other developers, the actual game were free, but for unlocking and special attributes, you would have to purchase to obtain those. Otherwise, this is definitely a nice puzzle game. It brings challenge, but still has the ease of fun. Graphics are beautiful and fit the purpose perfectly. Only criticism is that the star rating for levels can be ambiguous. Most levels get 3* for completion, then 1 level is completed but earns 1* or 0*? It does get a tad confusing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBMKJ194UUGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N6NGYG#wasThisHelpful","R3MBMKJ194UUGQ","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fabulous conceptual app that looks like it would fascinate and intrigue a lot of people, be it children or adults. I would have to say (or rather, write) that this application is more than a simple book reader. The book opens just like a regular book and the voice starts reading the story. After turning a few pages, the book reader stops to present an interaction of what is currently going on to the story; this makes it so the user is not just a passive reader. The user can do some rubbing or will be prompted to answer some questions related to what was just read or shown.

"I wanted to like this antiperspirant as I was under the impression that it was really natural and worth it. I also just wanted to try something different, as I have been using Secret and Dove for years, but desired to try an antiperspirant for a change. But I suppose this just isn't for me. It went on easy enough, but by the time I got to work, I was smelling a little funky. It was not bad, but it was as if I had not put on anything at all. It was a little embarassing, so the next day I gave it another shot, thinking I had not put on enough, and it was the same thing. Considering that I was working a full shift, on one of my breaks I went out and bought a travel size Secret deoderant.

"Seeing this picture for this app brought me nostalgia, for I loved this book as a kid. When I was four this was my favorite book, and I was a bit surprised (though I shouldn't be) that almost twenty years later it is still one of the most popular out there, and has translated into the virtual market.With that being said, there are five levels in this game, level one being the easiest, and then it progressively getting a little more challenging, each one requiring more skill than the other. When you begin the game, there is automatically background music playing and an instructional voice that asks you to get the fruit, and how many times. However, you can turn off both music and voiceover if you like. In each level the number of fruits are also sequential, but from the options menu you can alter that as well, so it will be a random number of fruits instead of going from 1 fruit, 2 fruits, 3 fruits, etc.This game played great on my first generation Kindle Fire with no issues. So aesthetically, this game looks great and matches well with the book. At the end of the day, it is a pretty simple counting game. However, the age range says 'all ages,' but I am not sure if that is super realistic for those in the younger age range. In this game you have to follow instruction (from either the voiceover, written word, or both), and I am not sure how many three year olds have that patience. Also, after you are successfully eating the food, instead of it going to the next crop of food, you have to click the 'done' button. I think this is a good game for those who are, say, four-five years old or up, while parents should probably play with their children who are younger than that, so they can actually get through the game. I'm also not sure if it is worth the original price range, but it is up to the consumer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A7QD8YFN5NHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074VA2T2#wasThisHelpful","R2A7QD8YFN5NHP","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a disappointment. This could have been a great game if the time was taken to actually make sure the game simply worked.

"I am curious to know if seven years is too long for Justin Timberlake fans, because I know for a fact that many have been feigning for what feels like forever for some fresh, new music from him. Many were upset (myself included) that we were hearing that only ten tracks were on the album, with an additional two if you purchase the deluxe version at target. However, word got out on the 18th of March (via ?uestlove of The Roots, then from JT himself), that more music from the recording sessions will be released later in the year, to complete the vision of the 20/20 experience.Pusher Love Girl - For a quick second, this beat reminded me of something that D'angelo would have used in his earlier music endeavors. I really like the beat and musical arrangement of this song. On the track, Justin sings about how he is so enamored with a certain girl's presence, that he has become ""a junkie for her love."" I can see this song fitting its way into many genres, and for that reason seeing it as definite single potential.Suit & Tie - I will be honest, I did not fall in love with this song upon release. I still am not in love with this song. I felt as if the inclusion of Jay Z did not mesh well, as they were not complementing themselves at all on this track. To me, it was as if they were on two total different tracks, speaking about totally different things. This songs succeeds in creating an urban-pop record where JT cockily proclaims, ""I be on my suit and tie s***... let me show you a few things about love..."" I am a sucker for big-band music (horns in the background), but I felt like a lot of different things were experimented in here (the chopping and screwing of the beginning and toward the end, etc). It is not my favorite.Don't Hold The Wall - You can clearly tell that this is a Timbaland production. I was immediately drawn it this song, where he sings about letting yourself go and dance instead of being somewhat the likes of a wallflower and ""holding the wall.""  This is a track that really allows the beat to be showcased, as singing parts are omitted in a few portions of the song. I immediately gravitated to it in the beginning, but felt like the seven minute song dragged a little bit toward the end.Strawberry Bubblegum - I did not imagine the result of a song titled `strawberry bubblegum' sounding like what I initially thought it would. With a fun and wacky name as the title, I imagined something loud and over the top. This song is surprisingly super mellow and clean. JT sings about loving the taste of his girl, and hoping that she will never change. Now, you can take this song metaphorically, or literally - that is up to you.  Simply put, he is intoxicated with this girl and does not know why but figures he does not need the answer -- he just needs his girl.Tunnel Vision - It seems like this boy is really in love! In this song, he sings about being so in love that even in a crowded room all he sees is one person. He is so gone in love, but it seems as if upon realization that he really is in love, he is a little scared. Maybe scared about being so gone, for he sings that ""now that I know the truth, what am I supposed to do?"" He can no longer deny it, which he also iterates, for he knows that she already knows his feelings. This is really an interesting song about finally having to come to terms with your feelings and emotions, and being ok with it.Spaceship Coupe - In Strawberry Bubblegum he begins the song by saying, ""this song goes out to you, this is dedicated to you,.."" while in Spaceship coupe he starts off similarly by saying, ""hey, I wrote this song for you."" It is a little obvious, but by this time you clearly see that this album is starting to have a certain theme. This song is about being alone with the one you love, just the one you love. He sings of obtaining seclusion with his love, the image of the two of them getting away together in empty space, and enjoying it.That Girl - Back to the big-band-like I was writing about earlier, thanks to JT and the Tennessee Kids. He is proclaiming that he is in love with ""that girl"" and does not give a damn what the opinions or stares of others are. She is his in love with his number one girl, and is already happy because she already told him that ""she's in love with me."" For some reason, I felt like this could be an answer to Alicia Key's song Un-thinkable (I'm Ready). Weird, I know, but I felt like these two songs are along the same themes and lines, where they both sing about no longer ignoring what is so obvious to them, and no longer caring what others think. Great song by JT and the Tennessee Kids.Let The Groove In - When I first heard this song, it kind of reminded me of ""Señorita"" from Justified. There is a lot of repetition that is so stretched in this song that I really did not care for, and he sings about enjoying the groove, and moving like there will be no tomorrow. Maybe this song will do well for a commercial, but I do not see it as one that I will have on repeat.Mirrors - Clearly this song is about the woman in his life, and how she is the better half of him. This is a pretty deep song about finally finding the one who completes you, and how he does not want to lose that person and how no one else could fill that place. He sings, ""it's like you're my mirror, my mirror staring back at me."" Simply put, he has found his equal in the love of his life.Blue Ocean Floor - This song is really slow, and honestly a little depressing. He sings about being able to understand some one so much, better than anyone else, for they are so in tune with one another that they are on the same ""frequency."" Nothing can incapacitate that fact, be it man-made or nature bound, is what I'm getting from this song. If you got a different vibe from this song, let me know. It is kind of a quiet song, reminds me of the ending of the movie Inception for some odd and random reason. Needless to say, not a favorite at the moment.I have got to be honest, I am a little confused at what Justin would consider himself music-vise, or what others think of him as. It is obvious that there are r&b related in some of the music he releases, but he is still considered to be pop. He definitely is Popular music, but I see this body of work as vastly different from what is considered as today's pop (i.e. Ke$ha, One Direction, Justin Bieber, whatever the heck else). This is even different (of course it would be) from when he was in his band days. With this album, you seriously see the growth JT has had as an artist, and how he has matured with age and where he currently is in life thanks to his marriage. Huge difference from his Justified days.I am eager to hear the other music JT and Timbaland have in store for us later this year. This is a pretty solid album, but does not get me over the moon excited after a 7 year hiatus from this man. However, there are plenty of songs that will be on my repeat list while I wait out for the completion of this experience. I am, however, if the other (currently unknown number) tracks will follow along the same theme of this album and will just be a continuation, or if it will be in a absolutely different direction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRR3T9SOOBXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCZU8WM#wasThisHelpful","RKRR3T9SOOBXB","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This app contains several different puzzles beautifully rendered and set to a creepy back story. All of the puzzles included can be found as separate apps, but now you can have them all in one gorgeous package. Hats off to the developers, amazing work. I love the variety of puzzles and difficulty levels couple with amusing graphics and ghoulish voice of the phantom looking host.I know, however, that app developers need to make money, but I know a lot of people are not going to be ecstatic to pay for hints, especially if they already shelled out the money to purchase the app in the first place. Nevertheless, it is not a requirement to purchase these hints, and at least the game is not structured in a way that you are forced to spend money in order to progress. It just depends on you in regard to how valuable you deem the game, to whether you wish to spend additional money on it.Overall, The Curse is a puzzle lover's dream come true. This is a great game with tons of variety in levels that are certainly not a walk in the park.

I have dry skin and a very dry scalp (it actually gets embarrassing, for I don't have dandruff, but flakes from my dry scalp), and I've had this scalp issue since I was young, so thanks to my mother I have used the gamut in specialized shampoo. But this one seems awesome and very promising for a person like me..","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PGN4G7Z7T8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UU05YC#wasThisHelpful","R32PGN4G7Z7T8T","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this at a local grocer, and seeing that it was sulfate and paraben free, as well as in a different though unique bottle, so I decided to give it a try. I will say that I did not mind the texture of the shampoo. This is the volumizing version, and that is not really an issue for me for my hair is in an afro in its natural state, but this was the only version I saw at the store, and I suppose I was not paying attention to the ""volumizing"" portion. However, this did lather for me. Some mentioned otherwise, but it lathered up for me, at least on my second rinse.So I used this shampoo in the shower, did two washes as I usually do and immediately after the second rinse felt uneasy. Even though my hair was clearly drenched, it felt stripped to me. I did not like the feel at all. It was as if as if all nutrients were taken away from my hair instead of my hair receiving it. It was not soft at all. So afterwards, I conditioned my hair with a different brand, and then deep conditioned with Feel It Formula Deep Conditioning Treatment, Box of 12 (even though the link says box of twelve, I only used one) for an hour, and afterwards my hair felt immensely better.I want to give this shampoo the benefit of the doubt, for it was a wash directly after I had taken down my hair from extentioned twists (though it should really be irrelevant), but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I will use it once more since I spent money on it without the added conditioning measures I utilized the first time, but if I come out with the same result I'm going to have to get rid of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBST8PVHD5NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023AV31U#wasThisHelpful","R2SBST8PVHD5NR","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice game that progressively does get challenging. First thing I noticed was the sound of the game, which I liked. The graphics are beautiful as well. Although this isn't a strategy-type game, this game does have a unique concept that keeps your intrigue throughout. It is actually a really run game; however, there are plenty of times that you have to have the exact perfect angle to reach an area.

"This is a great app. Ever since I was in the second grade, I have loved mathematics and arithmetic. I have realized however that I have let this go in my early 20s. Not being forced to take math courses like I was in K-12 really can show, and although I am not an invalid, playing around on this app I realize I am not as quick as I used to be.What I like:I like that there are different levels of difficulty that you can choose from. The options are clear, you can get playing right away.  categories are easy, medium, hard and expert. There are also different categories to play in so it doesn't get boring or redundant. These categories are calculations, bubbles and tables. You also have the choice to operate with the timer or not.What I don't care for so much:No real way to keep track of each time played so you can compete against previous scores in each category. I also don't care for the facebook inclusion, but someone younger may want to share this with their friends on the web.This is a great app that concentrates on reinforcing basic calculations and keeping these skills sharp.

"This app is pretty freaking cool, and I'm glad it was the FAOTD.Firstly it worked very well in accordance to the GPS, so unlike some other applications, it seems that this will not be an issue while you're near or inside an airport as long as you have an internet connection. It was lightening fast to my local Airport, and I am probably 20-25 minutes away.The interface was at first a little confusing to me, but the learning curve is pretty quick. Basically, the flight numbers are in one column, origin in the next column, followed by the gate and arrival/departure time. You can easily scroll through the rows from top to bottom. Once you find the flight you are looking for, you click on the row and all the information you need expands. You see the airport it departed from, airport it is landing to, the times for both, as well as the capability to email or message that information to someone if you so choose. You can do a whole bunch of other stuff with this information if your phone type permutes, as well as track the flight in real-time if you download another app (Flighttrack).I checked this app alongside my local airport's flight website, and so far everything has been accurate. When you are in the app, the airport's time, the interval of time the list of flight are being shown to you as well as the last time the app updated said list is indicated on the bottom of the screen in small lettering. It is not intrusive, but moves at a constant basis. On the top left status bar is where the name of the airport is located, and to the right of that are two arrows that you can pick to decide if you would like to see departing or arriving flights. You can only see one or the other, not both at the same time.There is also a search bar for your convenience if you would prefer to cut to the chase and find your flight. I was unsuccessful in finding some of the random flights I found in or out on the airport's website, so I thought there might be an issue with accuracy with this app. However, on the bottom of the screen it is indicated what interval of time the app is showing flights. At the moment it is showing at a six hour interval -- therefore only the arriving or departing flights from 2:55am to 8:55am pst. It really depends how long you are at an airport to determine if you would need a more broad list or times of flights, but that may be an issue or inconvenience for some. I could not find a way to expand or lengthen the time interval either.If the flight is on time/en route, the time is green. If it has landed, it is blue. If it is delayed, it is orange (though it may look red to some; it's more of a tangerine orange in my opinion, but that is besides the point).At the end of the day, I really like this app. I can see those who frequently travel benefitting from it, and a great app to have for those who sporadically travel as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51RN24N74K5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ET78TS#wasThisHelpful","R51RN24N74K5V","A36R1GGNDJ0R5I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36R1GGNDJ0R5I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lotion was prescribed by my dermatologist as I have Eczema with a weird combination of Psoriasis, and as it as ceramides in it, it is supposed to help restore my dry skin. I have been using it for almost three months, and I like it over all. It isn't oily to me, which is nice. I will say that I use it as a body moisturizer and not something on my hands (even though I have some Eczema there). I have really dry hands (especially in the winter), and it's hard for me to find lotion that actually moisturizes my hands literally and visually. So I do put it on my hands by habit, but I put either Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 7.3 Ounce or Vaseline Cocoa Butter Deep Conditioning Body Lotion 13.52 oz, as they both absorb very well into the skin on my hands.

"I have wanted an Invicta watch since I saw them on a cruise many years ago.  Invicta makes high quality watches our grandparents would have loved but with style that fits the 21st century.  The current fashion trend with watches is for them to be big and this one fits that description.  This watch is large and thick.  You can see in the photos the two toned colors, the additional dials for day, date and 24 hours.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is that it comes with an instruction booklet that is thick and explains how to adjust all the settings for just about every watch Invicta makes.  It is somewhat generic for all invicta analog watches but it's well written and includes a short story of how the company began.  It also comes with care instuctions and a plastic card where you can record the purchase date.I  put the watch on and was pleased that it was loose on my wrist. I have very large wrists for a woman and many bracelets and most watch bands are too small for me.  I will be able to adjust this smaller if needed but for now it's very comfortable fitting loosely.  I haven't had it long enough to talk about how well it keeps time but, because of the brand and the warranty that comes with the watch, I will assume it does a good job at that.  The documentation that comes with the watch includes care instructions and recommends you take this watch to a watch shop for inspection once a year to keep it in top running condition.  Overall, I am very pleased with this watch.  However, if you don't want a very large timepiece on your arm, I would recommend you look at other watches from Invicta.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM74PGT1O0HDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKV1M#wasThisHelpful","RM74PGT1O0HDN","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice docking station that looks good and does it's job.  It's smaller than you would thing based on the photos but it works well with my iPhone 5s.

The cord is a good length to plug into a wall socket.I tested this first while sitting on the sofa with my laptop in my lap.  I plugged my phone in and set the dock next to me.

"I was disappointed in the quality of this product.  I knew it was going to be plastic but I didn't expect it to be that brittle kind of plastic that will crack and break after a few washes and use.  That said, we'll see if it exceedes my expectations.Setup - you have to look at the manual for this one because it is not obvious how to set it up and/or take it apart for cleaning.  It came with the pump in it but not attached in any way so it rattled in the box.  To open the area with the pump, there's a small tab that you push up on and the whole thing opens up.  The pump has a small round opening that fits inside the round opening in the side of the interior of the dish so the water stream is controlled.  After washing everything in mild soap and attaching the pump to the dish, it was ready for use.Use - The dish holds more water than I expected and can be very heavy.  I was concerned that the sides would break when I lifted the full dish from the sink so I recommend you find a place for the dish and just refill it with a glass or something.  It runs very quietly and there is very little motion in the water.  However, if you look closely, you can see ripples in the water and see that it IS circulating.  I set this bowl up close to my cat's food dish and old stainless steel water bowl.  I let the water in the old bowl get stale to entice kitty to try the new bowl.  As far as I can tell, she is still avoiding it.As I mentioned at the start of this review, the entire dish is made of molded plastic.  This is something I avoid in my pet's food and water dishes based on the recommendation of my vet.  I had a kitty who suffered from feline acne and plastic was a big no-no.  It is nice that this dish can go in the dishwasher but I'm concerned the detergents and heat will bleach the color and break down the plastic.  For this reason, I give it three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GO0YNWWTE4K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6S4#wasThisHelpful","R1GO0YNWWTE4K5","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the bright color and the feel of the keys on this keyboard.  It was easy to set up once I acquired some AAA batteries and borrowed a screw driver from a coworker.  The keys are big and well spaced and the raised portion on the F and J are easy to feel so you can get lined up.  The home/end/insert/delete keys are in a logical place on the keyboard and clearly labeled.  All of the keys are quiet EXCEPT the spacebar which clicks every time you hit it.The keyboard takes two triple A batteries that supposedly come with the keyboard.  They were missing from mine but it was only a minor inconvenience.  Just make sure you have some on hand.  Being a person who frequently eats at my desk, I like how easy it is to clean this keyboard.  Setup was as easy as plugging in the wireless dongle (which is hiding in one of the small end boxes).  I am using Windows 7 and it was able to find the correct drivers and start working right away.  The function keys appear to do the things they are supposed to do.After typing on it for a bit, my hands are a little cramped so maybe the keys are a little closer together than I had thought.  Also, I would prefer a little more elevation when I use the legs under the keyboard.  Otherwise, it's pretty and trendy and functional.EDIT - I ordered the PDP Rock Candy Wireless Mouse to go with this keyboard and, while I like the feel of the mouse, I am disappointed that it is not recognizing the wireless transmitter from the keyboard and vice versa.  I have two small wireless transmitters sticking out of my laptop and no USB ports remaining.  I will contact customer support if I can't get the two to work with just one transmitter as advertised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKC2U8FMHHSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JCWH6O#wasThisHelpful","R2UKC2U8FMHHSH","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This product was offered to me through the Vine program and I thought some people might appreciate the feedback from someone who doesn't work out on a regular basis but would like a stronger core for better health.  I took every thing out of the package and felt a little overwhelmed.  I was ready to strap it on but it said I had to first charge it for 2 full hours.  As most exercise adverse people would do, I put it all back in the box for another day.  Finally I got it out and plugged it in to charge.  That evening, I read through the quick start guide and put the gel pads on for the widest point.  It comes with two sets of pads so when one set wears out, you have another to use.The controller is easy to use and the band was JUST big enough to go around my middle.  Per the quick start guide, I turned up the intensity until I could feel my abs tighten.  Then I turned it up a little more.  I went about my business, doing a little house work, watching TV until the cycle finished.  The next day I could tell that my abs had been exercised.

"FIrst let me say, it's beautiful and the glass bottle is very heavy and well made.  It is smaller than I expected and this is a good thing because you don't want a lot of nectar in the bottle for a long time or it goes bad and you hurt the hummingbirds instead of feeding them.  The spinner comes in a separate package, like it was an afterthought.  It's almost as big as the the feeder bottle is tall.  The red color is similar to the color of the nectar and will attract the little birds.  The feeding stations are just right.  It is currently the end of the season for hummingbirds as they are currently migrating for the winter.  However, it is still a lovely addtion to my garden.I took one star off for packaging.

"I use a One Touch Ultra to test my sugars on a regular basis.  This review is a comparison between that monitor and the iHealth Bg5.Setup:  Setup for this monitor felt cumbersome.  First you have to charge it for two hours to ensure a good change.  Other monitors use watch batteries that you can replace and come ready to use out of the box.  In addition, you have to download the app to your smart phone and then link the monitor to your phone.  I look forward to getting the feedback in one place on my phone but this would be intimidating to someone who is not quite as ""electronically savvy"" as I am.  (I'm thinking of my mother.)  Finding the port to plug in the monitor is a challenge. It has a little plug on the side and the opposite side has a power button that is very, very tiny.  They look identical and it took me a bit to find it.Use:  The lancet device is pretty and functional, but still takes some figuring out to get it right.  I prefer the design of the lancets I have with my OneTouch Ultra because the top that you remove to expose the needle becomes a cover for the needle so it can be disposed of in a normal trash can if necessary.  With the lancets included with the iHealth monitor, you end up with a used, exposed needle that should be disposed of in a sharps container for safety.  It's also difficult to figure out how to adjust the depth of the prick.  It is hard to turn but you can turn the end of the device to make adjustments.  It is just not clear that this is what you do since it is so hard to turn.Before you do your first test, you should scan the bottle of test strips.  The app will tell you that it will automatically expire those strips in 90 days. I thought it would read the expiration from the bottle but the 90 days seems like a built in value.  Otherwise it would tell you they will expire on a specific date.I tested with both monitors at the same time using the same finger stick.  iHealth ready 15 points higher than my OneTouch and required quite a bit more blood than the OneTouch.  My mother did the same with similar results.  A second test with the same stick and my results were lower.  I would have expected the same results both times since they were from the same stick and within a few minutes of each other.PROS: Small design with convenient carry pouch that has room to carry everything you need including the charging cable. Values stored on your smart phone for easy tracking over time.  I haven't played with the app much but it has potential to help people manage their diabetes.CONS:Difficult setupInconsistent values and high valuesComes with a control solution and I will try to calibrate to see if the values are closer to the other monitor (which matches the values my Dr gets).  Most monitors today do not require calibration with a control solutionI can't get my replacement strips from the local Pharmacy - my insurance covers the cost of the strips and my Dr. writes the prescription for them.It takes a bigger stick to get enough blood for a test.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVWYWCWNI0FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1IRZTW#wasThisHelpful","R2UVWYWCWNI0FM","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great starter set of matching dishtowels, two potholders and two oven mitts.  The fabric on the dishtowels is a thin terry cloth.  Both the potholders and the oven mitt are more of a heavy woven material.  I have large hands so I found the mitts to be a little difficult to maneuver but they felt substantial enough to use when pulling those cookies out of the oven.  The potholders are thin but protected my hands just fine.  I think I like the towels the best.  I was pleasantly surprised that the print on the terry cloth didn't bind the loops together into a stiff, unusable towel.

"I am fair complected with rosacea so finding a blush that suits my coloring is difficult.  I also need one that isn't going to irritate my skin and cause a break out.  I use Neutrogena soaps and foundation so it made sense to try this blush.  In the package I received the blush Rosy plus the bronzer and the luminous powder.  All can be used as a blusher but I used Rosy for blush, the bronzer to highlight areas to get a sunkist look and the luminous powder all over.  You need your own brushes to apply this product.  It goes on nicely and blends very well.  On my pale skin with red blotches, it smooths out the colors and looks natural.  If you are looking for something bold, keep looking.  This is a blush that is very subtle.At the end of the day, when I remove my makeup with a facial cleansing wipe, there is plenty of color so it stays on very well.

Out of the box you get the Lumo lift, a charging base, two magnetic clips and a clip that is supposed to be used with your bra strap.  I plugged in the charging base and charged my lift for two hours as recommended.  In the pictures, you see the base as a place to set your lumo lift but what it doesn't show you is that it is magnetic so the lumo lift practically jumps onto the base.  If you have it sitting on a desk, you don't have to worry about it not charging due to a poor connection.  I've seen some videos where the owner actually used a rubber band to attach the lumo lift to the charger but I see no need for that at this point.After charging, I set up an account and installed the software on my iPhone.  It paired with my phone almost instantly.  I found the app to be helpful as it takes you through a first time user's training session.  You need to remember three things.1.  Double click to tell it you are in good posture.  You need to do this periodically throughout the day as it can move and get off.2.  Press and hold to start a coaching session.  You don't HAVE to do coaching sessions.  Lumo lift will track how well you maintain good posture regardless but it is nice to be reminded when you've been slouching for two hours.  You will get one buzz when coaching starts.  You'll also get a notice on your phone.3.  Press and hold to stop a coaching session.  You'll get two buzzes when you stop the coaching.On days one and two with the lumo lift, I used the bra strap clip.  When I went to my car to get something, the clip slipped and the lumo lift fell under my car. :(  I crawled under and retrieved it and reattached.  When I reached my destination, it was off again.  I put it back in place and went about my business.  Later it fell off again, this time in the bathroom and I was lucky it didn't get wet.  I tried again on day 2 with similar results.  If you use the bra strap attachment, you need really thin, narrow straps.  If there is any padding in them, the clip won't hold.  I'm hoping maybe they'll come out with a new attachment that has a stronger magnet. (hint, hint)  I would have given this 5 stars if I'd had better luck with that clip.Today I am sitting here, back straight, lumo lift attached with the silver magnet and feeling great about my posture improving.  When I slouch for more than 2 minutes, I feel a mild tickle and straighten up.  I received an email from lumo lift congratulating me on meeting my first milestone.  I've also recieved emails from them saying that I'll get daily emails for the first 14 days to help me get started.  They say it takes three weeks to form a habit so the lumo lift team is making sure we all get a good start on that habit with plenty of positive feedback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMSXEHX632EPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9P8GMW#wasThisHelpful","RMSXEHX632EPB","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a wallet style iPhone case for Christmas and loved it.  The case was wearing out so I ordered a couple from Amazon.  The other case I ordered did not hold up and was falling apart by the end of the first day.  Even though it said you could carry a couple of cards and some other items in the case, it couldn't close if you had even one.  This case, however, has a couple of credit cards, drivers license, a few gift cards, some cash and a receipt all tucked in to the wallet side and closes without any problems at all.  The only negative is flash photography.  The case is so thick, that when you take a photo with the flash, it over exposes and you get a whitish blur.  You have to remove the phone from the case, take the picture and then put it back.  This will wear out the case much quicker than if you left the phone in all the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KELY6UIPFG6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAP7KE4#wasThisHelpful","R1KELY6UIPFG6Z","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never used a manual grinder to grind my coffee and I am impressed.  This is pretty easy to use and I get a perfect grind every time.  With the electric models I've used in the past it varies from having large chunks to a fine powder - oops.  The Tanors Ceramic Burr Coffee Grinder comes with a handy storage bag, a brush to clean it and a handle.  The first thing I did was take it out of the original packaging and take it apart.  The section where the grounds go has a plastic sleeve that holds the grounds.  In the top, you have a ""gear shaped nob"" that you can turn to adjust how course you want it ground.  This can be unscrewed so you can take the grinding mechanism off for cleaning.  (Be careful, there is a small washer between the spring and the grinder that falls off if you didn't know it was already there.)After the initial wash, I put some coffee beans in the grinder, put on the lid and handle and started turning it.  I found it best to hold on to the top half of the grinder to give myself resistance against the handle.  After adjusting the grind to a fine one for a k-cup, I went to work.  Clean up afterwards was a snap and I allowed everything to air dry.  I've used it several mornings in a row and am very pleased.  Not only is it easy to use, it is much quieter than the electric gadget I had used in the past.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QU7E47OAIYCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R1QU7E47OAIYCB","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very mild tasting coffee.  My first cup I thought it tasted very weak but after a few more times drinking it I have decided that it really is just a very mild tasting coffee.  It has a good aroma and is not burnt tasting.  If you are a starbucks drinker then this will not be to your liking.  One thing to note, the cups are not labeled to work in a Keurig 2.0 machine.  Also, the cups are a heavier grade plastic so it is harder to close the lid of the keurig than other cups.

"These are great little clips for cube walls, locker doors, refrigerators - anyplace that has a smooth surface where you need to hold something with a clip and don't want a permanent hole or sticker.  The backing reminds me of those gooey toys you could buy from a quarters machine and then throw against a wall to watch it splat down.  I had several of these toys: balls, octopus, etc.  The difference here is that the material used in the toys is against a flat surface so when you press it against something like a cube wall, it clings and clings very well.  I attached one to the refrigerator door and pressed out the bubbles like the instructions said.  Then I let it sit there.  When I came back, it was very thoroughly attached to the fridge.  The plastic clip is strong and holds papers and small objects very well.When I want to move it to another location, I simply peel it off, wash it if there's any dirt on it, and then put it someplace else after it dries.  My only concern would be painted surfaces.  I can remember my old splat toys leaving what looked like a grease mark on the wall.  I'm not willing to test that theory with these clips.

"A coffee creamer that can sit on a shelf and not require refrigeration is a good thing if you have an office with a coffee pot and no fridge.  The powdered creamer is not exactly what I would call good.  I have been a user of Coffee Mate products for a very long time and I love the small individual sized cups which can sit on a counter and not go bad.  I also love the cartons that have all the different flavors.  All of the flavored versions have sugar in them to make them taste good.This Coffee mate creamer has a different formula than the ones in the little pods and the kind in the carton.  First, the ""original"" is sweetened so if you like your coffee with just cream added, this won't work for you.  The first ingredient is ""sugar"".  This is followed by water and partially hydrogenated oil.  Personally, I would prefer something that did not contain hydrogenated anything.The nutrition label says there are no trans fats but that is for a single serving.  The serving size is one pump.  One pump is supposed to be the equivalent to one of the single serving cups.  However, the advertising that came with the creamer says ""most people put 2 or 3 pumps in their coffee so go ahead and put 3 pumps.  If it is not to your taste, you can put more or less the next time.""  Since 2 or 3 is the recommended ""serving"", it would be nice if they could include the nutrition information for 2 or three.  They provide the information for how many servings you get in a bottle based on 2 pumps per cup of coffee.  Anyway, you are consuming trans fats which are very dangerous fats and clog your arteries.As for flavor, I first tried my coffee with one pump.  It was creamy enough for me and not at all sweet.  I added my usual sweetener and the coffee was good.  The next cup I added 3 pumps.  This was creamy and slightly sweet.  It tasted pretty good.  If it weren't for the trans fats that are hiding in the creamer, I would probably put 4 pumps in my coffee.  At work we have this creamer and a couple of the flavors.  I've seen people put a lot of this stuff in their coffee and I'm sure, because the nutrition label says no trans fats, they have no idea how bad it is for their health.  I would probably give this product 4 stars if the serving size was set to the recommended 2 or 3 pumps and indicated whether or not that provided 1 or more grams of trans fat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144SNSVXVGIAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U132KQ8#wasThisHelpful","R144SNSVXVGIAR","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never used fondant before but since all the cakes these days are decorated with fondant I thought it would be fun to try.  This fondant comes with very few instructions so I did some searching on the internet for a few more instructions.  Then I was ready to decorate.This fondant comes in two blocks.  You massage it and work it with your hands until it is soft and pliable.  It gets a little sticky on your hands as you work it but pulls off cleanly.  I added several drops of food color (gel type) and worked it until the color was even.  Then I put it on parchment paper and started rolling it out.  No matter how thin rolled it, it never showed a single crack.  I used one full block to cover my two layer cake.  I cut the excess from around the edges and smoothed out any wrinkles.  For decorations on my cake I used silicon candy molds and colored pieces of fondant to create roses and leaves and then played with the fondant to make ropes with two colors for edging.Overall, I found it very easy to work with and well made.

"The Datacolor S5X100 SpyderExpress screen calibrator is designed to create a profile for your monitor to ensure it displays colors accurately. This is a valuable function for people who work with photography and videos in particular, ensuring that their finished products will display properly on other screens (assuming the other screens are accurately set) and print accurately. This type of device used to be extremely expensive; now, with consumer level products like this one, any home user can afford to have their monitor is accurately rendering their images.The device is powered through the USB cable, making it easy to work with. I appreciated that the USB cable was long, allowing it to wind down from the top of the monitor all the way to my CPU, which is on the floor.The process is simple, in principle at least - reset your monitor to its factory defaults, then place the calibrator's sensor over the center of your monitor, with a counter-weight holding the sensor in place. Next just start the calibration program. The test takes about 10 minutes, during which time the sensor can not be moved and nothing else can be displayed on screen (read that as - disable pop-ups and close all other programs before you start the test). Once the test is finished, the calibration software will generate a profile for your monitor that adjusts the monitor's output to create an accurate display.In practice, the process is not so simple.I ran two tests with the device and evaluated the results with an onscreen color chart.Initially, I had a great deal of difficulty getting the sensor to seat itself on the screen. If the monitor is straight up and down, the sensor dangles and doesn't press against the screen, which gives flawed results. The instructions said you should tilt the monitor to more of a horizontal position so gravity will keep the sensor in its place. Unfortunately, my monitor doesn't tilt that far back so the sensor wasn't firmly seated against the screen. As a result, my first attempt created a profile that wasn't anywhere close to accurate.My second attempt was better; I actually held the sensor against the monitor for the test. The instructions tell you not to do this, but it was the only way to get the sensor to stay. This test gave me more accurate colors but they were still a little dark. This could be due to the fact that my monitor does not have a factory default reset on it, so I may have run the test with the monitor set too bright. Once I ran the brightness up the colors looked very good.The Datacolor S5X100 SpyderExpress definitely does the job and is in a price range that consumers can afford, so it is an excellent value. Just be prepared to wrestle a bit with the device and your monitor to get it to test properly. I gave it 4 stars only because I feel the mechanism by which the sensor stays on the screen could be improved. Otherwise, this would be a 5 star product all the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UV31T6L3W5LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSL2TO#wasThisHelpful","R3UV31T6L3W5LW","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anne of Green Gables is a classic everyone should read.  The story of the red-haired orphan in Avonlea will steal your heart.  I've read all of the ""Anne"" books many times and it never become old or boring.  The story is set on Prince Edward Island around the turn of the century.  They are still using oil lamps and horse and buggy but you can get ice cream in the city.  Anne is adopted, accidentally but a brother and sister and is a sensitive, imaginative child.  The books take you from her growing up years (""Anne of Green Gables""), to her teen years as a teacher in ""Anne of Avonlea"".  Her years in college (""Anne of the Island'), years as a high school teacher (""Anne of Windy Poplars""), early married life ""Anne's House of  Dreams"", Anne's life as a mother (""Anne of Ingleside"")  her children's adventures (""Rainbow Valley"") and finally the story of her youngest in ""Rilla of Ingleside"".As a young person, I remember searching every book store to find the next book in the series as they had gone out of print for several years.  To have all of them in one kindle book is a great deal and so much fun to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Y78VIB6S39I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVM31GS#wasThisHelpful","R27Y78VIB6S39I","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I applaud Michael Regale for writing this book on such a controversial topic.  I know a lot of people won't even consider reading it because it challenges what we have been taught or what we want to believe.  He starts the book with his background, from his youth when he meets and marries his wife up through the present day when his daughter says she's gay.  He delves into the science of homosexuality and challenges our own interpretations of the Bible.

"My husband is a couch potato with a bad heart so I bought this fitbit for him.  It tracks his steps, the flights of stairs he climbs and his sleep patterns as well as his heart rate.  While he claims that he's not going to change his exercise patterns because of this device, he still brags when he makes his step goal or exceeds the stairs from previous days.  He also loves the caller ID feature since he frequently can't hear his phone.  The buzz on his wrist gets his attention and answers his phone.  As with all fitbit devices, you have a app on your smart phone and you can link with your friends to create a little healthy competition.  When my fitbit flex dies, I'm getting the FitBit Charge HR for myself so I have all the same great features my husband is trying (unsuccessfully) to ignore.  The only down side is the band.  This FitBit is built directly into the band so there's no tiny device to lose.  It is a little awkward to plug it in to charge because of the bulky band.  You also have to buy the size that's right for your wrist and you don't have the options of designer bands like you do with the flex.  Still, I think the features outweigh this one little inconvenience.  Soon you'll see these on the wrists of Hollywood celebrities on the red carpet and black bands will become all the rage in the fashion world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPXRWA07XWVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2BW2PK#wasThisHelpful","R2GPXRWA07XWVP","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It only took me 5 minutes and no tools to install this shower head in my shower.  The hardest part was removing the old shower head.  To install, you simply screw on the main head to the pipe coming out of the wall, attach the hose to the two parts and you're done.  The instructions suggested you might need a wrench and eye protection but I didn't need either.  It was nice to not have to fight with that silicon tape or any goo to stop leaks.  I hand tightened everything and turned on the water - no leaks anywhere.How did it work?  First, I have a LOT of water pressure.  So much, that it has broken plumbing fixtures in the past.  With this shower head, you have several spray options.  There is a lever on the back right of the main head to switch from a rain like spray from the large head, spray from the large head and the hand held or no spray from the main head.  The hand held head connects to the main head via a magnet and clip.  It looks pretty solid.  It too has a lever to adjust from massage, massage and outer or just outer.  There is a button to stop the flow all together.  When I set the shower head to put water through all the jets, I got a soft trickle out of some of them and a sprinkle from the outer head.  Turn off the massage on the handheld and I got a little better ""shower"".  Turn off the handheld all together and plenty of water goes through main head.  The jets are spaced pretty far apart but it's a nice ""rain"".  The handheld by itself was pretty nice.  It gave a good massaging spray when operated alone.  If you plan to run the massage while standing under the ""rain"", you aren't going to get much of a massage.All in all, it's a pretty nice shower head.  Very easy to install and lots of options in how the water comes out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWUFKGR7I15CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA85LM0#wasThisHelpful","RWUFKGR7I15CH","AT9U5ZE5OO84C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9U5ZE5OO84C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy a cup of tea from time to time and generally drink Earl Grey, Chamomile or Peppermint - either loose or in a bag.

It was not over brewed and had a very pleasing scent and flavor.  It was neither too weak nor too strong.  The cup used is recyclable and the tea can go in your garden or compost pile.  Just peel the lid back and you have a soft filter with wet tea.  (Let it cool before doing this!)One thing to note - this is NOT labeled for Keurig 2.0 which is the brewer that I have.

"I waited to review this product after a few months of usage to ensure it was as good as it initially seemed.  It is better.  One of the best facial cream products I have ever used and I've paid as much as $120 for 2.5 ounces of the ""good"" stuff.  I will never do that again, now that I've found this product.  My skin is brighter and tighter after 3 months of use.  Fine lines are gone or significantly diminished.  The very slight lines and inevitable neck sag that was just beginning, is now completely gone.  If I go a few days without using it, I can tell the difference.  Since using it, I have been told by several different people (strangers, work acquaintances, etc.) that I have my beautiful skin!  It has firmed up the skin around my eyes, and diminished all fine lines that were creeping up on me around my mouth.  I am 54, and while taking good care of my skin most of my life, I can say that this product has bought me several more years of healthy looking, more youthful skin.  I also use it on my decolletage, top of my hands and forearms, and elbows with equally great results.

"The only aches and pains I ever have are in my lower back. I like the results of creams like this but HATE the smells. This one doesnt' have that overbearing strong smell that could burn your eyes for days.  It has a minty smell almost like pepto bismol.  It is a lotion consistency not a gel.  The bottle is not huge but it does not take a lot of product even on a large part of your body.  It absorbs quickly and is easy to wash off.  I felt like it did just as good as the gel/strong smelling ones I have tried from the drugstore without the annoying smell.  I use this before bed in the evening after a shower.  I have not had much trouble of it transferring onto my bed sheets and it has not stained or had any affect on my clothing. I felt it took affect quickly and lasted to help me rest easier.  I plan to continue using this instead of my others whenever I have any muscles aches.

"This little pretend play makeup set is so much fun. My little girl loves watching me put my face on in the morning. We have bought her a little vanity with makeup brushes but she did not have pretend makeup.  She is only two so any of the little girl makeup sets are way too messy for her to play with.  This little set comes with everything she needs to pretend.  The powder, blush and eyeshadow compacts have textured material in them so they feel like makeup but do not have any mess what so ever.  They have the look of real makeup but never get used up. I love these because I have a way to let my little girl be girly and pretend without having to worry about her getting it on anything or all over herself.  The lipgloss has a roller ball but no liquid inside.  The brushes are soft and so is the powder puff. This does not look like the plastic hard pretend makeup kits that often come with pretend sets. These look really real which makes them even more fun to play with. She can pretend to do her dolls' makeup which is extra fun also. It comes in a little makeup bag that helps keep it all together. Would make a cute little gift or stocking stuffer for that little girly girl in your life.

"This cotton candy is delicious. It is a flavor I had never really tried(or heard of), but I am loving it.  My daughter and I are big cotton candy lovers and love summer and fairs because of it!  It's hard as a mother of a toddler to give her something she loves knowing that it is full of preservative and harmful ingredients.  This organic cotton candy gives me a bit of a piece of mind giving her her favorite sweet treat. The container this comes in is great because it is a snap close top so your cotton candy stays fresh and does not go stale or get hard quickly like the bagged cotton candy.  From the container, the product and the presentation you can tell that this company puts a lot of effort into making a quality, organic product.  The flavor is amazing!  This is by far one of my favorites with this brand.  The cotton candy is fluffy and very tasty.  It is really packed into the tub so you get a lot of product for the price. This would be a great unique gift option for that sweets lover in your life also(I recommend the 4 pack, it's a great value).  I plan to be back as a return customer for my family & as gifts.

"I'm usually not a huge fan of Banana, but this cotton candy is seriously so delicious. I am extremely impressed with the quality and presentation of this product.  The flavor is pure and extremely tasty.  My household are huge cotton candy fans and of course hit up all of the carnivals and festivals and come home with a big bag of it. It is hard for me as a mother to give that carnival cotton candy to my daughter because I know it is packed full of processed ingredients and chemicals.  This cotton candy is made with organic ingredients that I can feel better about giving my daughter.  The containers are great for storing it also.  The container is a thicker plastic with a snap lid that closes tightly so you can store the candy in the cupboard without it getting hard or going stale quickly.  The company logo is right on the container and you can tell that this company really puts a lot of thought and effort into making a delicious quality product that is much better for you.

"My little girl is obsessed with cotton candy and watermelon, so what a great mix. This company puts a fun remix to traditional cotton candy that is awesome!  The flavors are full of flavor without all of those nasty unknown ingredients. It has a very pure taste to it and the watermelon flavor isn't too overbearing so you can seriously sit and snack on this until it's gone!  The packaging is really unique.  The container is a thicker plastic and the snap top stays air tight so your cotton candy can be kept for a bit without it going stale or getting hard.  From the labels to the taste you can tell this company really cares about creating a quality product that is unique and much better for you than all of that processed stuff.When my daughter tried this she probably would have ate the whole container if I let her. It's extremely fluffy and you can tell it is made with quality ingredients. This company has awesome flavors that you don't usually find in traditional cotton candy.  All of the ones I have tried so far are extremely delicious!  These would even make a great gift for that cotton candy/sweets lover in your life. I highly recommend this company and this product.

"I have always been a huge fan of cotton candy.  It is my highlight of the summer and I have passed that sugary trait on to my little girl.  Sometimes it is hard to let her have cotton candy because it is SO sugary, full of preservatives and who knows what they throw into it.This cotton candy is totally different. I have a bit of a piece of mind giving her this as a special treat with it's organic ingredients.  From the second you open the box you can tell this company puts hard work and heart into this product.  The tubs are a nice size and the containers are a nicer thicker plastic so can even be reused :).  The labels are bright and fun and makes this treat an awesome gift giving product.The coconut flavor of this particular one is awesome.  It has a rich flavorful flavor and does not have that over processed taste to it.  The cotton candy is really fluffy and packed in so you get quite a bit of product in the container.  This is by far one of my favorite flavors I have tried from this company.  It has a great flavor and leaves you wanting more. I will definitely be back for more as gifts(and of course for my daughter and my little sugar addiction).

"These socks are a great value for the high quality they are made with.  The material is very soft and there is quite a bit of stretch to them so they fit smaller or larger feet.

I like that this company has many prints to choose from for mens dress socks depending on what type of pant or color you are wearing.

I have never had any problems with bamboo material socks and find them to be quite a bit softer and flexible than regular dress socks that I have purchased my husband in the past.

"This company has the most comfortable socks with so many prints to choose from. The stock photos don't do these socks justice at all. They are extremely high quality and nice and thick. They are warm so they are the perfect fall/winter sock.  The colors are nice and deep with a lot of pigment in them.  The texture is nice and cozy and even after washing them are extremely soft.  They do not slide down and fit my feet comfortably.  I have given one pair to my mother in law who wears a size 9 and I kept the rest and wear a 7.  These fit both of us perfect. They have a bit of a stretch to them. I have washed these along with the rest of my regular socks and have not had any color bleeding or shrinkage at all.

The separated compartments makes them great for taking any sort of meal and keeping items separated without any mixing or dumping.

They hold quite a bit of food and I personally like using these as part of my meal planning and also if I take lunch for my daughter to my in laws or grandpa's house.  These are also great for snacks or if we are on the go and need lunch with us.  They are dishwasher safe and I have not had any warping or bending.

"This little dress is SO adorable.  The look of it is so flowy and pretty.  The sheer overlay has a bit of a rough edge to it, but does not affect the way it looks or the quality of the look.  The flower is extremely pretty and needs a bit of fluffing when taken out of the package but came out perfect and is a great accent to the colors in this dress. The aqua ribbon goes nicely up against the pink.  The neckline falls nicely and the empire waist fits my daughter perfectly.  The back has a thin zipper and you can barely see it when she has the dress on. The dress is light weight and would even make a cute flower girl dress.

"I have tried many cloth diapers and training pants and these are by far one of the very best I have ordered. The quality and effectiveness of this brand gives exactly what it promises with a lot of unique features. This diaper includes one bamboo charcoal insert which can be used two different ways. The inside has a snap, so you can simply lay the insert on the inside of the diapers and snap it in for easy removal, or you can stuff it in and it is inside the diaper so it does not move around. This is a great way to customize the diaper for you needs depending on the day or your child's needs. With the stuffing option you toss the whole diaper and cover into the wash, with the snap in option you can reuse the shell and not have to wash the whole diaper. This is a great option because you get extra uses out of the shell. I like this diaper because it can grow with your child so even if you have a tiny little one or a toddler getting ready to potty train this diaper is a great option. My daughter is two and starting to potty train. This is a great option for her because she is 25 lbs and we can easily switch out the insert if she has a little accident. This saves me on training pants and the diaper can be used for future children. I am very impressed with the quality and print also. The design is adorable and the colors are bright and fun.

"Perfect tablet for my daughter and I to play games on!  The way this is packaged makes it a great quality gift for sure.  The tablet itself with the branding on it makes it look fun right out of the package. When I took it out it was light weight and easy to hold.  I charged it to the full 100% before I actually started playing around on it. The sound quality is what you expect of a cheaper tablet, but I hooked my wireless speaker to it and they sound was nice and crisp.  The colors are nice and clear.  It is very simple to use with the android/google layout and includes the play store to download tons of free apps. I downloaded facebook and a few of my daughter's games to see how well it would work with multiple things going at once or having many things downloaded on it. I didn't have any problems with a few of her games, facebook, pandora and a few of my random apps I like to use on a regular basis. This is not the top of the line, but if you want it for surfing the web, playing app games and things such as facebook it is great(would be a great value for children or teens as a gift).

"These are the perfect affordable solution for meal prepping containers.  They are a bit larger than the cheap ones I was purchasing at the dollar store and the separated compartments make it easy to dish out exact portions that you need for the day/week and keep it all nice and neat.  You can pop the lid on and throw it in the refrigerator. My husband also likes to use these for left overs to take to work the next day. The fact that they are microwave safe is a huge bonus.  Saves time and money by not having to do extra dishes and they clean up easily also.  Easy to stack in the cupboard when not using. I am really impressed with the quality of these and they have definitely made it easy for me to portion my food out for the week and be able to grab and go without having to use random containers that kept me extremely unorganized when trying to prep.

"Absolutely ADORABLE! We have broke down and are giving my little one an American Girl doll for Christmas. I was on the hunt for furniture and clothing for her and they are so expensive! This little kitchen set is not only the perfect size, but totally adorable and unique compared to some of the styles I have found before.This comes in a box with instructions and all of the parts separate. The instructions are extremely easy to read and every part is labeled with a letter including the screws and attachments. I timed myself putting it together(this is usually my husband's job) to see how long it would take me to put together and it took me less than 20 minutes to put it all together by myself. Very simple instructions with simple photos. This is all wood except for the clear window on the front of the oven door. I did not screw the knobs or sink in all of the way so my daughter will be able to turn them a bit for imaginary play. The colors are bright and the chrome look of the sink and knobs have a bit of a metallic look to them. The oven snaps shut but is not too hard to open. I love that this is an all in one kitchen so it is also a space saver in my daughter's room and doll house. The clear window makes it easy for your child to see what they are ""cooking"" also. The wood used in this is great quality, thicker and sturdy. I am very impressed with this product and the value of their products are amazing.

"This pillow cover is seriously awesome.  The design is extremely trendy and artistic  Definitely a statement piece.  The material is a really nice burlap that is made with quality and does not feel cheap.  The case is large so it is easy to fit a throw pillow right inside. The closure is a zipper that move easily and when zipped shut you cannot see the zipper.  The back side is burlap colored and plain. The black in this cover is very pigmented and has a sheen to the material so it is not completely matte.

"Nobody knows the wrath of a baby/toddler until they know the mystery of the missing binky! These little pacifier clips are a must have for parents.  This particular one is awesome because it doubles as a pacifier clip and a teeth. The clip fastens tight on your child's top or blanket etc. but does not have the metal spring loaded jaw so you don't have to worry about scrapes or some how your little one getting their fingers pinches.  The silicon balls are a great texture for those stubborn teeth coming through your little one's gums and having them right there with their pacifier makes it extremely handy. I love that these are safe for your child to chew and you have your pacifier and teeth all right together. These are great quality and a lot different than the regular ribbon pacifier clips I have used in the past. Great quality product from a nice quality company who cares about their customers. I would recommend these as baby shower gifts or personal use with your own children.

"This little bit is really nice. Cloth bibs are such a pain and you can only use them once before they are messed and you have to throw them into the laundry.  This silicone bib is extremely easy to put on your baby quickly with the snap in neck strap.  The silicone is easy to wipe down quickly also, and I have washed it in the dishwasher multiple times and it comes out perfect every time on the top rack.  The cup at the bottom is perfect for messy little ones. It catches all liquid and food that comes out of their mouth or that they drop when self feeding without getting their clothes messy.  You simply dump it out when they are done and you are good to go with a clean baby. I have a 2 year old and she wears this when eating messy food such at spaghetti.

"I really like this catnip spray.  We always get catnip for my cat and it is a huge mess. He usually eats most of it but often even if he put it on a toy he has it all over the floor and carpet.  This spray is a great solution to that. You simply spray it right on the toy/scratching post and are done with it. There is no mess and it dries quickly. I do feel that is is not as strong as the packages, but it also doesn't completely drive my cat up the walls, which was one reason we did not give it to him often when purchasing the packages. He got aggressive when he had the packages. When we sprayed this on his toys he played and obviously felt good, but did not get aggressive at all.

"My husband really liked these polarized sunglasses. He is a delivery driver who works any weather. Glare, sunlight and even night time headlights are a pain.  These sunglasses are great quality and really help with all of these problems when he is driving his truck.  The ability to switch out lenses is a great benefit.  The lenses are not too hard to switch out and the set comes with a nice cushioned case so he can take the case right along with him and use whatever lenses depending on the weather etc. The arms and style of the front are really sporty and comparable to expensive brands he has purchased in the past without that pricey tag.

The lenses were a bit difficult to remove and change, but once he got the hang of it it was a breeze.  The nose piece if nice and comfortable and the frames hug his face and head comfortable and stay put all day long.

"This is the only acne serum that has worked for me. I used to got to the dermatologist and within the last year my insurance has stopped covering it.  I have been on the hunt for something that actually works. I use a glycolic acne wash and then apply a small amount of this serum all over my face twice a day, once in the morning before applying my makeup and once before I go to bed. Literally within four days my acne and oil production has significantly reduced.  I am not getting as much congestion in my pores and the white heads that were showing up are slowing going away and not coming back!

"This is THE best acne facewash I have used. I have paired this with a 2% sacylic acid serum, and I have literally cleaned my face up atleast 70% in less than a week.  I wear makeup daily. I have adult acne, cystic and black/white heads.  My skin has went crazy since having my little girl two years ago and of course I get breakouts, cover them up with makeup, which in return caused more clogged pores. I have never found anything that helps with the congestion in my skin while also clearing up my breakouts. This does not give me any irritation and does not dry my skin out. It gives me a nice very clean feeling and reduces my oil and oil production significantly.  I use a wet washcloth to take most of my makeup off and then use this cleanser to finish removing the rest.  It is clear and has a bit of a menthol type smell to it.  My skin feels extremely clean after using it and I am amazed at how fast this has helped clear my skin.  I plan to purchase another bottle to help with body acne. I have reviewed and purchased many acne cleansers on here hoping to find one that works for a long period of time or gives quick results and so far this is the best I have tried and plan to stick with this brand.

"I am a hairstylist by trade and always love trying out new products and tools. Often when I try something that is not available in my professional store it ends up being crap compared to my expensive tools.  This iron is totally different. I am extremely impressed with not only the quality and feel of this iron but also the ability of it to quickly curl or straighten. The temp control is easy to set which is a bonus for any type of hair texture.  I personally have thin, fine hair with a bit of wave.  The iron heats up quickly and the plates have heat throughout there with no hot spots.  The iron is easy to handle and the cord is long for easy maneuvering.  The plates are a bit rounded on the edges so I can curl/wave my hair really quickly with this. It goes through your hair smooth without any catching.

"This pillow is extremely comfortable. My husband needed something that could support his neck and head but was still comfortable to sleep on. I have found that many memory foam pillows are so stiff and one large piece so they do not form around your neck and head like they say they will. The inside of this pillow is shredded so the pillow literally forms around your head and neck and gives you a soft cushion to sleep on rather than a stiff large piece that is not comfortable.  The pillow comes vacuum sealed. When I opened it I fluffed it up a bit with my hands and let it sit for a few hours. It had not fluffed up as much as I thought it should so I threw it in the dryer for about half an hour.  It came out nice and fluffed and the factory smell was gone from it.

"I am a cosmetologist and love playing around with makeup on my own before I use it on clients. This is the first gel/cream liner I have found that stays put! I have purchased many brands from low end to high end brands and seem to always get smudges or the consistency is hard and does not apply easily.  This is not only all natural it is so easy to apply. The consistency is nice and soft/smooth.  I used an angled shadow/liner brush and it was very easy to pick up exactly the amount of product I wanted on my brush without bending the bristles but also I did not have a big chunk on my brush, it was nice and smooth.  The pot is a regular size pot but it does not take a lot of product to get the perfect line or smokey eye.  I put this on in the morning, wore it throughout the day and even took a short nap with my toddler and it was still perfect at the end of the day with no smudges.  I also tested it to smudge it as a smokey eye with my shadow and it was easy to smudge but after it was able to set up for a while I didn't have to worry about looking like a raccoon.

"We were searching for a quality microphone that would last, but was not extremely expensive or difficult to use. This microphone is pretty light weight.  The design looks attractive and the packaging makes it as a nice gift.  The ability to use it cordless or corded is a great bonus depending on your uses for it. It is very easy to hook up.  If you are using the cord it simply hooks into the microphone and the device you are hooking it to.  The wireless ability can be used with the antennae or without(we tested it without for our little girl).  The mic has an on and off type switch for when not in use without completely turning it off(just turns off the mic putting out noise).  This is not the best sound, but it is a great mic for us to use as a family for a variety of uses from making videos, singing karaoke and my brother has used this with a friend when recording a song online.

"This costume is super comfortable. I believe it fits as expected and the material is extremely stretchy so it hugs all of your curves and can fit smaller or larger if needed.  The ruffles and tassle detail make this super girls also. The bust is ruched so it wraps around your upper part and the arms cap right on your shoulders. It is a bit off shoulder so it is good to keep that in mind, but gives a sexy look with that accent.  The flare of the skirt gives your waist a smaller appearance along with the tied look in the front(which is decorative).  Over all this is a very sexy and pretty Germany Beer Girl costume that is definitely different from others I have seen.  Throw a mug in with this costume and you are ready for your Halloween party!

"This sexy cop halloween costume is made really well!  I am a size 11/12 and ordered a large and it fits great. The quality of the material used is nice and thick and sewn tight. The quality of the material used is much better than the cheaper ""sexy"" costumes in the halloween stores.  The patches and the buttons are nice and thick and sewn on tight also.  The shape of this fits nicely and the pleated skirt gives it a flirty look at the bottom.  The outfit stays put when on and does not ride up like some of the cheaper stretchy costumes in shops now.  The cute tie is easy to put on and adds even more uniqueness to this costume.  The hat is nice and sturdy and keeps it's shape because it is reinforced and hard.  You may need to use bobby pins to keep it on your hair depending on the shape of your head.  Over all this is an awesome sexy costume that fits as expected for a size large, is really nicely made with quality and durability in mind and includes quality made accessories.

"My husband was pretty excited to add these to his in home bar downstairs. These are super easy to use.  The size makes them great for many sizes and shapes of glasses depending on what you are serving.  What I like about these is that you don't have to have ice. They quickly chill your drink and keep it cold without watering down what you are drinking. I have used these even with pop straight out of the warm can! They cool quickly and are also easy to clean and store. They come neatly placed in a nice gift box so would make a great holiday gift for that drink enthusiast who is always looking for something unique to add to their bar.

"This light is a lot different than most of the flash lights my husband has. The side band of lights makes it easy to light up a larger area, which makes it stand out from other flashlights of it's type.  It is really bright with the LED lights and can be used for so many things indoor and outdoors.  My husband likes to take this to work with him, but also likes to use this for small jobs like working on the furnace or under the sinks at home. The flashlight is light weight and smaller so it is nice to just throw in the car and doesn't take up a lot of space.  This light is extremely versatile and is a must have for anyone who travels on the road or needs a nice good quality flashlight that can be used as a flashlight or spotlight.

"I love this little speaker. I like to use this in my daughter's room with her ipad when we are playing or on her pandora stations. IT is super simple to use and expands for louder sound/base. It charges up quickly and we have been using it quite a bit for two weeks and it has no ran down yet(I'd say atleast 9 or so hours of use so far). It charges easily with a usb plug in either in the wall or into your computer depending if you have an adapter for the wall or not. The other part of the cord hooks into your device's headphones port. This speakers packs a pretty good sound and is small so it is easy to take on the go and not take up a lot of space.

"This is one of the best water bottles I  have tried. The bottle is extremely heavy duty. It is very well made and washed easily in the dish washer.  The top screws off or can flip open.  What I love about this bottle is not only does it keep drinks cold for a very long time, but the insert allows you to drink your water/beverage and not get any type of pulp or tea leaves if you have that in your drink. I have a lot of infuser bottles and I can throw in lemons etc and have flavored water without all the extra steps. I just drop it in, drop the insert in and screw on the lid. I have tried this with tea and have had really great results also. I have used this with ice water and also hot tea.

"This magnetic makeup caddy is a great organizer for me to take on the go and for every day.  This palette has a removable insert so you can customize it any way you want.  The insert areas are of different sizes so it is nice for different sizes of shadows along with powder or bronzer pans. They fit right in and the magnetic area holds the pans in nicely without slipping. If you have pans that do not fit in the already sizes spots you can remove the insert and stick them on the bare palette and they stick just as nicely, just not quite as organized. The large mirror makes it easy to do your makeup with ease.

"These pillows are seriously the squishiest pillows I have ever owned. I hate firm pillows and sleep on with very soft or medium soft pillows the best.  These two pillows are so soft and form right to your head.  They are much more comfortable than down pillows and I feel like they stay in their shape better than down.  The cotton cover is great for sleeping, I personally prefer a cover over them.  They are a nice standard size also.  When I received these pillows they were vacuum sealed tight and flat. I threw them in the dryer for about twenty minutes and they came out perfect. I am sleeping like a baby on these and have to fight over them with my little one so a set of two is perfect!

"I love the ideas of these sprinkle vitamins. My little girl is pretty picky about any type of vitamin I give her. Even when I give her gummy vitamins or half of a flintstone vitamin she does not seem to like the taste.  My daughter is a really picky eater so going without vitamins just is not giving her the nutrients she needs with her picky taste.  These sprinkle vitamins are literally undetectable. Last night for dinner I put the recommended amount on her macaroni and cheese and stirred it up. She had absolutely no idea I had put them in her dinner and she got her nutrients she needed!  This is a fabulous idea for those picky eaters or just for children who do not enjoy taking a regular vitamin. I love that there are probiotics and added iron also since some children's vitamins do not include this.  The amount you get is a great value for the price also.

"I have never used something other than lotions for chest wrinkles. I am in my early thirties and after having my daughter my skin texture and elasticity has changed a bit. I am a side sleeper and noticed within the last year or so that I wake up with wrinkles in my cleavage from being in one place all night on my side. I have a larger chest and I definitely can see this going south quickly. I decided to try these to help correct the little bit I have starting and to prevent further and deeper wrinkles starting.  These pads are easy to apply. They are large so they cover the whole center section on your chest and between the upper part of your breasts.  The set includes two large pads and they are packaged seperately.  The pads stick to your skin and stay put. They create a smooth platform so your skin does not crease together when sleeping.  When I woke up after using one of these over night I did not have the same creases that I usually have when I wake up. Even though the creases are not permanent right now, I know eventually they will stay and this is a great way for me to prevent them.  These are easy to clean and they can be used over and over again. Much more economical way to treat this type of skin annoyance than most creams and such.

"If there's one thing you can be sure of living the Apple life, it's that you can never have enough Lightning cables lying around. Third party cables are often wonky (frikkin' active circuitry just sitting there, JUDGING YOU), and even the properly certified ones can be rather fragile. (I can't be the only one who's had more than one duct-taped cable kept around long after it's been thrown out.)I'm not sure if this is necessarily a deal, although it's certainly cheaper than you'd find in a retail store, and Monoprice is a pretty well-respected brand, so you could safely buy this sight-unseen if you dared. The plug seems pretty jiggle-proof (a problem with many cables) and the 10-foot cable should be long enough to plug in your phone in the front seat and use it sitting in the back. Basically, this is a cable that does exactly what you want it to do. The one star deduction: after all this time, haven't cable builders figured out that the strain relief on virtually every Lightning cable on the market is absolute crap? This is slightly better than some, but I'd still expect it to start fraying sooner than later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXF8WYY7VK1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XP1MTO#wasThisHelpful","R2RXF8WYY7VK1I","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simon Monk is a pretty well-respected author in the maker space, so it's fair to say this will be a decent enough book right from the outset. All things considered, this book delivers exactly what it promises -- how to learn Python on a Raspberry Pi. If you need an inexpensive textbook for a school computer class or are a rank beginner, this is a fine book to start with.I am a little torn, though. It's certainly possible to be too ambitious when it comes to a textbook, especially on an elementary/beginner level, but if you already know Python and want to get straight to the hardware hacking, this probably isn't the book to start with, especially if you're jumping right into maker stuff in the spirit of MIT's 6.01 EECS intro course, and it doesn't cover the use of the RPi as a media system at all, which seems like a strange oversight given that's one of the most popular use cases. On the other hand, if you just plan on using your RPi as a desktop system, this book gives short shrift to Scratch and no coverage at all to Mathematica; whether those are a concern to you may depend on your age group (Scratch of course skews young, while Mathematica is more of a college student thing).I'd say if you're fine with a fairly narrow, Python-based introduction to the platform and aren't overly concerned about projects outside basic game programming or the maker space, this will do the job just fine. However, if you need a more general Pi book, look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39Z2A1B27VYGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1259587401#wasThisHelpful","R39Z2A1B27VYGR","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What do you need to know, and is it worth the effort to do it? This book attempts to answer.If you understand electronics at least at a ""Forrest Mims Engineer's Notebook"" level, that's about where this book is coming from, albeit repair-oriented rather than project-oriented. It's a slimmer volume than you'd expect; if you were hoping for a Chilton guide to everything electronic, this isn't it. Which is fine; you're better off trying to search the Internet for any given service manual. What this book teaches is, essentially, how to read that service manual and what you need in terms of mise-en-place and basic electronics expertise to make use of it -- what you need for your workbench, how to solder, even doing what I used to do to old transistor radios as a kid (let's call it an autopsy) to get familiar with the parts you might run into. It also goes through many common household electronics, gives a quick summary of their internals, and whether it's worth the effort to try to fix them -- in other words, what you need to know to triage your brave little toasters. (Okay, not actually toasters, but there are other books for that.)This does not suffice as a complete reference for electronics repair, but like I said above, it doesn't really need to. It's enough to get you started and on your way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YS7CJQ6RUQWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071848290#wasThisHelpful","R1YS7CJQ6RUQWI","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was a kid, model aviation was a very limited sort of thing -- most people just had paper planes and the odd balsa-and-rubber-band or styrofoam glider model; more realistic aircraft were the province of rich kids with nerdy dads. If you wanted something useful (ie something that takes pictures), you had to either have an Estes Astrocam rocket or an expensive RC plane with a jury-rigged camera... and no one I knew had either one. Things have certainly changed, haven't they?For better or for worse, Afghanistan did for UAVs what Mars Pathfinder did for hobby robotics, and while this book is maybe a year or two overdue, it's very welcome. The main focus of the book is on safe and legal flying and applications for your typical quadcopter drone; you are assumed to have already bought or constructed the aircraft you're going to be using; you'll get information on how to buy a drone and get up and running, but if you want information on how to design and construct a craft, that's going to be in a completely different book. There's a lot of information on law, support and communities (to be fair, this book is likely to be obsolete in a few years, so if you're reading this in 2020, don't try to save money and get the first edition, especially since laws are likely to have changed). There's even a section on proper battery handling, because let's be honest, NiMH is too heavy, NiCad is obsolete, and lithium-ion batteries have been cantankerous little bastards at the best of times, so pay attention to that part.There is a heavy focus on aerial photography, including some material on attaching a DSLR to your drone (assuming of course you're filthy rich and have nothing better to do with your money). It does discuss other matters, but not in great detail since drone cargo handling is an area that's still in legal flux. Overall, although it doesn't cover the design aspects as well as it could, it's definitely a must-read for a newbie drone operator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QEMFNA41QPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119049784#wasThisHelpful","R13QEMFNA41QPJ","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This *almost* seemed like a good idea. But I think I'll stick with my Wusthof and Accusharp.I don't know who thought this was a good idea or how it clearly made it out the door with insufficient user testing, but this thing is downright dangerous. The sliding action on the sleeve is very stiff and the knife occasionally gets hung up on the sharpener itself. It's possible it might work better with other styles of knife like a slicer or utility knife, but this particular combination of sleeve and knife is outright dangerous.Two stars because the knife itself is okay. It's a fairly thick stamped-blade knife with your basic plastic handle, more or less the same as you'd find in any supermarket for about thirty bucks. But really, don't buy this. Just don't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RPKORP6R67UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01004QUTK#wasThisHelpful","R1RPKORP6R67UL","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this printer for two reasons: 1) it was on sale, and 2) it was Consumer Reports' best buy all-in-one for 2014. I haven't been disappointed by this yet.Considering it isn't really optimized for photo printing, print quality in general is excellent. All functions that I've tried work well, although the HP Connected apps (which you likely won't much care about) seem to work differently from the way they used to. Although still insanely pricey like most inkjet cartridges, the ones the 86xx series take are quite a bit larger than the ones HP's more consumer-oriented printers use, so they're a relative bargain. The web interface is pretty comprehensive and includes some interesting features, most notably the ability to lock ink carts to the printer so they'll be useless if stolen. The only downside I've seen is that the standard event logging interface leaves a lot to be desired. Scanning and copying work nicely, and print-by-email works as smoothly as ever. One oddity: if you're printing pictures off an SD card, you'll need a USB card reader; there's only the one USB-A port on the front, with no card slots. (If you're still using TWAIN for scanner acquisition, I actually have no idea if it supports a TWAIN driver; even if you don't have the HP utility software on your system, the scan-by-web interface makes it somewhat unnecessary.)All that said, this thing's a monster. This is not necessarily a problem in an office setting, as most offices will have an appropriate place to put it, but if you're a home user who (like us) keeps it in a common area like the kitchen so everyone can get to it, you're going to have to look around for some open space. Also, even allowing for the fact that this model is frequently on sale from places that sell HP printers, this might be a particularly bad choice for a dorm room, as it will literally take up half of the average dorm desk. (Of course, most college students are using laptops these days, so that may not actually be a problem.) It's probably not the greatest printer you'll ever use, and it's not even the best inkjet HP has for sale, but as far as bang for the buck goes, you'll do fine with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYFTR3WXCTIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9E68B8#wasThisHelpful","RWYFTR3WXCTIT","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the speaker playing right now as I type this. It's surprisingly loud for its size, with respectable enough bass; it won't compete with a dedicated subwoofer, but it's not bad. Sound quality is acceptable unless you're picky about it; it is a little lacking in treble, but not so bad it'll annoy your ears.I'm not real crazy about some of the design aspects though. For one thing, it looks like it's supposed to drop into a car cupholder, which seems like one of those ideas that seemed good at the time but turns out not so good. Also, it lacks an obvious battery gauge, which is somewhat of a problem if you are indeed using it in the car. It does have an aux-in port so you can use it without Bluetooth, which is nice. You can't use it as a wireless external mic input; I feel like it wouldn't have been a significant expense to add that, but I don't design these things, so what do I know. It's no Ion Block Rocker, but it'll do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17531L8X2GTFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XF80G8A#wasThisHelpful","R17531L8X2GTFC","AWNBZSEZ9P8BE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNBZSEZ9P8BE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for our camper. It fit in one of the sink sides a little snuggly but fine. I agree with other reviewers that said the silverware dividing flap is very cheesy and does not stay put.

I personally think this is ingenious. I got it to hang PT in our camper, where space is a precious commodity and this thing did not disappoint. If I had to suggest anything it would be to make the arm able to change direction and not have the mounting bracket mounted upside down...or so it can be flush whichever way the arm faces.

"These look nice and I love the small space they require. They also do seem well made, but that's about the best I can say because they don't work very well and I wish I could return them. They are not easy to use one handed. I don't think I have small hands by any means and every friend who has tried them, as well as my husband, also has trouble. It takes too much pressure to press the plunger down with your thumb and we wind up holding it with one hand and pushing the plunger with the palm of our other hand. It's a good 1 3/4"" from the top of the plunger to the top of the barrel. In addition to that, you don't get very good output and there is no adjustment for the grind. The little tray it came with is nice, but it does fill with spilled S & P since the opening is on the bottom. Also, because these are so small, you wind up filling them ALL the time! They only hold about a tablespoon of S or P. Overall, I regret this purchase and wish I had sent them back while I still could instead of ""giving them a fair trial"".

She is a petite almost 9 year old who wears a 7/8 and I bought her the size 8. I was thrilled when they came and I discovered they are i-grow! We can lengthen the cuffs and the straps by several inches! Plus they were already long on her so I folded the straps over at least an inch already and tacked them in place. These will last her several years...thus making the cost more than reasonable! I do not regret this purchase! She also says they are very warm! She plays outside for hours in the cold and we've had the coldest sub-zero temps in over 180 years this winter...yet she went sledding, snowmobiling, built forts, and played for hours on end without getting cold or wet. As an added bonus they matched her LL Bean coat perfectly..though that was not planned! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19V92TECIJML8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE8FCF2#wasThisHelpful","R19V92TECIJML8","A2JXZD91WCJV7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXZD91WCJV7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really great case! It fits really well and doesn't cover any holes or make the buttons hard to use. This is a very neon pink color which I love and is transparent. The edges are smooth but not slippery and the back has almost a slightly sanded feel...not smooth but I wouldn't say rough either. I think I would probably prefer the back to be the same as the sides as the sides feel a bit grippier than the back but I like regardless. The material is very much like the old jelly shoes...so it's flexible and easy to put on and not all that hard to get off. I like that it covers the entire edges. My favorite part...and the reason I wanted this kind of case, is that unlike all the bulkier cases I tried this is NOT slippery!! At the same time it's not sticky or hard to slide into my pocket or purse either!

"I was on the hunt for an adjustable ring to wear on my thumb that was injured several years ago. As a result of the injury the knuckle is large and the base of the thumb is skinny and it has always remained sensitive since.

"This may provide extreme protection, but installing it is also a bit extreme, since you have to unscrew 15 screws with an Allen wrench, and in my package, it was not provided.  Fortunately, I had the correct size, and was able to unscrew all 15, pull the case apart, cringing the whole way since it sounded like it was tearing, installed the iPad, and screwed all 15 screws back in.The ports are all defended by plastic/rubber pieces that pull out, except the volume control, which is really difficult to use, especially for a child, if that is your intended use.  The charge port is finicky, and will not accept all charge cords.  We have a few of the AmazonBasics usb to lightning cords, which are, in my opinion, better than the Apple cords, but will not fit.So, I had fun removing the iPad from the case again, and 15 screws after beginning that project, I discovered it is quite a challenge to get it open with the iPad inside.In the end, I discovered no iPad Air owner in my household wants to use it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVDFCJWN42VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSJATA8#wasThisHelpful","R2DVDFCJWN42VN","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where I come from, most people erroneously take it at face value that in order for there to be any belief in the resurrection of Jesus, said resurrection must have taken place. After many years of studying the Bible and much biblical scholarship, it is difficult to see much difference in the stories of the Bible and stories of other cultures. Many people I know cannot imagine that anything in the Bible could have been made up, thinking it is too complex for someone to do. If I ask enough questions, it becomes obvious those people are not familiar with other stories people have told from ancient cultures. Yes, there are differences between stories originating in the Middle East and those originating from other locales such as Greece, Rome, Scandinavia, Britain, China, India, etc. One would expect the stories to be different, because the cultures are different. I also tend to find that those people usually have not read their entire Bible, whereas I have read it many times over.I am not one of those that think the Jesus spoken of in the Bible is purely a myth. There are complex reasons to think the stories are based on a real person. However, I do not think there is any need to doubt the existence of Jesus, in order to realize one may doubt almost everything attributed to him in the Bible. There are very good and complex reasons for doubting most actions and words of Jesus portrayed in the New Testament. Plus, there are very good reasons for doubting that there are any scriptures in the Old Testament that predict anything about Jesus.There is a quote from Bulfinch's Mythology I would like to share here. ""This is one of those mythological tales, says a late writer, in which there is reason to believe that a substratum of truth exists though overlaid by a mass of fiction."" That quote is referring specifically to Jason and the Argonauts, but one which can easily be applied to almost all incredible tales. If one has read the Bible, one can recognize the incredible nature of the tales. If one is familiar with lower and higher biblical criticism, it becomes apparent that what is claimed simply cannot be true, because there are far too many inconsistencies. Inconsistency with itself, with science, with history, with archaeology, and so much else, tends to make questions of whether something happened not worth pursuing to most, since it is obvious most of it is simply made up.I usually do not read books of this nature, where someone examines whether some event in the Bible actually happened. Because of everything else, I would stand with Thomas Jefferson, and pretty much cut out anything miraculous if I wanted to formulate an approximation of the truth. Or I would stand with David Hume (An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, 1748), and say ""In our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence."" When Hume gets to the end of a lengthy passage discussing miracles, he states ""The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention), `that no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.' When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.""This is why the approach taken by the author of this book, Kris Komarnitsky, is effective. What he suggests may have happened at Jesus's alleged resurrection is far more likely than what is suggested by the Bible. Cognitive dissonance reduction as a mechanism of the beginnings of a religious belief is extremely likely. The examples he gives of other messianic cults that have developed show that this happens. Even if I think it may not be necessary to resort to the possibility that someone or several persons experienced hallucinations, it is evident that this is much more likely than resurrection, because hallucinations in grief, as well as in other scenarios, are known scientifically to occur. All other scenarios described by Komarnitsky besides these are also known to be possible, and that is the entire point. Perhaps there was just one early follower that was a sincerely mistaken, deceived, or even lying individual, or perhaps there was the harmless accretion of legend that can occur over the decades between Jesus's death and Paul, or even Jesus's death and the gospel of Mark. Much can happen in 20-40 years, especially in a primitive environment.Obviously, we cannot know exactly what happened that led to this story of the resurrection of Jesus, or any other resurrection described in the Bible. The strength of this book is to show the reader that one has options to consider other than blind faith, and though the scenarios described may not be what happened, they are at least possible and even probable considering what we can know, and therefore far superior to anything the apologists can throw at the author in criticism.I would be satisfied with these conclusions by reading David Hume or by reading perhaps the resurrection debate ""Is There Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus? A Debate between William Lane Craig and Bart D. Ehrman"" held at College of the Holy Cross on March 28, 2006. This is one of the references used by Komarnitsky, and happened to be a debate I read back in 2006. It is about 40 pages long, and was, I think, devastating to Craig, and I was a (doubting) Christian when I read it. I am sure most Christians thought Craig won, as is usual for debates, since most people never reevaluate their own thoughts. Ehrman's arguments simply made more sense, and Craig's arguments were filled with special pleading. I was embarrassed to be a Christian in that moment, and reading that debate was one of the many things that ended my blind faith.This book will be one of those things, like that debate, that will help some find their way from faith to reason, from darkness to light.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JFYO0P5FG15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982552890#wasThisHelpful","R17JFYO0P5FG15","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Minimalistic can be great, and I generally prefer that approach, which is why I decided to take one of these for free to review.It is a quality piece of plastic, and the cutouts for all the switches, buttons, and access points are precise, so Belkin has done a good job, as they always do.  It provides a snug fit for the back of the iPad Air, and will ease your mind about setting the iPad down wherever you are.However, there is hardly any discernible lip that would provide much protection for the face of the iPad, and that is not intended.  So, if you want something to provide like protection for the screen, you will have to purchase something in addition to this, like the Smart Cover from Apple or a knockoff, which would put you in the price range of the Smart Case.  If you want to use this in conjunction with a cover you already have after regretting not having coverage for the back, this would be a great option.Since this costs about thirty dollars currently, I would say that one might as well buy a Smart Case from Apple (or a knockoff) that has the back and front covers all in one.  It provides better protection, while not quite going overboard and getting something like an Otterbox.Plus this item has one negative that really irritates me.  Fingerprints show up on this plastic immediately, and do not remove easily.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSXOUS6FRGLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENY08VU#wasThisHelpful","R1XSXOUS6FRGLM","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't misunderstand.  This is an excellent case for what it is designed for, which is protecting the iPhone from falls, bumps, tosses, and perhaps the occasional hammer.  However, if one does not have a tendency to have these mishaps, it just seems like overkill.It makes the phone about twice as thick, an inch longer, and more than twice as heavy.  (Estimates)The built in screen protector works smoothly, but is ultimately unattractive because of the oily rainbow appearance it adds to the iPhone screen.Slipping this thing in and out of a pocket can be a real pain, which explains why they feel it mandatory to include a holster.The rubber plugs that block every single port are just in the way.  I'm not sure why these are necessary, because from other people I've known with Defender cases, and from these other reviews, this case isn't blocking any dust.In summary, this is wonderful protection for the accident prone or sadistic (or masochistic), but after using it for a while, and noticing any pleasure of using the iPhone get sucked away by the bulk and interfering rubber plugs, I can tell this is not for me, at least.Getting one for free to review has been a good thing, though.  I have had my iPhone 5 for over a year, and even though I am careful, there are a few tiny scratches and nicks in places, and in hindsight, it may be better to have at least enough of a case so that one does not have to worry about where one sets the phone down, and enough of a lip over the front edge to prevent accidentally nicking the screen.  Screen protectors are really not necessary in that scenario, and I haven't used them with any iPhones.So, Otterbox has convinced me to purchase an Apple iPhone 5/5S case, for just enough protection, but maximum elegance.  I think I'll go with RED for my iPhone and iPad Air.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9VPFE2HD97Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3SIW18#wasThisHelpful","R3O9VPFE2HD97Q","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wallet case would be nice, if it were not so thick.The commuter case is thicker than the Defender case (without the Defender's holster), though the outside is more slick, allowing for easier insertion and removal from a pocket, assuming one can fit it in one's pocket.There is no built in screen protector, but one that must be installed.  Once installed, I did not like the appearance of the screen protector, because it has that oily rainbow appearance that happens with some, thus ruining the appearance of my iPhone screen.  So, I removed the screen protector and trashed it.The plastic sides that hold the softer layer in, which in turn holds the phone, does not mesh well with the soft layer, leaving the appearance that it is not completely in place.  I kept trying to make it mesh or snap in place fully, but perhaps mine is defective.If one absolutely has to have a phone case with the wallet feature, this may be one of the better options, because it has Otterbox protection for your phone, which is worth something significant to the clumsy among us.  If that is an unnecessary feature, but one desires the protection, I think the Defender is a much better option.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TBD4LAHIQMXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESYO60O#wasThisHelpful","R2TBD4LAHIQMXO","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved this series from the beginning, and Sam Eastland (Paul Watkins) has created one of my favorite characters in Pekkala.  However, the fifth book in the series is a dud, and I will explain this in the second half, after explaining a bit about the series, main protagonist, and order of the books.  The reader of the review will have to click on the ""Read more"" link to get the full review.Inspector Pekkala is a Finn in Russia, former top investigator for the Tsar, and top investigator for Stalin as of books 1-4 of this series. For me, at least, he is one of the more interesting characters I have enjoyed reading about for the last decade. There is a certain darkness about him, but that is not to mean he lacks a sense of justice. There are lots of personal demons he has to contend with, such as those caused by nine years in a Siberian prison camp marking trees, a job that killed others within six months.It is important to read the books in order, but one has to be careful about what they are buying, because the UK and US versions for the second and third books have different names. There are US versions for the first three books by Random House/Bantam, but it does not appear they are continuing US versions, since both books four and five are by Faber & Faber, the UK publishing house. It is no big deal if a US citizen is willing to read the UK version. One will see things like ""boot"" for the trunk of a car, ""torch"" for flashlight, ""kerb"" for curb, ""tyres"" for tires, and so on.  (A note on the author's site states there will be a US version of book five in May 2014, but no such note exists for book four.)I happened to purchase the Kindle version of book five before it was apparently pulled from Amazon's US market, and when I checked, even the Kindle version of book four has been taken down.  There are supposed to be six books in the series, and now, I wonder if the sixth book will even be available in the US on Kindle.Following is the proper order of the books:I. Eye of the Red Tsar (UK/US)II. The Red Coffin (UK) / Shadow Pass (US)III. Siberian Red (UK) / Archive 17 (US)IV. The Red Moth (UK)V. The Beast in the Red Forest (UK)VI. ?___________________________________This series, in my opinion, is better written and more engaging than most Russian oriented literature, such as the Arkady series (Gorky Park, etc).  However, this last book, The Beast in the Red Forest, is a disappointment, at least to me.The main reason I read the series is because of Inspector Pekkala.  He is the main character, the protagonist, the one I tend to identify with as I read these stories.  In book five, he didn't show up until 30% of the book was gone.  Until then, the protagonist was Kirov, his assistant.  Kirov is good comedy relief, but he is no protagonist, and in fact, becomes more disappointing when he is put in that position, since it becomes even more obvious how dull he really is.The rest of the book tends to focus on military politics between the Red Army and the partisans, which were groups that fought in WWII without actually being in the Red Army.  Nice history lesson, but there was little of Pekkala in this book, and the other characters are paper thin and not compelling.  Yes, there was a storyline that was specific to Pekkala, but it was so minor, and seems to have done little to add progress to the story.  Plus, it is a bit of a ripoff from the story of the first book (someone from the past plotting revenge against Pekkala), and has an ambiguous resolution.At the end of book four, it appeared Pekkala may have disappeared to search for his lost love, Ilya, that he was separated from at the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.  In this book, it appeared that may have been his intention, but something changes his mind, and after two years of being gone, and embroiled with the partisans, he returns to Moscow, giving her up yet again.Maybe it is not Pekkala's destiny to have that reunion, and I am wrong to think that may be the author's ultimate intention.  Frankly, after almost 30 years, it may seem ludicrous.  However, because of the way the story has been told in previous books, and the way Stalin handled that issue with Pekkala, it seems the best way to steer the series is to have Pekkala reunited with Ilya.  Maybe there was not enough to write, and so book five shows Pekkala in a sort of limbo, waiting for resolution, while the author fulfills a six book contract.Whatever disappointment I may feel in book five, the series as a whole is excellent, and I have far too much invested in it to stop now, especially when the final book is the next one.  For now, I still recommend reading the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6JXAO4X5KBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWY9VXG#wasThisHelpful","R3U6JXAO4X5KBE","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Montaigne's Essays are one of the more enjoyable massive tomes of renaissance writing available, and if reading in English, one has two major modern choices of translation, Screech and Frame.To start with Translation:  Both major translations are excellent in their own way, but some differences are of note.  When a translation is done, usually the translator will translate the major language of the text, French in this case, and leave quotes by the author from other languages, mostly Latin in this case, untranslated.  The translator will provide a note with the translation of the quote, and preferably the source of the quote.This is where Screech and Frame differ considerably.  Screech does what should be done, and Frame just translates everything into English with no significant notations other than the person quoted.  This means, however, that one may prefer one translation over the other based on this alone.  For example, one that wishes to take a more scholarly look will likely use Screech (or the original), and one that simply wants to read for pleasure may have no problem using the translation by Frame.  Also, Screech is British and Frame is American, so one may have other preferences for style.As for the Physical Copy:The physical copies of Frame's translation (Stanford and Everyman's) are vastly superior to the Penguin Classics Screech version.  The Penguin paperback is thick, but in keeping with the generally small form factor, the print is terribly small, and the paper is of a horrible quality, which is the reason I also purchased the Kindle version.As for the Kindle version:The Penguin Classics Kindle file is much more pleasant to read and deal with than the paperback alternative.  However, there are many errors in the Kindle version that are not present in the paperback version.  It appears some items get corrected occasionally, but still, it is not nice to charge so much for the Kindle version, and not have it completely proofread and ready for primetime.This actually lead me to have a conversation with a Penguin representative about the quality of the Kindle version, and in that conversation, I learned something I had not realized before.  Penguin does not produce the Kindle version.  Amazon does.  So, all of the quality issues I have noticed in the past about Kindle versions essentially are the fault of Amazon rather than the publisher listed.  I suppose the publisher only sells Amazon license to produce the Kindle file and sets price limitations, and Amazon does the rest.  This needs to change, because there needs to be more quality control.However, because of the limitations of the Penguin paperback, I would still recommend the Kindle version if one is to read Screech.Five stars for Montaigne's Complete Essays, regardless of which version one chooses to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DN7X4WDGMDFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI92VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DN7X4WDGMDFW","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really have no idea what happened between the second and third novel, but Dunn has moved from being a quite average novelist to a top-notch writer of the espionage thriller.I despise giving many details of a novel above the blurb given by the publisher, because most readers dislike spoilers.  That being the case, I will say that Cochrane, Dunn's protagonist, encounters some serious competition...There is another Spycatcher in this novel, an SVR version.  Plus there is a German assassin code-named Kronos that is an awesome character.  Both of these characters are likable, and I actually hope to see more of them in a future installment of the Spycatcher series.One large difference I saw in this book is that Matthew Dunn's writing and literary skills have improved, and he is becoming much better at character development.  Before, it was mostly just two-dimensional characters and plot, with much to be desired in descriptive narration.  With Slingshot, he has improved on all of these components of the novel.I recommend this series, with the qualification that readers understand the steep curve of writing quality.  The second book is much better than the first, and the third is much better than the second.  Plus, this seems to be an exponential rather than linear improvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IH2RBDNLBXM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062038028#wasThisHelpful","R1IH2RBDNLBXM9","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of course, it is not necessary for most people to purchase this version of Office, if one feels it is necessary at all, and if one already has 2007 or 2010, I am not convinced moving to 2013 is at all necessary.  If one has Office 2007, it is difficult for me to buy any arguments for upgrading to either major versions since that release.Please do not get me wrong, but Microsoft makes a quality product, and for many people, it is the standard that has to be used in order to prevent compatibility issues that may occur if switching between two different office software products.It appears that the 2013 version does not have options for multiple PCs, as previous versions did...not even the Home and Student version, which is a draconian approach for Microsoft to take.I think over time, people will tend to switch to free alternatives such as OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Google Docs/Drive, and many others.  If Apple keeps up development on the iWork suite, I even think many people will switch to that, if they use Macs, rather than buying MS Office for Mac, which is still a big market.Microsoft, it seems, needs to adjust to the fact that though they make a quality product, other options are available with quality, as well.  Some are even more pleasant and solid to work with.  For instance, when typing a document in Google Drive, the document saves automatically in the background, almost with every keystroke, making it next to impossible to lose any work.  The same thing applies when typing an email with Gmail.  So, there are advantages to using those web-based systems over using Word or Outlook.Using a program that downloads email, such as Outlook, also has the potential to be unsafe when compared to using webmail.  Ever since I switched exclusively to webmail, I have never had a virus download automatically to my computer.  I can evaluate every email or attachment without opening it or having it physically on my computer.  There are advantages to using Outlook, of course, but I don't really miss them.In the end, it is up to the individual to decide which version, if any, to purchase, but I would not personally spend money on Office 2013, as long as I had other viable options.

"If one must use a case, one could do far worse than this Belkin case.  Belkin makes quality products, and their cases are no exception.  It is obvious when inspecting this case that it would provide top-notch shock absorption, and even makes it less likely one would need shock absorption, because it improves ability to grip the iPhone.The Gray/Navy case looks a little like gray/slightly purple.  One can tell this pretty well from the pictures, especially using the zoom feature.When putting the phone in, it seems best to put the left side in first, then push the top right corner in, and finish by sliding down the right side to the bottom right corner.  When taking it out, reverse the process, taking out the bottom right corner, then up to the top right corner, then pull the rest of the phone out.A reminder about charging:  If anyone cares to look into the official Apple information on charging iPhones, they stipulate that ""charging your iPhone while in certain carrying cases may generate excess heat, which can affect battery capacity. If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when you charge it, take it out of its case first."" Which cases? Doesn't say, so better safe than sorry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S856FX6BEKSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC5D0U4#wasThisHelpful","R1S856FX6BEKSA","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
