" ------EDIT-------  August 2014One of the very first reviews I ever wrote in the US was in 2004 on epinions, about this GPS V.  I found it, and am therefore posting it here.The Garmin GPS V deserves a 2014 mention because I've had quite a bit of experience with a variety of other GPS's in the last decade and am still really stunned at the reliability of my Garmin GPS V.The tech is very old, the automotive navigation is next to useless, and the interface to a computer to download maps is agonizingly slow and a nearly pointless 19MB (without an SD card expansion slot).But, without question, while many high-tech GPS's I've purchased have broken, or become unusable, or have had the internal (and uncheangeable) battery die, the GPS V is still working exactly as efficiently (or inefficiently, depending on how you use it) as it did the day I got it.This GPS should not be used as an automotive navigation device.It's true power comes from simply always working, never failing.  It will give you your GPS coordinates always, and if you have the base maps loaded, it will show you approximately where you are, and if you have the detailed topo or marine maps loaded, it will show that information as well.As I have had quite a bit of gear fail in the field (I like backpacking and go out fairly often), I've come to realize that my electronic gear needs to be two things absolutely and always, to prevent failure in the field: - Rugged - WaterproofNot rugged'ish....rugged.  And that means seriously shock proof.  i've dropped this GPS V going 40 mph (don't ask, hahaha)And not ""water resistant"".  Water resistant is the most meaningless con ever.  Water proof...completely water proof is an absolute requirement when you're out in the field.I find it impressive that after all these years, while other electronic gear comes and goes, works for a while and then fails, the Garmin GPS V has stayed as consistently reliable as the day i bought it.  And while I don't take it out much anymore, since I'm now a satellite messenger and gps combo user, I will never sell my Garmin GPS V.Because when all my other GPS gear fails, I know that this will tell me GPS location, next year, or a decade from now. ------EDIT-------September 2009 Just used the Garmin recently for a multi-city trip and was able to install map data for key parts of Boston, Chicago, and College Town (TX) all in 19mbs. There's not doubt that more memory would be better (say, 256 or 512), but 19 can get the job done in a pinch.   In case anyone is interested, with all the construction going on in Boston, even the latest map is pretty worthless, with lots of road errors and directiion errors. In developing Boston, they're not only adding roads, but removing them as well. Somewhat frustrating. Luckily, College Town and Chicago were mostly unchanged since the last release and were both very accurate.   The key for Macintosh users, as mentioned earlier, is having VPC and a Keyspan serial adapter (or an IOGear serial adapter). If you install VPC, you can install the MapSource data on top of it.   There seems to be no problem with this as long as you set up COM1 in the VPC settings to be the serial port. Don't set USB for this as it won't work.   Which has lead to another discovery. When using USB based GPS devices (like the Garmin Quest), there seem to be numerous problems that simply don't exist with the serial adaptor set to COM1. That's both a relief and a disappointment. I was looking forward to the quest as my next device even though it only had 115mbs of memory (13mb for the base map comes to the expected 128mbs). Interestingly enough, in Europe they sell the 243mb version (which is 256mb minus 13mb for the base map). Either way, a major disappointment.------EDIT-------    Based on request, here are some additional opinions regarding the GPS V. I've had this for a few months now and have taken it on several trips.   Let's start with the interface.  Depending on who you ask or which review you read, the opinions of the interface range from hard to use to easy. But for me, it doesn't seem difficult at all. A few features were a little unintuitive at first, but I assume mostly because this is my first GPS. Now, though, I have a pretty good idea of all of the key funtions. It's easy to get to do just about anything. All the functions you would want in City/Street driving and walking are easy. The points of interest are really detailed and thhe inclusion of phone numbers is particularly useful. Of course, the only way to bring up phone numbers is to do a find. Wish they made that and the address easier to access after you made it a waypoint....  What is a little bit difficult is entering long/lat. It's so difficult, that it's just easier to do it with the MapSource software and then download the waypoints. I recently entered a series of waypoints from an off road trail (Used ""Back Country Roads"" book)    Physical buttons.  The buttons are designed to be waterproof along the edges, so the entire pad and all the buttons seem to be a single contiguous rubber piece.  The main navigation button in the center is a little ""mushy"" for lack of a better word. Trying to press ""down"" and end up pressing ""right"" or ""left"", well, you get the idea.   Visibility of the display.  Okay, so maybe I'm new to GPS's so my opinions are based on what I originally thought were ideal instead of in relation to other GPS's I have used, but I think the GPS V's screen (and every other GPS I've ever seen) is just too smal. You really can't read street names.  Having said this, I like this screen's size and resolution more than the Magellans I played around with.The best screen on a handheld I've seen to date is the iQue3600. Wow, lot's of pixels, more screen realestate, and color. But I read around that the iQue3600 breaks so easily as to be nearly worthless....  That's the complaint, but in reality, apart from being unable to read the names without squinting and leaning in a little, I have to say that the screen is easy to see. if you guide yourself by the street lines, then there's no problem. Especially if there's enough variation in the street lines that you can quickly gauge where you are. In Manhattan New York....you can't do that easily because the grid is so close to perfect in midtown. Sort of similar for San Francisco. But in Northern California's South Bay area, it's very easy to gauge where you are.  As to the screen's brightness, glaring sunlight is no problem. Almost no glare or reflection (certainly not enough to complicate screen viewing). And the backlight works really well. Several months and there seems to be no fading of the backlight. The screen's brightness controls and ability to see in daylight far surpass the iQue3600 or my Tungsten C.   Battery life.  About 20 hours contiguous on Duracell   Weight and durability.  Heavier than any Magellan. Will easily sink if dropped in water. Then again, it's very rugged. I can see why the military uses these. I've dropped it several times and there has been absolutely no damage to the functionality of the device, though scrathces abound throughout. Heck, i dropped it on asphalt from a motorcycle going 40mph...went back to pick it up...and it still worked fine.   Carrying on your hip.  Not easy. instead of being flat, it's a triangular cylinder (Like a Toblerone), with a rotating antenna on the one of the back planes. It's really not convenient compared to other GPS's out there.   Antenna....  okay, in a city with a bunch of skyscrapers, it's pretty bad. you get reception, but it's highly inaccurate. But since I set the software to always lock the GPS to a street, it's often the wrong street.  under a canopy of trees (recently went East to some national parks), it really depends on the density of the trees. If you're on the road and there's Redwood branches above and trees all around, I was surprised to get decent accuracy. But if you're hiking and walking in a dense forest where the trees are just a couple of feet away from you as you walk past them, the reception is highly inaccurate and often you lose the connection.   One thing that bothers me here is the inordinate amount of time the GPS takes to find satellites. Okay, let me re-phrase that. Sometimes it's really fast, but sometimes it can take several minutes. The manual says that it should take several minutes only if you turn it off, and move somewhere far away....this is not accurate. because if, for instance, you move to the other side of a building, or come out from an underground garage, it can take several minutes as well.   Routing  What can I say? It's slow as molasses. If you've been looking at a Roadmate, a Navman, or a Garming StreetPilot, don't look at the GPS V. It's ultra slow comparatively speaking. the interface is sluggish, routing and re-routing are slow, everything about it is slow.  As a side note,  WAAS  All I can say about WAAS is....wow!  it works much better than the StreetPilot if the reception is good enough. And though it takes a while to get several sattelites, once it does, it's very accurate and definitely good enough for walking. I recently went to New Mexico and was stunned at how accurate it was while walking in Old town Albequerque and Santa Fe's town square area.  I haven't seen any other WAAS enabled device in action, so I can't really comment on how it compares to other WAAS devices   What other impressions.....  Oh, I might point out here that the new Garmin Quest looks like it has all the features I wish the Garmin GPS V had. I didn't really thinkg the 60cs, or 76cs was a replacement possibility for the GPS V....But the Quest? Yeah, I think that could be my next device.  Last complaint..... If you use a Mac, then don't forget to get VPC, because MapSource won't work on the Mac, and there are no third party developers where you can use the POI database and routing functions that make the Garmin street capable.--Original Review:  September 1st, 2004--This is my first GPS device.  Having read a lot of reviews (many on this epinions), I was struggling with several different models and brands of GPS to choose from. In the end, I chose on price/performance.  The Garmin GPS V, is by now (April 2004), rather dated. There are newer models from Garmin out that are better at dealing with shortcomings from the Garmin GPS V. The newer model has color, an antenna port where removing the main antenna is not required, separate power/serial/USB ports, more memory, color touch screen, and more.  But the newer models, of course, don't come with a completely unlocked US street map. The Garmin, being discontinued, has a deluxe package that unlocks not just a particular region, but the entire United States. And the GPS V, has all the basics: WAAS, some memory (19MBs), high resolution screen, very good backlit screen, and more than anything else, is very tough.  Compared to the newer 60C/CS or 76 C/CS models, it's missing several keys, but even these newer models don't overcome key shortcomings in most Garmin handheld GPS's. Key among these shortcomings is memory. the GPS V has 19MBs, the 76c/cs has 100+MBs, the latest 60C/CS has 56MBs. California alone requires more than 100MBs. What's needed is expandable memory. Magellan GPS handhelds have SD memory card slots.   One might argue that the iQue3600 from Garmin has expandable features and a host of other really amazing features integrating PDA features and GPS features in a seemless unit. But the iQue3600 was $500 plus anywhere I looked. Someone mentioned getting one for less than $300, but I couldn't find such good deals, even including rebates, anywhere. The iQue3600 has another key fault: durability. There were as many complaints about how easily these devices broke down as there were praises for the great integration. And wanting to take the GPS with me on all business trips, off-road travel, and local routing info when visiting new places locally, my GPS was bound to get a lot of abuse. the lack of durability turned me off completely.   Of course, everyone complains about the lack of memory, but my addendum complaints are: Screen is so small, difficult to read on dashboard, have to bring the device somewhat closer to read effectively in map mode. the the turn-by-turn is great. Secondly, there should be a Mac version of MapSource. No matter how you cut it. It's worth it to do. No other manufacturer offers a Mac version. Sure, there are third party GPS software options, but MapSource has the detailed maps, points of interest, and routing information....it's one thing to get a software, but without good content, too much work is required to get it to work right and you still don't get routing. Garmin should make a Macintosh compatible version. They might be surprised at how much of a market opportunity there is. Especially if they are the only ones to do it.   Having used the Garmin GPS V for a little over a month, and having tested the iQue3600, Magellan Platinum, Magellan Sportstrac, Streetwise, and the Hertz GPS, as well as the etrex in the past 2 months, I can say that the GPS V Deluxe is the only device under $400 that I've seen so far with the most flexible configuration for Marine, off-road hiking/driving, on-road driving, and around town walking feautres and a full US (+ parts of Canada) street map. Though this probably doesn't need to be said, the MapSource CitySelect CD also includes obscure off-road trails that are usually not found anywhere except on ""backroads"" off-road maps. Oh, and updated maps are free from Garmin.   Magellan's bundle-packaged Platinum, Gold, and Color Meridians come very close, but no other Garmin, Magellan or Navman GPS comes close in terms of overall flexibility. The Garmin GPS V is heavier, but smaller than the Magellan handhelds (well, just thinner, so easier to pack in tight places when traveling). For hiking/off-road/and citiy driving, the Garmin GPS V is the best device for me.   ","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ACCPNNNHG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000066TPO#wasThisHelpful","R33ACCPNNNHG5","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a pretty big fan of wood stoves.  Starting a fire in the woods is always a chore for me since I don't have the skills to really get a fire going without a little help.But this little guy makes starting a fire using a magnesium fire starter fairly simple.Compared to the Emberlit Titanium mini, this wood stove is a little heavier and a little smaller.  It has a few features enhancements over the emberlit mini, with features more commonly seen in larger devices.The first is that there are two base plates.  one is the ash pan and one holds the wood.  the one for holding the wood has holes in it to draw air from below and also to drop ashes to the ash pan.This is very helpful as a buildup of ash decreases air flow to embers and fuel, which reduces heat.  With this unit, a few taps on the stove shakes ash loose so it drops to the ash pan.Interestingly, this unit also adds the ability to raise the fuel plate.You can notice from the image that this device is basically 4 walls, one of which has a larger opening.  The fuel plate has two rims, or wings, or flaps, if you will.  and these are designed to normally slot into two slits built into two of the walls.  but the fuel plate can actually rest on the base of that larger opening as well, bringing the fuel a lot higher and closer to the upper rim.  Great innovation.When the base plate is on the lower position, you can easily fit an alcohol stove in there as well, so this unit, combined with a trangia alcohol stove and a bottle of denatured alcohol, makes for a very versatile cooking setup.  Ideal for a weekend jaunt alone when the weather isn't too cold.Tougher campers could probably make due with just this in colder weather, but for me, winter camping requires a lot more heat and a lot more cooking efficiency, so I bring a gas canister stove or multi-fuel stove alone with a larger wood stove to help boil water faster, and act as a tiny campfire.All in all, I would say, from a feature, durability, and flexibility perspective, this is my new favorite miniature wood stove.Great job Bushbox.  Awesome piece of gear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U30RIAUVIR48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOPO0AW#wasThisHelpful","R1U30RIAUVIR48","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really wish there was a lot to say about this, but it's best feature is really the price.You get a bagless vacuum for under $100.  It's hugely popular so hepa filters should be easy to get for a good while yet, and it has all the basic features you'd expect, including the detachable hose, and nifty extender design that keeps everything out of the way until you need it.  the extension cord is reasonably long, and the vacuum is not prohibitively heavy.Really...not sure what else there is to say about it.If you want a bagless vacuum, and just need the basics, but want something that lasts and something for which you will likely be able to get hepa filters for a long time, this is kind of it....anything else will jump in price fast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8VVJEVX90B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBIZTW#wasThisHelpful","R1E8VVJEVX90B1","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I'm out backpacking, this little device is a must have.I usually have a few batteries in my pack, to help power my satellite GPS and headlamp.  one uses AA and the other AAA.  This little tester is feather light, has no wires, and is ridiculously easy to break out and adjust with one hand while holding batteries in the other.The lack of wires also means less prone to breaking.There's a dial to switch to a few different battery type settings.I use it with rechargeable batteries too.It works on mini cell (those flat batteries that go in some cameras, garage door openers, etc.  AA, AAA, C, D, 9 volt.Even at home, the fact that I can hold and adjust the gadget with one hand while holding the battery in the other means that for all of the above types of batteries, I grab this first, and not my more complex, voltage adjustable and customizable tester.Really is just too useful not to have around the house and in the backpack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HA7LZ3TV30L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G7SBY4#wasThisHelpful","R1HA7LZ3TV30L8","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough good things about this water filter.  Of all of Sawyer's portable water filters (all pointone family), this one is by far the most useful and the most used.It comes with the reverse ""syringe"" to back wash the filter, a small aluminum dirty water back and a rubber hose/straw.This thing is so unbelievably light, it's hard to believe it is a 0.1 micro filter.  and it works fast.  It may not be as hands free as a gravity filter, but it's way less work than a water pump.  And water pumps have far great mechanical failure chances than this little guy.  heck, I could carry two sets of these and still be lighter than just about every portable water filter I've seen (and those other ones are .2 microns).It fits on most cheap water bottles with the smaller bottle cap.  so you can re-cycle soda bottles or water bottles.  the aluminum bag is best though, and Sawyer sells a larger 2 liter version that is super light, and rolls up to be compact.  I bring two of the larger bags and one of the smaller bags.  The smaller bag I use during hiking.  the two larger ones I fill and cap at the camp site.  It's dirty water, of course, so I just screw on the water filter when I want clean water and pour into a pot and boil.0.1 microns is good for most things.  and certainly better than 0.2 micron filters.But, it's important to note that this is NOT a water purifier.  if there are toxic chemicals in the ""dirty"" water, this will not filter them out.  It will filter out bacteria, viruses, etc.  So you should be able to just drink water collected from a stream or lake in the mountains.  Just don't collect water from likely toxic areas like a large lake that has buildings and such.  Generally, I hike in the emigrant wilderness, where there are no buildings by the lakes at 7500 feet and about.  In fact, there's no one up there apart from park rangers and other backpackers, so this type of filter is more than adequate up there.If you backpack in the wilderness...I would recommend this over a pump without a doubt.  And frankly, I think it's better than a fravity filter because....again...fewer points of failure, and less weight to carry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQZZWZBHU11W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA2RLX2#wasThisHelpful","R2JQZZWZBHU11W","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there's one thing I'm a huge fan of, it's rugged gadgets.I purchased this because I recently went on a  camping trip and the el cheapo blue tooth speaker I purchased just stopped working.  I realized that it had gotten a little wet.  not soaked, mind you, just a little wet.But it got me thinking, if I were to fall into a stream while crossing it, or maybe my pack gets soaked from the rain and seeps through, or maybe my pack rips and falls, or when in a raft my pack gets wet....well...under these circumstances, rugged and water ""resistant"" just won't cut it.  I need water proof.Without doing a ton of research, I focused on strictly waterproof blue tooth speakers and this little guy popped up.  Really, I shouldn't need a speaker while backpacking at all, but when you're out alone, sometimes a little music can cheer you up, and headphones can be a tad scary since you can't hear anything else.  Since the smart phone's speakers are horrendous, a small bluetooth speaker is a reasonable compromise.This guy is a lot smaller than you'd think.  That carabiner you see in the photo is the same as the small ones you see at sports store.  it feels sturdy and a good weight for its size, though still light enough to disappear in the pack.I just took it hiking in the emigrant wilderness, and it was really great.  I won't take it on every camping trip I go, but if the rest of my pack is light, it's a good little morale booster to have with you.Sound quality, because it's waterproof, is a tad...uhhh...I guess you could say it's a tad muffled.  But all in, surprisingly decent.  the bass comes through okay, but treble comes through muddy and muted.  violins and flutes sound like you're listening through a wall, sort of.  but even at that, the sound is dramatically improved over using a smart phones speakers.It's small enough to fit in the top pocket of most packs, and disappears into most small backpacks and shoulder bags too.Surprisingly, this also has a microphone.  doesn't really work that well, but I guess you could use it as a speaker phone in a pinch.All in all, this was a rock solid purchase and I'm glad to have found it.If you want waterproof (because you just never know), and you want as small and compact as possible, with surprisingly good sound for its size, than this is definitely the one to get.The battery lasts a good 6+ hours right now. Don't know if it'll last that long in a year or so, but for now, I'm satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHKKTFT79JFTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSDMWGW#wasThisHelpful","RHKKTFT79JFTW","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quick gander at my list of reviews, and you'll find that I'm mostly positive about the things I purchase.This one was a huge mistake.You'd think that with 4 microphones to be more omnidirectional, the mic pickup on this thing would be a lot better.Nope.  It sucks.Sitting at your desk in a low ceilinged room and an area with little to no reverb from hard walls, and this works just fine.  About about maybe 2 feet away max, probably a little less.But try using this in a larger room still two feet away, and the folks on the other side can baaaaarely hear you.Have you ever been on the phone talking to someone, and you hear a that person talking, just for a moment, to someone else in the house, maybe that person's spouse, and you can sort of hear that ""spouse""?  At least, enough to understand what that distant person is saying?Yeah....this isn't even that good...and we're talking about 2-4 feet away.Sorry, but the reason I spend money on a bluetooth audio conferencing unit is NOT because I want it on my desk in my hotel room....The reason I purchased this is because I do a lot of audio conferencing, and when I go onsite somewhere, I want a way to have a few people around a table on the call.-----Having said all that, if you want to turn your iPhone or Android into a speakerphone, while in a small, quiet, hotel room, having it on your desk while you are sitting there and working...this'll serve.As far as i'm concerned, this is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11B3K25LDT72S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH0ESYK#wasThisHelpful","R11B3K25LDT72S","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I now have three backpacking chairs, they all wei about the same, or, at least, close enough to be negligible for me.  I would likely select a different chair for different types of trips.When hiking alone, I'd probably go with a competitor's chair that has the same seat height.When hiking in a small group for extended trips, I'd probably go with a competitor's chair that sits lowerFor hiking in larger groups, I'd definitely take the Helinox Chair One.  And really it comes to two simple reasons: - It's build to withstand a lot of abuse, the most of any backpacking chair - It's built wide, to accommodate a broad range of body types. - easier for most folks to get into and out of.Hiking in a larger group means all kinds of body types and personalities will be together.  There'll typically be a central campfire to gather around for food and relaxing, and chairs get strewn about and a lot of folks just don't care what chair they sit in.  So, likely, if I have my chair out, it'll be first come first serve.  Or I might get up for a sec to gather firewood, collect water, do some cooking, or maybe go check on my tent, or whatever, and come back and find someone in my chair.Now, that's not a big deal, of course.  But what I wouldn't want is for someone to have an accident because the chair wasn't really sturdy and possibly get hurt, or maybe someone's body type is stockier and becomes extremely uncomfortable in the chair where the front digs into the thighs or the sides put too much pressure, making the chair uncomfortable.The Helinox chair is significantly wider seating than my other two chairs.  Where the other two backpacking chair fits, not snug, but almost snug, the Helinox almost feel like a hammock.  There is plenty of room for stockier folks to be comfortable, and nothing digs in.  it’s also built to withstand 350 lbs.And it does seem immensely strong.  Not sure it would hold up to the same rigors as my lower seat height camp chair, but it sure looks like it can take a beating, and when you don't know how a ""community property"" piece of backpacking gear is going to be treated, you want it as risk free as possible.As I said in the beginning, all three camp chairs I have are essentially the same weight and they really are basically the same bulk.  whichever one I throw in my pack, there is no noticeable difference in weight, nor can I fit any more or less gear, meaning their in-pack build is roughly the same.I guess the only reason I wouldn't take this backpacking chair on all trips with me is that...well...it's kinda big for my butt, and the other camp chairs are a little more comfortable for me because they are a bit more snug.  btw, I measure 5'8"" when barefoot, 140lbs (maybe a touch more now).Oh, one more thing, it does seem to have you in a slightly more “sitting up” position than the other chairs.  Not quite a straight back chair, but a little closer to that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHM15UZB4JJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZGOWZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NHM15UZB4JJW","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've read my other reviews on camping knives, you know well that I don't know much about them.For me, a camping knife needs to be just sharp enough to do camping chores and be able to baton/split wood, and maybe do some occasional hacking and maybe just enough chopping so that I can snap a branch by stepping on it.  Other than that, I don't know or care much about the type of steel used, how well it holds an edge, etc. etc.  Most camping knives fit that bill......so if you're looking for a blade review about steel quality, holding an edge, combat, stop here, this review won't help.Other things I can talk about regarding camping knives since I've been heading out regularly, and things that have evolved for me over time include: - Full tine.  I get it now...full tine is a must. - No serrated portion to the knife.  A lot of hard core campers will disagree with me, and that's okay.  I'm sure they're right and I'm wrong.  But for me, serrated edges are much more trouble to maintain than they're worth for the very basic chores I do. - No weird notches.  I've had two blades now with funky notches along the non-blade side of a single sided blade knife (e.g. belt cutting, etc.)  this creates a weak point along the blade, and...it snaps.  I kid you not...it really snaps....crazy, I know. - 3/16"" is plenty thick enough for my uses, even splitting wood. - solid finger guard to prevent slippage to the blade.  Yeah, this is a biggy.  For backpacking, anything I can do to avoid any injury is a big deal because even a small injury can become very dangerous very quickly.  And when you're 10 miles from your car and 20 miles from the nearest building that might have a first aid kit, even little injuries aren't worth it.  Every blade I take into the woods must have some kind of perpendicular guard or shape to prevent fingers sliding forward to the blade. - removable handles.  I have had only one situation where I wanted to attach a knife to a long stick, so I admit that this is a rare need, and you can tie a knife to a stick without taking the handles off.  But being able to do so, splitting the end of a straight'ish branch a little, and inserting the thinner blade with handles removed and tying it all together....well...the difference in stability is noticeable. - A good sheath....you know, even the cheapest plastic and canvas sheaths with a drain hole work just fine.  I attach mine as close to a drop leg setup as possible, but it really doesn't matter, they all work well.The Esee 6 meets all these criteria, and then some.But, the real reason I love this knife?Drum roll please.The micarta handles.I don't know much about handles, but I do know that the hard Glock plastic material, and some other plastics get slippery when wet.  Again...injury = bad.The micarta handles do not slip even when wet.They feel like a very fine grain.  almost like a surface made with sand, but not as abrasive and skin tearing.  Somehow, this knife is reasonably smooth to the touch, but just rough enough that it doesn't slip....It's really rather incredible.But just as importantly, micarta is lighter than I would have expected.  Much lighter.The other reason i like the Esee 6 is that, for my uses, I just recently discovered that 6 is the perfect blade length.  I have a 9, 7, and 5, and all are great, but all have little disadvantages.  The 6"" blade with the simple, abuse bearing lines along the blade and the back edge, means I can beat the crap out of this knife and it'll keep on ticking.One last interesting note.  The sheath comes in two parts, the belt clip portion and the actual sheath.  You can attach the belt clip portion to either side, but it screws on, so just note that once it's on, you won't want to switch the side while out in the field, so think about the rest of your setup and where you want your knife to be before attaching the clip to the sheath.Of all the knives I've purchased as I continue to learn about backpacking, the Esee 6 is by far the most perfect fit.Rock on Esee, I'm impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZTZEXQJG5LES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049TYBL2#wasThisHelpful","RZTZEXQJG5LES","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When backpacking in the Emigrant Wilderness, you're not allowed to setup camp near the edge of the lakes, so it's always a good idea to have a bucket with you, to have access to water at the camp site.This bucket is about 10 litres realisitically, 11 would be pushing it.  that's about 2.5 gallons, or close enough.Plenty of water for two to drink, hydrate food, do a few dishes, and wash your face.  If you're conservative, that's plenty for the next morning too.I backpack along sometimes, and this bucket is more than enough for one.  For two people it works just fine.  For three you'd probably want a second bucket.Either way, backpacking buckets sure have come a long way.  I used to use the bear can to transport water, but once we started bear hanging, we switched to a folding bucket like this one, which was heavier and took up more space.This Seattle Sports PVC Free pocket bucket is quite a bit lighter, folds a little smaller, and also stands upright.  I wouldn't hang this from a tree when filled with water because I think the lifespan of this bucket may be considerably less than the other folding bucket.  But treated well, this bucket should work just fine to lug water to the camp site, and then you can use a filter to get clean water as you need it.Note:  use filtered water to wash your face.  lake water, especially the water near the surface, can get warm, and that is a breeding ground for some bacteria and viruses that can cause real harm.  It's highly unlikely, of course, but there have been news reports of warn lake water being a touch dangerous.If you're on the hunt for the lightest, free standing water bucket for backpacking, this is definitely the one to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPVPT7UV0UK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXYD168#wasThisHelpful","R3RPVPT7UV0UK9","A3OCIWPCPXNN0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OCIWPCPXNN0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really nice backpack! Even though it is designed for yoga, it really is quite multi-functional and can be used in a ton of different ways.I use it mostly when I am headed to the gym, because it is so nice to be able to carry everything that I need inside of the bag, and roll up my yoga mat and carry it using the straps on the side. It really frees my hands up and makes things a lot easier for me.There are plenty of compartments inside the bag, and I have plenty of room to carry everything that I like to take with me. The bag is very well made, all of the stitching is nice and tight and I did not find any loose threads anywhere. The zippers all work well, and open and close easily without having to tug.The bag is comfortable to wear, the straps are nice and thick and I love that there is a hidden pocket on the strap that can be used to carry a cellphone or MP3 player. This could also be used for backpacking or taking a hike in the woods, it really is so versatile. I received one to review and am very pleased with it. It definitely makes lugging all my things to the gym a much easier task!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I have tried using a lot of tablets over the past few years, and most of them just end up lacking in one department or another.This one definitely goes above and beyond my expectations, I absolutely love the fact that it is so versatile and that I can use it as a tablet when I feel like doing a bit of reading or playing some games, or I can snap on the included case and turn it into a laptop for when I want to use it to get some extra work done.It was extremely easy to set up, and it comes with Windows 10 and Office 365 already installed so I didn't have to worry about that at all. The screen is 10.1 inches and has a 1280 by 800 resolution, so the graphics are excellent.  I was really surprised by how bright and crisp everything is on the screen. Definitely no complaints in that department whatsoever.As far as speed, everything opens up very quickly and I never have any issues with it lagging. I like to take a lot of photos, which can take up space so I appreciate the fact that it has 2GB RAM + 32GB Nand Flash extendable to 128 GB by adding a Micro SD card.It also comes with a dual Camera, but since it is only 2MP, l would say that is is the one area that could definitely stand a little improvement. Even the most basic cameras are way above 2MP these days, so I was disappointed to see that the camera had such a low quality.The Bluetooth is a nice feature as well, because I enjoy listening to a lot of music and it is nice to be able to plug in a Bluetooth speaker to get a bit of added volume when I am in the mood for rocking out. I received one to review and have not wanted to put it down since it arrived. This is an excellent laptop/tablet hybrid and I will be purchasing another one to give as a gift this holiday season.

"I find that the air in my car gets extremely dry when I have had the windows rolled up, so this little portable humidifier comes in quite handy!This is really easy to use, all you have to do is fill it up and plug it in, it will do all the work for you. I like the fact that it fits into the cup holder in my center console perfectly, and didn't move around at all when I was driving. I even had a bit of a scare which caused me to hit the brakes suddenly, and it still stayed right in place.It looks nice and is very quiet, which makes a difference for the rare times that I do not have the radio playing while I am in the car.I was hoping that I would be able to take this inside and set it on my desk to use when I am working as well, but discovered that I would need to get a separate adapter, which was a bit of a bummer. Overall, it is a really nice gadget and is something that a lot of people don't realize that they can use.

"First off, let me say that I made some BOMB mashed potatoes using this!I have never tried using a potato ricer before when cooking, and now that I have I will never go back to making them the way that I was before. It is super easy to use, and turns the potatoes into these awesome soft flakes. Everyone loved how the potatoes turned out and commented on how different the texture was right away. The potatoes were a lot more fluffed up and now my family has been begging for them as a side dish every week.The ricer is very easy to use, just boil the potato and put it in and press.

"Lately I have gotten into the habit of making fresh juice in the mornings and this is definitely way easier than making it manually like I was before!This is really easy to use and comes with everything necessary. The first time I used it I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of juice I received using a machine versus using the same amount of oranges and squeezing them manually. Not only is it much less work and far less time consuming, the reward is also greater.I leave mine out all the time, and the juicer is really nice looking on the counter as well. The stainless steel has a classy look to it and is very easy for me to wipe down if it gets a bit messy during use.

"In preparation for my first holiday meal that I will be cooking, I needed something really nice and elegant looking to display the main dish.This stainless steel spiked tray is just what I was looking for. The picture really doesn't do it justice at all, when I took it out of the package I was really surprised by how nice and shiny it is. I looks much more expensive than it really is and I'm very excited to use it when we have our guests over.Just to give it a try, I prepared a meal at home and used this to carve and present the meat. Everyone loved how elegant the table looked and the spikes really helped to hold everything in place while I was carving it up. I always have a hard time carving meats because they tend to move around so much,but that didn't happen at all using this platter. I received one to review and am very happy with it.

"I have recently gotten into the habit of barbecuing more often, and figured it was time to really make food the proper way and use a meat thermometer.This one is really nice, and I like the fact that it is so easy to use. It takes a little bit of time for the reading to come, up, about 25 seconds or so, but having peace of mind that I am not giving myself food poisoning makes it well worth the wait in my opinion.It's lightweight, easy to hold, and gives an accurate reading which are really all I require out of a device such as this. The display is easy to read and it shuts off on its own after a few minutes. I really like the fact that it comes apart so that the metal pronged end can be washed properly without fear of messing up the electrical components.

"I am the type of person that is never without my phone in my hand, and while that has it advantages, it definitely has its disadvantages as well since my battery is constantly needing to be recharged.This is perfect for me me because I do not have to stick tight to a wall outlet anymore, I can toss this in my purse, plug my phone into it and let my phone charge while I am out and about running errands or doing whatever I need to do for the day.

"This is a nice set of whisks and are very handy to have around the kitchen.I had been using a very old set, that had become a bit rusted over the years of use and these were exactly what I was looking for. The fact that they are coated in rubber makes them perfect for me because they will not rust and also I don't have to worry about my pots ending up with scratches if I use them to stir a sauce, ect.The metal handles are easy to hold and feel comfortable in the hand, having three sizes to choose from is nice as well. So far they have proven to be sturdy and are also quite easy to clean. I handwash these and use the little hook on the end to hang them up and allow them to air dry and they are still in perfect condition.

"I have never used space saver bags before, but with lots of things to store and little storage space, I figured there was no time like the present to give them a try.When these arrived, the package included three of the bags in different sizes, and a few random pieces I wasn't sure what to do with. There were no instructions included, which was a bit of a pain, but I was able to do my own research and figure out how to use them.Overall, these really are quite simple to use. Just place the items inside the bag, seal the bag up, and use the hose attachment of a vacuum to take out the excess air. There is a bit of a learning curve, as the first few times I tried it the seal didn't seem to stick well but I eventually got the hang of it after a few tries.These are really quite large and hold a large amount of items. I am using them to store extra bedding away without taking up a ton of room, and for that they are perfect. I received some to review, and am happy with their performance.

I looked them over when they arrived and did not find any loose threads at all, and checked the zippers as well. The zippers glide easily and are very smooth on the track.

"This is a really nice set of wooden children's dominoes.When I ordered it I thought it would be more of something that only younger children would enjoy, but it turned out to be something that the entire family can do together. We had a blast setting up all of the dominoes and perfecting everything so that we could try to do the little stunts that come included.Honestly, for us the stunts were the best part. It comes with a little set of steps, a bridge, a swinging bell, and a ramp and we had a ton of fun coming up with different combinations and ways to work them in.The kit comes with 100 dominoes, which is a really good amount. The quality of them is very good, and they are made of wood, which is much better than some of the other plastic sets that we have used in the past. The wood gives them a bit of extra weight, so there is less worry about them getting accidentally knocked over. The colors are really bright and eye catching, which also makes them more fun to use.

"My neighbor just has a little girl and wanted to set up the nursery in an animal theme, so I thought this would make the perfect gift for her.She was absolutely thrilled when she opened the gift and found this cute little owl clothing rack inside. The colors are very pretty and vibrant and she hung it on the wall and it really brightens up the nursery quite a bit.It is a made of wood, so it is nice and sturdy and can handle a good amount of weight. It has 2 pegs and the description says it can handle up to 30 lbs,  although baby clothing really isn't that heavy so I would say that the amount that she has hanging from it is nowhere near that amount. This would also work well for an older child's bedroom and if they are hanging something like a backpack on the pegs, then having the added stability would be very important.We found it very easy to put up, we had to purchase some cheap hardware because it does not come with hardware included but that was really no big deal. We had it out of the box and up on the wall in about 5 minutes, easy peasy. I was sent one to review and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice way to add a bit of color and functionality to a baby or child's bedroom.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"Ever since this arrived it has been absolutely my favorite cutting board hands down.It is much larger than the cutting boards that I have been using in the past, and I am finding out that having the extra room makes a world of difference when it comes to food preparation. The fact that is has a pretty nice amount of thickness to it makes it easier for my husband to use as well. At 6ft4, anything that helps prevent him from having to hunch over so low gets an A+ in his book.The woven look is easy on the eyes and I don't mind letting this one set out on my counters when it is not in use. I typically keep it in its own little spot next to my microwave and that works out just fine for me.I have found it to be very easy to clean and I like the fact that is has been really resistant to knife cuts. After using it, I always wash and allow it to air dry, and before using I always spray it down with a white vinegar to help kill any bacteria.

"I use my hose for many different things, so having a nice quality hose with adjustable settings is something that is really important to me.This nozzle is strong and sturdy and does not leak at all. I have purchased a lot of nozzles from my local hardware store and they always seem to end up dripping water from the bottom after a short amount of time. I have been using this one daily and have not experienced any issues. When I first started using it, I found the handle a little difficult to squeeze but it has loosened up substantially now and I can squeeze it easily.The full setting is the one that I find myself using the most. It has a lot of power to it and works great for getting dirt and grime off of my sidewalk and hosing out the cracks so that the weeds do not grow there. The mist setting is very nice also, and works out perfectly for watering my more fragile flowers and vegetable garden. I received one to review and so far do not have any complaints.

"I was searching for something fun to give to my neighbors child for her birthday and this turned out to be the perfect gift.I remember playing with these types of toys when I was young, and to be honest did not even realize that they are still around. This traffic bead maze is very fun and has a nice twist on the classic style that I used to play with.It is very well made, and the painted colors are nice and bright. The beads and vehicles move along the track easily and she had a lot of fun with the little traffic signals too. It definitely made for an excellent gift and kept her occupied for quite some time.

"Now that the sun starts going down earlier in the day, I find myself having to go for walks in the evenings sometimes after dark.Since the area I live in is not very well lit in certain spots, having these on my wrists definitely make me feel a bit safer. They are a very bright neon yellow color and the reflective tape works perfectly and really makes a difference when the light hits it.These are very lightweight, which I love. Once I put these on, I barely even notice that I am wearing them. They just close with velcro, so it is very easy to make them as large or as small as necessary. I have been wearing them on my wrists, but these would also be good for attaching to my tennis shoes or even around a dogs collar to help them be seen as well. I received a pair to review and these are definitely going to get a ton of use from me. I love having the added security and knowing that I am more visible to cars passing by.

"I have quite a few family members that play the guitar, so they were all more than willing to try out this capo and give their honest opinions.Overall, this one got raving reviews! Everyone was very happy with it, and loved the fact that it is nice and lightweight. The Furios guitar capo is very easy to use and does not cause that unattractive buzzing that some other capos can cause. Another big advantage of this capo is the fact that it is not intrusive at all, and is completely out of the way so that it doesn't get bumped while playing.It has a nice look to it and is very well made for the price. If you are looking for a nice guitar capo and don't want to break the bank, this is an excellent choice.

"I love the classic look of these wooden toy trucks!I wanted a set of trucks that were a bit more durable than the typical plastic sets that I kept coming across at the department stores, and these turned out to be just what I was looking for. The trucks are made of wood, and are so much more sturdy and durable than the plastic ones I purchased previously.This set comes with three different trucks, a tractor, a pickup truck, and cement mixer. What I found really cool was the fact that each one of the trucks has real moving and working parts. I did not realize this when I ordered these, so it was a nice surprise when I opened them up and checked them out and found that the drum on the cement mixer really rolls.The trucks are all really well made, and have many small details that other toys lack. The wheels spin freely and they are the perfect size for little hands to pick up and move around the floor. I received these to review and they have been a big hit in my household. I highly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for something a little bit more well made and study that typical toys. If you have a little one that can be a bit rough on toys, this is a great choice.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I like to switch my nose rings out often to suit my mood or match whatever it is that I am wearing for the day, so the fact that this set offers multiple colors is perfect if you are like me.These are very comfortable to wear and slide in and out of my nose piercing easily. I like that they have the hook style on the end, which keeps them from falling out when sleeping or showering. The gemstones are on the small side and all very pretty, but seemed to be a bit dull, whereas I would prefer them to be a bit more shiny looking. I was able to get a bit more sparkle out of them by using some jewelry cleaner on them and giving them a good scrub down.Overall, they are definitely a great value, and for the price you can't go wrong. I received some to review and think they are nice for me to have around as spares. Thumbs up!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is an alright leash that is best suited for a small breed of dog.I used this leash for walking a dog that weighs around 30 lbs and I think for me personally I would consider that to be close to the top of the weight limit for this leash. The leash is made of a light plastic, and may not be able to perform well with any more weight than that pulling on it.When it first arrived, I noticed that it was a bit on the dusty side, but I was able to wipe it clean easily with a damp towel and it was just fine. Also, the metal clasp that hooks to the dog's collar had a bit of a gap in the closure when it arrived, but I just used some tools to clamp it all the way shut and it is fine now.I really like the look of the leash, and love the reflective stickers on the sides. I walk in the evenings a lot of times, and it is nice to have the stickers to help cars see me walking. As for the rest of the leash, I have small sized hands and found the handle to be just right for me and very comfortable for me to hold. If you have larger hands, it may be a bit small for you, so that is something to keep in mind when ordering. I received one to review, and have done my best to describe both the pros and cons of the leash in order to help others make an informed decision when purchasing.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is such an awesome ice cream cart! My niece loves to play pretend, and this cart has been her favorite ever since it arrived.As soon as it came, we couldn't wait to get it all up and try it out. It does require a bit of assembly, but nothing too difficult. You will need an Allen wrench/hex key and a Phillips screwdriver for assembly. The hex key is included, which is a nice bonus.Once everything is put together, the cart is about 3 foot tall in total, and the top of the counter comes to about 20"", which is perfect for a toddler. It's really a nice height because it is not too low that older children can't play with it as well.My niece and her friends had an absolute blast pretending to take orders and serve up ice cream cones to everyone in the family. The cart comes with 6 different wooden ice cream cones and a little wooden holder to put them in. The cones are very bright and colorful and are very eye catching, which the children loved.The cart also has some extra storage space, so they had a fun time pretending to expand their business and sell hot dogs as well. They spend hours putting the hot dogs in the storage area, taking orders and sending them out with ice cream. Little entrepreneurs already! I received the cart to review and can't say enough good things about it. It is an excellent way to promote creativity and learning and has been a great addition to our pretend area.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is such an adorable clothing rack! I was struggling to come up with a nice gift to give to my cousin who is having an animal themed baby shower, and this turned out to be the perfect choice.When this arrived, I immediately opened it up to check it out and loved how cute it is. I love that it comes ready to go and does not require any type of assembly. I always check things over from top to bottom before giving them as a gift and I could tell right away how well mad the clothing rack is. The shades of blue and very pretty together, and the paint job was very well done.She put it up in her nursery right away and it looks great. Every time I stop over and pop in to see the baby I notice how great it looks up on the wall. It does not take up much room (it measures approximately 11"" x 9"") and each peg can hold up to 15 lbs.She seems to be getting quite a bit of use out of it, and told me that she loves how it helps her to keep things organized in the room.

"I have a ton of phone cases, and this one is definitely one of my favorites!The teal color is beautiful in person, and the fact that it has rhinestones makes it even better in my book. The case looks great on my iPhone 6 Plus, and since it is relatively thick it also offers a pretty good amount of protection. The corner bumpers are well made to help stop the phone from shattering if it were to land on a corner or take a hit. The case also has a rubberized coating, which feels nice in the hand and helps me to have a better grip on it when I am texting or playing games with one hand.I tend to be a bit on the clumsy side, so more protection for my phone is something I can appreciate. I actually dropped my phone shortly after putting the case on, so I can say that it definitely does work!

I love that she will be able to wear this whenever she wants something a bit dressier to wear.The quality of the bracelet itself is great, the clasp opens and closes easily and it is a nice size that would fit on the average adult wrist.As a bonus, it came in a nice gift box, which is perfect for me since I like to save as much time as possible when it comes to wrapping gifts.

"Our home is filled with a multitude of pets, and of course our furry friends require nothing but the most luxurious sleeping accommodations.This micro suede pet bed was an excellent choice. As soon as I got it out of the box, my pets were already sniffing around trying to check everything out. I got the bed in the larger size and in the color blue and beige. Right off the bat I was impressed with the quality of the pet bed. All of the stitching is nice and tight, and there were no loose threads whatsoever. The blue color is very bright and vibrant, and the micro suede was nice and thick.The bed is nice and large, measuring 34"" x 24"" x 12"". While my dog can't get enough of it, I often look over and find two or more kitties curled up and napping comfortably in the bed. Good thing we are a family that likes to share!A few of the things I like best about the bed is the fact that the bed cover is removable. The zippers are also hidden, so I don't have to worry about the animals chewing on it or getting poked by the pull. It is really easy to take the cover off and put it back on again, so that is also a plus.If you prefer, there is also the option to take the filling out of the bed and refill it with soft old pillows or sweaters. My pets love the bed just the way that it came, but I like knowing that the option is there in case I want to do that later on.The bed cover is also machine washable. With so many pets, the bed can get a spot on it here and there, so it's really nice to be able to just unzip the cover and toss it in the washer to clean it. I washed it in cold water on the gentle cycle and then allowed it to tumble dry and that worked out nicely. The bed came out nice and clean and the colors are still bright and vibrant.Overall this is an excellent pet bed, and my fur babies have been very happy with it. I received one to review and love that it even came with a super cute bone shaped pillow. The bed is nice to look at, easy to clean and very supportive, which is great for older animals as well.

"I needed a replacement bulb for one of our fixtures, and this 9 watt bulb was a great choice.The bulb is very unique looking, which I really enjoy. The design of these bulbs is elegant and gives my fixture a little something extra. They give off a really nice soft white light, which gives the room a nice glow. I would have liked the brightness to be a bit more, but the amount of light was still acceptable.I prefer LED lighting to traditional bulbs because they are environmentally friendly and also use less power, and therefore cost less money to run.

"I spend a lot of time working out in the gym, and because of that I definitely know the importance of having a good sports bra.This is a really nice racerback sports bra. It is extremely comfortable for me to wear, and still offers a nice amount of support. As a size 36D/DD, I have a lot of difficulty doing high impact aerobics and running on the treadmill without being in pain. I was able to make it through my Turbo Kick class, and run a few miles in the treadmill with this sports bra on and never experienced any discomfort.The bra is great when it comes to wicking away sweat and moisture, even though I was sweating quite a bit I did not feel wet and yucky while working out. The band stayed in place and did not move or roll up at all, and the straps were comfortable and did not dig into my shoulders.I washed the sports bra and dried it in the dryer on low heat and it came out good as new with no shrinkage. From what I can tell, it is very well made and there was no loose threads or stitching. I received one to review and will be wearing it regularly for my workouts at the gym.

"I love collecting different styles of sunglasses, and this was one style that I have been wanting to add to my collection for a while now.I got these in the gold and black colors,and they are a lot of fun. The gold is very nice and shiny, and looks really good next to the black frame. These have a nice amount of tint to them, so they block out a decent amount of sunlight and allow me to still see through them easily.I like the fact that the design is pretty versatile, and they can easily be worn with either a casual or more dressed up outfit.For the most part, these are pretty comfortable to wear. I wore them out and about for a few hours, and the nose piece was comfy and did not hurt my face and all. Also, they are nice and lightweight so they didn't leave those little indent marks on the sides of my nose. As for the fit, I think they were a little bit large on my face horizontally.  I do wish they were a little smaller and more on par to typical women's sunglasses, but they would be perfect for anyone going for a bold look.

"I love how adorable this wallet case for my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is! The whole thing is really cute, and I love the blowing dandelion design.The print quality is really nice, the edges are nice and crisp too. I included a few photos so you can see that it is not blurry or anything, it's very pretty. The wallet has a magnetic closure, and the inside of the wallet has a few slots so that you can put cash, credit cards, and your ID to take with you. The magnetic closure works well, though I do prefer the added security of a snap button closure when it comes to my wallets. This one has popped open on me a few times in my purse, but nothing major.The phone holder is a perfect fit for my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. It holds my phone in place nice and tightly, and the cutouts are in the right spots so that I can access all of the buttons on my phone and use all of the features while it is inside the wallet case.

"We are a household that loves music, and listening to it on the go. With that being said, it's no surprise that we have managed to amass quite a collection of headphones over the years.Typically, I seem to end up just grabbing the first pair that I see, but recently I have been making sure to reach for these when I am grabbing a pair out of the collection. These are very comfortable for me to wear, and fit nicely in my ears. I have had troubles with other pairs hurting my ears, but these are nice and soft and cushy.When it comes to sound quality, I am very pleased with the performance of these ear buds. I can turn the volume of the music up nice and loud and there is very little distortion. The bass sounds fabulous and I never have any issues with the sound cutting out or anything like that.Overall, I really have no complaints about these.

"I use my laptop for quite a few hours a day and found that it would get increasingly hot during use. This little gadget seemed like a quick and inexpensive way to remedy the situation.The laptop cooler is very easy to use, and fits into the side of my laptop well. I appreciate the fact that it is fairly small and not intrusive at all. Since it just slides into the back corner of the laptop, I don't have to worry about bumping it when I am typing or anything like that.One thing that I did notice is that the seal is not as tight as I would like it to be, but it is tight enough for the cooler to work well. I have definitely noticed that while my laptop still does get a bit warm after extended use, it is no where near the hot box that it was before this arrived.

Definitely a great addition to my case collection!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQ5CN8O2KA48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GQ1NZO#wasThisHelpful","RHQ5CN8O2KA48","A3AFF6XMHMG9TD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFF6XMHMG9TD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really great and inexpensive way to keep a laptop safe from those with sticky fingers.The cable is relatively thick, so someone would definitely have to have the proper tools to cut through it. While it is obviously not indestructible, it definitely will deter someone with less than stellar morals from grabbing your stuff.The lock is very easy to use and comes with two keys that are special made and unique to each lock. I was able to unbox everything and have it on my laptop in under 5 minutes. I like that even with the lock in place, I am still able to open and close the lid of my laptop and it is not in an intrusive place.Also, the lock is not very heavy and it comes with a bit of velcro to help keep everything organized. It is super easy for me to carry this with me. I just toss this in my laptop bag when I am heading out, and love knowing I can lock my computer when necessary.As a sidenote, I did try it on my husbands Macbook Air, and found that the piece is too large so that is something keep in mind before ordering that this lock cannot be used with Apple laptops. I received one to review, and love it. It definitely adds a nice measure of security, and we can't be too careful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4OSOVF1XZW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJHQFLU#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4OSOVF1XZW8","A3AFF6XMHMG9TD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFF6XMHMG9TD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a little something that I could add over a nice camisole to dress it up a bit, and this turned out to be the perfect choice.This lace jacket is really nice fits me perfectly. I wear a size 12 and I ordered the color black in the size XL. It is nice and fitted, but because the material is stretchy, it is not tight at all. The sleeve length is perfect and they come right to my wrists.I looked the jacket over when it arrived and it seems to be very well made. There are no loose threads and the stitching is very tight. It looks great with my tank tops and is just what I was looking for. I received one to review and I have been wearing it a lot lately. I seem to get compliments on it every time I put it on.

"This is such a cute way to make your furry friend a little more festive for the holiday season!I love dressing my pets up, much to the disapproval of some of my friends, LOL. I can't help myself, I just can't resist a good novelty costume or collar and this one is no exception! Don't worry, no pets were harmed in this upgrade of adorableness.The collar has a pretty pretty red and green plaid print on it, and comes with a super cute bow attached. The size small collar is adjustable and can accommodate neck sizes between 12-16 inches, so it is easy to get a good fit. I found the collar very easy to adjust, which is always a bonus. It has a snap closure as opposed to the watch band style, so it is nice and easy to take on and off.While the collar was originally designed for dogs, I just had to give it a try on my sweet kitty when he came walking by.  The size small fit his neck perfectly, and made him quite the dapper little gentleman if I do say so myself.  My cat is used to my usual antics, so he didn't mind one bit.

"I love switching up the bands for my Fitbit Flex and have quite a large collection, but so far this one is my absolute FAVE!I love the neat black and white tribal pattern, it is a really pretty design and have gotten quite a few compliments on it since I started wearing it.The band is designed to be one size fits most, I typically wear a size small in the original Fitbit bands, and this band fits me well and is very comfortable to wear. There are plenty of holes in the band, so it could easily accommodate a larger wrist as well. The plastic is also very soft and bendable, so I can bend my wrist and it bends right along with me.If you have worn a Fitbit before, then I am sure that you know the usual Fitbit bands have a small metal piece that holds them closed, but they often end up popping open. Since this band has a watch band style closure, it stays secure and don't have to worry about it ever falling off while I am out and about. Since Fitbits certainly are not cheap, just having peace of mind that I am not going to lose it is priceless to me. I received one to review and wear it all the time now since it arrived, I think my other bands are getting jealous!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I'm a sucker for a good novelty item, and this is no exception. I love these little floating flamingo drink holders!These are super cute, and I used them when I was having a few friends over for a pool party. They come in a set of 6, which is nice and everyone got a huge kick out of watching them float around the pool all day long. Every time I turned around it seemed like someone kept asking me where they could get some of their own.These were easy to inflate and did a great job of holding our drinks, even with all the splishin and a'splashin. Since they are not very big, I had all 6 of them blown up in just over 10 minutes. They can easily hold a can of soda, or a small tumbler glass with a lid. They did not tip over and all and they floated perfectly.I loved the bright pink color of them, and thought they were a really cute way to add a bit of fun to the party. I received some to review and will be ordering another set so that I will have enough in case I decide to invite more friends next time.  I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is a pretty fun skull printed head wrap! I'm a fan of all things skull, and this is no exception for sure.When it arrived, I was surprised by how light weight this is. Even though it is not very heavy, it does still work well for keeping the face warm if the air is a bit brisk outside. It has been getting cold here overnight, so I was able to test it out and I felt like it definitely made a difference.Also, this is designed so it can be worn a lot of different ways, which is a nice bonus since it saves me from having to buy several different products. So far,  I think prefer to use it wrapped around the face like it is in the stock picture, just because that is the way that shows off the skull face the best.  I do wish that the face was printed a bit higher up, there is a lot of black fabric above where the design stops, so I have to fold the extra black fabric down, otherwise either the face would not be lined up correctly, or my eyes would be covered. Not a huge deal, but just something minor that I noticed.This is fun to use everyday, but could also be nice to have on hand around Halloween. I will be tossing this on with a little face paint to make an easy costume for myself when taking the little ones out Trick-or-Treating this year.

"I am going to be traveling to the Dominican Republic in the near future and was looking for a nice money belt to hold my cash, passport and phone under my clothes while traveling.This little money belt is exactly what I was looking for. The two big zippered pockets are great for holding my items. The larger one can easily accommodate my passport while the smaller one is great for holding cash and my cell phone. They zip shut tightly, and the zipper glides easily and does not stick at all.The belt is designed with a stretchy fabric, so it can fit a wide variety of waist sizes. I am a women's size 12 and it fit me with no problems and could still go quite a bit larger if needed. It is very adjustable, which is great if multiple people would like to use the same belt at different times during the trip.I love that it is not bulky at all, like old fanny packs used to be. I am able to conceal this under my clothes easily so that when I am walking around the city, nobody can tell that I am carrying it. It lays flat against my skin, so as long as I am not wearing a super form fitting shirt it is undetectable. I received one to review and I know that it will be very useful for me. If you are looking for an inexpensive money belt that is big enough to accommodate your odds an ends, this is a great choice.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"We recently decided to throw a party with a retro theme to celebrate my niece's birthday and these were a great touch.The adults at the party loved drinking out of these, and since they were a bit different and larger than the milk bottle glasses that the children used, it was easy to determine which had the adult beverages. These hold up to 15oz, which is great if you like to put ice in your drink because you can still fit the entire 12oz beverage into the cup even with the ice added.The mason jars are made of a nice thick glass, and seem to be very well made. The lids screw on tightly, and all seem to fit perfectly as well.The handles on these make them super easy to hold, and I love that they came with the lids and the fun reusable plastic straws. I received a set to review and everyone seemed to love them at the party. I received a lot of compliments and will be ordering an extra set so that we have enough for 8 next time.

"We decided to have a retro themed party for my niece's birthday, and these were the perfect addition!These were a total hit at the party, everyone kept commenting on how cute these were and that they were a lot of fun to drink out of.Each milk bottle can hold 10 oz of liquid, so just slightly less than what a can of soda holds. They are made of glass, but seem to be fairly thick. I didn't have to worry about them breaking easily or anything.The lids are a light blue color, which is pretty but I personally would have preferred a clear lid so that they can be used with a variety of color themes. They also come with the reusable striped plastic straws already included, which is a nice bonus and really helped with the retro feel too.I received a set to review and really enjoyed using them.

"My Galaxy phone only came with one charger so I was in need of spare to have with me so I could charge my phone at work when necessary.This charger works perfectly and charges my phone in a jiffy.

As someone who is constantly busy and going from place to place, I really love this.It comes with a cord, which is another bonus. The cord and charger are both well made, and the cord fits into the charger port on my phone perfectly and is not loose at all.

"I absolutely love this little set of collapsible bowls!They are designed for dogs, which is great, but I do have to admit that I have been using them for myself as well. I love these for if I just want a little snack while I am watching TV. They are safe for humans to use, so I figured why not, right? They pop out and make a nice sized bowl and since there is 4 of them in the set, my husband and I can each have our own little snack sized bowl of chips or popcorn instead of passing the bag back and forth and grabbing handfuls.The bowls themselves are really nicely made. The pop out and collapse down easily and are really nice and brightly colored. The fact that they fold down flat is awesome to me since I do not have a ton of room for storage in my kitchen. I received a set to review and these are very useful to have around the house. I never imagined that I would use these as much as I do.

"I purchased the new Galaxy S6 Edge Plus on the day it was released and spung for the platinum gold version, so I definitely wanted a clear case to show off the beauty of the phone.This is a nice case that offers moderate protection and lets the beauty of the phone shine through. It is very slim and lightweight, so it does not add a lot of bulk to the phone, which I love. Adding a huge bulky case to a phone with such a slim design ruins it a bit for me, so I prefer these types of cases by far.The edges of the case are slightly raised to help protect the curved design of the S6 Edge Plus. While that definitely helps, I do have to say that I wish they were raised slightly higher to offer a bit more protection. I also noticed that after having the case on for a while, it tends to get large air bubbles trapped between the back of the phone and the case, but since I don't spend much time staring at the back of the phone it isn't much of an issue for me personally.The case does not have cutouts for the buttons, but rather raised sections where the buttons are. I can access all of the buttons and features on my phone easily and without any issues when the case is on. I received one to review and overall it's a great case for the price. If you are looking for a clear case for the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus that won't break the bank, this is a wonderful choice.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is a really nice leather bag that is great for carrying things to and from work.The pictures really don't do it justice, I have to say that it looks much more expensive and luxurious in person. The color is very rich and the bag is well made. I looked it over and the stitching is very nice and tight and there are no loose threads anywhere.The shoulder strap makes the bag easy to carry and is a good length for me. It also comes with a short attached handle, which is nice since I have a choice in how I would like to carry it.The bag is nice and large, it easily accommodated my 13"" laptop, tablet, and other odds and ends. The top of the bag zips shut, and I did not have any issues with the zipper catching, it zips and unzips smoothly and easily. There is also a pocket on the front of the bag that has a magnetic closure. I like to use that pocket for pens and pencils, gum, and smaller items.When the bag arrived, it had a slight scent to it but I noticed that it went around after I let the bag air out for about 24 hours. It was not a bad or offensive odor, just slightly noticeable. I wasn't sure at first exactly what PU leather is, so I did a bit of research and learned that it is another word for split leather. Split leather has polyurethane applied to the surface, and is a bit different from 100% genuine leather just in case you were not sure what PU leather is either.

"This is my first time using a steamer made of bamboo, and I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised! 'One of the things that I always hated about my old steamer is that the water would condense on the lid and then drop back onto the food, making it a bit mushy and soggy. I noticed right away that the bamboo helps to prevent this from happening, my food was not mushy at all after using this steamer.Also, it's a definite bonus that this is a quick and easy way to cook. You really can just set it and forget it, the steamer does all of the work for you. This is great for me since during the week days I do not have a lot of extra time for cooking meals once I get home in the evening.

"We recently had a get together at our home and decided to give this ice bucket and tongs set a try.We were very pleased with the set, it kept the ice very cold for a long amount of time.

"This adapter was a lifesaver for me, and a simple solution to  the issues that I was having with my TV.Since it can handle full HD 1080 and 5.1 audio everything looks and sounds great when using this adapter. I have used other adapters in the past that really decreased the quality of the materials and it is nice to no longer have that problem. Since the box is a metal housing, it is very durable in case of getting dropped or knocked down from the entertainment center.I tried this out on my Blu-Ray player as well as my Nintendo Wii and it worked seamlessly with both of them. It did not overheat at all. I was worried that it may get hot after being used for a while, but it did not.

"This is an awesome set of mixing bowls that I absolutely love. I know, love is a pretty strong feeling for a set of mixing bowls, but hey, the heart wants what the heart wants.The thing that I love most about these is just how beautiful they are. The insides are a nice shiny stainless steel, but the outsides of each bowl are very bright and vibrantly colored. Each bowl is a different color, the green is my favorite by far. It's a stunning and brilliant true green color that is very eye catching.Since these mixing bowls are stainless steel, they are extremely durable and long lasting.  These are also dishwasher safe, so it is easy to clean up after using them. I personally prefer to hand wash my items, but it is nice to know that I could just toss these in the dishwasher if I wanted to on days that I am in a rush.I also love the fact that these are stackable.

"My niece loves playing with dolls and has quite a collection, but this one she has not been able to put down since it arrived.All summer long, my niece has been swimming in the pool, so she got a huge kick out of a this little swimmer girl doll that likes the same things that she does. She thinks it is really cute and fun, and loves that she comes with her very own pair of goggles to wear.The doll is very soft and plush, and her hair is made out of yarn. The yarn hair really reminds me of my old Cabbage Patch dolls that I used to play with as a child, so I think I love it just as much if not more than she does! The doll also comes with a book that has a cute story and some fun facts about swimming. We really enjoyed reading the book, and learning about swimming together.Overall, this is a very nice doll and I think it is a great way to either introduce a young child to swimming, or to help increase their knowledge and passion for the activity. I received one to review and will be ordering another one to give as a gift for the holidays.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I just recently started using a desktop computer again and realized that I did not have a mouse pad to use.Once this arrived in the mail, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it looks. It is a really shiny metallic silver that looks awesome against my bright white desk. Like anything metallic, it does have a tendency to get fingerprint marks on it after a while, but I have been able to wipe them clean very easily with just a damp paper towel.It is a nice large size (approximately 9in x 8in) that has plenty of room for me to move my mouse around. I hate dinky little mouse pads where the mouse ends up going off the edge when I use it, and that has not happened once with this one. The top of the mouse pad is very smooth, and the mouse moves easily. At first, I did notice there is a slight scratchy sound when moving the mouse, but now I barely even notice it.On the back side of the mouse pad, there are four little rubbery circles at each corner that helps to keep it in place. I have not had any troubles with it sliding or shifting at all during use. I received one to review and I am very happy with it so far. For me, this is exactly what I was looking for. It's got a nice modern look for it and really makes my desk look nice.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"If you are like me and get tired of wearing the same old Fitbit band, this is an awesome replacement set.The set includes 10 different colors, which I love. I can always grab the one that best matches my outfit and head out and about to get my daily steps in. Out of all of them, I think the white and the teal blue are my favorites. They are both really bright and vibrant, which best matches my style.As far as fit goes, these fit pretty close to the same as the standard band that came with my Fitbit. They are comfortable to wear, and I love the fact that they come with the extra silicone fasteners as a bonus. Fitbits are definitely not cheap, and I hated always having to worry about the band popping open and falling off while I was wearing it. The silicone fasteners just slip over the clasp and hold it in place tightly, so that I don't have to worry about that anymore. I received a set to review and these are great, I love having variety now and for the price you really can't go wrong!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is an awesome double sided tape for both indoor and outdoor use.I have a few things that I needed to put up outside, so the fact that this is waterproof makes it perfect for my needs. I first decided to give it a try by using it to tape up a wireless doorbell that I had, and it was strong enough to handle the weight with ease. I also tested it by taping up a small solar light that is used to illuminate the keyhole on my front door and it hasn't moved at all since I put it up, even with the door opening and closing constantly.The tape is very sticky and I did not experience any troubles with it at all. It easily held my items in place and is capable of holding a decent amount of weight. I received some to review and have been getting a ton of use out of it since it arrived. It's very handy to have around the house and I have found a lot of uses for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SU4Z03Z3PYL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3C8CBW#wasThisHelpful","R1SU4Z03Z3PYL3","A3AFF6XMHMG9TD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AFF6XMHMG9TD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear my Fitbit Flex every day without fail, so I have a ton of different bands that I like to wear and switch out.I honestly must have over 30 different bands that I wear and so far these are my absolute favorite! I LOVE the bright neon colors, the stock photo really doesn't do them justice. They are much more vibrant in person. Every time that I have worn on of these out, someone has stopped me to ask where I got such a cool and different Fitbit band.These have a really soft silicone feel to them, which makes them very comfortable on my wrist. They also close like a typical watchband, so I don't have to worry about them popping open and falling off when I am out and about anymore. I found the fit of them to be pretty close to the original band that came with my Fitbit as far as size goes.All around, I just can't say enough about how much I love these. I find myself reaching for them more than any other bands that I have now. I received them for review and I will be purchasing another set in the other colors too!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"My niece has a ton of stuffed animals that were starting to take over her entire bed and spill over on to the floor in her room.This set of toy hammocks have been a life saver and are a great way to get everything up off the floor and into one convenient location. I love that there are 2 nets included, she has a ton of stuffed animals and one just wouldn't have been enough.These are really easy to put up. They come with both suction cups and hooks, so you have a choice of how you'd like to hang them depending on where they will be and what type of walls you have. Since I put them up in a bedroom with traditional painted walls, I opted to use the hooks. It took me all of about 10 minutes to get these up on the walls and have them filled with plushy toys.Each hammock is made of a stretchy material and is 72 x 48 x 48 inches, so as you can imagine they can hold quite a bit. Her bedroom looks tons better now that there aren't stuffed animals everywhere. The room looks nice and clean thanks to these, and she can still take them down and play with them whenever she wants. I received them to review and I am thrilled with them. If you are experiencing a stuffed animal takeover like we were, then don't pass these by!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"My aunt and uncle drink a lot of wine during the holiday season, so this made a perfect gift to give to them for their anniversary this month.The wine stopper set comes in a really nice little black box, and includes a bottle stopper, a wine pourer, and a foil cutter. As soon as they received the gift, they decided to open it all up and put it to good use by testing it out. The foil cutter works great, it was so nice not having to hurt our hands anymore, so that is a definite plus.We also used the pourer, and the wine had a delicious taste to it, just as intended. Once we had our share, we used the bottle stopper to close the bottle back up and found that it was very simple and easy to use. It took just a few seconds, and the bottle was closed air tight.Overall, I would say this was a successful gift, as they seemed to be very happy with it. The only downfall was the fact that the box is missing a place to store the foil cutter, and it can be easily lost. If everything had a specific place in the box, that would be a lot more convenient. I received one to review, and think it is a great choice for any wine lover. It's inexpensive, and gets the job done. Thumbs up!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I wax and shape my eyebrows at home, and use a few different styles of tweezers during the process.One of the types that I like to use are the slant tip, because they help to grab the hairs when I am shaping. These have a nice feel to them, they are comfortable to hold and do an excellent job of grabbing the hairs. I love the fact that these are made of stainless steel, so I don't have to worry about them getting damaged or rusting if I set them down near my sink and they happen to get wet.These are a decent length and they close tightly, which helps with grabbing the short little hairs around my brow.

"My best friend does a lot of international traveling, so I decided to give this to her as a gift before her recent departure.She has been all over Europe for the past week and she told me that this little adapter works like a charm. She has been thrilled to be able to use all of her beloved electronic devices while she is traveling without having to worry about them not fitting into the outlets.So far I know that she has been using it to charge up her tablet, phone, and hair styling tools. The best thing about the adapter, according to her, is the fact that it can be used to charge more than one item at a time. This is super convenient and this way she doesn't have to waste a bunch of time waiting on things to charge up before she can go out exploring for the day.I am going to be traveling internationally myself in the future and now that I know this works so well I am going to order another one for me to take along on the trip.

"I am the type of person that always wants my teeth to be their whitest and brightest.I have had my teeth whitened professionally before and I have used a ton of different at home tooth whitening kits over the past few years, some great and some not so great. For me this kit falls under the great category.Right off the bat, I like that it has everything included that I need. It comes with syringes of whitening gel, mouth trays, and the activating light. The kit is super easy to use,  just fill the mouth tray with the whitening gel, pop it in and put the light up to your lips.I have sensitive teeth, so I am used to experiencing a bit of pain when whitening.  I did get a few zingers with this one, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle.The kit also comes with a little sheet that marks the different tooth shades. I have fairly white teeth to begin with, so my tooth color is pretty high up on the chart. Even still,  I did notice that my teeth were brighter and whiter after using this kit.

"This is one gigantic jar of coconut oil!! Luckily, that is exactly what I was looking for.I use a ton of coconut oil on a daily basis, for everything from cooking to moisturizing my hair and skin. I've tried a lot of different brands, some of which were extremely pricey, and I have to say that after using this for a while, it seems to be comparable in quality. For this price, you honestly can't beat it.If you have done your research, you will know that coconut oil comes with a huge amount of health benefits due to the high content of Lauric Acid. I prefer to use coconut oil in place of butter when I am going to be cooking something in a pan on the stove. Some coconut oil, this brand included will have the coconut scent and taste, which takes a bit of getting used to, but as a fan of coconut I do not mind at all and rarely even notice it once I have added the other spices and the food has finished cooking.I also use this as a makeup remover, a hair mask, and as my everyday moisturizer for my skin after I get out of the shower. My hair is super soft and manageable and my skin always feels nice and soft as well. I received one to review, and honestly I can say that I will be purchasing this again when I run out.

I have gone through countless charging cables in my lifetime, and this one seems to be super strong and durable, which is exactly what I need in my life.I have the 1ft cord, which is extremely short, but that is just what I was looking for. My adorable, yet pesky kitty has picked up a habit for chewing on my cords, so I wanted something that would only be long enough for me to plug in and set on my nightstand without any extra cord hanging off to tempt him. The 1ft length turned out to be perfect for me, I am glad that I didn't go with the next longest size, which I was considering at first.This cord is also designed to charge my devices quickly, and it definitely does. I love being able to plug my Galaxy in and have an almost full charge just over an hour later. Honestly, this cord is just awesome. It feels weird to be this passionate about a charging cable, but I just can't help it.

"I am always burning myself, whether it's in the kitchen, outside on the BBQ grill, on the living room fireplace, or in the bathroom with my curling wand. This glove has saved me from so many burns just in the short time since it arrived.I made sure to put this to the test as soon as I received it. I popped this baby on and went to work removing hot pans from the oven. The glove did a great job of preventing burns, I did feel a small amount of heat but that's to be expected when reaching in to a 350 degree oven. I was able to grab the pans quickly and easily and my hands were nice and safe.I found that for me, the glove was slightly larger than I would have liked, but I do have small hands so it may be perfectly fine for others. My husband tried out the glove as well and found the fit to be great on his hand. We are both right handed, but this glove is able to be used on either the right or left hands, so that is nice for those that are left handed.I personally have been using this glove the most for when I am getting ready and curling my hair with a curling wand. This offers awesome protection and is just what I needed. I can still hold the curling wand and manipulate it as necessary, but I don't have to worry about burning my fingertips when I am holding the hair against the iron.

If you are like me, and love to switch your case depending on your mood or outfit, then these are a great and inexpensive way to do that.These cases are made of gel and are very lightweight, which I love.

They do help keep the phone safe from bumps and scratches when it is in my purse or pocket, so I always keep that in mind and make sure to be extra careful when using these.The cases come in a pack with 5 different colors, and all of them look very nice on my phone. They fit the phone nicely, and I am able to access all of the buttons and use all of the features of my phone when the case is on. I received these to review and definitely will be adding these to my regular rotation of cases. If you are looking for a low cost way to change up the look of your phone, you've found it!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"My niece loves to play around with temporary tattoos, so when she decided to have a sleepover, I figured this would be a super fun thing for all of the girls to do together.As soon as I brought these out, all of the girls started oohing and ahhing over the fun bright shiny silver and gold colors of the temporary tattoos. There are a ton of different designs included, so there was plenty to go around and everyone got to pick out one or two that they wanted to try out.Once everyone had picked out their designs, I got to work applying the tattoos. They are relatively easy to apply, since I am experienced and have been using temporary tattoos since my own childhood. For the most part, these applied very well. There were a few designs that did not transfer completely, and a few that were very bumpy looking, but the kids didn't seem to mind or let it stop the fun at all.These are super shiny once applied, any light is going to reflect off them and bounce around the room, which the girls had a blast with. They are not incredibly long lasting, but they do have some pretty good staying power for the most part. I received some to review and I think they definitely were a fun addition to my niece's sleepover. These would also be great for Halloween or just for fun, thumbs up from me!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"When it comes to my clothing style, I am all about the comfort so naturally I spend the majority of my life running around in leggings and yoga pants.These are super comfortable to wear and I really like the way that they fit me. They are the 3/4 length, which makes them basically capris, and makes them great for wearing in the summer and fall seasons before the cold really starts to hit.Just as a frame of reference, I am 5ft2 and 180 lbs and the size large fits my waist nicely. They have a lot of stretch to them, and the band does not cut into my skin at all so I would say that they fit as expected.I find myself wearing these to workout at home and bum around the house on the weekends and I love them. They are a bit on the sheer side, so I really don't wear these out in public, though I could wear them under a dress or a long tunic that covers my backside and they would be fine. I received these to review and they have definitely become one of my go-to pairs of leggings. If they were a bit thicker, they would be perfect for me!I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"I have a lot of different cases that I like to use for my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, and this has been a very welcomed addition to my collection.The case is a nice gold color, that I really like. It gives my phone a nice, elegant look and I love using it whenever I am wearing gold jewelry or an outfit that has gold in it as well.The case itself is very lightweight, and offers a moderate amount of protection to the back and sides of the phone. While most cases have cutouts for the buttons on the phone, this case has the buttons built in. I found them all to be in the correct spaces, but I did have to get use to pressing the buttons a bit harder than if I was using the phone by itself without a case or with a case that has cutouts.Since this is not designed to be a heavy duty rugged style case, it is not going to offer extreme protection, however it does help to protect the phone from scratches and bumps.

"I wear my Fitbit Flex daily, and I have quite a collection of different bands that I wear regularly. These have been an awesome addition to my collection, and I have really been enjoying them since they arrived.These are very well made and I love the selection of colors. They are printed well, and the designs look flawless on every one. These also come with the bonus covers that help to keep them secure so that the clasps cannot pop open while you are wearing them. I really like that the covers are included since I have had more than a few of my Fitbit bands pop open on me in the past.For me, these are comfortable to wear and they feel nice on my wrist. The best part about it being able to grab a different one every single day. Now I always have one that matches my outfit, and that's a great thing.

"This is a nice and inexpensive way to add a bit of organization in your home or office.I love using these in my office as a way to keep myself on track for the tasks that I need to complete during my workweek. These are just peel and stick, so the application is super easy. These can be peeled off and re-positioned if necessary, without any issues. They also do not leave any type of sticky residue on the walls after they are peeled off, so that is a definite plus.I used the chalk set that was included, and found it to be a bit messy. There is a lot of fallout dust when writing, but that's nothing that can't be rectified just by purchasing different chalk from the craft store. The boards do wipe clean pretty easily also, which I like.  I received a set to review and find myself using them much more often than I expected. These would also make a great addition to a children's room and would be very helpful as a chore chart.

"I love using my cell phone for photography, so I was super excited to bust open the package and  give these little lenses a try.Once I got everything out and started to play around with them, the first thing that I noticed is that these are not designed to be used if there is a case on the phone. To use these, the case has to be removed first. Once I took my case off, it was relatively easy to get the lenses attached.I had a lot of fun playing around with these. I have to say that out of the 3, the macro lens is by far my favorite. The other two take nice photos as well, but they do seem to add a vignette effect, and I am a fan of cleaner looking photography without the shaded edges. The macro photos that I took really came out nicely, and I was able to capture quite a bit of detail.This is a pretty decent lens set, for the money it's a great value. I received one to review and I am having fun playing around with it. While I don't mind taking my case off now and then, I definitely don't see myself going through the trouble of taking it off and putting it back on every time that I'd want to use these lenses to take a photo, so for me this will be more of a once in a while type thing. My nieces don't always keep cases on their phones, so they are getting a lot of use out of it and find it to be very fun.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"This is a nice little mini humidifier, I really enjoy using this when I am working in my office where the air is much more dry than in the rest of the house.The fact that it plugs in to the computer or laptop via USB cord makes it super easy to use. It is very lightweight and portable, so it's no problem at all for me to take it from room to room depending on if I am using the PC in my office or if I am using my laptop and sitting elsewhere in the house.To use the humidifier, just fill it with water, pop the lid on top, and plug in the USB cord. It will run for two hours before the auto timer will turn it off. If it happens to run out of water before then, it will also stop so there's no worry of it drying out and getting ruined.The lights are very pretty and give off a relaxing vibe. I really enjoy looking at them when I'm working in the evenings and have the room dimly lit. This is one of my favorite things about the humidifier, actually. I received one to review, and I'm quite happy with the little gadget.

"With an abundance of electronic devices in my household, one can never have too many USB cords.This is a great, affordable cord that charges my devices quickly and without issue. The cord itself seems to be well made, and is a great value for the price. Since the cord is nice and long, I love being able to plug this in using the outlet behind my bed, and the cord still reaches so I can use it while I am relaxing and then I just set it on my nightstand to charge overnight while I sleep.This also fits into the connection port very tightly, which I love. I have had other cords that were too loose and would wiggle and damage the port, but there are no issues like that whatsoever with this one. I received one to review, and I'm very happy with it. Not too pricey, charges my phone and tablet and is just what I was looking for.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"Could this little doll be any more adorable? SO CUTE!Seriously. She even comes with little pom poms, which my niece really got a kick out of. I gave this doll to her as a gift, and she has been playing with it non stop since she tore the box open, which took all of about 10 seconds. She loves reading the book that it comes with, it's got some fun information about cheerleading and teaches children about how to have fun and live an active lifestyle by doing cheerleading.The doll is very cute and nice and soft and plush. She loves hugging her doll and has been dragging her to bed with her at night. The hair is a yarn style, which is very reminiscent of style my old Cabbage Patch dolls had when I was growing up. That style of hair is really fun, and great for learning braiding as well, which she has been doing. I received one to review, and it's been such a big hit with my sweet niece. I can definitely recommend this to anyone who has a child that is interested in cheerleading, or as a great way to introduce cheerleading to a child.I hope that you found this review to be helpful.

"If you have a little one that is interested in gymnastics, this is the perfect little doll for them to play with.The doll is really nice and plush, and it comes with a fun little story that teaches the reader all about the fun of gymnastics. My niece has always had an interest in gymnastics, so she really enjoyed learning all of the different facts and reading the inspirational storybook. It is written in such a way that even beginner readers would be able to sound words out and comprehend the story line.She really loved the feel of the yarn hair in her fingers, and loves how soft and cuddly the doll is. She has been carrying it around with her everywhere since it arrived, and is having a blast setting up a little cardboard gymnasium in the living room for her to show off all of Maya's ""routines"" that she made up.

"I've never been one that is too picky about the type of glass that I drink my alcohol out of, but my husband is.He SWEARS that the liquor tastes better when served in a nice glass as opposed to a cheap plastic, so I served him a few drinks in these so that I could ask him for his feedback. First of all, right off the bat he was really impressed by the quality of the glasses. He liked that they have a bit of weight to them, which makes them nice and sturdy. He specifically told me he was a big fan of the way that they felt in his hand.He has used whiskey stones before and was very pleased with the ones that were included in this set. The best thing about them is that the keep the drink at the proper temperature without watering them down at all. I received this set to review and am very glad that my husband will be getting a lot of use out of them.

"This is a really nice collapsible water bottle, I love being able to grab this on the go!I was a bit skeptical that this would really fold down as small as advertised, but when it arrived it was already compacted down and let me tell you - it is SMALL! This is just what I was looking for in a water bottle, I hate having to try to find extra space in my bag to take one along with me. Also, a lot of times, I want to go for a run and I know I will want to stop at the water fountain afterwards but do not want to have to carry a big bottle with me during the entire run. This one can fit in my pocket easily, and then I just fill it up at the fountain on the way back to the car. This is SUPER convenient.The first time that you use the water bottle, the instructions say to fill it with boiling water. Since the flexible bottle is a bit difficult to hold while pouring super hot water, I found that to be a bit of an inconvenience. The bottle is great otherwise, so it's nothing that I couldn't overlook. The spout works great and has not leaked. I received one to review and I will be purchasing a few more to keep in my gym bag and in the center console of the car so that I will have them when I need them.

"What a cute idea! My niece plays with a lot of dolls, so I was looking for something a little different from the norm and this was just what I had in mind.I really love that this doll also comes with a very cute storybook that she loves to read. The story talks about the different aspects of dancing and has a lot of interesting facts. My niece has always been interested in dance, but once she started playing with the doll and read the book, she couldn't wait to get signed up for some local classes. I love how this is helping her to take an interest in living an active and athletic lifestyle as she grows.This doll itself is very cute and very well made. She comes dressed in her little pink dance outfit and also comes with a backpack and towel to carry with her. I checked over the doll's clothing when it arrived, and from what I could tell the stitching was nice and tight and I could not find any loose threads at all.

"Boy has it been a looong time since I have played with a yoyo, but since these arrived I've learned that it is something that is still fun even as an adult. This set of yoyos is really nice and would make an awesome gift for any Star Wars fan.Everyone in the family has been having a blast playing with the for the past week or so. I am having a great time remembering all of the little tricks that I used to do when I played with yoyos as a child. The quality of these is very nice, and I have been able to do most of the basic yoyo tricks with ease thanks to the flared body shape, wide string gap and steel axle. As far as tricks go, the sleeper and walking the dog were always two of my faves as a kid, and my nieces and their friends were thoroughly impressed and have spent hours upon hours working on perfecting the tricks themselves.This is a really nice and inexpensive set that is a lot of fun and a really great way for kids to learn to yoyo.

"I am 36DD and purchased this in XLarge Blue.  Great value sports bra. The color is very pretty and the interior fabric is grey.  I like that the pads are removable and they are appropriately sized for larger bust (I hate when the pads are tiny in a larger bra.)  The pads are decently thick and will not have show-through.  The holes in the sides to insert the pads have a large enough access hole.  The band under the bust is comfortable and the entire bra seems really well-made.  I like that this bra does not dig into my armpits but it also has adequate side coverage to keep me from side exposure in yoga poses.

"I found the Jessica GELeration Start and Finish to be FAR superior to Gelish brand foundation and top coats.  The Jessica brand goes on smoother and thinner, does not pool at the edges of the nail bed, and dries without bubbles.  I have a LED light at home and do my own nails (for the most part.)  This brand is SHINY as a top coat (F Finish one).  The Start (S) coat goes on super thin, but it makes soaking off my nails MUCH faster.  It keeps the color coats from bonding to my nail and soaking with acetone, the color (from any brand) comes off in about 4-5 minutes (versus 10-15 minutes with a Gelish base coat.)

"These sleeves are BEAUTIFUL and are very high quality.  The seller was prompt with shipping and they are just as pictured!  So glad I snagged them at the discount and also glad I got the bigger pack!  I even used double sided tape and put a few on the inside of my planner to keep credit cards and stamps handy. (perfect size!)  Cards are easy to slide in and out, but they are not so loose they fall out.  The seller also offers them in CUSTOM prints, which would be cool to use your business logo and give to your employees for company business cards or to print family photos and give to members of family.

"I LOVE these shoes!  I am always a 9 or 9.5 and the 9.5 fit me best.  These can be worn with no-show socks and are the most comfortable shoes I own.  They kind of look like slippers, but are so comfy I don't mind.  I just came back to order my second pair.  I am a person who generally hates to wear flats because I get blisters and pain.  These shoes cause neither.  Also, I almost always get blisters on the back of my heel from this type of shoe, but this particular brand and model caused no blisters at all.  I prefer this model (PureFlex) to some of the other Sketchers shoes that have the weird monster-teeth looking bottoms.  These are the perfect shoe for the 2 months of the year in California where it is too chilly for flip-flops.

"I included a photo that shows the very fine strainer over the drinking hole.  The reason why I love this is that I can put lemon or orange slices in my bottle and not worry about getting a sip with a seed in it.  But I think what I like best about this bottle is that I can fill it (almost full) and FREEZE it.  The silicone allows for enough give and it is going to be perfect to use as an ice block in a small cooler (that doubles as drinking water after melting).  The caribeaner clip is not so useful for me, but I can see how some people would want it.  The silicone also passed the ""pinch test""...meaning that it does not turn white where pinched, but retains its color.  I have heard that this is the mark of high-grade silicone.  Overall, a useful bottle for anytime space is at a premium (travel/hiking/sports, etc).  It fits in my standard car cup holder too.

"To be fair, I actually love the shirts....(5'9""/36DD/165 ordered the 2XL). They fit great! But I hate that they use Photoshop on the colors. I ordered the envy green color and it is nothing like the photo. The actual shirt is a Kelly green (straight from the color wheel), not the light aqua pictured. I also ordered the yellow (banana cream) which is darker than the photo. I will say that I really like the shirts and they fit a little loose on me (which is what I prefer.) I also LOVE that the sleeves are a decent length. As another reviewer stated, these sleeves are long enough to be out of the ""cap-sleeve"" category (yay!)I am only giving 3 stars because of the color discrepancies.

"I live in an urban city so there are a lot of great Chinese food places around.  My favorite part of going to a great Chinese restaurant is the TEA.  I was never able to find anything remotely close until now.  I purchased the ""Lapsang Souchong Tea"" in the pale yellow and red package.  It is fantastic and actually tastes better than any I have had at a restaurant.  I brewed it a little too strong for my first cup (used about 1.5 Tbsp for 16 oz.) next time I will use a little less because it is so strong and flavorful!This tea needs a little space to bloom in hot water, so don't pack it into to one of those little balls.  Put into a large diffuser and you will be very pleased with the results!This Lapsang Souchong Tea is a black tea.  Much like traditional Chinese teas, it has a very crisp and clean flavor.  I can not wait to make some iced tea with this!!  I like my tea sweetened and found that the Teavana Perfectea Rock Sugar pairs well with this and does not distort the authentic Chinese flavor.  The only downfall of this item is the high price...I am afraid I will become addicted to this brand and will keep coming back for more.

"5'9""/160/36DD purchased the L and it fits great.  I think it actually looks better on me than the model.  This is a very flattering basic shirt if you are busty like me :)  The heathered coloring makes it look nice even after washing.  Will order another color.

"I am 5'9""/160/36DD and purchased the L in ivory.  I am going to exchange for the 1X.  In the photo I am trying on the L.  It fits fine except it is just a tad tight under the bust and the back of the shirt is about 2"" shorter than the front.  I think the 1X will fit me better.  The ivory color is BEAUTIFUL in person.  It is a nice warm toned ivory (with a hint of pink) and much nicer than the photo shows.  I might get another color as well.  Just love that this top feels like I am only wearing a tank top (zero heat retention) but covers all my problem areas.  In the photo, I am wearing a white tank underneath, the garment is completley sheer so you will need a tank underneath it. Hope this review and photo are helpful to your shopping.*sigh* so I had to edit my original review from 5 stars to 4.  I received the XL in Ivory and it is a COMPLETELY different color.  The XL is more of a band-aid beige and not near as pretty as the L color (even though both were ordered as ""IVORY"" -only difference was supposed to be the size).  So I will keep the L and wear white spanx under it....because I love the L color so much more.  One star removed for inconsistency in product line....other than that, a fantastic shirt.*update*--ordered a second color ""Floral Lace- Off White"" in XL.  Love that one as well.  Looks pure white (not off-white) and length is (sadly) shorter, but still a beautiful shirt.....I'm tempted to order the coral too. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7VZZQM1C1NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMJIQ8G#wasThisHelpful","RL7VZZQM1C1NU","AX84AFC7JX1I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX84AFC7JX1I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fits great as a TOP....not a dress.  Although I never expected it to fit like a dress since I am NOT 4'11"" and petite like the model....instead, I am 5'9""/160/36 DD and curvy.

"5'9""/160/36DD purchased the XL in Ecco Royal.  Color and fit are as pictured.  Please be aware this is JUNIORS sizing and would probably not fit as a loose-fit style anyone larger than me.  Sleeves are nice and long.  I might order another color.  Also, the ""ecco"" material has a washed, ""lived-in"" look to the material (slightly pilled, nubby) so if you hate that, look for something else.  I like the unfinished neckline and length.  Have not washed it yet and do expect it to shrink a little to the perfect fit. See photo.  I hope this review was helpful to you.**update** purchased in ecco wheat and ecco fuchsia colors as well.

"I do love the fit and color of this item.  However, I must have gotten a defective one.  I ordered the ""Grey Marble Fleece"" in XXL.  I am 5'9""/160/36 DD.  It fit great (a little loose, how I like it) and the sleeves were actually long enough for my tall frame.  However (very unlike the photo) the bottom seam of this garment is so wavy and sewn so poorly that I won't even wear it.  See my photo for the strange ripple in the fabric.  I really wish this would have worked and hope the vendor sends a replacement.  This is how it looked out of the bag, which would be ok I guess for a $5 sweatshirt, but not a $30 one.  Bummed.

"People were not joking when they said the sizing is off.... Based on reviews, I bought the shirt in 3x my normal size.  Normally I wear a large.  I purchased the ""midnight"" dark blue color with the seam down the front in a 3X....yes....3X (which I NEVER wear)....and it FITS!  I have exactly the same amount of ""slack"" as shown in the model photo.  For reference, I am 5'9""/160/36 DD and the 3X fits me.  I can't imagine anyone bigger than me trying to wear this shirt, it would look tight and ridiculous if I were any bigger.  Hope this clears up any sizing confusion.  Also, even though I ordered the dark blue color, it is still somewhat see-though.  The fabric is really thin and if I wear a black bra, you can see it through the shirt (so I will have to go with nude perhaps.)

"My pups really like this AvoDerm Duck food.  (Had a horrible experience with Taste of The Wild that made them very sick.)  When I switched to this food, my dogs immediately felt better and now that it has been two months, their coats are more shiny and healthy looking.  It sounds weird, but they actually eat less of this product because the ingredients are quality.  So The 22 lb bag of this lasts as long as a 40 lb bag of cheap food with lots of fillers.  This means they poop less and there is less mess to clean up.  Their energy is great and they free-feed because of my work schedule (so they eat whenever they are hungry).  Very happy with this food and love that it gets delivered right to my door.UPDATE:  Ordered the Trout & Pea Seafood variety for my third bag.  I had to remove a star because my pups don't seem to like that flavor as well.  If I put a bowl of the duck out and a bowl of the trout and pea, my dogs will gobble up the duck and let the trout and pea sit for a day before they eat it.  They seem to prefer the duck and the AvoDerm triple protein varieties.  I'll stick with those two flavors.  Overall,  great food made in California. <3","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D068D1D0ADKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CGL892#wasThisHelpful","R2D068D1D0ADKM","AX84AFC7JX1I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX84AFC7JX1I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased other shirts from MBJ that were sized differently.  For this shirt, choose your normal size (as expected).  I tried to size down and the shirts were too small.  I am 5'9""/160/36 DD and purchased a Medium.  I really needed a Large (the medium was too small in the chest, sleeves, and stomach.)

"If you have long hair, I'm sure you've heard that you should never brush it while it's wet. You should only comb it gingerly, fussing from the bottom up to remove the snags and snarls you get when you shampoo. On the other hand, you probably want to spend less than two hours detangling your hair.This brush is the answer that works for me. The bristles are firm enough to remove the tangles, but soft enough that they keep me from getting terrible and ugly split ends. I don't yank on wet hair of course, just brush it gently from the bottom. The many bristles do the work of detangling a bunch of hair at a time, which makes the job go faster. I have nearly waist length hair, and it takes me less than five minutes to detangle and brush my hair. My hair is very, very fine; so I can't say that this would work for everyone. But it works for me, and if you have very fine, long hair, I expect that it would work for you.The fact that there are two brushes is wonderful, and very necessary. That's because if you have another family member with long hair (as I do), that person will steal it in no time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4F5P3TFAK773/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI9VELE#wasThisHelpful","R4F5P3TFAK773","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this pulse oximeter because I am a severe asthmatic, and I don't always recognize when I need medical attention. For years, I had a pulse oximeter like they use in the doctor's office, which is the size of a paperback book and weighs about a pound. I got this one for my purse, because lugging around the big oximeter is inconvenient and it's impossible to take a reading without attracting attention.However, I was very concerned that this little guy wouldn't be accurate enough to keep me safe. After all, it cost me about 1/10th what I paid for the big ""hospital type"" oximeter (and that was used! My doc told me that what I paid was the deal of a lifetime) If you're using this to keep track of your stats while you're exercising, a percent or two reading that's off doesn't mean a lot. For me, a percentage point is the difference between treating myself and calling an ambulance.No fear. When I got this, I put it on one finger, and put the professional model on the next finger. They were exactly alike. At my next hospital visit, I compared this little guy with the giant cart model oximeter that also takes your temperature and blood pressure. Both had pulse and oxigen readings that were exactly alike. I now feel I can trust this little guy when I go out.Another nice touch was the purple rubber cover that came with the oximeter. It's not 100% necessary, but it will protect the meter from everyday bumps, whacks and squishes as it travels around in a purse or pocket. It also takes the writing of a Sharpie, so I was able to personalize my pulse oximeter. That way, it won't grow legs the next time I'm in the emergency room. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30C6GPPWNJDWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W294IUA#wasThisHelpful","R30C6GPPWNJDWN","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the most amazing little tools I've ever seen, and I don't know how I gave myself a manicure without them. They are little markers which have extra tips in one end, and a barely moist tip on the other. The barely moist tip removes any smudges you make when you polish your nails, leaving your cuticles and fingers so clean that it looks as if you never made any mistakes at all.I sometimes have shaky fingers when I'm applying polish, and there are sometimes smears and globs on my fingers after my nails dry. I've tried the suggested solution of dipping a cotton swab in nail polish remover and using that to clean your hands. But that doesn't work - the swab dries too quickly, and the bendy stick can cause problems all its own. This has straight acetone (the active ingredient in most nail polish removers), and there is enough in the body of the marker to remove any number of smears. After removing dark purple mistakes, I understood why they gave me extra nibs: using the dark purple nib to remove light nail polish would just make a mess.The package of five pens seems very generous. I had enough pens to give to a friend, my daughter and my Mom, and I still have two for myself.

"I never knew that one wasn't supposed to use polish remover to thin old nail polish until I read it in an article about the beauty things I was doing wrong. Gee - that's why it never worked well. I had always thought it was because the polish was old and nothing could save it. So I bought this - in the smallest possible container available. I saw offers for containers of up to a quart of thinner, which is hopefully more than I'd need in a lifetime! I'm sure that nail salons are glad for that option, though.I had a polish had thickened significantly and was no longer usable, although it wasn't to the point where it was solid. I figured that would be the perfect trial for this thinner. I opened the package and found a nail-polish sized bottle and a separate dropper with a screw-on cap that fits the bottle of thinner.I thre away the normal cap for the thinner, although on second thought, that probably wasn't the smartest thing to do - the dropper bottle isn't nearly as solid as the cap in preventing evaporation!Back to the thinner - it worked perfectly. Two droppersful were enough to make the old nail polish as thin and smooth as new polish, and it took no real time at all.

Unfortunately, with the way this product clumped, that's about the look I got - four lashes on the top and four on the bottom of the eye!The next day (yeah, I'm a glutton for punishment, but I do try to judge these things fairly), I used this product on my right eye, and opened a new tube of my normal mascara and used it on my left eye. By the end of the day, I got tired of hearing people ask me if I was all right. The Manga mascara made me look as if I had hurt my eye. It didn't smudge, it just looked ""wrong"" to the people around me.I have to give it three stars because it did what it said it would: it didn't smudge, didn't wear off during the day, and gave me a look just like the one on the package.

"The people at Belkin who designed this should be given heaps of praise for what I consider to be the excellent job they've done in designing this case. It adds full laptop functionality to your iPad Air without adding the weight of a laptop. (although this case is no featherweight)  After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned that this case would have connectivity issues, but that hasn't happened. If there were problems, Belkin has corrected them by now (June, 2015)For me, the most important part of this case was the keyboard. I was concerned that the keys would be mushy, rubbery or slow, or that the battery would give out every couple of hours. Not to fear - the keyboard had the same familiar feel I've gotten used to with the various Apple laptops I've used, and I can make it give you the same ""click"" I'm used to. Most of all, this keyboard had all the keys I have on my laptop, so I have no problem going back and forth between machines.There are three levels of backlighting on the keyboard, if you like working in a dark or dim room. I found it distracting, so I simply disabled it. The battery life is supposed to be a year, but I can't comment on that, since I've only been using it for a few days. But it doesn't die every couple of hours, as I feared - it keeps a charge long enough to get where you're going. (4 days). I prefer to keep the keyboard and the iPad together while I'm typing, but I tried to type this while the two were separated and had no problems.I love the two tilt angles. One is very comfortable for me, and is what I'll probably use most of the time. In the past, I've been stuck trying to get an acceptable angle with all sorts of things propping up the tablet. Having an angle to fit me is a huge benefit.I like the aluminum that this is made of (the case, not the keyboard). It's not too heavy, and should be very protective. On the day, hopefully far into the future, when I stop using this cover or the iPad, I should be able to simply drop the cover in my weekly recycle bin, and hold onto the keyboard for the annual ""computer recyclables"" collection. If reuse isn't an issue to you, then the extra weight this adds could be problematic. There are lighter cases out there.This isn't the least expensive solution to the lack of a keyboard on an iPad by a long shot. However, it has proven to be the least problematic, most useful solution I've found. The designers of this cover/keyboard made this with someone like me in mind, and for that, I am very thankful (and happy).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WO4F4DM4CLM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWE9ZDE#wasThisHelpful","R1WO4F4DM4CLM9","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book to review, and was not sure what to think before I got it. I made sure I didn't look up anything about the author or the book in advance, so I wouldn't make up my mind before reading. As it turns out, the author is a Presbyterian Protestant minister with four adult children, one of whom is gay. When that child ""came out"" to him and his wife, he began a spiritual journey to discover exactly what the Bible says about same-sex love. His first stop was the Bible, checking out the verses that appear to command Christians about homosexuality. (Anyone who has done the slightest research in this area will know these verses, as they are trotted out each time anyone wants to discriminate against gay people) Rev. Regele used the newest translations available, and began to read while keeping in mind the norms of society at the time each verse was written.At the beginning of the book, the Pastor asks nine questions of himself, ranging from whether homosexuality is biologically caused or is a personal choice to is same sex marriage acceptable from a Christian standpoint and whether being LGBT makes one ineligible for leadership in a Christian church. He then discusses each question as he sees it, then talks about the Bible verses that appear to discuss the question, and talks about the question in light to the place and time when it was written, and how the verse should be viewed today, in an entirely different time, place and political atmosphere.I believe that this book was written for two distinct sets of people: church/prayer groups looking for a text to guide them through these questions and how their church should handle them; and/or Christian parents of gay children. Fortunately, Rev. Regele has experience in both points of view. The book is organized in a way that discusses each question, then summarizes the questions and the answers to which he's been led in the last chapter. He definitely knows how strapped people can be for time, and even suggests which portions one can skip while still getting to the ""meat"" of the question.Rev. Regele includes copious notes and references, as well as the results of a survey that encompasses some of his questions. Even with all of this material, the book has been kept to approximately 260 pages (I read a review copy. The final book may be a little shorter or longer). It's not the kind of book you can sit and read in a couple of hours, though. I found myself stopping and reflecting after reading short sections, which is why it took me almost three weeks to read it.In the end, I don't think it matters which viewpoint you're coming from; this book isn't going to change your mind. It will give you a researched, well-thought out and prayed over view by someone who has more experience in this matter than most of us. I think it's a very valuable book for any Christian who is searching for answers about what Scripture is saying, although in the end, each reader is going to make up his/her mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCUE4TH6HZM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426798296#wasThisHelpful","R1WCUE4TH6HZM1","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spoilers ahead -- Please skip if you don't want to know!I got this book because the lead character and I are multi-generational residents of Quincy, MA. Her Quincy, of course, was fictional, and I live in the real world (or so it seems). However, the author has definitely lived here, because so much of her fictional Quincy collides with the real thing. Naturally, the story cannot match the real city in every way, but there are many remarkable similarities.The lead character, Mimi, was born in Quincy as one of seven daughters, her mother dying in childbirth. One child was sent to away to Ireland to be ""taught how to behave"" and never returned. Later, Mimi and her sisters learn that the missing child died of malnutrition in Ireland. Mimi has few memories of her childhood, except that she loathed her stepmother (brought in so her Da could raise his daughters after his wife died), because the woman was cruel. Mimi has some passing memories that the stepmother beat her and worse, but very little besides that. But one of her sisters grandchildren is doing a family tree for a school assignment, and therein lies the beginning of her troubles.  During the day, she cannot remember much of her family life hen she sleeps, she dreams of her now deceased older sisters prompting her to remember - remember everything.During the day, she has other problem: One of her daughters thinks she's got Alzheimers or is going broke and wants her to live in an assisted living facility. Two of her other daughters sided with her husband during her divorce (about which she is bitter), so she has mainly written them off. Another daughter refuses to speak with her, so she doesn't bother to try and start any sort of dialogue. And so on. Mimi has such rough relationships with both her daughters and her sister that I got confused as to who was who.The only bright spot in her life is her budding friendship with the janitor of her building, Dick Duffy, a WWII veteran who walks with a limp, but is otherwise oh-so-charming. They become friends (and perhaps more than that), but Dick has a secret or two of his own. While Mimi is remembering her own secrets, Mr. Duffy is trying to work out how he'll tell Mimi about his secret without losing her.The story winds up exactly as you suppose it will, with Mimi remembering everything, Mr. Duffy telling is secret, and everything is mostly resolved.Maybe. I found it charming at first that Mimi and Dick spoke quite formally to one another; but even after they slept together? Come on!Also, when exactly did this story take place? Some of the details are 20 years old: the Fore River Bridge, for example, was replaced by a ""temporary bridge"" and is only now being reconstructed, and WWII veterans are not in their sixties, but in their eighties. The price of real estate is current, however, as are some of the news stories. Ms. MacDonell is 100% right about the current state of the shipyard (formerly a major Quincy employer) I felt as if the story should have been set in the 1980's, where a 68 year old Mimi would really have been able to remember the Depression.I was left wanting more - how does Mimi reconcile her relationship with her daughters? She's ""okay"" with a couple of them, but that's it. And her possible strokes? Does she recover? She believes that the brain anomalies on her MRI will become happy swirls and rainbows, but I'd have liked to hear about some medical confirmation. Also, does she end up having to leave her home?","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SQFMY1QV09Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041546#wasThisHelpful","R1SQFMY1QV09Z4","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yummy. These apricot dices were moist but not gooey, and the flavor of fresh apricots sang out when I tasted them. I used the dices in a recipe for apricot nut bread, and the apricots stole the show. Then I used them in a spread with dates and pineapple.

"Secret Confession:  I love lace curtains, and nearly every curtain in my home is lace, or at least has lace underneath drapes. I spent some of my growing up in a part of Germany where everyone has lace curtains. They come in many, many varieties, and my Oma (grandmother) would gossip with her neighbor friends about who had nice lace, and who had the cheap stuff.When I saw these curtains offered here, I couldn't have been happier. We have a sliding door in our apartment that shows all of Boston Harbor, and lace curtains have set it off perfectly.  The floral lace is pretty, but shows enough of the Harbor that you can enjoy both. I swear it even cut the noise from the street a bit. The fabric is 100% polyester, and is heavy enough that the sun won't destroy them. The edges are especially well done with a heavy satin stitch accentuating the hem. I swear, Oma couldn't have found fault with them.I'm happy, too. Curtains that fit beautifully, will wear well, and are easy to wash (throw in machine with detergent and oxygen bleach.) I couldn't ask for more.

"Wow. I put off reading this book, thinking that the comics, anime, and Internet  stuff was just meant to be a publicity measure, and not a vital part of the plot.  I should have read it the moment it arrived from Amazon.  It's that good.The story begins with two somewhat unpopular new girls who become best friends by writing their own secret graphic novel, called ""Princess X"" Princess X is not your typical princess: she goes around with a samurai sword (almost), red Chuck Taylor high tops, and blue hair. She has many adventures, with Libby (the amazing, rich one) doing the drawing and May (the introverted, less than middle class one) doing all the writing. The girls kept a small portion of their things in their shared school locker and the bulk of their Princess X material in the large closet at Libby's home.Then disaster strikes: Libby's mother drives her car off a bridge and both Libby and her mother are drowned. May is inconsolable, and when she finally comes around to get their Princess X stuff out of Libby's closet, it's all gone! The maid (told you Libby was rich!) said that her father disposed of all the personal effects, then sold the house's contents and moved to Michigan with his new fiance. May falls into a deep depression which isn't helped by the fact that her parents divorce shortly thereafter, and May needs to move with Mom to Atlanta. (quite a way from Seattle, where the story starts out).A few years later, May is in Seattle, on visitation with her father for the summer. While walking along her old stomping grounds and missing Libby, she begins to see ""Princess X"" stickers and web sites that ask ""Who is Princess X/"" May is astonished, and begins to explore the case. She soon learns that everything she has been told about Libby's death is a lie.  She becomes obsessed with finding the truth.... And that's where I stop. I once wrote a couple of book reports for people, so I now only write down part of the plot.But I did find this book absolutely riveting, and I couldn't put it down until I discovered the answers for myself. I found out that there really is a Princess X web site, and lots more, and that the ""Internet Breaks"" are a real thing. The book I had first thought was hokey and juvenile is a great read. If you like being online, great friendships, and a cool mystery, this is just right for you. Anyone from a top reading level fifth grader on up should have no problem reading it, and for the parents, there is no gratuitous sex or violence.

"I LOVE this little guy, while acknowledging it's not 100% perfect. I own the big brother to this pressure cooker (the 8 qt.) and was delighted to see that they fixed one main problem: opening and closing the lid. While the other pot has a lid that supposedly tilts upward to see the food, it made the locking and unlocking function very difficult.  You had to have the heavy (and often hot) lid in the exact place, at the exact angle, or it wouldn't close, which is really important when using a pressure cooker.  I saw that this cooker allows you to easily open the lid, by trying it many times in my kitchen. If you are short, as I am, this is important because when the cooker is on your kitchen counter, you're doing all this at eye level, and hot steam is in your eyes.I wish that the manual came with a bit more of a cookbook. There are a very few pages of recipes and some ""helpful hints""  but that's it. If you have used a pressure cooker before this one, there will be far less of a learning curve. I was a complete newbie when it came to pressure cookers, so I started with some of our favorites: pot roast, soups and when they came our perfectly, I did a bit more experimenting. So far, everything has come out deliciously. If you've never used a pressure cooker and want a real treat, try some vegetables, setting the time for a few minutes less than you would in a microwave oven. The first time I did this, we even ran out of vegetables at dinner (a first).My other complaint with this pressure cooker is that the internal liner (where you cook all your food), is not stick resistant with a coating like Teflon(r). They have a nonstick coating on the outer liner, which makes it twice as confusing to have it missing from the inner pot. Food isn't supposed to touch the outer liner, yet it has a nonstick coating. (huh?!?) The booklet that comes with the cooker states that the pot has a nonstick liner, but it doesn't have one. Perhaps I got a rare and collectable un-coated pot, like those postal stamps that are printed upside down. (No, I didn't think so, either.)Despite this, the food that I've make in this cooker is delicious. Because none of the water cooks away, the food has a more concentrated flavor. It also means that you add almost no water when cooking. I just use the tiniest bit of water at the bottom of the pot, but not no water, as the pressure cooker depends of the higher boiling temperature of water when under pressure to work. That also means that you cannot overfill the pot, meaning six qts. is a maximum, even though you could probably add another quart or two to the inner pot liner. The water needs someplace to boil and convert into steam.It might not be perfect, but it's darned close, and I still love it.Edited to correct ""creative"" spelling and grammar.

"Great kit - a bottle of clear nail polish, one of a white-tinted matter underpolish, and the last has a blue cuticle conditioner. I've tried them all, and they all work beautifully. The clear one is an amazing nail protector. I like clear nail polish for daytime wear, and this is as shiny and pretty a clear as you'll find. It is also holding my nail together - one of them mostly tore off the other day and I tried putting another coat of the nail protectant on and using it as a sort of glue. It has worked perfectly, and no one knows which nail is torn - and I'm not telling!One gotcha - the writing on the bottles and the instruction sheet is almost unreadable because it is so tiny. This is because the package uses about four different languages on it, and it's not like a nail polish bottle is overly spacious anyway. I got out my glasses and a magnifying glass and it was fine.

"This is the scariest product I have ever bought for my dog. I had head rumors that if your dog was a vigorous chewer who would bite big hunks off the bone, a piece of the bone could become lodged in the dog's digestive tract, requiring surgery or worse. I wasn't worried, my dog is the opposite of a vigorous chewer, and figured licking couldn't cause a problem.WRONG! Something in the flavor of these things made my dog start chewing vigorously for the first time in his life. As soon as I saw that, about ten seconds after he got the bone, I screamed to my daughter to grab it from the dog. My daughter is an adult, but when the dog started growling and protecting his treat (another first), she backed right off. So, I had to grab the dog, who bit the whole top off the bone in one chunk right that second. Getting the long, unbroken piece of the bone was not too terrible, but the broken-off piece was something else.  The dog tried to swallow it, and I got my hand in his mouth. He was trying to keep the piece of bone and bite me at the same time. I had to try and give him the Heimlich maneuver and keep my hand from being that days' lunch at the same time.  Somehow, I got the big piece of bone out of his throat and I didn't get too badly bitten.If the dog had swallowed the piece of bone, he would have asphyxiated, no doubt about it.  That this bone would break so darned easily is a crime, in my opinion. IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOG, DO NOT GIVE HIM OR HER THESE TREATS! ""Healthy Edibles"" my left toe!

"Not that this is world peace or anything, but for a wire corner shelf, this is as good as it gets. Not only is the wire made of Stainless Steel, to prevent rusting, the design of the shelf includes a guard to make sure that what you put on the shelf, stays on the shelf. But the biggest deal are the ""suction cups.""  They make sure that the shelf you put in the corner of your shower doesn't come crashing down onto your toes on a chilly, dark morning.The key to making sure that this goal is met is to combine suction with a removable adhesive. It grips into the smooth, often glassy surface of a bathroom shower to hold tight. If you happen to have the more modern matte tiles, special squares of adhesive plastic are enclosed to make sure that you have the proper surface for the best adhesion of the suction cups.

"This book took me a while to get used to, mostly because of the protagonist's self-absorbtion.  Richard, the protagonist is a slacker and a user, but he's glad to describe all the flaws he sees in people. He accepts all all sorts of good things without even thanking his benefactors. Almost everything is due to him so that he might finish his thesis, and the project his father was never able to finish. Even in the face of horrendous tragedy, he thinks about himself, what he wants...I wanted to like this book. It is literary, intelligent, and integrates the third and last crusade of Richard ""The Lion Hearted"", King of England. The historical part the novel is the understandable and coherent part of the book. It's the other part, the modern stream of consciousness that the current Richard writes that is difficult.  I found the character to be totally unlikeable, even though he finds what he's looking for and is happy with that. When I finished the book, I asked myself ""Is that all there is?"" Even though I had read somewhere around 350 pages.I hope for the present day Richard that he finds the answers to the questions that haunt him, and that he does a better job than his father.

"I have long hair. REALLY long hair that ends about two inches from my behind, so a great conditioner is important to me.

It seems to have sealed all of my split ends (even though I cut off an inch or two every month or three, split ends are usually a fact of life for someone with hair as long as mine.But not today. I washed my hair with my normal Pantene shampoo, then used this conditioner, especially on the ends.  When I rinsed it off a couple of minutes later, it was astonishing.

My hair looks as if I never did anything with it but go to the hairdresser and let my hair glisten in the sun.I think I now have a new conditioner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWIOET2BEDEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM9XTQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1MWIOET2BEDEI","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What would you do if you were two seconds away from dying, and your mother said a secret spell to save your life? But this secret spell caused all sorts of evilness to be set loose in the world: blood raining from the skies, Death Walkers who try to eat souls, and worst of all (to you, anyway), your mother disappears and you're only twelve?Alex and his best friend, Ren, who is also twelve, are headed to London because they've heard that the blood rain is happening there, too; and maybe this is a way that Alex can find his mother. His cousin, Luke, is on the same flight, headed for athletic camp. Luke's parents are Alex's guardians, so the less Luke knows about this, the better. Luke has different ideas about being totally left out.And then they hear about people disappearing.This book is a great summer read for kids who are too old for Harry Potter, but want to read about magic, scary things and mysteries. I am a grown person and there are even a few moments where I jumped out of my chair! Danger and creepy things are around every corner. My advice:  never forget to be kind whenever you can! (What does that mean?  Read the book and find out!)It would be nice if you read the first book in the Tomb Quest series, but I didn't and I knew what was happening without a lot of guessing. But, getting the first book would make the rest of the series (all five parts!) make a whole lot more sense. The book isn't long, since I read it in an evening, but the author sure packs an awful lot of action in just a few chapters. Most kids between elementary and middle school up through middle school will like this, especially if their teachers hate it. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYOB2KMFFIR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545723396#wasThisHelpful","R3OYOB2KMFFIR6","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of years ago, I discovered this kind of kitchen towel, which isn't terrycloth, but dries plenty of dishes anyway, and leaves no lint. The cloth is thin, a little thinner than I'd like, because I want my kitchen towels to last for many years, not ""almost a year."" The description says that they are cotton-rayon (not my favorite blend) to 100% cotton. Still, which one is right?Before laundering, the towels started out at 19"" x 28"". The color was a bright red stripe on white (not the blue in the picture). After washing in warm water with Tide Free detergent, they shrunk significantly. (will edit when I find the tape measure again) However, I recently bought some tea towels that started the same size as these did, and after a few washes, those came in at 13"" x 20, and looked years old.These look great. I am not in love with the color red (especially when the towels were blue in the picture), but they only had minimal fading and minimal shrinkage. Unlike the other ones, I think that they should last in my kitchen a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LRX70QFZMQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMHPI0W#wasThisHelpful","R21LRX70QFZMQ4","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This makeup is perfect for oily skin, which is something quite amazing. It dried very quickly to an extremely matte but not 100% poreless finish. (I haven't found any makeup that gets rid of the pores on my right cheek) This comes close, though, and dries to a powdery finish. None of my facial oil showed, and I put it on unwashed, greasy skin the first time. It remained greaseless for hours, which is also pretty amazing. When I applied the makeup, it dried within seconds into a powder, and was somewhat difficult to blend. If I knew where I wanted it to be beforehand and applied it accordingly, it was fine.So, why did I give it three stars instead of five? Because of the color. The ivory I got matched my facial skin, for a few seconds.  Within a few moments of application, I saw the color change to a slightly orange cast, which is the exact opposite of what I want. It remained orange despite the fact that it remained completely matte and powdery. I was working and sweaty, which normally causes my makeup to shine and turn really orange.  It stayed the same color (slightly orange) Then, I put on a light coat of ivory facial powder, which hid the orange.Washing off the makeup was a dream. I used my normal facial soap and water, and it removed every trace instantly. If every foundation was this easy to remove, I'd wear it more often. Something that stays in place all day, yet removes with soap and water is very special.To me, having to add another makeup to hide the bad effect of the first makeup is a problem. But, if you can't find anything else that stays oil-free, then this would be an option.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAU4S53ADDP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCSX7U#wasThisHelpful","R1UAU4S53ADDP1","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To understand this book:Lettice Knollys and Beatrice are two separate people. One existed and one is the star of this book. I should have said that at the beginning of each chapter!Queen Elizabeth I of England had many companions/maidservants around her at all times. If unmarried they were called her Maids of Honor, if married, they were Ladies in Waiting. The Queen was never left alone - she even had a Maid or a Lady while she slept, sleeping with her on a trundle. Many teens at or approaching marriageable age would spend some time as a Maid of Honor as a kind of ""finishing school"" that not only polished their manners, but also let them be seen by the People That Mattered and hopefully enabled them to find a rich, titled husband. That last bit was the supreme prize. If he was not a total scumbag was icing on the cake. A decent looking and kind man was more than could be dreamed for.Beatrice Knowles is a Maid of Honor, and the protagonist of this story. She is bit of a flirt, and is able to get any guy to spill his guts. This is _very_ handy skill at any time, and priceless beyond imagining in Tudor England, where people would keep their secrets while being tortured. Beatrice is about to wind up her service to the Queen and marry her intended, a Lord Cavanaugh. Before she can skedaddle, all hell breaks loose between England and its feisty neighbor to the North, Scotland. The wedding is put on hold, and the Queen sends Beatrice to get all the dirt she can get from Alasdair McLeod. Because this is a historical romance, you can probably guess what happens.I really enjoyed this book, despite the formula must use to become a historical romance. The action moves swiftly, and many of the real Maid of Honor and Ladies in Waiting weave in and out, interacting with our two fictional characters. Real events are included as well, like England and Spain's ongoing hatred of one another. The problems that England had in switching from Catholicism to the Anglican Church are well treated and the struggle the Queen had in forcing her subjects to view her as their conduit to God.The biggest problem I had with the whole book was that I kept mixing up Beatrice Knowles with Lettice Knollys, a real cousin and Maid of Honor to Queen Elizabeth. I have read extensively  about the Elizabethan court, and when Beatrice did something I kept thinking, ""Lettice didn't do that, she married Robert Dudley in secret and was banished for life by the Queen.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQ6X51WDBWW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442441410#wasThisHelpful","REQ6X51WDBWW0","A3S15YGZ6W6EV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S15YGZ6W6EV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great features, OK look.***Update 8/30/15****After having it for a couple of months, I've grown pretty bored with it. For a Double-Din it really does have a lot of empty face space.2 other issues that I have are faint LED lighting and the volume being pushed in for Menu.For whatever reason (and I've seen others say this on their reviews), the LED on both the keys and the face go very dim. And they do that randomly. Checked my Dim setting while it was like this and it was maxed out.When it does look normal and it's sunny outside, forget about it, you're not even going to see the clock. The color variations are nice and prevent early bordem, but still, in this 2015 they won't put animation on it?!? I feel like this would be seen in my car back in 2000.

What's pathetic is that neither Pioneer nor the Chevy dealership could tell me what the problem was. I can tell you that THIS was the solution. If you have a vehicle that has its radio and doors sync'd together, but this harness with the interface bus. This should be something that needs to be explained. Hope this helps someone. I spent an extra $38 b/c of this, plus I also need to use the after market plug in the original harness for the new CD player.

"Yes, this is a great classic game. Same Tiger Woods but better than most. I'm not going to give it 5 or even 4 stars, however. This is because of the annoyance, repetitive, and sometimes inaccurate features of the game.I had been playing Tiger '08 for a few years and got bored with it. Saw the reviews on all Golf games and this came out best. Graphics have improved (even though when you're playing through a windy front 9 the wind somehow blows the tree truck the same as the leafs). Tiger Challenge has also improved. I wouldn't say it's more challenging than most, but you don't have to worry about finishing Bronze, Silver, or Gold in events anymore. Was pointless anyways.You'll have Tiger's  caddy as your golf pro trainer. I thought this would be cool, at first, but quickly realized that this was a pain in the neck. I'd say after every other event, they demote your built up attributes for pretty much no reason, then make you do multiple practice challenges to re-lift your attributes for Power, Accuracy, Short Game, and Putting. NO Power Boost or Spin attributes anymore. It's already provided when playing (which is a good thing). But the worst part about this training is that it doesn't matter if you played a tournament going -50. It'll still demote your attributes. You can hit the ball off the tee, hit every fairway, and average 370 yds and still, he'll tell you that your power isn't where it should be. It is VERY frustrating. That's really the only bad part of the game. If they made that part more accurate and less predictable and unfair, it'd be a 5-star game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U40JVMVRR1RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00164TDUC#wasThisHelpful","R3U40JVMVRR1RL","A3OKAEM5C3OFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OKAEM5C3OFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The kids, ages 3 to 8, played with these briefly when they opened the package but the interest didn't last more than a few minutes.  They got the Play Doh ""bin"" out, and the 3 year old was interested in filling in the molds on the outsides of the fighters.  None of the kids thought much of the Can-heads.  The kids like Play-Doh and on a rainy day, all three will play well together for easily over an hour so the lack of interest was in the product.

"Depends upon use.  This is a good value, perhaps the ""best"" value for most applications. One star off for ""wimpy when wet.""I compared four brands of ""paper towels.""  Sellars (blue) shop towels from Lowes.  Kroger brand 2 ply.  Bounty 2 ply and the Georgia Pacific Sparkle Professional Series 2 ply.  The texture, overall feel and weight of the Sparkle, Kroger and Bounty are very similar; close your eyes, you can't tell them apart.  The blue shop towel is softer, no embossing, but actually weighs twice as much.  No idea what makes this ""Professional Series.""The postal scale weight for similar sized towels (had to cut the Kroger brand down a bit to be comparable) was 2 grams for the Sparkle, 2 grams for Bounty, 3 grams for Kroger and 4 grams for the blue.  I put each towel in water, held it up until it stopped dripping and put it on the postal scale.  Sparkle 16 grams, Bounty 32 grams, Kroger 26 grams, blue 40 grams.  No idea if that's any kind of valid test, probably depends upon what you need it to do at the time.  To be blunt though, the Sparkle is ""wimpy when wet,"" wad it up, it fits on a table spoon.It gets complicated because the towels differ slightly in size, number of sheets per roll and of course price.  Bottom line, all things being close to equal, Sparkle and Sellars Blue Shop are very close in price. Bounty is about twice their price but Kroger is only about 20% higher.  There are 85 Sparkle towels on a roll, 48 Bounty and 103 Kroger ""half sheets"" (closer to 2/3).  The Sellars Blue Shop are the overall best buy based price per sheet and being a clear absorbency winner, but you're probably not going to put those in your kitchen.  Kroger comes in second because the price is slightly more than Sparkle, but it's more absorbent and isn't ""wimpy when wet.""  If absorbency is your only measure Bounty comes in second on a dollars per gram of absorbency measure.So, where does that leave you... my guess is in most applications a paper towel is only fractionally consumed so ""efficiency"" isn't particularly relevant and occasionally grabbing a second or third towel is more than balanced by the lower price.  For general use, this Georgia-Pacific's Sparkle brand is a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYN7U5N0W7A5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q271IQK#wasThisHelpful","RYN7U5N0W7A5Y","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing, of course, is the appearance.  Rugged with molded, protective corners all around and an undeniable sense of bulk.  Nothing streamlined.  It looks like a military grade paper shredder. It rolls more smoothly than anyother luggage I’ve experienced. The wheels are partially recessed, which, according to Tumi’s literature, provides “a more spacious interior compared to bags with surface mounted wheels. “  That may be true for two bags with the same overall height. The handle is really smooth.  A relatively large, rigid, plastic briefcase hook is included.The interior is divided into two compartments separated by a zippered cloth panel that opens all the way out.  This is a major differentiator; this Tumi zippers more-or-less down the middle, rather than along one edge.  When you open the bag, you get two halves rather than a “container with a zippered lid.”  The 2” expansion may be useful; the only time I’ve taken advantage of that feature is returning with souvenirs from overseas.Inside, there are two, nearly full length zippered, tie sized side pouches that also hinge along the sides as well as various straps to hold things in place.  There’s also a clothes hanger strap that appears to be designed for a Tumi hanger (2 for $35, not included).  There are full sized, zippered compartments in both halves as well.  The interior is highly functional. One zipper pull was missing, easily resolved with a small nylon zip tie.I’m a frequent traveler and I still have and occasionally use my much repaired original 1990 vintage Travelpro Rollaboard.  I compared this new Tumi to three other carry-ons we have.  The spec says the Tumi is 11.2 lbs and that may be accurate but it weighed in at 11.8 lbs. on the office postal scale.  Not quibbling, just noting that I weighed the other three bags on the same scale.  The original Travelpro came in at 10.2 lbs and the newest Travelpro was 7.9 lbs.  The 3 pound difference may not matter most of the time, but in the US carry-on bags are limited to 40 lbs. and overseas I’ve been on flights where the baggage limit was 15 kg. (33 lbs.) for domestic flights and paying a weight penalty was not an option.The next issue is the size for a carry on.  The spec says 24” X 14” X 9”. The 24” and 14” dimensions are accurate, but you’re going to have to sit on the bag to get it down to 9”.  Freestanding, without the 2” expansion, it’s 10”.  Even at 9” the linear sum of L+W+H=47, which is more than the 45” limit on some airlines (i.e. Delta). Other airlines permit the sum to be as large as 62 (i.e. Southwest).  Most US airlines have a 22” “official” limit on the long dimension and the Tumi exceeds that by 2” so theoretically could never be carried on. But if you travel much, you already know that the rules are rarely enforced in the US and the overheads may be so full there isn’t room even if the bag will fit in the compartment.  This bag will simply not fit in some overheads though; that’s why I still occasionally travel with the original Travelpro.  On regional jets it’s going to be checked anyway. For reference, the original Travelpro is 8.5” and the newer version is 10” and the original’s length is 24”, the updated version is 23”.The main functional feature of the bag is the way it opens into two halves, rather than one compartment with a lid.  It is large enough, exceeding most formal limits for size, that every boarding will be a crap-shoot as to whether it will fit or have to be checked.  Tumi is Tumi, it’s inherently pricey and you expect it to last.  The risk is, and it is discussed periodically, a single, enforced standard for carry-on baggage across all carriers.  The problem is that the proposed standard is so small, we’ll all need new luggage anyway. The warranty is 5 years.5 stars for functionality and execution.  I considered deducting a star or two for size, but between regional jets and full aircraft, carry-on is only a probability, not a certainty anyway.  Don’t be surprised though if you have to check this bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZ3LRBQ7I7CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCHS5A8#wasThisHelpful","RNZ3LRBQ7I7CL","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautifully executed watch, especially at that price point.  The bezel is real, inside the crystal, and rotates smoothly.  No stamped sheet metal on this watch like so many others, some even more expensive.

"Bought 1, then a second after seeing the results.  With four Energizer lithium AA batteries and a 32 G SD card, the camera will run for a year on the 5 minute (no night pics) setting.  Amazing.

There are lots of options if you only need a system to work for a few hours, but when you're interested in documenting days, weeks and months, it gets bulky and messy.  It's a very wide angle view and understand the resolution is low, so you will generally not be able to identify people you don't know; if you need a high resolution image, this isn't your choice.I have these set up monitoring the exterior of a remote cabin.If you're mounting outside, using the clear housing and expect rain, I recommend polishing the lens area with Rain-X or something similar.

"For non-medical, light use, disposable gloves the question is vinyl or nitrile? I""m sure there are cases where chemicals will dictate which is better, but the ""disposable"" class of gloves are all thin, not for rugged use. Either vinyl or nitrile are far more durable than latex. Vinyl is either side of half the price of nitrile though both are cheap enough.  Nitrile provides a little more dexterity and is better for fine work.  I use vinyl for things like oil changes, handling the occasional dead animal in the yard and applying oil stains.  I use nitrile for finer things like cleaning small parts and oiling the grandfather clock.  Mostly vinyl in the garage, nitrile on the work bench.These Ammex gloves go on easily, contain no contaminating powder and are more than reasonably durable; I don't have to worry about a tear during an oil change for example.

So, at times this is a bit of a slog, but worth the effort.One short, and incomplete example from the classic ""faith without works"": ""Another rhetorical question begins 2:20, this one addressed to the hypothetical interlocutor as 'vain human.' A certain play on words is evident in Greek because the word for 'vain' (Greek word, kenos) also means 'empty.' The one who claims to separate faith and works is an 'empty human' because he or she has an empty faith, just as a body without a spirit is empty (2:26).""

"Spoiler Alert.  This is part SciFi part ""espionage.""  It lost three stars for one reason, it stopped; it just stopped.  It's as if the author just decided not to write any more.  Of course, this could be part one of a series but even at that, the active characters need some kind of resolution of their current circumstances and sitting on the beach looking up at distant sniper/guards isn't much resolution.  No resolution for one of the key characters, this book just stops.  There isn't even some tickler, a hint of direction, anything that would want you to pick up the next book in the series (if there is one).  As others have observed, the characters aren't compelling, largely stereotypical, no one is particularly unique.  Spoiler alert... the simple plot is some type of alien craft broke up into three pieces and crashed on earth in the early 1900's.  The Russians have a piece, the Americans have a piece.  The Russian piece calls home to a moon of Jupiter.  The Americans in an alien ship chase the Russians with an adapted alien drive to Europa, the moon.  It doesn't work out well and some of the Americans and one Russian make it back to Earth with nothing but their lives and a lot of questions.FWIW., I bought Starfire because I read a couple of Larson's ""World"" books; they were much more interesting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJB01XL33XJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150554453X#wasThisHelpful","R2IJB01XL33XJF","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is first a standard, full face over-the-nose balaclava, with hook-n-loop patches on each side.  The ""heat exchanger"" piece just wraps over the top, an overlay that wraps around to each side. So when you're breathing, you are doing so through first the cloth balaclava, then the heat exchanger, so moisture collects on the balaclava cloth as well as in the heat exchanger.  The overlay is very stiff, I can't get it to conform to my face comfortably.  It does not work at all well with goggles, it mounts too high so goggles can't seal.  I'll keep it for the balaclava and trash the overlay heat exchanger.  No idea whether the heat exchanger works, it's a small piece of very open cell plastic foam which wouldn't seem to have any inherent ability to work as a periodic flow heat exchanger.I have an older PSolar product, apparently no longer manufactured, similar in concept, but the heat exchanger is actually built into a mesh pocket stitched into the balaclava so the flexible fit is provided easily by the balaclava and works more successfully with goggles.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYABL6JCA35A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091CC38A#wasThisHelpful","RYABL6JCA35A5","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works as advertised, but for most applications no need to worry about linking it to the garage door.

"This is big enough to easily apply serious torque if you have to without pain.  Easy to adjust.Some things are just too important to guess at.  My most consistent use is final torque on all the lug nuts when I change out the snow tires twice a year.  That means both the OEM lugs AND their proprietary ""key"" wrenches. You don't want to torque down lug nuts with an impact wrench and you don't want to over torque ""key"" wrenches (like keyed Gorilla lugs or McGard keys), you might stretch or break the studs or wreck the key, but the more likely problem is getting a flat on the road and having the dinky lug wrench that comes with most cars.

"Understand the title, the book is true to its title, it is not a comprehensive book about debt resolution. Read the book and you may recognize an un-fair practice, but you can't stop it, and you may be at risk if you ignore it.Short book, 55 pages that with different formatting might have been 30.  Debt is complicated, but the book offers and adequate overview.  Covers some absolutely critical points, such as ""are you really responsible for the debt"" AND ""is the debt collector legitimate.""  One essential admonition, get a signed contract BEFORE you pay a cent.  Second, make sure the collection agent is in fact authorized to collect and representing the principal.  Third, you have to make sure the paperwork covers you or you can pay and it won't be over. You might even pay the wrong person, effectively throwing your payments away.  The point again is, that in the context of the scope of this book, un-fair debt collection practices, a collector may not even have a legitimate interest.Also, the author point out that most debt is settled for a fraction of the original amount.You need a lawyer or you'll get screwed.  It doesn't have to cost $ thousands.  Read this book and you'll understand why you need the protection a lawyer can provide and in the end, the lawyer's fees, one way or another, will come out of what you owe unless you're in a weird situation, either way there's a heads up in this story.  The collection agents are bottom feeders. The book doesn't push for hiring legal help, but there's too much paperwork that has to be right; you have to be skilled in this stuff or you'll end up paying and still have people chasing you.  The book doesn't explain how it can happen, but once a debt goes to ""collection"" there's a possibility that some how the same debts will end up with multiple collectors and they don't talk to each other.I've had a cell phone for almost two years that was previously owned by someone who obviously owes many people money.  At least two collection agents call a week.  Whether they're convinced I know the debtor, or just think they can intimidate me into paying something to make them go away, no idea, but they can be ugly.  The collection agents call from all over the world, thought they always show up as US phone numbers.Major criticism, and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars, if you're facing un-fair debt collection practices, the book will tell you how to recognize them, but doesn't offer any effective tools to stop it.  You'll know what they're doing is illegal, immoral and unethical but knowing it doesn't much help, they're not going to change.  For example, most states actually have laws on the books that say a collector can't threaten to do something they either can't do, or don't plan to do.  So they can't threaten to take your retirement.  But there's no penalty in law if they do make the threat.The book deals with consumer debt, but doesn't mention taxes, so if you owe taxes this doesn't offer a perspective.  Second, it doesn't emphasize the differences between states or the feds for example.  So if you read the book, you might assume a debt more than 7 years old isn't collectible.  Ohio though, as one example, has the longest statute of limitations on debt in the country, 15 years and the Feds are usually 10 years.The book avoids the issue of bankruptcy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IC9IHLHY9XJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT0N138#wasThisHelpful","R2IC9IHLHY9XJC","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fascinating and effective tool.  Easy to use.  The transducer/microphone is built into the handle of the alligator clip, connected by wire to the small numbered box.  The box is mostly 4 AAA batteries.  So you apply the alligator clip to whatever you want to evaluate and go for a drive, and mount the sending unit with nylon zip ties, the built in clip or built in magnet.  Switching between sensors is as simple as pushing a button.  If your vehicle has an ""aux in"" port on your radio, you'll need a patch cord and it's really easy then to listen over the radio, rather than a headset.Some noises sound as you'd expect although amplified.  If you clip to a brake caliper, you'll hear the sort of grinding noise you'd expect.  Other noises, like a clicking when mounted to an axle control arm, aren't so easy to interpret BUT it is easy to know that the sound is indeed coming from something directly connected to the control arm and that's the power of this tool.Sometimes for example, when you're driving you think an unexpected sound is coming from the front of the car, but in fact it's coming from the rear or the other way around.  A friend had an old Honda with a noise he was sure was coming from the right rear so I drove while he rode along side on a bike and it was clearly right front.  With the ChassisEAR, it takes only a few minutes to narrow the source, no need to ""run"" along side.  Some noises are so intermittent they're probably impossible to find any other way.Most recently we traced the source of a ""thunk"" to the inside of a strut, and it turns out there's a service bulletin on the strut.A couple of other reviewers have commented on problems with feedback or extraneous noise, but we haven't experienced that.Biggest surprise after using this is that it's only $200. Comes in a sturdy, roomy case.For convenience, you might want to buy a package of releasable zip ties such as Monoprice Releasable cable tie 6 inch 50LBS, 100pcs/Pack - Black (Amazon)to mount and unmount the sending unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PKD1ER5QNSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00123J79O#wasThisHelpful","R30PKD1ER5QNSV","A1C5TCCR2IGKBU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C5TCCR2IGKBU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was excited to try this little speaker out.  Something nice and compact would be a great feature for the ultimate in portability.  Unfortunately, the sound was so shallow and flat that I could not get through a whole song.  Only part of the mids and mostly highs were audible and bass was non-existent.I will say that there is one area in which this little speaker excels is with voice reproduction.  I'll sometimes listen to a sermon, audio book or even stand up comedy and it was able to reproduce and carry the sound of these types of audio fairly well.For the price, you can't expect the moon, but if you are buying this for music, I would recommend spending a few more dollars for a decent bluetooth speaker better suited for music.

"I've tried a few different bluetooth headsets and haven't found the one I'd call a complete winner, however, these nudge out the others as my current favorite.  I'll list some of the pros and cons below:Pros:- Controls built into earpiece.  Other headsets have the controls on one of the wires which tends to pull the earpiece out when you are walking.- Earpiece stays in reasonably well.  My ears are usually pretty hard to fit, but I like that these use two methods of securing the earpiece.  First the grommet that goes in your ear and then using a flap that you can tuck in your ear for additional support.- Decent sound.  The 'overall' sound is pretty good, but it does tend to fall apart when there is punchy bass.  Other than that, it has sound as good as my old trusty Sony ear buds.Cons:- Controls are not intuitive.  There are a lot of speakers and head phones that utilize 3 buttons where one will play/pause and the other two advance tracks and adjust volume depending on if you long press or short press.  My preferred sequence is (+) short press = advance track, (+) long press = increase volume, (-) short press = rewind track and (-) long press = decrease volume.  These use short presses for volume and long presses for tracks, which I can deal with.  The odd part is that (+) increases volume, but rewinds the track.  (-) decreases volume, but advances tracks.  It just seems reversed and I don't know if I'll ever get used to it.- The plastics and button presses feel a little cheap.  Kind of a subjective comment, but it just didn't have the smooth button clicks that I prefer.Overall its a decent set of bluetooth headphones that can get you going if you need a set for working out at the gym without breaking the bank.  There are probably better options out there, but it will also cost you more.

"I love the look of Edison bulbs, it just ads a great atmosphere for your vintage themed rooms.  LED is also a great thing of the modern era that gives you decent light for little energy.  Now this particular bulb makes an effort to combine the old and the new.  I really wished it worked for me.  Functionally, the bulb works fine.  It gives off a fair amount of light and is energy efficient.  Where is falls short is in style.  One of the most interesting aspects of the Edison bulbs is the long filaments that run up and down the bulb.  Not that an LED version would not work, but I feel it should make some effort to imitate this look.  This appears much like the product photo (unfortunately) with a bunch of little dots.  The shape of the glass is only part of the overall look.The color temperature was also not very warm.  Certainly not as warm as pictured.  If I were decorating a vintage themed room, I just would not feel comfortable making this bulb a part of the decor.I will add that if the bulb will be at a distance, then the LEDs tend to run together and its not as obvious, but if it will be close (hanging over a bar or table) then the little dots will be easy to see.

"If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker right now, I bet your head is spinning.  With the sea of 100s to choose from, where do you start?  I myself have test driven a handful of them and was happy to get to try this one.  When I look at a new speaker, I try to break it down into several aspects, which I'll touch on below:PORTABILITYThe Sinoband S400S is not the smallest speaker on the market, so if you are looking to stick this thing into a jacket pocket or small purse, move along.  This is a good size, though, to toss into your backpack or even clip it on with the included lanyard ring.  The included oversized stuff sack also makes it a little easier to grab and go.  Given the sound and included power bank, its really as small as you could wish for with all the included features.FUNCTIONALITYMan, does this speaker shine on functionality: Bluetooth w/NFC, large battery which doubles as a power bank, handsfree voice calling, Aux input and rugged, weather resistant construction.  There really isn't anything more you could ask for with regard to pure function.SOUND QUALITYWith regards to sound quality, its probably one of the cleanest and crisp speakers I've tried.  I like to listen to acoustic and singer/songwriter type music and the mids and highs are so clean.  With such emphasis on mids and highs, the bass is not the strongest, but I've got a love/hate thing with bass.  I see many speakers making bass their big claim to fame.  I think people are fooling themselves if they think a hand held speaker is going to give them thumping bass.  When bass is the dominant range, sound tends to be muddy in these smaller speakers.  I, for one, am happy Sinoband took the ""high road"" and concentrated on clean sound rather than bass Bass BASS!  There are nice bass tones to keep the sound well rounded and full sounding, just not this annoying thumping and bouncing that some people seem to crave.SOUND VOLUMEThis speaker falls somewhere in between the quietest and the loudest speaker that I've tried, but it gets plenty loud enough for a medium sized room to jam out.  The loudest speaker that I have is a 15 watt speaker that gets absurdly loud and I never get near its max volume.APPEARANCE / DESIGNI have both plain jane and crazy busy looking speakers and, again, this falls somewhere in the middle.  The honeycomb design gives it visual appeal without getting ridiculous with swirls, zig zags and colors.  Have you ever thought of a speaker as ergonomic?  I haven't until I picked up this speaker.  It fits comfortable in the hand if you decide to just carry it and the rounded corners and rubberized exterior make it easy to grip.  Finally, there is a flat spot on one of the corners so you can either lay the speaker flat to fire forward or on the corner so it fires up and a 45 degree angle.  This was nice when I set it in my passenger car seat and wanted the speakers aiming up towards my head.In summary, I really like the Sinoband S400S and would go so far as to say its currently my favorite speaker.  I received a complementary unit for review purposes, but my opinion provided above is unbiased and would recommend to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6LSBRPIIVKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31YV9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6LSBRPIIVKA","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These locks are primarily designed for your luggage, even though it states other uses, I would not use this on a gym locker or other use due to durability.  So why still 4-stars?  Because luggage is inherently easy to ""break into"" when all you need to do is pop the zipper with a pocket knife or screw driver.  I view luggage locks as a deterrent for the opportunist crook that does not want to make a scene.  For that, these will serve their purpose.  I tried to twist and break the case with my bare hands and, while there was some audible cracking, I could not do it.  Given the plastic case though, I don't think it would be too difficult to break it open with a flat head screwdriver.

"I was anxious to try the diffuser soon after it arrived due to the simple design and shape since most diffusers can be a little too taste specific.  The first thing i noticed was that the power cord was merely a USB adapted cable.  This could be a plus or minus.  For me, i happened to have an extra USB brick. This means you can also power it from any powered USB outlet like on computers and some TVs.  For some, it will mean you need to buy a USB brick.Once plugged in, it was very straightforward to use.  I like how, when lit up, it resembles a candle, only with the mist coming out the side.  Mine did not have the ability to change color that i could tell.  The light button merely changed the brightness of the white light.  I even tried holding it down and no luck.  Not a big deal for me as i was planning on just using white anyway, but that's clearly not how it's advertised.Overall, this is a budget friendly diffuser for any small room of your home.

"These headphones have very good sound quality and I like the wood finish.  There is decent bass response and good overall balanced sound.  The ear buds also stay in my ear comfortably.  The cord has a cloth type material covering it, which seems pretty durable, but can create some noise when its rubbing against your clothes.

"While there are several alarm clocks that offer dual alarms, I was looking for one that specifically had a nap feature.  We have a newborn and need to feed on 3 hour intervals, so I thought it would be a nice thing to have.  After receiving it, I realized that it only goes up to 99 minutes.  My previous Sony alarm clock allowed for a lot more time, so I didn't think about it (newer Sony ones don't appear to have the nap timer any more).  With that said, the nap function is less useful, but the rest of the clock functions are fine.You set the time zone and DST on the back and the time came up right the first time I plugged it in.  Setting the alarm is a one button deal, so you can't set hour and minutes separately.  You can cycle forward and backwards, so there is less chance of overshooting your setting, but its still not a friendly clock if you need to change alarm times often.The USB charging ports seem to work fine.  The manual says that the phone one is 1A and the tablet one 2.1A.  Your device has to be able to accept 2.1A charging or it will default to 1A, so you cant just plug your phone in there and hope for quick charging.Overall, the clock feels a little cheap.  If I had a do over, I would go back and get a Sony clock.  The quality is so much better.  I would have done without USB charging and just got the Sony ICFC1T Alarm Clock Radio for about the same money.  As it is, this clock will serve its purpose, so we'll see how long it lasts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOJ0FTMKAJ39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY936OS#wasThisHelpful","RFOJ0FTMKAJ39","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It helps if you have low, white ceilings because this shoots a beam straight up and reflected light off the ceiling helps light up the room.

"While Brandon's first release was an excellent book of photography, it lacked many of the stories behind the individuals.  I came to find HONY on facebook and feel the story behind the photo is half the experience.  With his newest release, it all comes together to give you the full HONY package that most people have come to know and love.  This book is a bargain for all the passion and work that Brandon puts into this project.If you are deciding on whether or not to buy the book, consider the following, which Brandon posted on the HONY facebook page: ""I want to take a quick opportunity to remind everyone that HONY is advertisement free and almost entirely financed by book sales. (The only exception being income from a handful of speeches I give every year.) Proceeds from books have been used to pay for trips to twenty different countries over the past year alone. Even when working with large organizations like the United Nations or UNHCR, I’m always very careful to cover all costs and reimburse any expenses. I do this so that the content on HONY can remain entirely independent, self-directed, and transparent. By purchasing a book, you can help HONY continue to grow in a way that remains focused on telling people’s stories--- and nothing else. Thanks to everyone for your continued support.""Connect with real people.  Get out of your box and learn about people different from you.  Get to know their story.  Support the project.

"Our newborn is a deep sleeper and it turns out that the pain medicine that my wife was prescribed for her C-Section made its way to baby through the milk and made it hard to wake him up.  We had to have him on IV for a day while my wife rid her body of the pain med so we could start feeding again.  In the meantime, his sleep was so deep, that it really worried us and we got this for peace of mind.During that first week, this alarmed us several times a night that his breathing was low (alarms for less than 10 breaths per minute) and we were able to wake him a little to get him out of deep deep sleep.  Now at the end of our second week, it looks like the pain meds are out of his little body and he's not getting into as deep of sleep.  He is still on the low end of the recommended range (30 BPM), so I think we'll continue to use it until we are past 3-4 months or so.One gripe is that you should expect some false alarms.  I got one that said he wasn't breathing and I was sitting right there watching him when it went off.  He was breathing fine.  There were also some for low breathing when I don't think it was that low.  It has helped with those few episodes where it really was low though.  I also wish it would track his BPM through the night so you could see a chart or at least the average the next morning.  There is only a live reading.  The pad is small... its not a problem in the bassinet, but I can see him rolling off of this often once we put him in the crib.  Finally, when we bought this, the listing said it was discontinued.  I take that to mean that there will no longer be support for this product and that you shouldn't expect any app updates.  That adds a little risk if there are any issues.You need to weigh the options as to if you think this will help you out or drive you more crazy.  For us, if it helped us wake him from that one episode that could have gone bad, it was worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EOOHPQT6POS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDCNSXA#wasThisHelpful","R12EOOHPQT6POS","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I searched high and low for a baby monitor that would fit our needs, which was to be able to pan and zoom as well as have a 2-way intercom.  I looked for one with the 'best' reviews and if you search as long as I have, you'll find that ALL monitors are hit and miss and ALL monitors image looks nothing like the box.  The attached photo was of my mom rocking our baby, but its the zoomed in screen shot.  Resolution zoomed out is a little better.With that said, this one seems to be working well for us so far.  The screen size is perfect enough to see baby, but not be too large that its a hassle to carry around.

"If you rely on your phone as much as most people do, you are likely concerned with battery life and could use a back up plan should you run out of juice.  Some options are to keep chargers with you everywhere you go, adding a battery back up case or keeping a spare battery pack with you.  This battery pack is one of several options out there for you to consider.Some things that I like about it are its compact size and the fact that the charger connections are built right into the device.  You can also recharge the battery pack with the usb connection built in instead of needed a separate cable.  The downside(s) to this particular model is the limited battery capacity and the fact that the iPhone connection cannot be used with a protective case on your phone.  Most people I know have a case on their phone, and most of them are not easy to remove.  However, that is only an issue with iPhones since the plug for android devices can be used with a case.The downside for android devices is that most tend to be larger, with larger batteries, and the capacity of this would not even provide a single full charge.  It will, however, fully charge your iPhone, hence I feel this is an ideal backup for iPhone users that do not use a case (or their case is easily removable).  If you are in this market segment, this is a good device, otherwise, considering the price and size, I would recommend getting the 5000 mAh version instead, since its almost the same price and the physical size is not much larger.I was provided a unit at a reduced price for review purposes and my unbiased opinion was given above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ONRCJHFKFQAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTFG26A#wasThisHelpful","R2ONRCJHFKFQAG","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After installing this, I almost prefer this one because I still have good visibility out the rear window, yet can still see the car seat.

"I just needed a basic tablet for the main room for checking email, facebook, playing music and buying more stuff off Amazon :-)  For that, this tablet fits the bill. Don't expect to multi-task (stream music, check email and Facebook at same time), but it will manage single tasks pretty well.  Try to do too much and you will run out of RAM fast and it will get laggy.  Keep in mind that there are some apps that you can never completely shut off that will run in the background and eat up RAM.  All Facebook (facebook, page manager, messenger and instagram) and Amazon apps (product store, app store, instant video, music and kindle) seem to fall into this category.The colors are great, which was important to me, since I like viewing photos (Instagram, 500px), and the sound is good to, but not very loud. You might need an external Bluetooth speaker.  Battery life is up there with the best of them.With expectations set reasonably, you will appreciate this tablet. If you have a modern phone and expect similar performance, you might be disappointed.  I have an LG Optimus Pro G with 2 GB of RAM and it operates much smoother and can handle more tasks.  This tablet is certainly worth the price, though, for a budget tablet.  Price will bounce between a hundred bucks and full retail.  I picked it up for one hundred ten. Google the model number (ZA030046US) to find the best current price.UPDATE:  A new firmware update has helped the tablet operate a little smoother (although still not perfect) and it also added the ability to clear all the open programs with one tap.  Previously you had to close each one individually.  Still enjoying it and use it primarily for playing music (it pairs with my speaker much quicker than my phone), checking email and watching videos.  For more processor and memory hungry tasks, I stick to my phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4OEV8HHNL07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNDF7IY#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4OEV8HHNL07","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cut the cable a few years ago and have loved not being a slave to the cable company, but there is always the struggle of getting a clear signal for the basics (what I consider to be ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW and PBS).  I have not had much trouble for most of them except ABC, which is about 40 miles away and separated by a mountain range.I tried a cheaper amplified flat antenna and had no success whatsoever, but have had luck with the Winegard FV-30BB FreeVision, so I decided to try their FlatWave.  After hooking it up and doing my scan, I picked it right up!  I do have to use the amplifier and position the antenna close to the window at least 4 feet off the ground, but it comes in.  My wife still thinks this is unsightly, but its better than having the bulky FreeVision in our living room.  I did not notice anything that would suggest that its refurbished and would not hesitate to buy it again.

"A common scenario around my house is family sitting around the TV messing with their phone or tablet and being tethered to the wall with a short, 3 foot charging cord.  Everyone is leaning off the sides of the couch the whole time.  Meet the Skiva PowerFlow SmartQuad.  I plugged this in and set it on the corner end table where our couches meet.  Not only is this a multi-port usb charger, but it also serves as an extension.  Now we can sit at the couch normally and stay charged without having to lean off the side.The unit was tested simultaneously charging my LG Optimus Pro G, my wife's iPhone 5s and a bluetooth speaker and it worked perfectly!  A nice feature of this product is that it will detect your device and provide the correct and best amperage for a quick charge, no matter which port you use.  Other similar chargers have dedicated ports for the type of device you are charging, which can be confusing and may not give you the optimal power you need for all the devices you are charging.  If you are buying one for a common area of a business (i.e. coffee house), this feature is essential as you cannot expect your customers to try and figure out what port to use.  From my testing, I noticed that all my devices charged very quickly.Its also nice that the ports are spread out so that items with a larger base can be charged and it also helped direct the cords to users sitting in different areas.  This can also be used as a travel charger, so that you don't have to pack each items 'brick' and you can just bring this and the cords.  The only down side is that its not very compact and is a tad bulky.  It may be better to bring your individual charging bricks if you only have a couple items.  Its most beneficial if you'll use all 4 ports.Nice device should you need a multi-port charger.  I received a complementary unit for review purposes and my unbiased opinion was given above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RCGN3JON3QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSXVXL4#wasThisHelpful","R3RCGN3JON3QD","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cut the cable long ago and have been streaming my content and getting over the air channels for a few years now.  The only problem is I have been using a metal antenna in the living room that has been an eye sore, so I'm exploring these flat antenna options.  The antenna seems okay, but the amplifier feels like its going to fall apart in my hands.  The number of channels and signal strength is no different with it on or off.  On top of all that, it would not pick up my 'trouble' channel, which is about 40 miles away.  Based on that, I decided to return it.If you can't spend more than $30 and think you can get by without the amplifier, try the non amplified Winegard Flatwave FL-5000.  Or, if you think you really need amplification and you're not squeamish about buying refurbished, try the refurbished Winegard FL-55YR Flatwave antenna for about the same price (at the time of this review).  That's what I did and it did indeed pick up my 'trouble' channel!  There is a difference!With any flat antenna, don't expect it to perform as good as a metal HD antenna, but it will get you most of your channels while keeping a low profile.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9J4KWVZRLY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1WF9PA#wasThisHelpful","R2A9J4KWVZRLY9","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am trying to base my option based on the cost that I paid, which was only $18.  I understand that this is an inexpensive item, but its not terribly useful, as delivered.  I don't see how this can be functional at all unless you attach it to your door at several points.  It swings and moves all over the place, even when opening the door slowly.  I used some Command Wire Hooks to attach it to the door in multiple spots and it will work okay after rigging it.  We are just using it to put small towels and bathroom items on the back of the bathroom closet door.

"I have a Kammok Roo and love how comfortable it is. I never considered the ""hammock life"" until I got hooked on hanging in this thing. The problem is, my wife has also become fond of hanging, so I was off to find another hammock!While I love my Roo, its on the expensive side and its also pretty large where I felt like I was getting swallowed up sometimes. In my mind a 'single' person hammock would be just the right size for me. Having heard a lot about ENO, naturally I purchased the SingleNest without doing much more research. While its a quality hammock, it was a tad on the small side. I kept saying to myself, ""if only it was a little bigger."" Thumbing around the internet, I found the Grand Trunk single. Since its about 5"" wider and over a foot longer, I just knew it would be the perfect fit. I sold my SingleNest and bought this one. I was right! Its the perfect size! Not too big, not too small (and it was cheaper!). To give you some reference, I'm 5'11"" and 210 lbs and am able to lay slightly on the diagonal so I can get almost flat. That leaves me just enough fabric for me to prop my arm up as a little arm rest.One downside is that the fabric is just a tad rougher than the ENO, but its not something that is going to cause me to return it (it does not compare to the Roo... that fabric is heavenly). Another minor gripe is that the carabiners are huge and clunky. ENO and Kammok are using the smaller, lighter weight climbing carabiners, but thats something that can be easily replaced with better carabiners or descending rings. On the plus side, they do give you some cord so that you can start hanging immediately. If you plan on using the hammock frequently, you will probably want to upgrade to webbing or something similar (i.e. Python straps) in the future.All in all, I'm very impressed with this hammock and would recommend it to anyone considering an ENO or a hammock at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G77F193ZG9BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AIFFM4#wasThisHelpful","R3G77F193ZG9BA","A1H4IVXNXWWBLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H4IVXNXWWBLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to imagine the loss of a child, and even harder to experience it. Artist Tom Hart lost his young daughter rather unexpectedly, and this memoir, ""Rosalie Lighting"" is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and emotionally wrought tome sharing his horrible experience.The memoir is divided into several small sections, creating a shattering effect that one must feel when this happens. Tom intricately introduces us to his daughter, and slowly rolls out the story of her death, and the months following as he and his wife navigate this horrendous occurrence. All of the expected emotions surface, however, Tom's approach to exploring them, both through art and words, puts his own spin on the experience. At times, you will stop at the beauty of a phrase or the emotion pouring out of a single picture.Somehow, he manages to balance both the intense pain and grief of losing a  child, and bringing her to life through this pages once again. In this way, Rosalie lives again, in our heart as well as his. Highly recommended, and have a box of Kleenex ready.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HACGC6KG1LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049946#wasThisHelpful","R28HACGC6KG1LV","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really, really wanted to like this book. Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American associate justice of the Supreme Court has been a hero of mine. Fighting injustice in America's schools, on the front line of the civil rights movement, battling racial injustice on the field of the court system. When it came time for his due, President Lyndon Johnson nominated him for the highest court, setting him up for a potentially brutal battle.However, the results of this book are uneven at best. The author, Wil Haygood, starts off strongly with the nomination, and quickly moves to the confirmation hearings. Then takes the unsurprising detour into Thurgood's history. In fact, that's part of the problem with this story. In an editorial misstep of sorts, Haygood loses control of the narrative, as the fight for civil rights and the state of America during this time begin to sway him away from his central focus. Unfortunately, he has some factual errors that are glaring and embarrassing (FDR was not alive at the end of WWII). Thurgood gets lost in the book from time to time. I understand the need for historical context, however reading this book at times felt like Haywood was more interested in telling those stories than Marshall's own.By the time we reorient ourselves to the main story, I'd lost my own interest and focus, and chose not to finish this book. Again, I really wanted to like it, but found the literary wanderings of the author, and the historical errors, too much to overlook.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23V5W7KVI6QO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307957195#wasThisHelpful","R23V5W7KVI6QO5","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When i learned that Brian Selznick published another book, I purposefully decided not to learn anything about the book. Swept away by his previous novels The Invention of Hugo Cabret and Wonderstruck (Schneider Family Book Award - Middle School Winner), I knew that the story would encompass much emotion, realness, tenderness and heart. Alas, I was wrong. The Marvel has all of that, and so much more.The book starts with a series of amazing prints, drawn by Selznick, that tell the story of the Marvels visually. As always with his intimate, perfect drawings, the story unfolds beautifully. With the turn of a page, years fall away, beloved characters live and die, and generations are presented. It is all too tempting to turn the pages quickly through this section. Take your time. Enjoy the artwork, scope out details that later on may be important, pay attention to the eyes. Selznick is a master of drawing the eyes.Soon, the pictures give away to a story about a young boy fleeing from a harsh boarding school in England, trying to find a long lost uncle holed up in out-of-time house in London. Set in the early 90's, Joseph's story is somehow connected to the magnificent pictures you just leafed through ... but how? That is the glorious mystery of this novel. Arriving at the house, his uncle, Albert Nightgale, is strange, distant, and not all willing to help out his forgotten nephew. But he does, because deep down, Albert's heart is there, if somewhat hidden.I so want to talk so much about this book, but fear spoilers would give away the surprises that Selznick has planned. Suffice it to say, the actual story that is hidden in pages unfolds in unpredictable ways, that reveal a tenderness that are reflected in those first pictures of the story.Selznick has written a tale that honors our history and our future, explores the meaning of objects in our lives, and how and to whom we choose to devote our lives. This book is simply a masterpiece.Thank you, Mr. Selznick, for yet another tour de force. We wait so long in between your books, and now I know why. The wait is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HYNA9Z97KQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545448689#wasThisHelpful","R16HYNA9Z97KQ5","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first attempt at a cordless headphone for my running. I run about 3 miles every day (not a lot), but enough to warrant trying this product. I'm just back from my first run, and they were great.First, finding the foam to fit my ears was quite easy. Although, I haven't tried to fit any of the guards yet. I charged up the headphones and soon was out on my run. The headphones are light, and the dangly cord is heavy enough that the earpieces stay put. I first noticed the cord bouncing a bit more than normal, but soon it didn't bother me.

"After finishing this book last night, I'm still a bit perplexed about this story, and I am vacillating about my star rating. My indecision stems from parts of the story that I absolutely love, the target audience that I suspect this book is intended to reach, and an ending (no spoilers here) that was a mix of disappointment and understanding. If I could give half stars, I think I'd land it at 3.5 stars.Jack lives with his family on a farm in Maine, and take in foster boy Joseph, who comes from a hideous past. Joseph, at age of thirteen, became a father of baby Jupiter, and spends the story wrestling with this reality. Jack and his family provide a warm, understanding cocoon for Joseph as he adjusts to adults (and a special cow) who care for him. Most of his time is spent with foster brother Jack, as Jack tries to navigate the complex mental issues of Joseph with honesty and occasional rule violations.It's the relationship between the two boy that drives the story, at least it did for me. Jack counting Joseph's smiles was profoundly beautiful and innocent, and a sign of Joseph's thaw. Much like the beautiful way that Schmidt describes the winter-soaked Maine countryside, deep in snow, ice, and frozen wonder. He writes his outside as frosty as can be, making the inside of Jack's home and the barn warm, nurturing places they need to be.Yet, it's in the ending that I felt I got lost a bit, and the narrative drive that kept me in the story got lost as well. Let's just say that I would have wanted a different ending.My disappointment with the ending doesn't mask the beauty of the story. This is not a story for elementary students. Schmidt's simplicity in the writing makes this a perfect story for middle schoolers who need a easier text to navigate, but not a ""dumbing down"" of the content. I could easily see what rich and insightful conversations this book will inspire in ELA classrooms across our middle schools.The title is Orbiting Jupiter, but for me, the true orbit is Jack and Joseph.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB8TT9K4OARW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054446222X#wasThisHelpful","RHB8TT9K4OARW","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, upon reading it, I honestly only made it through about 60% of the story. My interest began waning about halfway through. I can't exactly say why. Perhaps it was a stylist choice the author made with the the main character reading a journal from her missing daughter, and the character reflecting/commenting on what she just read.

"To be honest, YA romance-type novels aren't really my cup of tea. However, upon reading the description of this book on the Vine website, it was intriguing just enough to get me to request it. Glad that I did! Everything, Everything, which I received yesterday, and finished today, is a well-worth your time story of trial, tribulation, and teenage angst, all sealed in a germ-free bubble.Madeline Whittier is your average seventeen year old girl, with one slight problem. She's literally allergic to the outside world. Fearing harmful consequences, Madeline's mother, who is a doctor herself, creates a home that is sealed off from the world and raises her daughter, alone, inside of it. With the help of a nurse who constantly monitors her health, Madeline has managed to have a life, get educated, and seem relatively adjusted. Until the boy next door moves in, and her heart awakens for the first time.Olly, a somewhat Emo moody youth with the soul of an acrobat, enchants dear Madeline in a way that only he can. He too has his own back story, and is saddled with a family that at its best is dysfunctional. How Yoon unpacks his story is unique, and I appreciated her skill in writing in doing so. Olly has a few surprises in store too.So far, this seems somewhat in the vein of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" or your typical romance-ish book. I just advise you, without writing any spoilers here, to go through the story. Yoon has many twists and turns in this plot that are both revolutionary and realistic. You end up with a book that will compel much discussion, in schools and in families, about many issues.One of the reasons this is a compelling novel is the way that Yoon handles the characterization of Madeline. She could have easily been a stereotype, or a heroic ""damsel-in-distress"" (which is somewhat playfully mocked n the book). Yet Yoon keeps her real, and sometimes painfully so. As Madeline's heart awakens, and she realizes more and more the life she has inside can never be the life she yearns for outside, and that conflict drives the story. Also, I appreciated Madeline's multi-racial background, which features in the story but is not the driver of the story. It's a nice touch as we begin to include more characters in our YA books that represent the many different people in our country.Through an innovative use of chats, pictures, graphs, and notes, this story of Madeline's awakening is a refreshing look at your typical YA story, and it had me hooked from the first couple of pages. I highly recommend this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIRDH9OZO7G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553496646#wasThisHelpful","R2NIRDH9OZO7G0","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I've been using this pillow since receiving it this past Friday. My succinct review is: eh.The pillow comes wrapped in in plastic looking oddly like a cylinder. Opening it, you are greeted with a curvy object and an intense ""new  car"" smell to the pillow, which, even after several days of airing, I can still smell. The pillow flattened out nicely (as the directions suggested). It is a hefty pillow, not a light pillow by any means, that is a bit heavy as well. Laying on the pillow originally felt comfortable, but the heaviness made it harder to move around on the bed.Every night I fell asleep quickly using this pillow. And every morning I wake up with my second pillow under my head as well. It seems like I prefer more pillow than this pillow is giving me, and I honestly don't remember shoving that second pillow under my head. So I must need more.This pillow is middlin'. I'm planning to move this one to the guest bedroom, and back to my former pillow, which I really enjoy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2208PMC9EFY29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJ9BFCY#wasThisHelpful","R2208PMC9EFY29","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So apparently, having electric shocks delivered through pads that you place your feet on is ""a thing"". I hadn't heard about it before ordering this device from Amazon. I originally thought it was some sort of foot massager, and I love a good foot rub.However, upon plugging in and turning on, it was clear the device had a different purpose. Little electric shocks began to pulsate through my feet and into my legs. Through a hand held remote, you can adjust the shocks to increase the intensity. The first time I did it, I put it at 15. After several uses, I'm up to 30.The effect is strange. Designed to increase blood flow into the legs and feet, it seems to work well. I can feel the effects in my legs long afterwards. It not necessarily relaxing, nor is it uncomfortable. But I do enjoy my go arounds with this device and can't help but feel that it's helping somehow. My partner also enjoys his time and uses it after me. They also include a few patches to attach, in case you want shocks delivered to other muscles. I have yet to try that, and honestly, I don't think I will!The AccuRelief is heavy, sturdy and well made.

"Charles M. Blow has written a memoir that is both frank and fresh, real and incredibly painful at times to read. As Blow recounts his childhood in the South, he recounts how he and his family navigates the complex racial mores of the times in chilling and honest ways. As I read books such as this, I find myself reflecting on how I would attempt to handle such situations, and fear that I would not be successful. Blow didn't have a choice in the matter; survive or die. What is most compelling about this book was his writing, described by others as lyrical, which is apt. He doesn't overburden his text with extra words, and doesn't shy away from anything either.

I began to appreciate this book as an parallel somewhat to Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States"", only with an educational focus.

"... the story comes together in a fluid, heartbreaking sort of way that made the reading journey there all the worthwhile. After previously reviewing the fantastic book by Mr. Rachman, ""The Imperfectionists"", I was excited to read his newest creation. Fortunately, he does not disappoint in the slightest.This is a complex and involved story of a girl named Tooly, and the three important times in her life, and how they've come to affect each other in ways that unfold slowly over the novel. At first, you are unplaced in each story, the only connective tissue between them is the girl, but then, Rachman, a master of his content, unspools each tale and starts to fill in gaps, answering questions posed in one time frame, only to ask more questions in another. All is resolved, and the journey is worthwhile.A note about Rachman's writing style: it is profound and wonderful. He manages to make the most mundane occurances rapt with interest, purely based on the words he chooses to use in insightful ways. Another author he reminds me of, who also masters words well, is Michael Cunningham, but their storytelling is definitely NOT similar. I appreciated Rachman's handling of all of the characters, even the less than admirable ones, making them pulse with a reality, warts and all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSK5XIJ55OC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679643656#wasThisHelpful","R2PSK5XIJ55OC4","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Meet Handful, renamed Hetty by her owners, a resilient slave who, at the beginning of this story, is ""given"" as a gift. Meet Sarah, daughter of prominent slave owners, who instinctively recoils at the thought of actually owning another person. Thus sets in motion the dynamics of this compelling and quite remarkable story, based on real life, of both girls finding their voice and lives in pre-Civil War America.Told in alternating chapters, the story unfolds from these two distinct viewpoints, blending and melding together to create one powerful narrative. Kidd doesn't skimp on either's story; filling each one with rich details, backgrounds, traditions, and histories, making them wholly come alive. She holds nothing back: how slaves were treated in the antebellum south smash any stereotypes of ""happy slaves working in the fields for their benevolent masters"".Through her rebellious and quick-witted mother Charlotte, Handful learns to both navigate this horrid system as well as take advantage of it.At the same time, Kidd explores Handful's relationship with Sarah, which is incredibly complex. Are they friends? Are they equals in any way? What must happen between the two for that to occur? There are no easy answers here, but opportunities for some rich exploration and discussion. As the two girls grow up, the relationship is tested in many ways, as is each of the girls. Both confront the social mores of the time, and strive to overcome the limited expectations placed on both of them. In that way, they are sisters through and through.You leave the story enriched, impassioned, and ready to change the world, as Handful and Sarah tried to do. As it turns out, Sarah is based on a real life figure, as Kidd explores in her wonderfully insightful postscript. Handful is almost an invention. But that didn't make her story less real. Handful is just as real and realized as Sarah. And as a reader, you are better for knowing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWLRPR7XTVMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670024783#wasThisHelpful","RDWLRPR7XTVMR","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most video game reviews that I write, I make it very clear that I'm not one of those ""gamers"" that spends 24 hours on a new game to solve it immediately. I play for about an hour at a time, not only to draw out the experience, but to relish the game. Also, as a fairly ""older"" player (I'm in my 40's), I tend to expect a lot from my gaming experiences (not a big fan of games primarily for little kids). I'm happy to report my complete satisfaction with UBI Soft's new game ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"".I first picked up this line of games with Assassin's Creed III. Because of the historical content (I wanted to see the renditions of Boston and other places), I was intrigued, and loved many aspects of the game. One of them was the sea battles that you completed from time to time. It only made sense that the new game capitalized on that aspect. And boy, they did.You are a pirate, completing missions and ever increasing the strength of your ship as you progress through the game. There are still aspects of the game (the modern day story) that I'm not too fond of, but unlike III, that aspect doesn't confuse or bother me as much.The sea battles are quite fun and quite stress reducing. Having a bad day? Attack and raid a few ships! As soon as I upgraded my ship the Jack Daw, attacking even the larger ships was fun. Going on raids, discovering buried treasure, and even harpooning sea life all makes for an enjoyable, escapist environment.I highly recommend this game for casual players like me, just wanting some fun, to those more experienced, who truly want to make the most of the game and environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNO50RSDSR3JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMFIXKQ#wasThisHelpful","RNO50RSDSR3JD","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... and that is that I didn't pick it up sooner. I'm not sure why. I'd seen it on the shelves of my local bookstores for a month or so. A longtime Henson fan, and growing up with the Muppets as a central part of my life, I should have naturally been drawn to the book. However, it wasn't until I'd read a glowing review of the book (where, I honestly can't remember) that it landed on my reading radar, and I picked it up.My treat to myself this holiday season of 2013 was this book, and it's been so incredibly enjoyable to read. One of the reasons is purely the subject matter. Jim Henson comes across exactly as all of us probably wanted him to be: kind, quiet, wickedly funny, and completely sincere. Clearly, Kermit wasn't too far from the tree ... or the arm ... and as we love Kermit, we love Jim in return. Spending time with him doses your soul with lightness and fun.That affect definitely wouldn't have happened had it not been for the writing of Brian Jay Jones. He moves along through the early part of Jim's life to get to the Muppets, and that is where his writing shines. He manages to mention enough that you feel like you are getting to know everything quite well, but doesn't drown you in details to make it a slog.And there is so much to learn about in this book: I never knew how totally integral Jim was to the development and creation of Sesame Street. Jones writes of an ""insert"" in the show with two girls, a dollhouse, a tea party, and two kittens, which I'd forgotten about for over 40 years. Jim's constant striving for new and excellence, from Emmett to Miss Piggy and beyond.Jim left us too early, but he left his legacy behind: the shows, the movies, the integral part he and his Muppets have taken in American culture. He was quite a gift to us. Give yourself a gift this holiday season, and enjoy spending some quality time with a whole bunch of friends ... Jim and the muppets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJXVBCBZI47M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345526112#wasThisHelpful","R2LJXVBCBZI47M","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I knew about the reconstruction of the White House, (first learning about it with My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House and Backstairs at the White House but never gave what they did a second thought. This new book ""unearths"" the story of the rebuilding of the White House, from its start to end, in an informative, interesting way.Robert Klara deftly manages to tell the story of a reconstruction of the building without plodding through too many ""engineering details"", which was what my fear was. When he does talk about the actual structure, his writing is supportive enough of the lay person to maintain understanding, while giving building enthusiasts what they want from this story as well. I found the actual story to be incredibly interesting, from the initial chandelier swaying in the blue room to literally pieces of the building falling on President Truman.Klara also includes details of the time, some of which informs the story by supporting decisions made by the designers to include a bomb shelter in the White House. I removed one star because sometimes I felt that Klara's detour into history was more of a way to fill out the book instead of illuminating the actual story. However, such detours do not entirely detract from the enjoyment of reading the story. Klara's chapters are never too long, filled with the right amount of information, which kept the story moving at a brisk, enjoyable pace.If you are a fan of presidential history, of buildings and architecture, or of the 1950's in general, this book is a must read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181SV3IHCDXYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250000270#wasThisHelpful","R181SV3IHCDXYE","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We know the absolute hell that people went through after hurricane Katrina ravaged the New Orleans area. Images of people stuck in their attics, sitting on top of roofs waiting for rescue, violence, and the horror of the Superdome. Add to that this compelling, sometimes awful, story of a group of doctors and patients at Memorial Hospital.Let me start off by saying that this is by no means a pleasant read: it's a challenging book of a challenging time. Why is it so challenging? It challenges you on many levels. Given the horrific conditions of the hospital at the time, did the doctors and nurses, that may have acted inappropriately in the handling of some of the patients in the hospital, act out of human decency or frustration? This book doesn't offer easy answers. It's a thorough examination of the dire situation, and the actions that these people took, and the reverberating after effects of those choices.This book is not pleasant, but necessary. My question after finishing this story is that has anyone learned anything from this experience? I certainly hope so. At the end of the day, so much that happened in New Orleans should have happened.

"No doubt about it. David Levithan's new book, ""Two Boys Kissing"", is a revolutionary text that will be lauded  as a milestone in young adult and gay literature for decades to come. That's a pretty hefty statement, yet its not hyperbole by any means. The book commends such praise for its beautiful originality, its poignancy, its realness and rawness.Meet Harry and Craig, two boys who decide to break the world kissing record. Meet Avery and Ryan, two small town teens who meet at an ersatz prom and discover much about each other. Meet Cooper, who's version and vision of gay life is warped by family and the internet. Meet Tariq, who's bashing inspires the kissing. Meet Neil and Peter, two boys navigating their love. And meet the chorus of gay men who died from the AIDS epidemic, who omnisciently narrate the lives of the characters throughout the story, and well as their own, through the ingenious use of ""we"".It's through the characters and this ""gay Greek chorus"" that Levithan manages to make his story compelling. As the men watch the kissing, and the lives of the other characters, they reflect on their own existence. Levithan honors both the reality of today's experience of being gay in our society as well as the lives of the men and women who came before us. This powerful dichotomy creates emotional, stunning moments in the novel that will cause you to reach for a Kleenex.Levithan also manages to obliterate stereotypes through the novel. The stereotype shattering aspect of two boys kissing would be enough, but Levithan expands that throughout his story. If you think you know how the characters in the book should act, be prepared to be pleasantly and wonderfully surprised. Levithan has painted with words a more complex picture of people's reactions to two boys kissing, a vision almost of how life can be, and for some of us, how life is.When asked about what this book is about, one could simply say two boys kissing, because that is the act that drives this story. But its more. Its so much more. In it, I see where I came from, where I am today, and where I will be in the future. This book is narrated with ""we"", but in reality, it's the story of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUN78N5TMCKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307931900#wasThisHelpful","RKUN78N5TMCKC","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I primarily buy another brand of pomade that I've been using for many, many years. One reason I love the brand is because of the scent. However, I'm open to trying new things, so I opted to give Baxter's a go. I'm happy to report satisfaction for this product.This pomade that I chose is unscented. In the jar, it feels thick and gooey to the touch, but not overly so. It runs very nice through my wet hair with little effort, and it doesn't take too much to use. The end result is a good hold, with a slight touch of shine that remains that my other product doesn't have. The hold lasts easily all day, and doesn't harden or become ""shell-like"", which I don't like.I'd recommend this pomade if you're wanting to change or try another brand!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YG2URCMUC6S8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00512SGEY#wasThisHelpful","R2YG2URCMUC6S8","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I'm a Jill Lepore fan. It started with The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History (The Public Square), and then The Story of America: Essays on Origins, and most recently, The Mansion of Happiness: A History of Life and Death (Vintage). Maybe it's her writing style, maybe it's the deft in which she both manages to teach and gently entertain at the same time. Whatever the case, I have yet to pick up a book by Lepore and be disappointed, and that certainly was the case with her newest book, ""Book of Ages: the Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin.""Given how very little information there is out there about Jane Franklin, I worried about the trappings of such a book, filled with ""could haves"" and ""maybes"" that lead to such doubtful reading. No need to fear: Jane is handled with great care, and great wisdom in this book. Lepore manages to take the subject, and shine light on her in ways that are astounding and informative. By pairing her story with her much more famous brother, which scads of material is available, Lepore gives us a sense of this woman whom Ben wrote over the years.Not only that, Lepore explores the grossly unequitable lives women had back during our pre-Revoultionary times, making for a story that also raises hackles too. If only Jane were born a boy, she might have had all of the advantages, opportunities, and privileges that were given to males during that time. The fact that she could read and write at all was a revoultionary act. Even though her spelling was erratic (as it was during those days), her intelligence was fierce.In fact, it's through her letters, paired with the fragile, fabulous book she left ""Book of Ages"", that we get to know her and her world. Lepore mentions on a page by itself the importance of leaving Jane's spellings intact, and with two short sentences, I was able to overlook them and get to know the writer well. When Jane writes a letter that is somewhat confusing, Lepore steps in to explain, and also give context for that explanation. It is through this process that we can meet Jane, live with her through her joys and seemingly endless heartbreaks, her worries, gossip sessions, and requests of Benjamin.So now I have a new favorite in Jill Lepore's collection. I also have a new favorite voice in our country's early history. Lepore has given us Jane Mecom, and her beautiful voice adds much to our understanding of our country, her citizens, the town of Boston and life, in general.Highly recommended!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVNZQJXWXQ17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307958345#wasThisHelpful","RBVNZQJXWXQ17","AL5OEDM8TPTKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL5OEDM8TPTKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This guy comes in at a little over 6 1/2"" tall.  It's not too heavy, but given the porcelain and glass components, it is not a lightweight decoration...and it's one you'll have to directly supervise the little kids with.  The overall white motif is nice and simple, with just a little bit of color with the gold bow and hat ring, and some color on his face and hat, a good balance.My highly scientific measurement had the action of the snowflakes in the globe lasting all of about 22 seconds.  There was no air bubble in mine, so you can't get any really energetic shaking going on; all you can really do is turn it upside-down and let the snowflakes ""fall"" to do their thing.  There are some glitter bits in the mix, so you get some nice multi-color sparkle with the action.Price.  About $30 for this item seems about right.  As it's an enduring product, a keepsake and it'll last a number of years, this price seems fair.Bottom line: this is a nice and simple holiday decoration, from a highly respected maker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHDZT92VSN2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNK27U#wasThisHelpful","R2BHDZT92VSN2R","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice item.  The color is good, and once assembled it is relatively sturdy.Assembly.  It didn't take too long to get this product out of its box and assembled.  The instructions are easy enough to decipher, and there are ample pieces of hardware.  As other have noted: be careful tightening your cams, as you can easily overtighten and then you've essentially ruined that connection.I find it absolutely stunningly stupid that the manufacturer has not provided holes in the backing through which to pass your power cords.  This would not be difficult at all to do in the manufacturing process.  Hell, you could probably charge another $10 or $20 for the product, just based on that feature.  I ended up drilling my own holes, which must be done carefully as the back is particularly flimsy pseudo-board.Once assembled, it does stand rather tall.  If you have a low-slung bed this probably would not be a good solution.  This is a good headboard for a higher bed, and the ample shelving allows for lots of books, a phone, lamps, etc, with lots of wide open space up top for your choice of urbane décor.Bottom line: for the price, this is a nice item.

Nope.  I ordered two, and both had fallen apart in the box.  I have to wonder if they were falling apart as they were placed in the box; wouldn't it be obvious to the fulfillment center employee to notice that the item is defective, and not even pack it to begin with?Yeah, I could get out the super glue and put it all back together again, but that's not what I've paid for.

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.My kids have been using a low-end FM transmitter in one of our paleolithic, non-digital-friendly vehicles, and I’m sick of it, because the sound is so absolutely terrible.  This device is a massive improvement over that old one, which already has been thrown away.  This product is not delivering perfect stereophonic sound, but then again, it doesn’t promise that.This product is easy to set up and get right into action right out of the box.  Its controls are intuitive: plug in the power, click on the channel you want on the device, match it on the car radio, and plug in your device, and you’ve got digital music in your non-aux car.  Not bad.And added feature is the USB outlet right at the car power adapter.  So, if you’ve got a USB charging cord handy, you can charge whatever you need while you’re using the power socket to run this transmitter.My experience with this transmitter was positive.  I had no problems getting it to sync and spit out passable connections and music at the top and bottom of the FM dial.Price. For about $15, this is a pretty good product.  Its use is intuitive, and it’s easy to get working quickly.  That, and it also chargers our device while playing.It actually has some pretty good documentation, with text and diagrams that really show how to use the product—nice!  A little confusing are the photos for “Device Appearance,” which shows four separate adapters/plugs for this device, when it only comes with two, the standard 3.5mm male plug and the Apple 8-pin plug.  Quite disappointing is the complete absence of any contact information whatsoever; no URL, phone number, email address or physical address.  One could interpret that as the manufacturer not wanting consumers to be in contact...Bottom line: If your car is aux-deficient, this is a good interim solution to get your digital content through your speakers.

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.This is an entry-level, low-cost head lamp.  It works relatively well, in that it provides a good amount of light in the dark, in a fixed—and adjustable—position on your head.The headlamp requires 3 AAA batteries, which are not included.  Installation is relatively easy, by squeezing two tension buttons on each side to remove the back.  A plus is that no tools are required to access the battery compartment.  I note there is no gasketing for the back, just a molded lip.  This product would likely do okay in the rain, but immersion would ruin it pretty quickly.  I have not tested the product for battery duration.The light works in three modes: full on, lower-power and a blinking full-on.  The zoom function is performed simply by pulling the lens in or out.  The zoom function is mediocre at best, and at full in provide an acceptably wide beam; at full out the beam is relatively narrow.  The convex lamp lens is relatively well protected by modest side shrouds.The tilt of the lamp adjusts on the headband through six positions.The headband is adjustable for head circumference, and also adjusts for the crown.  There is adequate plastic padding where the headband meets the lamp.Price.  For approximately $8 this is a pretty good entry-level headlamp.There is no documentation, nor are there any instructions on how to use the lamp, maintain it, install the batteries, etc.  If you aren’t familiar with this kind of device, you’ll need some help.Bottom line: This is a simple, low-cost headlamp, suitable for the car emergency kit, work around the house, or for infrequent campers.  For the more hard-core outdoor-types and those who need to rely more heavily on a more stringently constructed lamp, this is not quite the right one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BFQTTO2WANB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R3BFQTTO2WANB8","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I recently reviewed the Cailler bar almost exactly the same as this one, the one with cranberries instead of raisins.  This is basically the same review as that one, with the slightest of modifications to address the presence of raisins instead of cranberries.I received the standard Amazon.com shipment of two of these bars—thank you!  They were quite enjoyable.I’ve had my share of European chocolate, having lived in Europe for almost nine years total, and visited many more times (Belgium, most recently).  But this brand I’d not heard of (it’s a Nestle brand); that’s one of the reasons I wanted to try it.This bar is big, thick and heavy—they’re calling it a tablet—so you’re getting a lot of chocolate bar with your purchase.  Or you think you’re getting a lot…I note that there are a lot of deep longitudinal and lateral grooves in the product…so that packaged it looks big, but the bar’s actual volume is considerably less than what the box is showing you (see image).  It’s a big box, but the actual weight of the bar is less than seven ounces.You also get a lot of wrapping, the very sturdy box, and then the bright red paper wrapping, with the foil-wrapped bar inside.  Yeah, I was definitely channeling Charlie Bucket as I opened this product, and was a bit disappointed not to find a golden ticket waiting for me.When you finally get to the bar, it’s a bit different in appearance.  It is not all smooth chocolate exterior, with the goodies buried inside.  The pouring method intentionally makes the almonds, hazelnuts and raisins visible (see image).  This tends to make the bar appear a little less refined, less sophisticated, and may actually detract from the “fine European chocolate” image.  If you’re used to granola, trail mix or chunky cereal bars, being able to see the ingredients is a nice touch, and could even be considered to be somewhat thoughtful on the part of the manufacturer.The closest similar bar that most would be familiar with would be the Ritter Sport hazelnut or raisin bar.  This one is bigger, and puts it all together, the raisins, almonds, and hazelnuts.Yeah, yeah, so how does it taste?  For the chocolate, the traditional soft and very sweet traditional milk chocolate taste is moderated by the crunchies.  If you’re tuned in that deep, sweet and smooth traditional Swiss chocolate taste is in there.  The raisins are good size and chewy and the raisin taste is discernable.  The hazelnuts and almonds are nicely crunchy, and are both good size in the bar.  The taste of both comes out relatively clearly.There is a salty undertaste, but not quite the trendy salted caramel.  Just like with the other bar (with the cranberries) I detected the same smoky aftertaste, not like smoked meat, but to my mind closer to open fire in the outdoors, sort of a chocolatey-sweet campfire taste…strange, but pleasurable.  I think this is an aftertaste of the roasted nuts.  Not bad.There’s basically nothing good for you in this product.  Fat, saturated fat, sugar, gluten, nuts, egg products, etc.  One positive is that is has zero trans-fat.  Don’t worry about the label; just enjoy the product.Price: This is basically a $9 bar of chocolate.  Wow.  On physical size (more than $1/oz) and origin, that’s about right, I guess.  I expect there is some craft that goes into it and choice ingredients as well, so I guess that’s about right.  But on taste, it’s just not quite a $9 chocolate bar taste.  I’d go $7.  If I saw it in the store, I might buy it, but not for $9.  As a high-end candy gift, this would be a good choice, for something like a Christmas stocking.Bottom line: This is a nice n’ tasty, crunchy and fun Swiss chocolate bar.  It has an interesting taste and some really good texture, but is somewhat spendy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH6X5YPOAU0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGN3I#wasThisHelpful","RUH6X5YPOAU0H","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the packaging, arriving very secure, in layers of packaging that are classy and replicate a much more expensive watch.  The opening/unboxing for this item is a nice experience (for the female consumer).The only function of this watch is time.  There is no date indication, nothing else.I noticed immediately that the entire face is the same color as the entire case, the rose gold tone throughout.  The entire watch case is the same rose gold tone, as is the buckle.  As such, the face’s numerals do not stand out in any way.  You have to roll/rotate your wrist to get some light angling to see the numerals and tell the time.  The numerals do not illuminate/glow, and there is no way to read this watch in the dark (unless you’ve got a flashlight).For wear, the watch is light and unobtrusive.  The nice smooth leather lining on the inside of the band is smooth and makes wearing it very comfortable.During the brief period using this watch it has kept accurate time.  It is easy to adjust quickly.The documentation says this watch is water resistant to 30m.  I did not test this, although I cannot imagine using this watch in any kind of wet environment, given its band.As a guy big on documentation, there is a lot of it here, but unfortunately it’s a boilerplate document for all Invicta watches, so there is a ton of extraneous material which is not applicable whatsoever to your purchase of this specific watch.  Also, a lot of the documentation inside the package is for an extended warranty for the product.Bottom line: this is a simple ladies fashion watch, best for dress-up occasions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK0WN4EN8LSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5P2FI#wasThisHelpful","R1BK0WN4EN8LSI","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.Okay, I’ll admit it: I didn’t read the product description that clearly.  Specifically, I didn’t notice that this set comes WITHOUT a battery.  So, you’re supposed to already have the battery, or purchase one separately to use with this set.  It arrived, looks cool, seems to be very sturdily constructed, but I have no way to test it, as I don’t have a battery.  And, I’m not really inclined to go out and pay for a battery…I’d figure that if you’re offering one to a reviewer that you might want to include a battery…I also note that the item came with no documentation at all, no instructions, no user’s manual, nothing.  It was just the flashlight and the charger in a nice little package.  There was no information on what kind of battery you should purchase to use with this product.  If I were selling this product it would make a lot of sense to make that information available to my customers, but it’s not there.  Also, nowhere in the product’s online description is there any kind of information on the battery that should be used with it.  I’d think that manufacturer NockNock or vendor Raysourcing would be interested in offering the battery for sale, or at least want to offer information—or a link—to where a buyer might find the right battery.  The charger has a neat little plastic-imprinted outline of a battery with some data in it, but the printing is very small and the texturing of the plastic essentially makes what I guess to be battery information unreadable.All I can guess is that the cost of the package for this light, charger and battery would push it close to $50.  At $35, it’s relatively expensive to begin with, but I’ll give on that, as this looks like a pretty rugged and well-constructed piece of gear.The product images show a white zoom graphic on the next of the light; mine does not have that.  The images also shows what appears to be a white/gray imprinted battery outline on the charger.  Again, mine does not have that.So, the item seems pretty cool but is completely unusable as purchased.  That’s too bad.Bottom line: This seems to be a pretty awesome piece of gear, but I’ve got no way to completely evaluate it, as I’ve got no battery to make it go…and the seller offers no information on how to get one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JD4MCO08T008/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016MDWLVE#wasThisHelpful","R2JD4MCO08T008","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.For $20, this is a superb pair of earbuds.  The sound is crisp and clear, and I especially like the very distinct low-end bass reproduction.  Greg Nagy’s “Walk That Fine Thin Line,” David Sanborn’s “Chicago Song,” the “Hawaii-5-O” theme by Big Kahuna and the Kopa Cat Pack, and everything from Sadao Watanabe’s “How’s Everything?” release all sounded fantastic on these buds, very impressive.In the package you get the earbuds and two pairs of extra tips—that’s it.  No case, no warranty card or user’s manual.  Some kind of documentation/instruction would be good, as there is a small control module on the left-side cord; one click stops/starts playback and two skips to the next song, at least this is what happened when I auditioned these on my iPod classic.  The box provides the technical specs, and that’s all you get.The box does offer an email address for support, support@soundpeatsaudio.com.The listed standard price of $99.99 is absolutely ridiculous for this product.  The Prime price of $20 is much more reasonable, and is a good deal for this product.Bottom line: This is a low-cost earbuds set, but most definitely not low-budget.

"The dog absolutely loved these things.  She would literally inhale them.  They did not last long at all.They smell really good, just like human meat sticks.  Go figure, as the ingredients are beef, salt, sugar, citric acid, dextrose, paprika (for color), black pepper and garlic.  The appearance, though, is not quite up to human speed.  They don’t really look like those pictured on the packaging.  They are much more uniform and smooth, not the rich variegation shown, and their color is more of a dull brown, not the vibrant red-brown shown.As with all the dog treats, I tried one.  Uh, not really that tasty, despite its appetizing smell and its appearance like human-intended beef jerky.There is a ton of info here about how great these are for your dog, with protein and fiber, really natural and not artificial.  Yeah, sure, I guess.  I have no way to verify or test any of the claims.  I do note that the analysis says these things are 40% moisture.

I received these a number of months ago, got really busy at home and work, had to be out of the country for a while, and forgot about my promise to review this product.

I have passed these products on to my kids, and they also have enjoyed them and praised them.  I like the construction, feel, extras, and especially the sound these products deliver.  This earbud set is no different.You get the standard black/red pouch, with two interior pockets, the six additional pairs of different-sized earbud tips including the super-squishy-moldable ones, a little hook-and-loop keeper for the cord, and a little clothing clip.  And the earbuds, too.The buds are clearly marked L and R, which I like.  The construction is meal, but the earbuds are not heavy.  Online under technical details the attribute “noise isolation” is listed.  It is not listed on the product packaging.  I note once again that this is a meaningless attribute, as there is no active action taking place with these earbuds; they are not “noise canceling,” like the very expensive, active Bose headphones.  These earbuds isolate noise only by keeping it from your ears by overriding it with the signal from your device.The cord is “tangle-free,” thin, and appears braided, with some nice texture.  I had no problem with tangles.  There is no device or earbud control on the cord.  There also is no little device at the cord’s Y to snug the two separate cords up under your chin.Sound.  The box says, “Intense, Detailed Bass” as the first product attribute, so that’s what I auditioned them for, with Karl Denson’s rocking cover of “Seven Nation Army,” “Bust a Move,” “My City Was Gone,” Sanborn’s “Hideaway,” (live), Stanley Clarke’s “School Days,” and a few more.  The sound was good, clear and crisp, with a nice low-end thrum.The product documentation is sparse, as always, with a tiny card offering user info, warnings, and the warranty, with the flip side being the product registration/warranty card.Price: The regular price for this product is far too high.  The Prime price also seems somewhat spendy.Bottom line: this is another well made Brainwavz product, good materials and strong workmanship combining to provide a good earbud set with excellent sound reproduction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FPKRYNZKQ13S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I5FL1G#wasThisHelpful","R3FPKRYNZKQ13S","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.I like the design, the shape and size/dimensions reminiscent of the 2001: A Space Odyssey monolith, with that green on the bottom for some New Millennium flair (other colors available!).  This portable battery is thin and smooth, with a nice pseudo-rubberized exterior so it’s easy to grip.  That’s a good thing, as it has a shake-to-wake feature.  It has no on/off button; you just shake it.Interesting is that the status light shows a wonderful deep green when depleted and a nice, glowing, striking red when fully charged (with a nice cobalt blue in between).  This is a Chinese product, and of course, in China a deep, glowing red is always a good thing, so this makes sense.  But this product is being offered for sale in the West, where everything good is green, green means go and on, and red means danger and stop and off.  So just remember that for this product red is good.The flat, no-tangle charging cord comes in at about 21”; I’d like to see it a little bit longer, so you can set the battery on a table and still use a connected/charging device.  The cord ends are USB and Micro USB, so Apple users are going to have to get an adapter to make this thing work for their product.Use is highly intuitive; plug the cord into the respective outlets and let the battery charge or be charged.  It’s that simple.  I’ve had no problem with its charging or discharging.  It’s got plenty of juice left over after charging a phone.The documentation/user’s manual could be better.  It’s in both Chinese and English, mostly Chinese, and the English is not that great.  It’s passable, and the meaning is clear, but it could be better (see my Umu battery review).Bottom line: This is a nice portable battery, easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4G0T9I66O4KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VT3FMUK#wasThisHelpful","R4G0T9I66O4KI","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.Overall, I like this product, a lot.  It’s small, so it’s easy to carry, and it charges quickly and fully.  When providing charge to another device, it does so quickly and has some juice left over when done.The simple addition of both the lightning adapter (iPhone, etc.) and the Micro USB adapter (Androids) is very smart, which means both I and my kids can use this quickly and easily, as we all have different devices.  The lightning adapter just snaps onto the Micro USB, and you’re in business.  I would make one small design change, though: the addition of a graphic on both adapters to show how they line up, so to make it all go more quickly and prevent the mis-alignment of the two adapters and physical damage to either.There are four little status lights on the body of the battery; all four lighting up means it’s fully charged.  I like this simple design, but the lights are very tiny; a little bit bigger would be better.The USB-adapater cord comes in at at little more than 24”, so you’ve got room to set this on a nightstand and still work your phone in bed.The user’s manual is small, well written and clearBottom line: This is a great little portable battery, very easy to use, that charges up quickly and easily, holds that charge for a good long time, and then connects quickly and easily to a number of devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFQMI2HA2NJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YJ32LS#wasThisHelpful","ROFQMI2HA2NJZ","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve said it before: what’s the difference between weird and kinky?  Weird is when you use a feather; with kinky, you use the whole chicken.So, this is my 11th one of these, as I work my way through them all.  Sigh…15 still to go.The Alison Tyler intro is surprisingly sparse; it seems phoned it in, even ghost-written, too thick with story excerpts, with no real effort to say anything unique or interesting about what exactly kink is and is about.  The intro says only that it’s “the unexpected.”  That comes across as a cop-out.So, whaddaya get here?  Well, you get:• a lady who likes to be written upon—not a bad opener• some subtle sexual conditioning—not that kinky, more like psychological B&D• a whiny sub—it’s got a nice comic twist at the end, but is clearly B&D• some BDSM equine play--okay, sufficiently kinky• some Halloween costume play--nope, not really, more like dress-up/cosplay• some light watersport—okay, but disappointingly shallow• spanking--yawn• a senior citizen dirty story teller about a hot jazz nursey-dress-up—not bad, getting closer to kinky• an intense spinning class, with a penetrative twist--much better• a man become a coin-operated toy--better• spanking, again--yawn, again• a writing exercise playing on feline personification with BDSM—okay, if completely predictable• a plastic surgeon who gets off on sex n’ cars—think JG Ballard’s magnificent Crash, but dumbed way down, involving low-end hookers• some lesbian kleptomania and cutting—not badSome of this was kinda kinky, but a lot of it just wasn’t.  Sure, for the dull brown suit churchgoers in Middle America, this book is indisputable evidence of Satanic presence in daily life, but for anyone who’s read a book or two of adult fiction, this collection is not kinkily cutting it.  Where was the frottage, electro-stim, the adult baby fetish, immobilization, asphyxiation, the plushies, the really intense watersports story, statues and mannequins, bestiality, not to mention the subjects that I can’t mention here?  There’s a lot of wild and varied kinky out there, and this collection barely scratches the surface.Yeah, I get it: most folks don’t want to read that kind of way-out content.  This is book is mainstream, acceptable kink.I did find a couple choice lines, though: “…There would always be more [urine].  It was her birthright…” “’You’re kinky,’ says Leticia, ‘I appreciate that in a medical professional…’”Bottom line: this is entry-level kink, best for someone who is happy with vanilla sex and may wonder what kind of moderately acceptable additional activities may be had for the just-a-little sexually adventurous.  If you’re looking for real kink, unflinching adult fiction riffing on all of the really esoteric sexual proclivities out there, this one isn’t it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QA5IYFSTLNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1573443077#wasThisHelpful","R36QA5IYFSTLNO","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is a pair of ambidextrous oven mitts.  Both are identical, to include the little clothing hanging loop.Yep, they work very well on hot items, both on the stove top and especially for items going into/coming out of the oven.I had no problem with the fit; I usually wear a men's size Large glove.  These may be a bit loose on ladies with small hands.The neoprene business end of the mitts is not very flexible.  They could use a little bit of modification in the construction to put a small break in the thumb at the 2/3 point and the same for the fingers to allow these mitts to be more flexible and increase their utility.  I understand that this alteration would make them somewhat more expensive.turning the mitts a little inside out, I see the interior construction, while not exactly shoddy, is not that detailed.  Te cross-hatch/diamond sewing pattern on the lower part of the mitts did not line up very well, and this was reflected on the inside.  There is some excess cloth where the seams were cut, and this is shedding both the cotton covering and the polyster fill.  This was evident on the first (separate) wash, which is recommended in the care label of both mitts.  This construction doesn't necessarily compromise these mitts, as they are for home-kitchen purposes; they are not a fashion item.Both have held up well in the wash, with no splitting of seams or shedding of the internal padding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ZIORUEQH4XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R944U#wasThisHelpful","R23ZIORUEQH4XO","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return, and received it at a large discount.This is not a bad product at all.  I’ve seen lots of sprocket-and-chain-inspired jewelry, and it’s pretty hard to get really creative with bicycle chain, but this one comes off pretty nicely.  It is a simple and relatively understated piece.  The metal has a nice shine, and the colored sections are well done.  It’s a nice feature of the product that you have color choices.This is a relatively heavy piece of jewelry.  It does not “clink” or make a lot of noise, but there is some subtle metallic ring to it as you wear it.  It has some play in it, but given the nature of the interlocking bicycle chain parts, it is also relatively stiff, meaning that it bends in only one direction and most definitely does not twist at all.It arrived in a nice presentation box, wrapped diligently in cling-plastic that was infuriatingly tedious to pull off.The product description says, “Function:Anti-Radiation.”  What in the world is that all about?I note that I received the blue-silver model, and the one I received indeed was that, but the actual blue is very, very dark, at first glance easily mistaken for black.  In bright light and if turned to the side the blue does come through.Fit.  I’m a 52-year-old guy, and this fits just fine.  By my measurement, this would comfortably  fit a wrist up to 8”.  The overall length of the bracelet comes in at just a little over 8 ”.My son digs this bracelet, and has laid claim to it.Bottom line: If you’re a guy that goes in for man-jewelry, you could do a lot worse than this item.

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.This is a simple cubic zirconia pendant in a snowflake pattern.  The product description of it as 1.4cm in diameter is accurate.  It is not that big, so gets credit in the small-and-understated-elegance department.  The necklace has a 5cm-long section through which you can adjust your fit.I’m no diamond or QZ expert, but the pendant has a very nice sparkle to it, its total of 15 stones throwing off some nice, eye-catching glints.I note that buying a couple of these and altering them a bit to be matching earrings would be a pretty cool move.  Or buy three, make two earrings, and wear the other as part of matching three-piece set.My daughter likes this piece, and has claimed it.Bottom line: This is a nice little piece of costume jewelry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TD25U0NL8J97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1WUGVU#wasThisHelpful","R1TD25U0NL8J97","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note first that you can't just buy one box, as we Vine Voices received.  You can only buy this in a lot of ten boxes, which comes in at just a little over $65 (as currently priced).  So,that's about $6.50 for one box, and a truly miniscule $06.5 per sheet.  That's a pretty good price for these sheets, which are highly durable and relatively reusable.  They perform well when wet and don't melt down into glop in no time flat.Note that this lot of ten boxes comes in at more than 22 pounds, so make sure you're getting free shipping.Each sheet measures 17"" x 9"".I used these wipes for everyday cleaning around the house, particularly in the bathroom and in the kitchen.  They held up very well, with one usually easily handling the entire cleaning job.  They wring out well and dry pretty quickly.  I did put one through the washing machine for a test, where it did in fact come apart--they are not THAT reusable.The box has a perforated pullout for dispensing, which also serves as a simple carrying handle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDN75GU7P5XD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040ZOFW0#wasThisHelpful","RBDN75GU7P5XD","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.For less than $20 this is an excellent starter kitchen set.  You get 11 well-made and durable products you will use just about every day.  But there are a few minor problems.You get five steel nesting measuring spoons, from ¼ teaspoon to 1 full tablespoon.  They’ve also got metric notation on them, which is nice, and expected.  All are connected by a split ring to keep them all together.You get five steel nesting measuring cups, from ¼ cup to one full cup.  For some strange reason, they do not have metric measurements on them like the spoons do; someone was smart enough to do it with the spoons, so why not on the measuring cups?  That just don’t make no sense.  I like the cups because they resemble little saucepans.  They’re also all connected by a split ring, so you can keep track of them.The glass measuring cup is also a puzzle: both sides have the exact same graduation, with 100-500 mL on one side and 4 to 16 ounces on the left, with a little ½ liter line above.  Where is the notation for cups?  What about pints?  The box says it’s a two-cup measuring cup, but there is no indication on the cup where exactly that two cups is.  This is a surprisingly incompetent oversight on the part of Teikis design and manufacturing—how could someone not notice this and do something about it?  Also, the glass carries no official glass manufacturing logos, such as Pyrex.All of the metal items were completely smooth and free of burrs.  There was some manufacturing debris on them; make sure you give these a good wash first.I can confirm that all items are indeed fully dishwasher safe, as stated on the box.  I have successfully used the glass measuring cup in the microwave, although I’m unsure if it’s okay to do so—there is nothing on the box or in the online product description that states this is the case.  This is another pretty basic oversight on the part of Teikis, either to make the item microwave safe, or at least just tell us yes or no on the question.Bottom line: This is a nice basic kitchen set that is seriously compromised by some very basic mistakes: the lack of metric markings on the measuring cups, the lack of full markings on the measuring cup, the question of microwave use for the glass cup.  It doesn’t ruin the set, but these little things shouldn’t be there in the first place.  Some minor design and manufacturing changes could fix this pretty quickly; I’m quite surprised no one caught these things before this went into production.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EKMJBH1FY2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SABJXJA#wasThisHelpful","R29EKMJBH1FY2Q","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product. I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.This Jolly Gear jump rope set is being sold here by Bella Naturals/Naturalico, but as far as I can tell, it is almost exactly the same as the jump rope set I reviewed in April 2014, strangely enough logo'd as ""Naturalico.""  So, here is that review, modified just a little, which applies fully to this one, except for this set the ""rope"" itself is coated in clear red plastic (they do offer a nice choice of colors).This set also comes with two extra rubber nubs for the end of the rope/wire and two extra thumbscrew sets for the end of the wire--nice.The black nylon bag has a Jolly Gear stencil on it, as do the two black handles.So, here's my original review, for what seems to be the exact same product, under a different vendor name:I'm not a boxer or a serious health nut, just an older guy who needs to get in better shape. This proved to be a nice diversion from the traditional exercise routine, an exercise activity I have not undertaken in many a year. It's easy to do, and this product was a nice way to do it. And yeah, it gives you one helluva workout.I've never experienced an adjustable jump rope before, and this impressed me. You can adjust the rope length by way of twin thumbscrew-locking keepers at each end of the rope. The ""rope"" is really plastic-coated braided wire, so some serious shears are needed if you're going to modify it.  There are little plastic/rubber caps on each end, which are not glued on, so you can use them again if you choose to shorten your rope.The logo'd handles each have two separate bearings in them to keep the rope moving and untangled. Flawless performance here.I was worried about rope wear, but a number of sessions on both smooth and rough concrete showed no real wear. Of course, if you're jumping the hell out of this thing, sooner or later you're going to wear it out. Bug given its price, it would not be that much of a burden to get a new one.And it comes with a nice little logo'd nylon bag with a barrel-lock closure. Nice way to take this on the road with you for a portable workout.Price.  The regular price of about $20 seems right for this product, so it's great to see it down to less than $13.  That's a good deal for this product.  Given the components I figured it would be closer to $25.And for all you international contract assassins out there, the rope can be used as a handy garrote. Neato!Bottom line: This is a nice compact bit of training gear, easy to use and easy to transport, at a more than reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JN0R7ZTKFSSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YIAWCO0#wasThisHelpful","R2JN0R7ZTKFSSU","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yeah, I’m a big, hairy man, but I’m secure enough to state that this stuff smells great.  It pumps easily from the original bottle (or any pump bottle you may choose to use).  It washes up well, cleaning quickly and thoroughly, and then rinses quickly and without a slippery residue.  The best part is that when you’re done your hands smell just like this soap.True decadence would be to use this as your bathing soap.Price: This bottle comes in at about $20.  That’s spendy.  But then again, it’s got great indegrients, and it’s imported from France.  This is not knockoff soap; this is the real deal, and you get what you pay for.  Our family of three has already gone through about half of this bottle, which means for more than a month this single (roughly) 17-ounce bottle will wash bathroom hands.  If you look at it that way, the value isn’t really that far out of whack.Bottom line: This is a very luxurious, maybe even decadent, product.

"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.Overall, this is a nice pair of budget binoculars.  Even DBPower themselves say they are “pretty well built.”In the box you get: The binos, with pliable “rubbery” covers for both the eyepieces and opposite ends A thin nylon neck strap (not shown in the product images) A one-page “manual” A carrying case with nylon shoulder strap A small lens clothThe binos have a nice feel in the hands, with some nice ergonomic ridges built into the rubber housing cover to help grip.  They adjust to size easily and quickly.  Both the eye ring and the binos also adjust quickly and easily, all of them nice and smooth.The main selling point is they are purported to be “waterproof.”  Of course, nothing is waterproof, and not wanting to inadvertently ruin this item, I did not rigorously test the moisture permeability of this product.  I will provide updates as needed as this items gets a more thorough workout.It takes some work to get the loose neck strap through the slots on the binos—this took far longer than it should have.The case is a thin, pseudo-padded neoprene, and its nylon shoulder strap adjusts fully.  The shoulder strap is not removable.  The case closes with a single centered 3” velcro strip.  A nice addition to the carrying case would be a couple of nylon belt loops on the backside, so that you could put this onto your belt, or strap easily to the outside of a pack.The owner’s manual is just an 8 ½” x 11” piece of paper, folded in eighths.  It’s in English, French, German and Italian.  The English text is better than I expected, more or less correct in syntax, usage, grammar, spelling and punctuation.  The word spacing is out to lunch, though.Not mentioned in the manual is a screw-in mounting for a tripod.  This is located at the front of the binos, along the axle.  I’m not too sure how this would work exactly, to screw onto a tripod through the very front of the binos; I guess you’re going to have a multi-directional mounting head…Price: Less than $40 for a pair of nicely functional and notionally weather-proof binos is a pretty good deal.Bottom line: This is a nice pair of entry-level binoculars.

"I saw this 1972 movie in the main post theater at Fort Riley, Kansas in mid-1975, for a whopping 25 cents.  Somehow this title and a few choice images and scenes stuck with me all these years, so I find myself once again drawn, as if by some dark, unseen force...that I cannot comprehend or control...from beyond the depths of oblivion, erh, ah...back into this screen gem for the first time in 40 years.Yeah, it's pretty low-budge.  But a fun low-budge passing of an hour and a half.Plot: Assorted post-flower child hippies and stereotypical California drifters end up commune-like in a Topanga Canyon mansion, and a super-hip guru steps in to help lead them onto another path to immortality, by turning them into vampires.You get the entire stock hippie rainbow here, the bearded dude in the bib overalls, the bard with the guitar, the flower girl, the flouncy Hispanic girl in a peasant blouse (non-speaking role), the pseudo-Beatnik in her shockingly tiny waist, midriff shirt and tight pants, the big-afro chick in a tight turtleneck with a big colorful scarf around it, no less, a fuzzy and sunglassed biker dude, and our ""hero"" with his modified hippie Prince Valiant haircut and as Frank Zappa famously said in ""Who Needs the Peace Corps?,"" ""a leather band to go around [his] head.""  All the ladies support the full palette of early 70s eye shadow, lots of seaform green and sky blue--far out, man.The bad guy is bearded and smooth and well-dressed kind of like an Arabian sheik with some Indian pasha and Jesus robes thrown in, with a very heavy layer of Charlie Manson crazy eyes (and the beard).  This is Topanga Canyon, after all.  The vampire's trusted helper, his hippie Renfield, if you will, is a dashiki-wearing dude with his very own cool-70s theme percussion by the name of Barbado; it seems that Clarence Williams III was busy, or most likely too expensive, so they went with his smaller-fro'd, non-union counterpart.  There is a lot of laughable stock 70s terminology, delivered horribly, about where your head's at, goin' on your trip, getting' it together, man, etc.You get the contemporary soft focus of waves and the sun and heartfelt folk music about life and spirituality and stuff.  You get a teeny-tiny bit of nudity in the form of a single female bare backside.  And when the vampires finally do their horror thing, you get the traditional 1950s/1960s ultra-schlocky white-face makeup and that stereotypical evil eyes and open-mouth-to-show-the-vampire-fangs gawping of the traditional movie-vampire menace.The plot holes are massive and start right from the opening minutes, with vampires apparently unable to open doors or go down stairs...and able to go out during the day.  But it's all over and done in a mere 94 minutes, so you can get on to something more cinematically worthwhile.The only real name star you're going to get is the nicely doomed Pop, played by John Fiedler (b. 1925, d. 2005).  You'll remember him as the similarly doomed Chief Hengist, unfortunately possessed by Redjac in the Star Trek TOS episode ""Wolf in the Fold"" (that's Episode 36, for those of you keeping score at home).  I guess you could cite the lead, Robert Quarry, as a name actor, but his star had risen and mostly fallen by the time this came out.As an American International Pictures film, yes, you do get the traditional schlocky-horror dark-and-cloudy nighttime sky with the cheezy lightning bolts.  Kinda like a visual Wilhelm Scream.Bottom line: This is prime B-list horror from the early 70s, updating the traditional vampire bit to the fading culture of Flower Power and the cult horrors of the Manson era.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen (Madonna's Swept Away remake), but it's also not the best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19A3JCSXLS9A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R79E04#wasThisHelpful","R19A3JCSXLS9A5","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the good, er, jolly folks at Jolly Gear and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.This review is for the single, black “Medium” (two-dot) resistance band.  The product page could use some additional explanation and better management/standardization of product images.  You’ll see the prices increase from left to right, as the bands increase in thickness and strength; lightest/cheapest band is on the left with the heaviest/most expensive on the right.First off, no, it does not come with the coins, as shown…This is a pretty simple product, a big rubber band.  If you’re a home slingshot hobby enthusiast, this might be just the kind of thing you need to outfit your ultimate mega-slingshot.  But I digress…The band comes in at about 40” long, and it’ll stretch as far as you need it to.  I go 6’4” and had no issues with the length or stretchiness of the product.  Yes, indeed, as you stretch it farther, the resistance increases.  Nice how physics works, eh?Function: I did not attempt to use this for pull-up assistance, but instead used it for a series of arm, shoulder and leg workouts.  This product’s utility is limited only by your imagination, whether you use it in/around your body or you tie it off on a fixed object.Price: At close to $14 for a big rubber band, it seems expensive.  But this is well manufactured, with no seams and consistent texture and uniformity, so this price does not seem too far off.  A full set of all six of these bands, though, is going to run you more than $150.Bottom line: This is an extremely simple device, well manufactured, that serves a multitude of exercise purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPLWTXMDCRRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW2H2M8#wasThisHelpful","R2HPLWTXMDCRRN","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.  The ASIN on the package I received is different from the ASIN on this page, but this is the only pair of Ixion gloves that I could find that matched…Disclaimer: I’m not weightlifting stud, at least not anymore.  I go intermittently at home with some barbells and a heavy bar with variable weights.  That being said, these gloves are a nice addition to the activity.  The 16-year-old rugby player-son also digs these gloves and has claimed them for his gym workouts.First, I just plain like the look of these gloves.  Nice color combination and accenting.Fit: I got them in Large, and this is just about right.  They fit snug, so they’re easy on but take a little of effort to get off, a little bit more effort with sweaty hands after working out.  The addition of a sizing chart on this product’s page would be a good idea.  The fingers go right to the second knuckle, while the fit goes a little over the knuckle on the thumb.Function: they are intuitive to figure out, wrist wrapping and all.  The glove wrist closure is adjustable with a Velcro closure.  The wrap goes around—depending on your size—twice.  I’ve found that the wrist wrap also doubles as a good way to bind both gloves together for storage/travel.Materials:  Good mix of leather, rubber padding and grip assistance and nylon mesh for breathing.Construction: the palm is all leather with some nice ergonomic padding and rubber grip assistance.  The front of the fingers is all leather with padding and some rubber grippies, with the sides in mesh for ventilation.  The back of the gloves is all leather, with some nice articulated construction to assist movement and it has some mesh channels for ventilation.  The back of the thumb is all mesh for ventilation.Price: at less than $22, these gloves are a good deal.  I like the materials and construction, they fit well, feel good, and I have confidence that they will do what they are supposed to and last for a while.  Even if they wear out in a year, at this price it’s a good deal.Bottom line: These are really nice weightlifting gloves, well constructed and padded, which feel good on and work just like they’re supposed to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5DCET56AF81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD8JV8S#wasThisHelpful","RU5DCET56AF81","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I was contacted by the manufacturer and offered this product.  I accepted, promising a fair and honest review in return.First off, the leash I received is not 6’ long; it is 5’, and that’s even giving a couple of inches for the brass connector at the end.This is a nice, simple leash that would be suitable for taking your dog out in public.The leash is all-leather, and the leather is well cut, nicely trimmed, uniform in width and thickness throughout, with no imperfections or warping.  Both the handle and the connector-end have a nice flair of four braids.  This means that there is no sewing; there is nothing physically securing the handle or the dog-end of the leash except for that little strip ¼” of leather.  I would think that over time this might wear and eventually tear, and then you’d be faced with a repair; we will have to see how this fares and how long it lasts.On the first few uses with a 95-pound black lab, the braids tightened somewhat, but not a great deal.  There does not appear to be a great deal of stress upon the end-portions of the braids. It looks like the handle end will be the part receiving the most stress.  Time will tell.At the end there is a nice heavy brass spring connector on swivel.Price: at less than $20, this seems to be a pretty good deal.  The materials appear to be good quality and other than my concern over the longevity of the braids, this seems to be a good value for what you get.Bottom line: This is a nice, simple five-foot-long leather dog leash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARNVF5BQSLKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X087YBC#wasThisHelpful","R3ARNVF5BQSLKG","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 1981 original release of a seminal song in French popular music, basically the introduction of US-style rap en Francais.What exactly is this guy rappin’ about?  I have no idea; my specialty is German and Indonesian.  Apparently the title comes across as “I do whatever I want to do,” or something similar.  Actually, it doesn’t matter, as it’s a catchy tune, is interesting and fun, and, yes, you can dance to it.  Having rediscovered this song after not hearing it even one time in close to 30 years, it holds up pretty well.I used to play this song on the campus radio at Washington University in St. Louis, and it was way popular with the kids of the time…who also didn’t understand its lyrics.Bottom line: This is ancient Euro-pop at its best, just like jazz and rock ‘n roll before, taking an American musical innovation (rap) and making it their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HVDIQZ4FHH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064ZHN64#wasThisHelpful","R16HVDIQZ4FHH4","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: Simple, Sterile CoverThis is a peaceful instrumental cover of the 1978 10cc classic about a Jamaican holiday that doesn’t quite go as planned.When I see “orchestra” in a group’s name, I anticipate big sound.  Now, for this original song, a white reggae tune led by a single rhythm guitar with a little bass and a vocal, I was looking forward to something alternative, something with a big fat orchestral sound.  Nope.At a duration of 4:09 it comes in about 13 seconds shorter than the original.  Given that this is, I believe, an artistic cover/interpretation of the original, I was thinking it would go longer.  Actually, I’m thinking it should go longer, by maybe offering an interesting solo, a change in instrumentation/arrangement, another key change, something.  But sadly, no.You get some good cowbell from the outset and throughout, some nice, quiet, peaceful organ and vibes, with that signature rhythm guitar twanging steadily throughout.  You get the same change in key of the original, and it’s on to the board fade, nothing special, nothing soaring, nothing spewing fireworks or excitement or really any kind of musical flair.Bottom line: This is a nice, simple, instrumental cover of a rock classic, best suited to your karaoke library for you to add the vocals and therefore the musical fun that this cover is lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KRKSJI8NNYPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067T1HZA#wasThisHelpful","R3KRKSJI8NNYPE","A38VQ2TIPPBKNN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38VQ2TIPPBKNN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fascinating read, but you definitely need to read the first Wildestern Saga book first.  There are just too many plot elements that will be difficult to understand without the background of the much earlier book.With that in mind, this book set in an alternate Victorian England is an absolute winner.  It's a superb mystery for teens and hey, adults will enjoy it too.  Writing is skillful and plotting is quite good.  Characters are all believable.

"I learned to like pomegranates as a kid although I considered eating them to be a bit of work to get such a short burst of flavor.  During the last few years, I've become fond of pomegranate juice.This is the first pomegranate candy I've tasted and it's certainly a winner.  Coated with dark chocolate, there's a wonderful balance of flavors.  The rich dark chocolate flavor blends wonderfully with the sharp fruit flavor.  It was my honest intention to make this bag last for a week, but my mistake was to have the bag too close to my reading chair, with the result that I'm finishing the bag in five days.  I love the pomegranate taste and am glad the flavor is finally being used in candy.As an irrelevant aside, no I'm hoping soft drink manufacturers discover pomegranate...maybe Pepsi could come out with a pom flavored Mountain Dew....or a pom flavored Dr. Pepper might work.

"This isn't as bad as some of these reviews indicate.  On the other hand, it certainly isn't as good as the one 5 star review indicates.  It is a helicopter, not a drone.  It looks cheap and flimsy but it does fly.  It does need to be handled gingerly because it looks and feels like it would be easily damaged.  I'm not sure why it's labelled for inside use only.  It does work outside.It seems to be overpriced.  I wouldn't expect it to be priced over $25.  All in all, seems to be okay, but if I had paid for it rather than receiving it for review purposes, I wouldn't be too happy with it.

"Please note!!! Many of the reviews posted here are incorrectly referencing a Belkin HDMI switcher for a home entertainment system. This 3-port headset switch has NOTHING to do with HDMI or TVs/consoles, so any poor reviews mentioning HDMI have been incorrectly posted here and do not reflect this product.As for my review, I love this little switch. It was very easy to set up with my Windows 10 PC for Skype calls, my iPhone 6 Plus and my in-home landline. This has simplified my life in a big way. The device itself has a very small footprint and tucks nicely under the edge of my monitor in a way that still allows me to access the buttons without it taking up any space. I wear my bluetooth headset (Plantronics Voyager Legend, love love love) and can answer any call with it using this amazing little switch. It doesn't matter if the call comes in over the house phone, iPhone or PC, I can receive and make all calls from one headset without having to say ""Hang on!!!"" while I make the caller wait to set up my headset if it was previously paired with a different device. It seems like such a small thing but it's made a huge difference in the few weeks I've had it already. It's definitely a necessity for anyone who spends a lot of time with phone or video chat communication on a daily basis, be it for business or otherwise. I find myself wishing I had one of these for all my bluetooth devices as pairing and unpairing becomes a huge hassle when you're sharing bluetooth over multiple devices and machines. Having this effectively eliminates the need to have multiple headsets like I was using previously. Great little device and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DS2GP2MO57TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNN81RC#wasThisHelpful","R2DS2GP2MO57TK","A1P0JSFW184ZXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P0JSFW184ZXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent addition to your whitening regimen. I have had professional whitening done by my dentist, followed up by the ""cheap"" at home solutions used with my professional dentist tray to keep my teeth white as they do start to fade over time, regardless of whether you had it done at a dentist or not. Usually whitening toothpaste keeps the whiteness going for a good while longer than regular toothpaste, but I found this to be absolutely the best whitening product I've tried. After a brush in the morning, I feel there's definitely an improvement over my prior all-in-one (including whitening) toothpaste. The first step is a deep cleaning whitening toothpaste and there's a clear improvement after this step, but the real improvement comes with the finisher in step 2, which Crest calls a ""whitening finisher."" I noticed a very clear improvement immediately after brushing. I don't think this is intended to whiten teeth that haven't been treated before, but as a touch up for previously treated teeth and as a followup to the excellent Crest 3D Luxe whitening strips, this is a great product and one I'm definitely keeping in my cabinet.

It bolts directly to the frame of your trailer with ease and has everything you need for a tire change.

"It has a strong smell so I notice it all the time. I was willing to overlook this if my girls liked it, but they don't. They are 2.5 years old and have been fed fresh fruit and veggies their entire lives, so I guess I'm not surprised that they don't love this dry, hard kibble. I need to leave them home for a few days while I go on a short trip as I'm not able to take them with me as I usually do, and thought this would fill in nicely as I can't leave fresh food out for that many days without it spoiling. I mixed this up with dried meal worms, dried fruit and sunflower seeds to give them a variety to munch on while I'm gone and wanted to test it out before I leave. Unfortunately, they devoured everything BUT these pellets.I don't want to preach, but if you have exotic animals like sugar gliders, you need to be prepared to feed them properly. Their teeth are not meant to bite into or chew hard foods like this, and no kibble is going to give them the balanced diet that they need. They need real, fresh fruit, veggies and nuts on a daily basis as chewing on hard kibble hurts their teeth and gums. If you can get your glider to eat this, please only use it as a temporary filler when fresh food is not available, such as my case when you're out of town and can't bring them with you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E25DG7I0PA5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006L2VZ0#wasThisHelpful","R1E25DG7I0PA5A","A1P0JSFW184ZXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P0JSFW184ZXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the smaller SteelSeries Stratus for almost a year now, and while I have loved it, this Stratus XL feels soooo much better in my hands. It feels weighty and well built, very similar to an Xbox One/360 controllers with very similar button layout. The only difference is the D-pad and left joystick are swapped, more akin to the PS4 Dual Shocks. The shoulder buttons are almost identical to the Xbox One so it feels very familiar right off the bat. The smaller Stratus controller is fantastic for portable use, but nothing beats a full size controller for comfort and familiarity. Pairing is very simple and the battery indicator lets you know when you're running low and need to replace your 2 AA's. Controls are quick and responsive. I've never noticed any lag at all when playing games on my iPad either directly or via my Apple TV. In this generation of mobile gaming, there are so many good games out there that take full advantage of the Stratus XL and more are jumping on the bandwagon all the time. If you're at all into gaming on your tablet or phone, you owe it to yourself to pick one of these up.

"My golden loves this so much and I am so impressed with the ingredients and the honesty of this company that I may be switching over permanently. My golden has about half high quality kibble and half ""human"" food and she is extremely healthy and energetic, but I admit I have always felt some guilt over giving her dry kibble. No matter how much you spruce it up or how high quality the ingredients are, it's still dry kibble. She gets a variety of foods daily in addition to the kibble, usually a portion of our family meals, but there are times when she is just bored with the dry dog food and won't eat it. It's always good to switch up your dog's diet because too much of anything is never good, but no matter how many different types of kibble you give your dog, it's still kibble.I fed my dogs raw before my son was born, but ever since then, I've been very hesitant to handle raw meat in my home. I can just never be 100% sure that I've cleaned up enough to prevent illness. While I still hold that Blue Buffalo Wilderness is one of the best dry dog foods you can give your dog, ""real"" healthy food is always better. This is the first time I've ever seen a dog food that is FDA approved and considered human grade quality. At first the price seems ludicrous, but when you realize that after preparation it makes four times that amount, it's more economical. It's still pricey but not much more than the top quality dry brands out there. I'd like to see the price come down to be more comparable with top brands so more people are tempted to try it out. My golden loves it so much and I'm thrilled about the quality of the ingredients, and giving wet food is better for digestion. I really have no reasons to not love it. I'm sold!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UTMXQJR5GSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DD6#wasThisHelpful","R36UTMXQJR5GSV","A1P0JSFW184ZXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P0JSFW184ZXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very picky golden that needs to be fed different things each day or she will stop eating. Even the very best top quality kibble doesn't satisfy her if she's been eating the same thing for days, so she will just refuse to eat it. To combat this, she always receives something in addition to her kibble, usually something from the meals the rest of the family is eating, like chicken, steak, etc. I found this to be a simple way to spice up her food but it definitely won't replace giving her actual ""real"" food. She seems to enjoy it thoroughly, and the ingredient list is indeed impressive, but I'm confused about how a dry kibble could be considered ""raw."" Raw is highly beneficial because it contains the nutrients in their raw form, with nothing lost to the cooking or preparation process. This is why eating raw fruits and veggies is better for you than canned which not only contain preservatives and usually added sugar, they also lose some of their nutritional value. I understand they freeze dry it to preserve all the goodness of the food, but it still just doesn't make sense in my mind that anything other than true fresh, raw food can be called raw. In any sense though, she loves it and it appears to be of quality ingredients, so it's a nice extra little treat for her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68L8WX7JT12B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWPHX9K#wasThisHelpful","R68L8WX7JT12B","A1P0JSFW184ZXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P0JSFW184ZXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I complaind to my doctor that I had chronic diarrhea that came and went, e.g. I'd be bad for a few days, then not so bad for a few days, and then bad again (I think you know what I mean by ""bad"").  He asked me if my stool smelled. I paused and re-examined the medical degree he has hanging on the wall. Of course it smells. What he meant was, really, really smelled. I reconsidered leaving him and answered yes. He got an ""ah ah"" look on his face and said that I needed to take a probiotic because the increased odor was a sign that I must have had some sort of problem that cleared up but my body wasn't producing good bacteria fast enough to overtake the bad bacteria. So, I started taking a probiotic every day.If you aren't currently taking a probiotic you have my sympathies because you're probably researching the subject and I suspect that you're as confused as I was. With most medications, if I can call this that, my doctor gives me a script and I have it filled at the pharmacy. Simple. But not the case with over the counter products. I was on my own. I was using Philips probiotics and was pleased with the results. My diarrhea subsided, cramping went away and I wasn't as gassy as I was before not to mention there were fewer stinkers (sorry, I'm trying to keep this as family friendly as possible).I used some Viva Laps products in the past and was pleased with the quality and effectivenes. When I was offered their probiotic I didn't hesitate and started taking it instead of the Philips product. I haven't noticed a difference, which is a good thing because I was doing well.Will I permanently switch to the Viva Labs product over the Philips? I don't know.

"Not long ago I built a MeccaNoid G15 KS along with my able sidekicks - an 11 year old and a 13 year old.  The KS is identical to this robot except the KS is four feet tall and this one is two feet tall.  That build went well and you can see my review, and others, on that product page.Meccano MeccaNoid G15 KS.Building this robot wasn't quite as challenging for two reasons. First, it's smaller so there weren't as many parts and second, we learned a lot from the first build. That said the instructions, complemented with youtube videos, were pretty clear. It's hard to mess up and when you do it becomes obvious pretty quickly. Even though this was our second robot build we did have to take a leg apart to fix an error.I think it helps if you do a few things. First, we unpacked everything and got them organized.  There are a lot of screws and nuts and we kept those in plastic containers. The other parts were put together by the name used in the instructions.  Second, we put aside the entire day to work. It turned out we didn't need the entire day but it was nice not feeling rushed because we had to do or go somewhere else. Third, read the reviews, watch the youtube videos, etc.  Just search for MeccaNoid G15 and you're going to find a lot of useful information (OK, some of it isn't very useful).  Finally, patience matters, especially when you're building this with a youngster.  We walked away from it a few times.We had fun building it together but that was nothing compared to the fun when you finish.  We did some quick testing and found that we had one servo wired incorrectly. Fixed that and the little guy was ready to go.  He's (or is it a she? - you decide) easy to control and the app (iPhone and Android) is easy to use.FYI - I saw the KS fully assembled at a local Brookstone store at the mall. It was more expensive than Amazon but if you want to see the robot live you can check and see if your local store has one on the floor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2Z8S46284G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY40EKO#wasThisHelpful","R1S2Z8S46284G6","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two older dogs that have gotten a bit overweight and since they aren't as active as they used to be I try to control their weight with food. I thought this food would be an alternative to the food I was using but it's not going to be a temporary or permanent replacement.Both dogs walked up their bowls, sniffed it, looked at me with their ""what is this?"" look, and then slowly started eating. I think it was more because they were hungry than anything else. Neither one of them finished their meal and that's very unusual.Although the description of this product led me to believe that the first ingredient is chicken it's not. After I read the description a few more times it hit me that they were describing the weight maintenance product and then added a short blurb about the weight control product; in my mind I put the two together. As I write this Eukanuba hasn't listed the ingredients for the product. I took a picture of the bag but I apologize for the quality. White letters on a pink bag are difficult to capture but I think you'll get the idea.  The first ingredient is corn meal followed by chicken by-product (I don't even want to know what that is but I'm guessing it isn't meat).  That's followed by simply ""chicken"" and then a long list of grains and things I can't pronounce.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDCL3H0YK21Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ML7YO#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDCL3H0YK21Z","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Part of my rehab is to occasionally treat myself to some very good chocolate and this bar fits that requirement just fine.While this brand may not be as recognizable in the US as other Swiss chocolates I think it's as good as the others that I've tried. The milk chocolate is smooth and doesn't have that waxy feel and taste you get with popular US brands like Hershey and Mars. I find it comparible to Lindt and Ghirardelli.

"I've been using a Tech Solutions shredder for the past seven or eight years. It's been fine but it has some quirks and it doesn't do a good a job as it used to.This shredder is essentially a shredder (motor, controls, blades) that sits on top of an included plastic trash container that's been customized for use. The controls are simple enough. It's pretty much on/off, forward/backward.  There's also an overheat and bin full indicator. After you attach the top and plug it in you're ready to go. It turns on automatically when you feed it and stops when it's finished.A few observations.It's much quieter than my old shredder. That's not to say it's quiet but you can hold a conversation while it's running.There's a window on the side of the container so you have an idea of how full it is.A very nice feature is the ability to compact your cuttings. You just unlock the top, remove the power cord and push down. A nice feature that doesn't leave a mess.Emptying the container is also simple. Remove the top and dump the container into a trash bag. With my old shredder I had to slide the container out to empty it which always made a mess.The slit for feeding paper is just over 8 1/2 inches; if you have anything larger you're going to have to fold it and you are going to have to pay attention when you feed it.While I was able to feed it 12 sheets of standard 20 pound paper it did groan and slow down a bit when I did. Ten sheets went as smoothly as one.I'm happy with this. I'm not sure I'd use it in a high volume setting like an office but for a good, well built home or home office shredder it does the trick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDZTVOSMQVZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FD2QYY#wasThisHelpful","R3PDZTVOSMQVZQ","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did an unfair comparison of this soundbar to my much more expensive home theater system and wish I wouldn't have because the Definitive Technology product fared pretty well for a lot less money and real estate.My family room has a fairly new Samsung 60 inch 4K TV. It's connected to an Onkyo TX-NR838 receiver which sends audio out to a 5.1 Aperion Audio speaker system that includes a dual 8 inch powered subwoofer.  I have all of my inputs going into the Onkyo so the video is sent to the TV from the receiver and the sound is sent out to the speakers and subwoofer.  My inputs include cable TV, an Oppo BD player, and two game consoles.  I also use the receiver to play music from my media player and from the Internet. For this test I connected everything directly to the TV and then connected the TV to the soundbar, i.e., I took the Onkyo and Aperion speakers out of the equation.Setup:  Very easy. Simply unpack the soundbar, subwoofer, and accessories (cables, remote) and hook everything up.  A basic manual is included (note, it's under the Styrofoam in a black folder that you're bound to overlook).  You can download a more extensive manual from Definitive Technology's website.  I installed the soundbar on a cabinet under the TV but if you're going to wall mount it you should be aware that the power cable that goes from the soundbar to the brick is 56 inches long. There's an additional 6 feet (roughly) of power cable coming out of the brick at the other end to go into a wall receptacle. All of the connections on the back of the soundbar are side-mounts so you shouldn't have any gaps between the soundbar and the wall with a bit of pre-planning on where to drill the hole in the wall.  the soundbar also comes with a very thin digital optical cable (about 6 1/2 feet). The soundbar has two keyhole slots for mounting.  Also keep in mind that the pairing buttons are on the back of the soundbar.  If you're going to connect to your home WiFi you will probably want to connect it before you mount it to the wall.Basic Use:  I tried this out with cable TV before I connected it to WiFi.  The soundbar found the wireless subwoofer with no problem and began giving me more than decent audio from a television program.  The front panel isn't annoying at all - you won't even know it's there.  When you adjust the volume you'll see a row of LEDs light up and turn on/off as you increase or decrease the volume level; they disappear within a few seconds.  The included remote is probably a lot bigger than it needs to be but it does fit nicely into your hand. I do have a complaint about the remote - it's black and the lettering is an off-white and the + and - symbols are black but raised from the surface. It's very difficult to see in a low lit room and the buttons aren't back-lit.  In addition to power and volume control, the remote allows you to switch sources (2 optical and 1 aux), mute, switch between optimized settings for music or movie/tv, and adjust the subwoofer and center channel levels.  I plan on adding this soundbar to my Harmony Ultimate remote so it won't be a problem in the future.  FYI, the manual I downloaded from their website has all the remote codes if you run into a problem with your universal remote. I've included a picture of the remote.WiFi:  In order to connect directly to music sources you have to connect the soundbar to your home WiFi. After you download the Definitive Technology app (iPhone or Android) it will search for WiFi networks and PlayFi devices.  When it's done you can choose your source using the app and begin playing music.  I couldn't connect at first but after I put the soundbar back into pairing mode it all went OK.Sound: I realize this is very subjective but I'm impressed.  I've always found that my Onkyo/Aperion setup weren't doing a very good job of processing dialog from my cable box. The dialog from this soundbar is noticeably better.  I was getting some odd subwoofer sound that I didn't get with my 5.1 setup. Clearly the crossover between the Onkyo and the Definitive Technology soundbar aren't the same. I adjusted the subwoofer and the problem went away.  TV aside, I put it to the test listening to some music.  First I connected to my home media server. I have a few very poor quality recordings (ripped from CDs) on my server and the soundbar didn't make them sound any better. To be fair, neither did the Onkyo.  Streaming and digital downloads sounded much better.  Maybe not quite as good as my Onkyo/Aperion setup but not that you'd notice unless you were focusing on it.  My home theater system does a much better job with bass but my subwoofer cost about the same as this soundbar.  I'm not saying this subwoofer is bad I'm just saying that if you're an audiophile you may not be thrilled.  But, for the average person? No problem.For the real test I fired up the BD player.  My go-to test movie is the first five or so minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. With my Onkyo/Aperion system and the volume jacked up you feel like you're in the middle of the battle.  The Definitive Technology soundbar did an admirable job but I missed not having the rear speakers and, as I said earlier, the Aperion subwoofer does a better job.  If you've never had rears then you probably won't notice and you'll be much happier than listening to anything compared to your TV speakers.Overall, this is a nice, high end soundbar/sub combination. While you can certainly get less expensive alternatives I think you'll definitely notice the difference in sound and usability of this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOQZKI4LK3YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UXE2Q0#wasThisHelpful","RIOQZKI4LK3YP","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well made LED bulb that puts out a lot of light. But, it's a daylight white bulb meaning that it's a pretty bright white light. That's not a problem but if you're used to a soft white light you may not like the effect.I first tried this bulb in a reading lamp. No problems except, because of the design, most of the light went up. Obviously for reading I needed the light to go down and out. I had to put the CFL bulb back into that lamp for my needs.I found the perfect use for it in my living room. I have an accept spot that shines up from the floor and highlights a sculpture in that corner. The daylight white coupled with the light mostly coming from the top was perfect for this application.  I had a 100 watt incandescent bulb in that fixture and it's on a timer so it comes on for about 4 hours each day.  Getting about the same light output with 88 fewer watts is a definite plus. This bulb will save me a few dollars every year and last, by my calculations, about 14 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOCE887ZDJ4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5ADG7M#wasThisHelpful","R3TOCE887ZDJ4B","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife dropped her $50 sunglasses and the frame just under the lens snapped. The lens didn't come out but it was just a matter of time.  I thought about using glue but two problems - 1. if I used something like Gorilla glue I would have had to somehow clamp it until the glue cured. With rounded frames that's almost impossible. 2. if I used SuperGlue or Gorilla glue I would have to get the two pieces to touch each other and that wasn't possible.I saw Bondic advertised before and thought it was a clever idea. Since the sunglasses had a small space between the broken sides this seemed like the perfect solution since I could fill the space and I didn't need to clamp it.This is incredibly easy to use. Clean the two sides the best you can, squeeze the glue into the area and hold the ultraviolet light over it for a few seconds. You can actually see it cure.  For the sunglasses I had to apply the glue then cure it and then build on top of that layer. The entire repair took less than five minutes.  I noticed that the frame had some hairline cracks under the other lens. As long as I had everything out I applied some glue to that area as well to fill in the cracks that were eventually going to split.  I overfilled them which left a small lump on the frame but I used a nail file to smooth it out.  On both areas you have to look very closely to even notice that they were repaired.Yes, this product costs about 20 bucks but it just saved a $50 pair of sunglasses and there's plenty of glue left for future repairs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9TOAI4D50MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU5M4MG#wasThisHelpful","R3D9TOAI4D50MC","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is this dog food or a treat? I ask that somewhat in jest because of the reaction I'm getting to it from my two dogs. One of them will eat anything put in front of her. The other one is very picky so before I bother filling his bowl with new food I offer him some by hand to see if he goes into what  call ""cat mode"" and snub his nose at it and walk away. He not only devoured the first offering but kept begging for more.I'm happy that they both like the taste but, as their Lord and Master (ha!) I have a responsibility to make sure they are eating stuff that's good fr them. I'm not a dog nutritionist but it didn't take long for me to feel good about giving this food to them based on the ingredients, reviews here and elsewhere and just good old common sense.This is certainly a hit with me and the dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22B0QZXKE5RUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F57N8AC#wasThisHelpful","R22B0QZXKE5RUM","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two dogs. One would eat rotting tree bark (and has). The other is an extremely picky eater.  He'll even snub his nose at human food. It's possible he was a cat in a previous life.I always mix some canned food in with their kibble in the morning. They both devour it and, unbeknownst to them, they also eating some powered joint medicine that I mix in.The first time I mixed this with their kibble the aforementioned bark eater didn't miss a beat and wolfed her food down without coming up for air.  The picky eater took a look, then looked up at me for assurance, then sniffed it, then looked back at me with a ""What is this?"" look.  I encouraged him and he eventually ate it, but very slowly. The next day he skipped the looking at me ritual and just started eating. After a few days he didn't skip a beat and at it like he was getting it for the past five years.So, from a dog's perspective, it's OK. They like it. From an owner's perspective I'm OK with it too. Yes, it does have a bit of an odor but only if you stick your nose in the can and seriously, how often are you going to do that?  It mixes well, but not as well as a chunky/gravy canned food with kibble. I had to add a bit of water to make the powdered medicine completely disappear.While I would normally consider fish to be something I would serve to a cat the dogs seem to like the food and the variation to their diet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TYAVYLWP1A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEFC2#wasThisHelpful","R35TYAVYLWP1A8","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After years of enjoying stir fry at restaurants I decided it was something I wanted to do at home. Yes, stir fry is supposed to be healthier but I really wanted to make it because it tastes good.I did some research on Woks and got totally confused.  One site said to get carbon steel. Another said stainless steel. And another said to get cast iron.  I found sites that said a nonstick coating was bad and just as many that said it didn't matter.  Arrrggghhhh!  I finally did what I should have done in the first place and just checked here for the most popular Wok. This Joyce Chen was the second most popular. I think because it was slightly more money since it came with a lid, a tool, and a cookbook.I seasoned the wok per the instructions and that seemed to work out OK except the bottom of the wok turned dark. At first I thought it was burned oil but it was also dark on the outside.  I ignored it.For my first time out I decided to make stir fry chicken with snap peas and red bell pepper served over rice.  I didn't get the recipe from the included cookbook (which is very small btw) but found thousands of recipes online.  It really turned out well.  Clean-up was pretty easy. As advised, I didn't use soap but just rinsed the wok and scrubbed it a bit with a nylon scrubber to get the sticky parts off.  I then towel dried it and placed it on my cooktop at medium head for a few minutes to totally dry.  After putting a bit of oil on the surface I put it in a cabinet. A nice feature is that the long handle is easy to remove and re-attach to save space.A few notes.First - if you like super shiny, pretty cookware I don't think you're going to like this one. It got a patina on it when I was conditioning it and I can already see parts of the sides turning color as I use it.  I'm told this is a good thing.Second - I'm not convinced that I can't simply use my large saute pan. But, I really feel like I'm a pro when I use the wok.Third - I have an induction cooktop and this works great.Overall, I'm pretty happy I got this. The cookbook isn't of much use but it does include the basic instructions for conditioning and use. The bamboo tool is very nice and did a nice job of moving the ingredients around. I haven't had much use for the lid but I think it'll come in hand when I steam something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAL1CJ1FNG4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AQSWNE#wasThisHelpful","RZAL1CJ1FNG4D","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the vast majority of people I hate flossing. I just do - for a number of reasons including an old injury to my left hand that makes it difficult to hold the floss. That aside, it's boring and time consuming.Four or five years ago I started using a WaterPik. To test the effectiveness I started using it the day after my six month checkup/cleaning so I'd start with a clean slate so to speak. Lo and behold, six months later and the hygienist commented on how much better my gums looked and there was very little plaque.For those of you who have used a WaterPik you know it's not without its issues. The biggest problem is that it can be a bit messy. You learn quickly that opening your mouth even a little bit means you're going to be wiping down the mirror.  The other problem is that you can't really aim the wand because your mouth is closed.I was reluctant to try the Philips Airfloss at first because I was pretty happy with my WaterPik.  But, I figured that if I always thought that way I'd still be using an Apple II computer. After charging it for a few hours (the manual says 24 hours but it came over half charged) I filled up the little reservoir with my mouthwash (ACT), turned it on, and put it in  my mouth. But, like an idiot, I didn't close my lips.  Bad idea - but my mirror needed cleaning anyway.  I quickly learned that it was OK to open my mouth to position it but to close my lips when I pressed the button. Learned behavior - Pavlov would be so proud of me.Poof...poof...poof...whirrrrr. That's what happens. The poofs are the air/mouthwash pulses between your teeth. The whirrrr is the air pump.  I kept moving the little wand between my teeth and pressing the button.  What's kind of cool is that when I get a poof my cheek on the other side of my mouth moves.  My whole mouth was done in about a minute - not bad!  What's better is that it did a really nice job.  Just before using it I ate a bagel. A really doughy bagel that left a lot of stuff between my teeth.  When I spit after I was done with the Airfloss I was amazed at how much stuff came out - the bagel and what I hope were sesame seeds. I inspected my teeth and everything was gone.  Better yet, my mouth felt very clean.  I should note that the reservoir on the Airfloss won't hold two days' worth of mouthwash or water if you have it set to three pulses. I think it will for one or two pulses though.  But, it takes all of five seconds to fill it up.Is it better than the WaterPik? I think as far as cleaning it's a draw. The WaterPik does a good job and I've gotten good reports from my hygienist. But, the Airfloss is easier to use and it's not as messy. It also takes up much less valuable counter space.  For now I'm sticking with the Airfloss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12V5T91985RHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R12V5T91985RHF","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a seven year old Husky electric power washer that I picked up on sale at a big box store. I bring it out every month or so to mostly clean the walkway in the front of my house and the pool deck.  I have a dog that refuses to do his business on the grass so those areas get stained and stinky. Washing with a hose doesn't get the job done. The Husky has performed well but it was starting to have some issues. So, the timing was perfect for this to show up.Assembly was pretty straight forward. Attach the handle pieces, then the hose. All you need is a Phillips screwdriver.My first use was to clean the badly stained walkway. I had to put the nozzle at the thinnest setting which gave me a pencil sized spray that blasted through the stains.  As long as I was there I cranked it down to a fan spray and cleaned the rest of the walkway which had mostly ground in dirt. I also blasted some plant shelves that had some bird poop. No problems. But, after I switched the spray settings a few times the spray selector became loose.  It didn't leak but it was awkward to hold the wand and change the setting.I was curious about the noise level. I have a meter so I tested the Briggs & Stratton at 94 decibels when I was using the highest setting.  That's not quiet but it's not terrible - it's the equivalent of a gas powered lawn mower.Happy with the walkway cleaning I went to the pool deck.  The deck is concrete aggregate so it has a lot of nooks and crannies for dirt (and dog waste) to hide.  Like the walkway I was able to use a fan spray to clean the deck but the deck is sealed so while the dog stains look bad they usually aren't hard to clean.  But, about half way through water started dripping and then streaming out of the connection between the hose and the wand. I think what's happening is when you move the wand back and forth you're also slowly loosening this connection. I checked my Husky and they have a quick connect hose attachment so it doesn't leak and is able to swivel a bit.  If I keep using this power washer I may have to invest in one - otherwise I'll be wearing a swimming suit when I use it because I got soaked.The other problem with this unit, and I have exactly the same problem with the Husky, is the hose going from the unit to the wand. It's very stiff and I don't care how hard you try it won't straighten out. I live in the Phoenix area and stretched the hose out in 105 degree weather loosened up a bit but it's still a bit stiff.  When you're using the power washer the hose curls up and if you pull too hard it'll actually kink and cut off water to the nozzle (the Husky is just as unforgiving but it's never kinked). The stiffness of the hose is also a problem when you store the unit.  Good luck trying to wrap the hose around the back like they show in the picture.  Mine is attached but I used a long Velcro strap to hold it in place. Again, I have the same problem with the Husky.Overall, it's OK. It leaks but I think I can fix that problem. I'm not sure what to do about the hose stiffness though. If I come up with a solution I'll update this review - if you have any ideas please share them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HRL8RY1J8Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZE7J3S#wasThisHelpful","R29HRL8RY1J8Z9","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit is great fun and a nice diversion from electronic games and the plethora of building sets we have accumulated over the years (Legos, etc).It comes with a number of parts - I've included a picture showing the box contents before everything was opened.  I put it in the hands of an 11 year old boy. He loves building things and the idea that he could make them move was intriguing. Even at his age he had some difficulty putting some of the pieces together and asked for help.The projects are fun and they actually do move with the aid of the rubber band. But, don't expect break neck speed. They sort of putter along but that's fine.  We have RC cars that go fast and let's face it, this is rubber band powered.Overall it's a nice kit and it kept the 11 year old busy for a few hours. I strongly suspect that he'll get tired of it and it'll go off into the black hole closet. But, I think it's the kind of kit that may get pulled out again on a rainy day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDHAUIKZBQLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8ZZV2#wasThisHelpful","R2BDHAUIKZBQLI","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the Nutro cat food brand in the past and thought I'd give a different flavor a try. Our two cats aren't very picky eaters but they have snubbed their noses at food in the past. They did walk up to it, sniff it, give me a funny look and then dove in - I took that as a good sign.As a cat owner I was of course interested in the healthiness of this food.  I can actually recognize and pronounce the top ten or so ingredients. We were first introduced to the Nutro brand by our vet. It wasn't the only brand she recommended but it was on her short list.

"We now have four building kits in our house. The Zoob, Lincoln Logs, Magformers, and Lego. Interest in the Lincoln Logs and Magformers has dwindled over time but they still come out of the closet occasionally.  The Lego's are always the ""go-to"" building toy and are likely to stay in the top spot for the next generation or two. Like any new toy, the Zoob became the most popular as soon as the box was opened.The pieces are easy to put together and you can make a number of shapes because they swivel on each other; you can make a circle, a snake, etc. There's a nice booklet included with step-by-step instructions for a number of projects.  I prefer the, ""here - go build something"" approach but having the instructions was a nice way to get started.  After a few of those were tackled the booklet was discarded and the creativity began. That's what I really like about toys like this. The kids have fun and, as an adult, it's fun to watch their little brains work.This is a nice beginner kit with plenty of pieces for completing projects.  Another plus - unlike Lego's there aren't any small pieces so clean up is easier and you're not likely to walk across the floor barefooted in the middle of the night and step on one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YWF06K1YCCJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OUZBMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YWF06K1YCCJ7","A2NX6PABLIJLP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NX6PABLIJLP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Life is moving along pretty easily for County Sheriff Ed McCoy.  His office is in the quiet backwater town of Nugget City, Colorado.  Formerly a wild mining boomtown, Nugget City was tamed by his father, Sheriff Fist McCoy.  As the ore played out, the town changed from a raucous mining camp to a tranquil ranching community.  With the death of Fist, young Ed has taken his father's place and become the Law in the County.  But tensions are simmering just under this peaceful facade.  There is a persistent threat of range war over water rights between the two largest ranchers in the county, Pete Egan of the Rafter E and Curt Mauldin of the M Bar, and now Pete has hired a gunslinger.  Add to this troubling escalation, the fact that the local banker, Sam Thorn, holds mortgages on most of the land in the County and has his own plan to foreclose on both ranches and the pot of trouble is beginning to boil.  Then one day a stranger, with the singularly unremarkable name of John Brown, comes to town on the stage and starts sitting in front of the hotel all day, every day.  The stranger is wearing two tied down guns and suddenly Ed has his hands full.  Why is the stranger in town and what is he doing just sitting and watching?  Can Ed solve the mystery?  Can he prevent a range war?  Can he stay alive long enough to marry the love of his life, Curt Mauldin's daughter, Judy?  And how the heck did the seamstress and the school teacher get involved in all of this?Next to Louis L'Amour, Wayne Overholser is one of my favorite Western authors and Nugget City is one of his better novels.  The first half of the book has none of the violence that is characteristic of most Western stories, but instead focuses on the mysterious stranger and the various sub-plots that swirl around him.  These narrative threads come crashing together in the second half of the book with plenty of suspense and sudden plot twists.  If you like Westerns, you will really enjoy reading Nugget City.  The narrative has a limited, believable level of violence and a well structured series of sub-plots that will hold your interest to the last page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68QR7KNMT3P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786207566#wasThisHelpful","R68QR7KNMT3P9","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Surf Safari Nurse by Jane Converse, our protagonist, Laurie Davis, a plucky young nurse, is having a very bad week.  Her boyfriend, the dashing Ron Tercotte, a surgery student/surfer dude, just broke up with her and, to top it off, she has been demoted from OR nurse to general duty on the maternity ward.  What's a girl to do?  (Cue Beach Boys music.)  Why, go on a surf safari!  Can she win Ron's heart back among the white beach sands and rolling waves and convince him to return to school instead of surfing his life away?  Or is Linc, not Ron, the man for her?  Can she bring peace and healing to Eddie Barclay, a troubled young man with domineering parents?  But most of all, will she have to punch Ron's new surf bunny girlfriend, Diane Etheridge, in the face?  Don't worry this trip won't be just another lame ""ho-dad rockout"" (whatever that is).  With Goofyfoot, Elephant, Beast, Preacher, and, of course, Ron, along, you can be sure this will be one wild ride.Published in 1966, this is an old fashioned romance novel.  There is no sex and just a few kisses.  Romantic passion is only very subtly implied.  The majority of the book reads like a daytime soap opera with everyone just sitting around talking and thinking about relationships and the meaning of life.  It was kind of boring for me.  Strangely, the few exciting events that occur are written ""off camera"" and only revealed through re-telling to Laurie.  I can understand such a budget-saving technique for a television soap opera, but, of course, the author has no such constraints.  I would have enjoyed the story more if Laurie had been directly involved as events unfolded.  On the other hand, the last couple of chapters throw Laurie right into the action with plenty of suspense and excitement.  Overall, I am only giving it four stars simply because I feel with a little tweaking in the narrative structure it could have been a much more enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5OBDIGG761E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078624626X#wasThisHelpful","RO5OBDIGG761E","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sun-Maid Raisins & Dried Fruits: Serving American Families & The World Since 1912 is a history/recipe book put together by the Sun-Maid Growers of California and published by DK Publishing in New York in 2011.  Anna L. Palecek, Gary H. Marshburn, and Barry F. Kriebel are listed as the ""creative team"".  The hardcover edition (8 1/4"" by 10 1/4"") is 176 pages with an index.  It is a commemorative book that recognizes the 100 year anniversary of Sun-Maid.  Being printed on high quality paper with beautiful illustrations, I would describe it as a ""coffee table book"".  There really isn't a narrative as such (maybe that is why there is a ""creative team"" rather than authors listed), rather the story is laid out as a series of images with accompanying blurbs.  The presentation gives the impression of a high end marketing brochure, which I guess in one sense it is.In general, the six chapter titles are fairly explanatory.  Chapter 1, The Basics, provides an interesting Sun-Maid time-line followed by some random blurbs on the use of raisins and other dried fruits such as Holidays and Festivals that feature dried fruits (although the Children's Day in Japan blurb makes no mention of raisins or dried fruit).  Oh, BTW, did you know that March 1st is Fruit Compote Day?  There is also a comparison of hamburgers and boxes of raisins and a blurb on Sir Isaac Newton's Laws of Motion...as I mentioned earlier, the blurbs tend to be very random.  Chapter 2, The Background Story, is a bit more organized, chronologically starting somewhat before the founding of Sun-Maid with the use of dried fruit by the ancient Egyptians and ending with the introduction of the Thompson seedless grape at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition.  Chapter 3, The Sun-Maid Story, has some really neat random blurbs; the real-life Sun-Maid girl then and later in life, the evolution of the Sun-Maid girl logo, Norman Rockwell and Sun-Maid (!), games, recipe books, etc.  Chapter 4, From Field to Table, discusses the process of growing and making raisins, complete with ""Sun-Maid experts"" pictured looking through refractometers and magnifying glasses.  Chapter 5, The Facts on Raisins and Dried Fruit, highlights the various kinds of dried fruit sold by Sun-Maid and the health benefits of eating dried fruit.  Various international food guidelines are provided, but no negative issues are addressed.  And finally, Chapter 6, Recipes, presents 52 recipes (by my count) ranging from the mundane (Oatmeal Raisin Cookies) to the bizarre (Grilled Baby Eggplant with Raisins, Pine Nuts, and Rosemary).  To be honest, some of the recipes are pretty darn good.In conclusion, this is a beautiful coffee table book that is obviously a marketing brochure for Sun-Maid.  It is laid out as a series of images and blurbs, some of which are really interesting, that is meant to be browsed rather than read.  It is certainly not a detailed centennial history of Sun-Maid and doesn't address some of the more controversial issues that range from the humorous (the revamping of a modern animated Sun-Maid girl in tight fitting clothing) to the more serious (immigrant labor and working conditions).  In general, the history of the fruit growing industry in California's Central Valley is a fascinating subject that is a case study for the growth of American commerce and industry.  It is filled with struggle and changes in labor rights and working conditions and increasing mechanization of production.  For example, over the past decade, Sun-Maid has significantly increased the mechanization of the production process due to a shortage of farm labor.  They now produce more raisins on less land than ever before.  If you get a chance read up on the history of the Central Valley.  If you just want the recipes, you can download this book for free from the Sun-Maid website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBNXXPHFFZ5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756690676#wasThisHelpful","R3JBNXXPHFFZ5F","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These 11 inch plastic parts organizers come in a set of three.  They are made in China and distributed by Home Depot under the Husky Tools brand (www dot huskytools dot com).  They have a ""two year limited warranty"" on failures due to a defect in materials or workmanship which really means, if you break it, you keep it.  I don't know why they are advertised as 11 inches.  The actual length of the box is approximately 10 5/8 inches and the storage length is about 10 1/8 inches.  The box width is about 7 inches with a storage depth of a little over 1 1/2 inches.  As can be seen in the product image, the storage area is divided into four fixed rows.  The back three rows are a little over 1 1/2 inches wide with removable dividers spaced about every 2 inches.  The front row is designed differently than the back rows with three fixed length compartments that are roughly 3 1/4 inches long.  The two side compartments vary between 1 and 1 1/4 inches wide to allow room for the box latches.  The middle compartment is approximately 1 1/4 inches wide with a shallower depth of about 3/4 of an inch to allow for a hand grip.These seem to be reasonably high quality storage boxes made from fairly thick plastic.  Flexing is minimal when you pick the loaded box up by one corner.  Even though made of plastic, the latches and hinges are two piece mechanisms (i.e., separate hinge pin and leaf) which are more durable than the one piece thin seam hinge that you usually find on small plastic box hinges and latches.  The latch snaps on the three bins I received were solid and snapped securely.  When fully inserted, the dividers fit flush with the compartment bottom and appear to be flush with the lid.  If you are storing hardware such as nuts, bolts, and washers, they will not mix when the box is turned over.  Overall, they are a nice set of storage bins.  But keep in mind, they are designed for small quantities of small parts and are not the best solution for larger parts or larger quantities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1VL23SI8N0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I7993D6#wasThisHelpful","RK1VL23SI8N0Y","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first year of the Civil War, 1861, Northern troops under questionable leadership had suffered several setbacks and the Confederacy was on the offensive.  So, when Federal troops investigating an Indian attack on the Humboldt River in Nevada find stolen munitions in the burned wagons, the alarm is raised in Washington.  The possibility of secessionist insurrection in the Western states was a very real threat.  Northern leadership needed to find out just how much of a threat the stolen arms posed and ordered a covert operation to expose any such plans.  Our protagonist, Lt. Tracy Dalton, is selected as the undercover agent and is sent West to pose as a free-wheeling mining investor...and so the story begins.  Can Lt. Dalton uncover the truth behind the stolen guns and ammunition without compromising his cover?  Can he thwart plans by Confederate sympathizers to capture the Western states?  Can he stay alive long enough to complete such a dangerous mission?  The author, Chad Merriman, has structured this fictional tale around a true real world event.  In 1861, Brig. Gen. Henry H. Sibley began preparing a plan to capture the mineral rich Western states of New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada for the Confederacy.  The campaign was launched from the, at the time abandoned, Federal Fort Bliss, located near El Paso, Texas.  Ultimately the plan failed for a variety of tactical and logistical reasons and, in April of 1862, Sibley was forced to retreat back to Fort Bliss, thus ending any Confederate hopes for capturing lands in the West.NO SPOILERS, BUT STOP HERE IF YOU WANT TO READ THE STORY WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEPTIONS.  I am only giving this novel three stars because, in my opinion, it is simply a boring narrative.  You would think with a title, ""Ride West For War"", this book would be filled with non-stop action.  Unfortunately, the first 15 chapters consist of Lt. Dalton talking to someone, searching for the hidden weapons, talking to some more people, again searching for the hidden weapons, and so on and so on.  The only action is a brutal beating and a short fist fight...that's it.  Even the romantic subplot is half-hearted and never really developed.  Ironically, this is probably a realistic depiction of an undercover investigation...you just talk to people until you find out what is going on.  But, it doesn't make good storytelling.  On the other hand, the climax in the last two chapters is very exciting.  If only the first fifteen chapters had been that interesting, it would have been a very enjoyable read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2RMGB1K1CJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597220787#wasThisHelpful","R1X2RMGB1K1CJZ","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Just an FYI, I wrote a similar review of National's UltraSofts Women's Holiday sleep tee.)  The National Novelty sleep tee is simply a long teeshirt with no pockets that can be worn as a nightgown.  It is sold by the National Wholesale Company (www dot shopnational dot com) under the National label as a ""Novelty"" sleep tee.  The tee is made in China and was shipped to me from the National warehouse in Lexington, North Carolina. The material is a 60% cotton/40% polyester blend that, as one would expect from a knit, has a soft, stretchy feel. The seams were consistent with no fraying.  It is a very comfortable tee that is stretchy enough to ease binding and bunching as you move around in your sleep.  The tee is thin enough to be worn during the warmer Summer nights.  National also sells a line of cotton/polyester sleep tees under the UltraSofts by National label, which seem to me to be somewhat thicker and more suited for cooler Winter nights.  However, the UltraSofts tees are narrower across the shoulders than the Novelty tees.I ordered a carnation color Novelty tee which is a creamy pink hue.  As can be seen in the product image, the carnation tee has a nice ""three stacked coffee cups"" design on the front.  The Novelty sleep tees come in two sizes; Misses (One size fits 6-16) and Womens (One size fits 18-26). I ordered the Womens one size. The product description states that the tee is 39 inches long.  Before the first washing, I measured approximately 37 inches from the back of the neck to the hemline and approximately 29 inches across the shoulders. After several washings, I measured again and the length was approximately 34 1/2 inches, while the width across the shoulders remained approximately 29 inches. So, you can expect several inches of shrinkage in length, but the tee appears to hold its width.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the UltraSofts tees are four to five inches narrower across the shoulders than the Novelty tees and may be snug across the chest for some. If you are full figured, you may find the Novelty tees to be more comfortable than the UltraSofts tees. Overall, the Novelty tees are good quality, comfortable night sleep tees so five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L20PMSQMFFFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IECR0VS#wasThisHelpful","R2L20PMSQMFFFR","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Trail Blazers by E. C. Tubb, the protagonist, Gregg Halmar, is a hardened veteran of the Civil War.  Having fought as a Captain for the Confederacy, he has lost everything except the clothes on his back, and even those have become threadbare.  He realizes there is a substantial financial opportunity in post-Civil War Texas where large herds of cattle are bottled up by blocked trails to the East.  Gregg figures that instead of East, he can drive a herd North to the meat-starved mining camps of Wyoming and Montana.  But to push 5,000 head North, he must blaze a new cattle trail and, in the process, face outlaw Jayhawks, marauding Indians, and the ravages of Nature.  Can he stay alive long enough to make his fortune or will he lose his herd and his life?  Trail Blazers is a short novel and therefore a fairly quick read.  It is a classic Western in the sense that all the traditional elements are there; fistfights, gunfights, a cattle drive, Indian attacks, etc.  Recently, I have been reading some of E. C. Tubb's Western stories and, although he is better known for his science fiction and fantasy novels, his Western tales such as Trail Blazers are pretty good.As an aside, about halfway through Trail Blazers the protagonist argues that the Indians should be left alone and allowed to stay on their lands.  In Tubb's Wagon Trail (aka, Cauldron of Violence) novel, published one year later in 1957, it is clear the Indians are the bad guys, savages bent on murdering innocent white settlers.  I wonder if these views were written as purely character motivation or if is was a reflection of the author's changing view of Westward Expansion and the ""Indian Wars"".  Anyway, getting back to my review of Trail Blazers.  Even though the story is pretty good, I am giving it three stars based on my personal preferences.  About halfway through the book, the protagonist acts in a very distasteful, disturbing manner and I developed a sudden dislike for Gregg Halmar.  I really don't want the protagonist to be ""super"" human.  Human weaknesses add realism to the character.  But, I do want him or her to have a fairly strong sense of moral right and wrong...and to choose the right path.  Personally, if I don't like the protagonist, I don't enjoy the story.  Of course I finished reading the book, but I really didn't connect with Gregg Halmar in the second half of the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNORXET5HR90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846179688#wasThisHelpful","R3PNORXET5HR90","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to hang out a wind streamer (windsock) so I can just glance out the window to see how windy it is outside.  I have been using a rainbow colored streamer that is generic enough to be used year round.  For a change I decided to buy this series of windsocks to add some seasonal color to the yard.  The windsocks are made in China and were shipped directly from the Miles Kimball Company in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  They arrived in a clear plastic bag which itself contained six plastic bags each containing one of the six windsocks in the set.  The socks are as pictured in the product image; a snowman for Christmas, flowers/bee for Spring, a bunny rabbit for Easter, USA stars and stripes for the Fourth of July, autumn leaves for Fall, and a pumpkin/ghosts for Halloween.  The patterns are on only one side of the windsock with just the background color on the other side (e.g., The Fall sock has leaves on one side and just the brown background color on the other side.).As you can see in the image, the streamers are crinkled when unpacked.  Even though advertised as being 62"" long, I measured the length at about 59""; however, if I pull the streamers tight, I can get just about 62"".  They may straighten out with use, but that isn't really an issue for me.  I sorta like the crinkled look.  The sock material is made from very thin, very lightweight, polyester.  The three (double strand) hangar strings appear to be made from braided nylon and the hook is metal.  Being so thin and lightweight, It is hard to judge the durability of the materials and construction.  On the other hand, the sock needs to be lightweight so it will flutter in a light breeze.  So far, I am happy with my purchase.  It seems to be a good value for six seasonal windsocks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29OPCDJ4PZI4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEXS5U4#wasThisHelpful","R29OPCDJ4PZI4Q","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By sheer luck, Colin Bowman manages to escape an Indian attack that kills his parents and instills in him a hatred and fear of Indians.  Still a young boy, he was suddenly thrown into an adult world.  As he grows older, the horrors of the Civil War transform him into a hardened, dangerous, man.  Surviving the War, Colin is once again drawn west to the land that he loves, but he will need to face his fears and heal his hatred before he can find love and peace in his life.In my opinion, E.C. Tubb is an inconsistent writer.  Some of his work is excellent and some is below average.  I liked Cauldron of Violence.  It is not his best work, but it is an enjoyable read.  It is a classic Western where the Indians are clearly the ""bad guys""; ferocious savages bent on murder.  If you like your Westerns to be more sympathetic to the Indian plight, then this is probably not the book for you.  The narrative is a fairly quick read and is essentially three main episodes connected by a some transitional paragraphs.  I got the feeling that the author had three short stories that he decided to string together to create this short novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNC2NU0ZCBUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444801317#wasThisHelpful","R1PNC2NU0ZCBUZ","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This folding ""camp"" table sold by Outsunny is made in China and has, by my measurements, a 23 3/4"" wide by 17 3/4"" long top with legs that can be locked at either of two heights; 19"" from the ground or a maximum height of 25 1/2"" from the ground.  The legs fold up into a 2 3/4"" thickness.  The top does not fold.  My scales are not very accurate but it does appear to weigh the advertised 6 pounds.  The table has an advertised maximum weight loading of 60 pounds.  The frame is aluminum.  The top appears to be made from some type of plastic(?).  My guess is that most of the 6 pound weight is in the top.  It has a nice flexible plastic (rubber?) hand carry strap on the side.  The strap feels secure but I don't know how durable the plastic is.  Even though the advertising states that you can carry it for long distances, with a weight of 6 pounds and a solid top, the table is not well suited for hiking or backwoods camping.  For hiking and remote camping, you really need a slated or cloth table top that you can cinch into a tight roll.  On the other hand, if you can drive to the campsite, or just need to walk a short distance to a picnic area, or maybe need some extra spread space for a tailgate party, this table is a good choice.The product description states, and I agree, that the top is easy to clean.  However, keep in mind that since an aluminum flange runs completely around the edge of the plastic top, large liquid spills will undoubtedly seep between the top and the flange where you won't be able to clean it up.  So, if you aren't careful the edges can get very dirty.  In conclusion, I had two issues with this table.  First, you really need three hands to adjust the legs;  two to push in the spring-loaded ball bearing catches on each leg pair and one to push in or pull out the leg pair.  It was a bit awkward but I had to push in on one ball bearing and force one leg down just far enough to release it from the catch hole and then release the other leg the same way.  Once both legs are released then you push or pull the leg pair in or out.  The second issue is that you can't fold the table with the legs fully extended.  I had wanted to extend the legs and then hang up the table for later use, but, the design of the folding legs forces me to extend the legs every time I use the table.  I am going to give this four stars for these two issues, but for the right application, you may find it a five star buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB387D22QR5G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDYE5EC#wasThisHelpful","RB387D22QR5G0","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rectangular shoulder shawl sold by Maxi-Aids.  The shawl I received is made in the USA by Care Apparel Industries.  Even though it is called ""polar fleece"", the material is 100 percent polyester.  There is no organic material or wool in the shawl.  The synthetic fibers are woven into a soft nap that provides a moderate level of insulation.  The shawl is sold as ""one size fits all"" and is a single rectangular piece of material that is 19 3/4 inches wide by 62 inches long.  A pocket is sewn on each end of the material.  The two pockets are 6 1/2 inches square with the bottom of each pocket sewn into the edge hem of the material.The seller describes the shawl as a ""extra thick and luxurious"".  In my opinion, this is a bit of an exaggeration.  The material is fairly thin.  It is not stretchable and has a soft feel that is just slightly harsh but still comfortable.  You can tell it is made of polyester fibers.  In any case, the material is thick enough to feel good in a cool room, but it won't keep you warm if the temperature is lowered.  I know these are vague words, but a ""comfortable"" temperature can vary quite a bit between individuals.  Let me put it this way...my mother likes this shawl in an air conditioned room in the Summer, but finds it too thin to keep her warm during the Winter months.  There are no wrinkles after washing and the material is durable.  Even though the product description indicates light blue, I don't think the seller can guarantee the color.  The shawl I received turned out to be black.  I don't know if there is any variation in size.  I am giving it five stars with a caveat.  This is a nice simple rectangular shawl with two pockets.  It is comfortable for a cool room but is too thin for anything colder.  If this is what you need, then it is a good buy.

"This gap hole taper gauge sold by Amico provides a quick low cost way of measuring hole diameter with some limitations.  The tool itself is about 6 inches long by about 3/4 inches wide and a little over 1/32 of an inch thick.  The stated measurement range is between 1 mm and 15 mm.  However, if you look closely at the product image you will see that you lose the multiple length gradations at below 4 mm.  So, if the hole is smaller than 4 mm, you will have to start counting lines which can be a pain without a magnifying glass.  In fact  you will need to count lines from 4 mm on down to 1 mm just to figure out which lines are the 3, 2, and 1 mm marks.  In my opinion, the useful measurement range of the gauge is between 4 mm and 15 mm.  As another reviewer has noted, the design of the gauge means that it can only be used on ""through"" holes or holes that are deeper than the length of the gauge below the hole size mark.  I mic'ed out a couple of the marks and they appear to be accurate.  I can certainly work with millimeters, but I wish they made these in SAE also.Anyway, the gauge is made in China and appears to be targeted for the Chinese market since the packaging is all in Chinese.  The seller?? has taped a UPC bar code and product name in English to the outside of the package.  The gauge was slightly bent (bowed) but not enough to be a problem.  The labeling stamped on the tool that I received is ""KC0-15mm"".  This is different from the product description image which shows a labeling of ""JOA No. 700A Stainless Hardened"" so I don't know if my gauge is actually made from hardened stainless steel.  I am not sure why there is a small ""01"" dimension mark stamped on the tool next to the labeling.  Overall, the gauge is a good solution for measuring the top edge diameter of 4 mm to 15 mm holes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBYIRKLUE98O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO5KPJM#wasThisHelpful","R1DBYIRKLUE98O","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These 6 mm nylon wing bolts are sold in two pair packs (two bolts and two nuts).  They are made in Vietnam out of what I am guessing to be Nylon 6/6.  The type of material isn't given in the product description, but Nylon 6/6 thermoplastic is pretty much the industry standard for ""plastic"" bolts and nuts.  In addition, the bolts/nuts I received are off-white which is the untreated color of Nylon 6/6.  It should be noted that the product image shows black bolts/nuts.  However, my project (electrically insulated wire posts) doesn't require a specific bolt color so the off-white is not an issue for me.  They are called wing bolts because they are usually used by radio control airplane hobbyists to mount the wing on the body of the aircraft.  If the airplane crashes, the bolts will shear, releasing the wing from the body, and reducing the amount of damage to the aircraft.  I mic'ed out one of the bolts and nuts.  The diameter of the threaded length is 6 mm or just under a quarter inch.  The bolt length from the pointed tip to the base of the bolt head is 13/16 of an inch.  This includes an un-threaded 5/16"" shoulder between the bolt threads and the base of the bolt head.  So, keep in mind that you can't run the nut all the way against the bottom of the bolt head.  The bolt head is a 5/8"" diameter circle that is just under 1/8"" thick with a protruding 1/8"" flange.  The nut is T-shaped with a circular threaded tube (O.D. just under 3/8"") and a flat 17/32"" x 1 1/16"" base that is 1/8"" thick.  Note that you can't use a screwdriver to tighten the bolt head and you can't use a wrench to tighten the nut.  There is some mold flashing left on the length of the bolt but I was able to run a nut all the way up the bolt without a problem.  Overall, except for the color, the bolts seem to be as advertised, so five stars.

"Buckskin Man by Wayne D. OverholserRafe Dolan grew up as a buckskin-wearing, mountain man and he wanted to continue that way of life until he died.  Unfortunately, he was born too late.  The progression of cattlemen and farmers were slowly settling the last remaining wildernesses of the West.  Rafe didn't like farming and he certainly didn't like cattlemen, so he constantly drifted, looking for a place far away from the relentless spread of civilization.  Whether he wanted it or not, a chance meeting with a cattleman and later with an old friend from the past was about to pull Rafe violently into this new way of life.  There was a good chance he wouldn't survive.  The odds certainly were against him.  But Rafe knew that he had to fight for what was good and right and to protect those who were depending on him.== Musings ==As I have written in another review, my favorite author of Western novels is Louis L'Amour.  Louis' protagonists are quintessential Western heroes.  But Wayne D. Overholser and his son Stephen Overholser are a close second.  They are master storytellers in their own right.  Usually, Overholser stories have a sub-theme in the narrative that gives the story a ""realistic"" feel.  Buckskin Man is no exception, as Rafe has to face the end of a way of life and adapt to a new modern reality.  In fact, one character in the story, upon first meeting Rafe, calls him an anachronism...a man living in the past.

"As a caregiver, I have bought several different brands of adult pull-ups (i.e., Depend, Tranquility, Prevail, Tena, and Surecare) and have written a few reviews on the their attributes.  I recently decided to try these Prevail bladder control pads as ""booster"" pads for adult pull-up diapers.  Booster pads are placed in the crotch of the pull-ups for at least two reasons; first, to increase the amount of liquid that can be adsorbed if there is a heavy flow or the pull-ups must be worn for an extended period or, second, to reduce the number of pull-ups used either for financial or convenience reasons.  As an aside, if you are having an issue with overnight containment, then I would suggest trying the Tranquility Overnight pull-ups first before resorting to booster pads.Anyway, back to the Prevail pads...the pads are individually wrapped in a soft, ""faux cloth"" overwrap with a flowery imprint that is seamed and easily torn open.  The pad unfolds into a 13 inch long strip that is about 3 inches wide and about a half inch thick.  (This is their maximum absorbency pad, previously known as Ultra-Plus.)  The pad is advertised as body shaped and designed for women.  There is only a barely discernible hour glass shape to it with an elastic edge on each side of the middle.  I'm not sure why, but the inside of the pad is imprinted with a flowery design.  The back side of the pad (away from the skin) has a full length adhesive strip (covered with paper) for securing the pad to the crotch of the pull-up.  I didn't realize that the quietness of the wrapping was an issue, but Prevail advertises the fact that the wrapping is soft and quiet for discretion.  But you should note that even though the overwrap may be quiet, taking the paper off the adhesive strip can be somewhat noisy.  Although I can't see the difference in the symmetrical design, the paper covering the adhesive strip indicates a front direction.The 13 inch length provides very good coverage and the pad adsorbs well.  However, unlike pads designed specifically as boosters with ""flow through"" control, these pads limit the amount of fluid flow through the backside material when the pad is full.  Accordingly, these are not a good solution for increasing the fluid capacity of the pull-up.  When the Prevail pad gets full, they tend to leak around the sides rather than flowing through to the absorbent layer of the pull-up crotch.  (See the comments below for further discussion on this issue.)  On the other hand, if you can change the pad when it gets full, then you can greatly reduce the number of pull-ups you use and, in turn, reduce your overall cost for incontinence protection.  Also, for extended wear, changing out the pad is much more convenient than replacing your pull-up each time you get wet.  So I am giving a mixed review and four stars for use in booster pad applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4CUS1H2Z00F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YHA9SM#wasThisHelpful","R3C4CUS1H2Z00F","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a bottom rack wheel assembly break on my Sears Kenmore dishwasher.  I looked up the part number on the Sears website.  It turned out to be fairly expensive when I included shipping, so I searched the same part number (8268645) on Amazon.  The result came back as a Whirlpool wheel.  The product image appeared to be the same as the Sears wheel assembly and it was significantly lower in cost (with free shipping) so I ordered it from Amazon.  It is an exact replacement for the Sears wheel assembly.

"This CD entitled ""Dream Sleep: Music for Relaxation"" is produced, composed, and performed by Rutman Bowmore and printed and manufactured in Canada.  It is from the Reflections of Nature series of CD's (reflectionsmusic dot com).  The CD is just over 45 minutes long and is structured into eight tracks ranging from about four to seven minutes each.  All the tracks are similar and integrate ocean waves with the music.  The waves stay in the foreground throughout with the instruments serving as filler between wave crashes.  Most of the time, a piano and flute are leads backed by strings and winds.  Occasionally, a violin and guitar will move to the front to carry the score.  On some of the tracks, the flute gives a Celtic vibe to the score.  I don't know whether this is an ensemble performance or multiple synthesized keyboard overlays.  The compositions are all fairly slow nondescript scores with no vocals.  The music smooths out the amplitude by filling the low volume transitions between wave crashes.  Accordingly, none of the tunes and transitions stick in your mind and there are no surprises as you are trying to drift off to sleep.  This is a nice hybrid of nature (ocean waves) and relaxing music.  I do wish it were about 15 minutes longer to round out to an hour.  If you are looking for nature/music hybrids, then this a good one to add to your collection...five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQF88EA1EFTHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007PTO64#wasThisHelpful","RQF88EA1EFTHF","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD entitled ""Evening Symphony"" is produced by Santec Music (santec-music dot com) in Germany and is performed by the in-house Santec Music Orchestra.  It is 54 minutes long and is structured into 12 tracks ranging from about four to seven minutes each.  There are no nature sounds.  All the tracks are pretty much the same with either piano or guitar leads supported by a small orchestra of strings and winds.  The compositions are all fairly slow nondescript scores with no vocals.  Of course, this is a plus since you really don't want vocals or catchy tunes when you are trying to fall asleep.  The volume is consistently even throughout with no high amplitude surprises.  It is apparent the CD is designed to be background music and it succeeds in the sense that none of the tunes and transitions stick in your mind and, in fact, quickly fade from your consciousness as you thoughts drift elsewhere.  Even so, I would have preferred if the conductor had pushed the strings even further into the background.  Using this kind of music for sleeping really depends on your mood when you go to bed.  Sometimes I feel like immersing myself in nature (e.g., storms, oceans, etc.) and sometimes I want relaxing music.  Evening Symphony is not a nature CD and it really doesn't fall into the latter category either because it is so homogenized.  Usually music to promote sleep is structured to gradually ease the listener into sleepiness.  The music on this CD is targeted more for meditation than sleeping.  Nonetheless, I am going to give it five stars because I think it is good for those nights when you are already relaxed.  Since you don't need to ""de-stress"", quiet background music is really all you need at bedtime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PTPU79U8IHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023QCWW8#wasThisHelpful","R23PTPU79U8IHX","A1NDV4ML54NAEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDV4ML54NAEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually got these bulbs intending to put them in our ceiling fan/chandelier combo, but didn't realize that the ""A15"" wasn't describing the socket, but the length and shape of the neck (I know now, though :/), so I had to order some candelabra socket bulbs after these. I ended up re-purposing these bulbs into the nightside tables of my girl's rooms. They worked very well in there, as they are quite low profile, and their lamps are also low profile.

"I think this is a cool little lamp. It has a fully powered USB port which makes charging a phone or tablet a snap, and I think it was genius to include different types and intensities of LEDs in the lamp that you can toggle depending on your mood. I pretty much always have it in Reading or Study mode, because I prefer the 5000K+ color temperature of light, but it is nice that they include ""softer"" light modes for people who prefer yellower light. Also including a light intensity +/- control was also a nice touch. The lamp also swivels, and articulates at the base and the top of the neck. However, the whole thing is plastic, and the cord is a little short. Additionally, it only angles on the plane of the neck of the joints it has, no side to side rotation, which would have been nice.

"This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owner's had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

It has a nice shape for the bowl of the spoon itself, not too wide, and not too deep. My only gripe about these spoons is the end of the stem has corners which are actually fairly sharp -- which seems like a ridiculous thing to overlook -- HOW could they miss that? If you are pressing on the end of the stem hard enough, or aren't careful with it around soft skin, it could scratch you, maybe even cut you, depending on how soft your skin is.

"These are very nice. I use them when outside the paintball field, refilling, and checking equipment, so I still have some eye protection, without having to wear my full mask. I also use these when I am out rollerblading, or when I am walking/jogging, and I don't need to read street signs with my prescription sunglasses. These are RX ready, though, which, according to Under Armour, means you can wear your regular lenses under these, and the sunglasses shouldn't interfere with your RX vision.

" 9:49 MinsThe video shows me doing a sound test of the main unit that you can program with an arm/disarm code, and with the door & window models as well. The main unit is LOUD, it actually hurt my ears. The door and window units aren't quite as loud, but they work well enough. You can put everything into alarm or chime mode, which I like. You can install them easily, and I think they work well, and since they are white, they will blend into the walls of most home paint jobs. These will work very well for renters too, as they install with double-sided tape which allows for easy removal that doesn't damage the walls. I wasn't 100% wild about the kit, though. I think the door & window models should be louder, and I think the main unit should be smaller. I also wish that the main unit didn't have a screw required to get into the battery compartment. Yes, I know that keeps kids and possibly a criminal out of it, but frankly, the criminal could just smash it, and if it is mounted on the wall with screws, a kid shouldn't be able to get to it, and the criminal would have a semi-difficult time getting it off the wall to get at it. So, yeah, anyway, not a fan of the screws to get to battery compartments.Overall, I personally rate this 4.5 stars.

I am not an audiophile, though, so take their word for the sound quality over mine :)NEUTRAL:-The microphone is a little tricky to plug in at first-swapping between modes on the base unit to get chat to work can be tricky/time consuming-switching between volume modes on the headset, so that you are adjusting either the game volume, or the chat volume, can be tricky -- and hard to do by touch alone-uses batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable batteryCONS:-I was never able to get chat to work on the Xbox One. The cable that comes with the unit has a 3.5mm plug for the end that connects to the headset, but a 2.5mm plug on the other end that connects to the controller (intended for use with the Xbox 360). In the manual it flat out tells you that you will need a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter to get it to work with the Xbox One (REALLY, Klipsch?!) -- so, OK, I went ahead and ordered an adapter (you can find them for only a couple of bucks on Amazon) to use with the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter you need for chat for the Xbox One (if you don't already have one, you will need to order one from Microsoft as well, as the Klipsch headset doesn't come with that, either). And, after all of that, I couldn't get it to work. I re-synched, but that didn't work. I re-initialized the mode and made sure it was in the correct (green) mode. I swapped out the headset for another one which I knew was working (my Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Gaming Headset), just to make sure the line wasn't dead. When I used the other headset, my friends could hear me on the Xbox Party chat I started to test the headset, just fine. But when I had the Klipsch plugged in, I could sometimes hear them (it would bring their audio in every few seconds or so), but they couldn't ever hear me. So, yeah, this is a deal breaker for me.  Note, I was able to get the chat working on the PS4 just fine. But, for a premium headset well north of a couple hundred dollars at retail price, I expect more than this. First of all, why not just either include the 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter, or include another cable for Xbox One chat. Would that have been so hard? Also, if the (fairly cheap compared to these) Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Gaming Headset can come with the chat adapter that you need to plug into the controller, then these should have come with that as well. It is just inexcusable to not include it, when you are marketing your headset as a premium headset that supports the Xbox One & 360, and the PS4 & PS3. That support should be there OUT OF THE BOX. This problem by itself is a deal breaker for me. I will be giving these headphones to my daughter to listen to her TV/Music on.BOTTOM LINE:Sadly, the chat problems are a deal breaker for me. Otherwise, I think these would be perfectly serviceable headphones for gaming or listening to TV or music. In the end, though, I am going to be gaming with my Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Gaming Headset I picked up at the same time I got these. They are smaller, and less fancy, but they worked 100% right out of the box, with nothing complicated about them at all, and chat worked beautifully on the first try.So, for the Klipsch KG-300, I have to give it: 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KK9MP5CFOB63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFOKJNU#wasThisHelpful","R3KK9MP5CFOB63","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a decent little voice recorder. My only complaints about it, are that the status lights are WAY too faint and small. I didn't think it even had status lights at first, until I read the manual, and then knew where to look for them. Other than that, though, this unit is fairly solid. I did several sample recordings of myself talking, from various distances away, and it all played back fine. I was originally concerned that the device would fill up FAST since raw audio can be HUGE, but it is compressing it to a smaller format, and a 1 minute recording only took up a couple of Megabytes of space, so you should be able to use this sucker to record around 20-30 hours of voice (assuming the compression rate holds, and the charge holds -- you will most likely need to recharge it before you would be able to fill it up).Over all, this is a decent little unit that gets the job done. The controls could be a bit easier to use, and the status lights could be MUCH bigger and brighter, but either way, this will get the job done.4 stars.Disclosure: I was given a free copy of this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27NCVERREKPL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZL75TG#wasThisHelpful","R27NCVERREKPL8","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, I STRONGLY recommend you get a switch sampler kit, and TRY THE SWITCHES YOURSELF. I try to help you make the decision by walking you through the various switches I can show you, but really, NOTHING can substitute better for you just feeling the switches for yourself.Overall, this is just a rock solid keyboard, with very nice performance.

It is also soft and comfortable, has a removable cover for washing, and includes a generous amount of memory foam.

"I can't really say a lot about these headphones that is nice. Among the traits of these headphones which I don't find objectionable:1.) I can say that the ear cups have a nice fabric-y covering (better than leather or fake leather, absorbs less heat)2.) The removable microphone works well3.) The status notices from the unit are spoken words (powering up, powering down, etc.) instead of just beep codes.On to the objectionable traits.1.) The pairing process is RIDICULOUSLY complicated (you have to use a paperclip to press a recessed button!) and DOES NOT WORK WELL! I had to FIGHT with this stupid thing to get it to pair AT ALL. The instructions SAY that it will arrive pre-paired, but mine didn't. Just the overly long and obnoxious pairing process alone makes me not want to use these things. Seriously, headphone industry, you NEED to find a BETTER way to do this. It should be a one-button press thing that happens automatically. The Playstation and the Xbox have figured it out, why haven't you?2.) The digital audio cable they include with the unit is VERY short (just a little bit shorter than 2 feet long, tip to tip). I don't know about you, but NONE of my game systems sit within 2 feet of my TV. Conversely, the digital audio cable that has come with all of the other Turtle Beach headsets I have, were all around 4-6 feet in length -- much more practical to use. With this cable, your choices are to go out and get another one that is longer, or to move your game system to sit right under/next to your TV.3.) The whole unit is a light-weight plastic, and feels cheap.4.) The sound from the unit is spotty at best, and seems to suffer for poor signal quality.5.) The controls on the unit are too close together, and seem to be cross-wired or at least so close together that it is VERY easy to hit the wrong control when you are trying to find one by feel alone.In short, while there are some positives for this headset, I CANNOT recommend it. Turtle Beach normally puts out fine quality products -- but this is NOT one of them.2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CWEUBF5SMOIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQAACO#wasThisHelpful","R3CWEUBF5SMOIQ","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, if we ever do make a major spill on it, and the stain resistance proves to be not up to their claims, I will update this review.

All 3 of the devices charged fairly quickly, and I didn't observe any major problems. Of course, with a 3-port USB charger, that means keeping 3 USB charging cables in the car, which I would rather not do. Also, I did notice that the cables don't fit super-snug into the charging ports, so you have to do a bit of fiddling with the cables to get them all seated and charging.

"This Wahl trimmer is all right, but it isn't salon-grade, for sure.It feels cheap and plasticy, and the heads they include with it don't really impress me all that much. That being said, it is quite functional, and your average user will probably like this unit just fine. I have reviewed quite a few shavers over time, and I have come to have a pretty fine eye for these things. Nothing about this unit jumps out at me. I do like that they aren't using touch-controls for the unit. I also like the quick-charging battery, and the lithium-ion capacity and performance of the battery.Overall, this is a decent beard trimmer and shaver, but in my experience, these kinds of units can either be great shavers, or great beard trimmers, but never both. This one tries to be both, and like all the rest who have tried, I think it fails at it. There aren't a large variety of trimming tools available, and the shaving options are foil-based, which I don't really care for, and they are set in that dual rotary-drum layout which I REALLY don't care for.There isn't anything really WRONG with this unit, it just isn't stellar. So, I am giving it 4 stars, because Amazon won't let me do partial stars, but my actual rating is 3.5 stars.

Once the cloth ribbon in the center gets severely dirty, that will pretty much be it for these mats. They are nice looking, but they are going to be a pain-in-the-neck to clean. Can't just throw them in the washing machine and call it a day.So, like I said, these will be reserved for nicer dinners only, knowing full well that they won't be long for this Earth.

The labels you can make with it, though, are pretty impressive. The software you download to the computer includes a TON of pre-made labels in various categories (school, hospital, office, home, travel, etc.) with nice graphics and standard messages. And, then on top of that, they give you access to a BUNCH of clip-art, borders, and other cool things, in addition to fonts to craft custom labels. You can then save those labels, use them like templates, etc. etc. It is all very slick, and works very well.Additionally, the label ribbons themselves aren't as expensive as labels I have used in the past for an older Casio model, and they stick VERY well, AND the backs of the labels are split down the back making peeling off the backing to expose the adhesive MUCH easier.

"Meh.I am a long-time software engineer who has also been doing web stuff since the 1990's. I have been largely avoiding JavaScript and jQuery where I could, and only using it as built-into the .NET framework with update panels, and similar constructs -- or just using snippets of JavaScript I have built up into a handy library over the years to show/hide things, change fonts, etc. I have been using HTML5 since it came out, though, that and CSS3 are pretty much unavoidable.But, I figured, since jQuery doesn't seem to be going away, I might as well sit down and fiddle with it until I could bend it to my will :)This book starts out strong (although I skipped right to chapter 4, and the first 3 chapters are just intros, ""about the book"" and a history of web applications (which I already knew). Chapters 4 & 5 went along swimmingly, then chapter 6 (jQuery) arrived.Listen, I am a developer with almost 2 solid decades of programming experience across a wide swath of languages, and I am telling you that the structure of chapter 6 leaves much to be desired. Instead of breaking the chapter into smaller parts, and including intros for each concept, etc. the author just kind of dumps everything out in one long string. Yes, there are examples, and section headers, but it seems like the author just wanted to get that info dump out there as fast as possible, so they could move on to playing with the jQuery.Now, I am no stranger to jQuery, like I said, I have been avoiding it, not ignoring it. I have jQuery deployed in quite a few production apps at this very moment. But, I hadn't ever sat down to study and understand it. I would just google for whatever it was I needed to do, find a code sample on stack-overflow, or similar, and then away I would go. My purpose behind getting this book was to get a solid understanding of jQuery-speak. And, while I can certainly do that with this book (because the information IS there), I cannot do it easily. The author quickly jumps into selectors, and then immediately springboards into DOM manipulation from there, expanding rapidly on the vocabulary and keyword usage, without every really stopping to catch one's breath.If you can make it through chapter 6, and get your head around everything, then the rest of the book will be downhill for you. But, as for myself, I didn't care for the author's layout and information presentation style in the book. Too rushed, and too much of an information dump, in my opinion.  I would have broken it down into sections, with each section having a clear purpose, and goal, with explanations along the way.

"I am, by no means, an audio expert. I can just tell you what I have experienced. The sound output from these headphones seems really good to me. The bass is very deep, and very satisfying. High vocal ranges come through clear, and everything in the middle sounds good to my non-expert ears.Additionally, I am a fan of quality materials used in the construction of things like this. These are made out of metal and leather, and some plastic and some synthetic fabric, but the majority materials are metal and leather. (Note, the leather earpieces can get warmer faster than fabric covered ear-pieces).I also like the extra-long cords that come with the headphones (with a nice braided cover as well), and the hard-case for storing them in. You can also order custom face-plate ""shields"" with stock graphics, or your own graphics -- which I thought was pretty cool (you have to do that directly with V-Moda, though, you can't do it through Amazon).My biggest complaint about these headphones, is that stock/out-of-the-box, they were TIGHT on my head, which would have given me headaches. Luckily, this isn't my first time to the new headphones rodeo, so I knew to stretch them out by putting a few books together and putting the headphones on the books to stretch them out for about a week.

Let it air out for a day like they say to do in the instructions, then put a mattress protector over it, and then sheets, etc. The bed is much more comfortable with the memory foam topper on it. We have toppers on all of our beds (from various manufacturers), and they all work just fine. They DO retain body heat a bit better than a basic mattress would, but not drastically. And, if you have the topper under a mattress cover, and sheets, then the body heat retention shouldn't be that severe. Overall, it does exactly what it is supposed to do.The only thing I DIDN'T like about this one, is for some reason they decided to punch a bunch of holes all throughout the thing. I don't know WHY they did that, but I don't like that. You can't feel the holes when you lay on it, but it still bugs me that they did that. Like I said, we own a lot of mattress toppers, and this is the first time I have ever seen one with holes in it. It kind of screams ""cost savings"" to me, and if that is the case, it should be advertised as such.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ICTLUNNRP90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HQ0MGW#wasThisHelpful","R24ICTLUNNRP90","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works well enough. I bought this for one reason, and that was to sit in a windowsill and pull in cool air from an open window to cool the house off at night. It works OK at that, but the air displacement from this unit isn't very good (which isn't surprising, it is small). It is also louder than you might expect, on the highest setting.

"I am using this bad-boy in my ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop right now. I tried several SSDs and after much research and trial and error, I settled on this one. It comes with data transfer and porting tools, but I just did a fresh install of the OS on it, so I can't report how well the tools work. I trust Samsung, and this drive was universally well-rated and reviewed. I have been using it for over a month now, and the speeds are excellent both up and down. I am so used to running on a SSD now, that when I use the computers at work, they seem like they are running in slow motion to me >_<The drive has been rock solid so far, and I really like it. Installation was a breeze. They include drive-cloning and data-porting software for free with the purchase of the drive, and the drive is big enough to use as a main OS/""C"" drive, and still have enough room to install your core software to run as SSD speeds (games, and general data I am keeping on a separate ""data-only"" drive in the second HDD port on the laptop).5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M9MWSLV2ONGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3W19MO#wasThisHelpful","R1M9MWSLV2ONGS","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very very nice set. The blu-ray transfers are beautifully cleaned up, with enhanced colors, and good audio. There are multiple subtitling options to cater to all tastes, and everything is as I remember it. The sets also include a nice book that lists the episodes and gives a summary for each, and includes some samples of the manga. This is the first volume of a planned 7 volume run. The first volume will give you a good idea about whether or not the series is for you or not ;)Also note, with this set, Viz has FINALLY fixed the order of the episodes so they run in the correct order, and are not out of sequence any more (the most glaringly annoying example of which was that in the old sets they use to run the episodes: ""The Abduction of P-Chan"" and ""Close Call! The Dance of Death... On Ice!"" (the ice skating episodes) AFTER they ran ""Enter Shampoo, the Gung-Ho Girl! I Put My Life in Your Hands"" -- which made NO SENSE, because Akane has a flashback in the Shampoo intro-episodes where she remembers events from the ice skating episodes, that HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET, when they were presented in the wrong order.)Parental Warning: For those in the United States (and elsewhere) still fiercely clinging to ancient Puritanical vices on nudity (but for some reason are perfectly OK with wanton/graphic violence o_O), you should note that there is a fair amount of female non-sexual nudity in this series, especially in the first season.

"These things work really well! I have been using these things for about a month now (I was originally just going to use grease pencils, until I saw someone else recommending these on Amazon), and I have to say I am impressed! The stickers go on easily, and they stay on quite nicely. I have run MANY of the stickers attached to the lids of our glassware, through the dishwasher (top shelf), and they have all stayed firmly affixed to the lids.

"Pretty darn good. I like it! I had zero problems getting this to connect to my ipad. I had no problem getting my ipad into the case. And the keyboard itself works very well. And, the kickstand mode for this case works a LOT better than the standard ipad case. I was also impressed that the case is designed so that the keyboard isn't active, unless you have it in kickstand mode, it can detect when it it in that mode, and only enables the keyboard then. You should know, though, that this case is QUITE heavier than the standard ipad case Apple sells. If you hold your ipad in your hand a lot, you should expect an additional amount of wrist strain because of that.PROS:-works very well-keyboard is responsive and pairs easily with the ipad-gives your ipad a kickstand easy way to prop up-keyboard turns itself on and off depending on how you are using the caseCONS:-it is HEAVY4 stars! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBVLBEFX8BBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELOEIDG#wasThisHelpful","RUBVLBEFX8BBU","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have bought, literally, 5 ASUS laptops and counting. And, you know what, I am done with brand loyalty. Brand loyalty is for suckers. I am also done with cheap laptops with cheap components.I bought this laptop, and not only did the Seagate Hard Disc Drive (HDD) die, but this model also had the fun problem of the socket to plug the AC power into, came loose from the sidewall of the laptop, making it impossible to charge it after that (unless I wanted to break it open and resolder the connections). I didn't cheap out on this model, either. I paid $600 for it when I bought it. I was expecting FAR BETTER quality than I got.ASUS *CAN* make a VERY GOOD laptop. However, you have to be willing to shell out the premium bucks if you want their quality stuff. Their Republic of Gamers (RoG) line is actually quite good. Their stock/discount lines (which is what you are looking at now) are where ASUS cuts corners to make up profits for the slimmer margins they must have on their decent lines such as the RoG line.Most of their ""bargain"" models come with Seagate hard disk drives (HDD) -- and, I am not kidding, almost every single Seagate drive I have ever owned, has died a horrible death within 1-2 years of normal usage. I have had 2 full-sized HDDs die on me, 1 external HDD die, and 3 laptop HDDs, in three SEPARATE ASUS laptops, die. ALL of them were Seagate drives. In contrast, the RoG ASUS that I have, shipped with a Hitachi HDD, which are widely regarded as one of the best on the market, and I have owned several, and NONE of my Hitachi drives have died, and they are still alive and kicking to this day.In short, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a CHEAP laptop that you ONLY expect to be used for business/school needs, and it will be kept CAREFULLY on a desk, and HARDLY EVER MOVED, and you only expect to get 2-3 years out of that laptop (TOPS) before it dies, then go ahead and get one of the cheap ASUS models.If you want to be able to take the laptop around with you, also use if for gaming (or graphics work, or video work, or anything else RAM/Processor intensive) AND you want it to last AT LEAST 4-6 years (treated decently), then shell out for a top-line ASUS (like their RoG line), or get an Alienware, or a Samsung laptop.My experience with this laptop, and 3 others like it, all from the bargain line of laptops from ASUS, has been to teach me that you get what you pay for, and cheap up-front isn't as good a deal as quality and pricier up-front. My Republic of Gamers laptop from ASUS has been working very, very well. It came with quality parts, and runs very nicely with no problems.

"I got this model of ASUS laptop 3 years ago. I still have it, and it is still running fine.  I have owned 5 ASUS laptops over the years. This one isn't the best one I've owned, but it isn't bad. Most of the rest of them were the ""cheap"" models ASUS has, that I bought for my girls. Get the better/more expensive models, it makes a HUGE difference.I bought the A73E-XE1 to work on, and to game. It ended up being a bit under-powered for both gaming and video editing. For programming and database work it excelled, though. It seems that ASUS used some decent components in it, though, as it is 3 years later, and it is still running fine.The A73E-XE1 is a 64-bit machine running under a GeForce GTX 660M GPU. It ships (at least mine did) with a 650GB, 5400RPM HDD, has a full-sized keyboard, and number pad, and a 17"" screen.

As for video cards, count yourself lucky if you get a name-brand. Most likely you will be getting an Intel baked-in, on-motherboard video setup to handle your graphics. Including this one, the A53U-AS21 comes with Intel graphics. What that means is, no modern video games at decent settings, and games yet to be released may not run well (or at all) on that laptop -- which is all well and good if you don't play games on your laptop.Additional problems I have had with ASUS laptops in their bargain tier have been:-the little rubber feet on the bottom of the device which are supposed to balance the unit and provide shock absorption, fall off.-one of my ASUS laptops had a faulty connector where the AC power plug-in point was, and came detached from the side-wall of the laptop, making it impossible to charge the laptop anymore without ripping it open and soldering that connection point back into place (for the record, that model that happened to was the K53E-C1)-I have had frequent memory problems with many of my ASUS laptops until I ripped out their cheap RAM from no-name companies, and replaced it with top-of-the-line Corsair RAM or similar.-the amount of bloatware and shovelware that comes pre-installed on ASUS laptops is getting worse and more numerous each year.In short, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a CHEAP laptop that you ONLY expect to be used for business/school needs, and it will be kept CAREFULLY on a desk, and HARDLY EVER MOVED, and you only expect to get 2-3 years out of that laptop (TOPS) before it dies, then go ahead and get one of the cheap ASUS models.If you want to be able to take the laptop around with you, also use if for gaming (or graphics work, or video work, or anything else RAM/Processor intensive) AND you want it to last AT LEAST 4-6 years (treated decently), then shell out for a top-line ASUS (like their RoG line), or get an Alienware, or a Samsung laptop.All of the top-line models are going to cost you more, but if you do the math, it works out as a better deal in the long-run. The ""bargain"" laptops tend to run $300-$500, and you will get 2-3 years out of them (less if they aren't treated VERY well). To get decent memory use out of them, you may then spend another $50-$150 upgrading the RAM (which is easy to do, even for non-technical people) and another $50-200 upgrading the HDD (unlikely unless you are a tech-type person). Multiply the base amount by 2, and you get a cost of $600-$1000 for 4-6 years of computing, having to buy a new ""cheap one"" half way through. And, if you DO upgrade the RAM each time you get one, then it will actually be more like $700-1300. If you also upgrade the HDD, then it will be more like $800-1700. So, at the most optimistic, you get a cost/year of $100-167 up to $150-$250, and a cost per year of $133-283 up to $200-$425 at the higher end of the scale, if you are an upgrader.But, if you get one of the more premium models to start with, at a cost of anywhere from $500-$900 (or even more if you really want to shell out for a power machine), then your cost per year goes down dramatically to $83-$125 on the cheaper end of the scale up to $150-$225 on the higher end. For 4-6 years of decent, hassle-free, computing (if you treat and handle the laptop well).My experience with this laptop, and 3 others like it, all from the bargain line of laptops from ASUS, has been to teach me that you get what you pay for, and cheap up-front isn't as good a deal as quality and pricier up-front.

"I have an iPad (current gen) I like to carry around with me sometimes, and having the ability to charge it while on the go, without having to carry around the full charging setup, can be quite handy. This little device fits that need quite nicely. I have tested it, and it worked fine to charge my iPad via the USB to Lighting adapter. It also fits on my keychain ring (although it is VERY thick, and you will need to use another key, or something, to get the ring open wide enough to start threading it on the ring). Once that is done, though, carrying it around with you makes being able to charge your Lighting powered devices on the go, much more likely.Caveats: the cord is VERY short, so you will need to plug this in someplace where you can lay your device down as well. Also note, the power the device receives is dependent on the type of USB source you plug it into. A LOT of USB ports on computers DO NOT output enough AMPS to power charging an iPad -- that IS NOT the fault of this device. You have to plug it into a USB source that is outputting enough AMPS, to charge the device. Some USB hubs do that, and any USB to AC adapter (like the one that comes with your iPhone/iPad) will do that.Overall, this is a good product.

"This is the sequel to Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy, which I read and reviewed as a 5-star book -- you should read it too! :)This followup book continues the story from the first book, and it keeps many of the same characters (including the titular Hank, naturally) from the first book. Not a whole lot of the stuff explained in the first book are recapped again for the sequel. So, while reading the first book isn't necessary to reading and understanding this book, I highly recommend it (besides, Campbell is an independent author, and I am sure he could use the support!)Hard Luck Hank: Basketful of Crap is difficult to categorize as was the first book. It is set in a Star Wars-y/Halo-y/Mass Effect-y universe (dirty/well lived in/high tech/military & super-humans). The book also has humor in it -- it is a dry/dark sense of humor, but it is still humor ;)The story is basically a continuation of the first book, but set after a 7 year period of time has lapsed. Events from the first book are commented on, but not generally explained. The story is basically an ongoing narrative from Hank as he deals with an ever-escalating series of issues and events as things spin out of control on his space station. There are quite a few fire fights, and there are lots of instances of random/weird stuff happening that Hank has to deal with.The story in the sequel again moves along at a fast pace, like the first book. And you will get hooked pretty quickly wanting to know what happens next, and also wanting to know what the answer is behind the big mysteries in the story. The story is well written, polished, and well edited (better edited in fact, than a LOT of major-publisher written stuff I have read).Overall, I liked the book, hence my 4.5 star rating. However, I did dock it half a star this time around, because frankly the story got a little less fun for me. The first book was lighter, and sillier; it had goofy alien girls in love with Hank and not realizing the situation they were in. It had crazy-powerful mutants messing up everything; it had robots running amuck; it had Hank yelling his trademark line (before attacking someone), ""eat suck, suckface!"" and it coming off as comedy; it had mad scientists, galaxy-destroying ships and insane street-gang politics in it. It was just a fun read.In contrast, the sequel gets a bit heavier. Gone are the goofy girls in love with Hank -- in their place are random people being shot to death outside Hank's door. Gone are the crazy-powerful mutants, Hank is pretty much the last remaining powerful mutant on the space station. There are no robots running amuck, but there are powerful assassin women running amuck -- but they keep stabbing Hank. There is a weirdly cheerful guy who befriends Hank, and seems to have a weird power over females, and the story rarely leaves the space station this time.  Everything just feels more closed in, and restricted in this book, even in situations where Hank yells his ""eat suck, suckface,"" line, Hank is in danger, and even he is worried about whether he should say it or not given the situation he is in. Finally, the biggest bummer for me, was that Hank was made more vulnerable in this book. In the first book, Hank is basically indestructible. That made the fire fights more or less fun, because we weren't worried about the viewpoint character, so we could appreciate the situations in a macabre way as the action and dark comedy unfolded. In this book, Hank keeps getting hurt (which happened in the first book) -- but now for some reason, it is affecting him in ways which is making it very hard for Hank to move or even feel things -- and it is freaking Hank out. That isn't fun. Hank spends a LARGE portion of the last 1/4 of the book being very worried about himself and his mutation -- and that just bummed me out.I STRONGLY hope that the 3rd book will ""fix"" Hank, at least enough so that he is more or less at the same point he was at in the first book. Because, 2nd book Hank wasn't nearly as fun to read about -- and with his limitations given to him in the book, if things keep progressing as they have been, I am not sure what Hank is really going to be able to do in the 3rd book.Overall, though, this is a quality sci-fi story. If you like sci-fi, you should like this book. It is better than a LOT of the stuff out there now. Read it! :)4.5 stars![Full disclosure: the author gave me a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review]---------------------------------Book Content Guide For Parents:---------------------------------Sex & Nudity: [1/5] sex is mentioned, but only in passing. There were no nudity or actual sex scenes. There are a couple of kissing scenes, and women's bodies are commented on appreciatively -- but in very generic terms ( like, ""and she was muscular and had an amazing figure"" sort of terms).Violence & Gore: [2/5] minimal, mostly PG/PG-13 action-movie types of stuff. There are fire fights in the book where people die via gunshot and explosion, but none of it is described. That's about it. No torture, no crimes against women, no graphic details of much of anything. Even in a fight scene where Hank is involved, when he gets stabbed or whatever, we aren't worried about it, because he is basically invulnerable. Hank DOES crush someone in a bear-hug kind of attack in one fight (and the crush is told about, but not described in detail), and hurts that person, but to be fair, that person was trying to kill him.Profanity: [1/5] the occasional crass language is used (not profane, just crass), women's bodies are described in a couple of scenes (but not graphically, just appreciatively). I don't recall much in the way of profanity.Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: [2/5] there are scenes in bars. Drug addicts are talked about, but are never ""on camera."" Characters drink in a few scenes, but no attention is called to it.Frightening/Intense Scenes: [3.5/5] The last 1/4 of the book is fairly intense. There are some major battles, and lots of people die, and Hank has to run for his life. There are fights where people close to Hank are in serious danger. The main villain in the book is crazy powerful and insane, and creepy. There are at least 2 fight scenes I recall where Hank is in genuine danger during the fight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SH75GEX9X0WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU9JRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SH75GEX9X0WB","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had this game on pre-order ever since it was available for order. It is brimming with inside jokes and references for fans of the show. Even if you aren't a fan of the show, the game is a good RPG all by itself. It is a turn-based RPG in the grand tradition of old-school RPGs like the Final Fantasy & Dragon Quest series.  Standard RPG tropes are featured like upgradeable: weapons, armor and trinkets that boost various stats. You can also tinker with the items a bit with a limited crafting system that allows you to add your favorite types of boosts, stats and/or powers to items you gain, or want to make more powerful.The story is PURE South Park. If you are a fan of the show, you will LOVE it.  If you AREN'T a fan of the show ... you may like it, if you don't mind graphic stuff (expect graphic violence, graphic sexual content, and some pretty gross stuff as well overall, NC-17 stuff) -- then there is plenty of humor and plenty of entertainment to be had.Overall, the game-play is solid, the jokes are funny, the production values are stellar.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XJUUZJHAL9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IOAHTQ#wasThisHelpful","R24XJUUZJHAL9J","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dreadnaught (Book #7 of the ""Black Jack"" Geary series, is also book #1 of the ""Beyond the Frontier"" series, which succeeded the ""Lost Fleet"" series) picks up right where Victorious (Book #6) leaves off in the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell. The only real difference, is the fleet is no longer lost, so the series from this point on is called the ""Beyond the Frontier"" series. The fleet is still under the command of John ""Black Jack"" Geary (now an Admiral), but they are no longer trying to head for home. [minor spoiler alert] If you want to read this book, then you should already know that Geary got the fleet back to Alliance territory, and then was able to turn around with that same fleet after repairing and resupplying, and was able to force an end to the war. [/end: minor spoiler alert]In this book, now with the war between the Alliance and the Syndics ended, humanity can turn its beleaguered gaze to the apparent cause of the war in the first place, the aliens on the other side of Syndic space.  [minor spoiler alert] Aliens, who quickly went from suspected, to outright seen and fought against, at the end of book #6, Victorious. [/end: minor spoiler alert] Now, after Geary & Desjani (whom I love) has managed to take care of some personal business, they are back with the fleet -- Geary is still an Admiral, and they have been ordered to head into the unknown region of space where these aliens reside, and to try to establish peaceful contact with them -- but, failing that, at least get the aliens to understand that any further aggression from them will be met with strong resistance from humanity.What follows is an interesting tale with more issues from cranky officers who think they should be running things, romance gone wrong, and an alien culture which completely baffles Geary and his trusted officers, forcing them into fights they don't want.  The ending was kind of abrupt though, I am fairly certain the author was told he was running long, and he just had to pick a place to end it, instead of planning the ending. But, regardless, it is an enjoyable read, and the next book is already out, so it is no big deal to get the next one and keep reading.The Lost Fleet/Beyond the Frontier -- ""Black Jack"" Geary series are some of my favorite Military Science Fiction series, and frankly, they are some of my favorite series, period. It is a story told in the grand tradition of Star Trek/Star Wars and epic space operas in general. The ""Black Jack"" Geary series (although sometimes very corny) are what got me majorly hooked on Military Science Fiction, which lead to me discovering other excellent series after that, such as the Man of War by Honsinger, and the Frontlines series by Kloos, and the Shadowstorm series by Almasi.

"Victorious (Book #6 (and the last book in the original Lost Fleet series)) picks up right where Relentless (Book #5) leaves off in the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell.[spoiler alert!]......Geary has managed to get the fleet all the way back into Alliance territory, and he has managed to make use of the technology that the brilliant Captain Cresida invented, to stave off disaster with the hypernet gates. Now, safe for the moment, a lot of things happen very quickly, many of which were predicted by Geary's officers. But, once the initial political issues are dealt with (I won't say how ^_^), there are more immediate concerns....[/end: spoiler alert]Geary is tasked with leading the fleet back into Syndic space, this time with the aim of ending the war, for good. The fleet is given minimal time to repair the worst damage, resupply, and lick their wounds, and then sent out again. The Syndics are reeling, their fleets have been (mostly) destroyed, and the alien threat is looming large. Many of the Syndic star systems are in open revolt/civil war and everyone is looking to Geary for leadership and answers (poor Geary must be popping antacids like skittles at this point).The story ramps up to a major confrontation and satisfying conclusion, then it takes a turn and provides a nice setup for the next series that continues where the Lost Fleet leaves off, the Beyond The Frontier series (see, because, they aren't lost any more). The ending of the book is especially nice, and long awaited. I highlighted like the last 10 pages of the book. Very sweet, and very satisfying payoff to a long-running story thread.The Lost Fleet series is one of my favorite Military Science Fiction series, and frankly, it is one of my favorite series, period.

The Fleet is also still under attack from internal sources trying to assassinate Geary to force a return to the way things used to be, before he took command. The assassination and betrayal-from-within subplot comes to a major peak in this book.In this book, we get a lot more up-close and personal interaction with the Marines, who we follow for decent lengths of time as they liberate a POW camp.

"Valiant (Book #4) picks up right where Courageous (Book #3) leaves off in the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell. The fleet is still under the command of Captain John ""Black Jack"" Geary, and they are still trying to head for home. Things are getting serious now. Geary has decided to jump right back to Lakota, the location of their last fatal encounter with the Syndics where they were ambushed by Syndics who were just as surprised to see them as Geary's fleet was. The return to Lakota strategy is basically to go on a surprise offensive, while also giving his ships more time in jump space for repairs.From this point on for the rest of the series, the actions Geary has been taking in the series start to pay off. Syndics are listening to him, and even reluctant officers under his command begin to believe in what Geary has to say. Of course, there are still some die-hards who will stop at literally NOTHING to stop Geary from ruining the way they think the war should be governed.The Lost Fleet series is very entertaining, very realistic Military Science Fiction told in an epic space navy/space opera sort of way. There are huge space battles, Marine actions, love and hate, revenge and loyalty, duty and valor.

"I loved To Honor You Call Us (Man of War, Book 1) and the sequel did not disappoint me. It started off a little rocky (the somewhat pedantic method used by the author to explain tactics to the reader by having the captain ""teach"" the doctor gets a little old, fairly quickly -- luckily, the author stops doing that after a few chapters) but then it settled in and more than made up for the rocky start with an excellent amount of interesting and exciting military science fiction.The story takes place mostly in space, aboard space navy vessels -- in particular the Destroyer-class ship captained by Max Robichaux (the protagonist and viewpoint character for the story). Humanity is still deeply involved in a war for survival for the human species. Max is still training his crew, and he and his crew are still forced to deal with insane situations. The battles are interesting and exciting, and the danger always feels real.The universe feels lived-in, but not dirty. Fans of Star Wars and Star Trek should like this series. There are lots of great details about military duty, and there are lots of aspects of the story that are full of honor and duty and brotherhood and camaraderie.There are still a SURPRISING amount of details/conversations/plot points that involve organized religion (specifically the Muslim and Christian ones) -- which still feels out of place to me in a science-fiction story. I can appreciate that the author is trying to teach some people things they may not know, and expose them to ideas of tolerance and inclusion in the best tradition of Gene Roddenberry and his philosophy for Star Trek (amongst other tributes to Star Trek found in the books) -- but it still feels out of place.Overall, if you are looking for a good, clean, entertaining military science fiction story brimming with honor and duty and military details and engagements -- WITHOUT any horrific violence, crimes against women, or other vulgarities that can be found in other stories, then you will like this series.5 stars---------------------------------Book Content Guide For Parents:---------------------------------Sex & Nudity: [0/5] I don't recall any sex of nudity in the book.Violence & Gore: [1/5] almost completely absent -- there is an execution scene in the book of a traitor, who is executed via expulsion from the airlock, and there is space combat where people die, but none of it is described.Profanity: [3.5/5] it is a military novel, OF COURSE it has language in it. It is fairly tame (although I would say a bit stronger than the first book in the series). All of the ""big 4"" make it in, and some fairly strong additional ones as well. Nothing too terribly graphic or offensive, though (no crude sexual remarks, racial epithets, or hate-speech).Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: [2/5] I don't recall any smoking. There is a bit of drinking in the story, nothing graphic or glamorized, though -- mostly just sailors having beers occasionally.Frightening/Intense Scenes: [2/5] pretty standard PG/PG-13 action/war movie stuff. Also, the execution scene is pretty intense. There are some military battles, soldiers die, and the protagonist and his crew is in mortal danger more than once. But it is never horrifying or sadistic stuff. None of it bothered me. Much milder than the first book in the series","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKX4EXU2FTZ6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU0NOP0#wasThisHelpful","RKX4EXU2FTZ6T","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listen, if you are not a fan of the Simpsons, then this is just another town building game, and most of the buildings and characters in it won't mean anything to you. This is a game for fans of the Simpsons, pure and simple.I would describe the game as a cross between a town building sim, and an RPG-lite. The game has actual stories and quests/missions, etc. to accomplish, all the while leveling up, which unlocks new characters, new buildings, and new stories!The game is also REGULARLY updated (at least every 2 to 3 weeks) with new content that is either:-a new level-a special event based around a real or Simpsons-universe holiday-a new episode tie-inMost of the special event updates for the major holidays, are HUGE, with TONS of stuff to do (Halloween and Christmas are the biggest).The game *IS* a freemium/free-to-play (f2p) game, which is kind of a bummer. BUT, of all of the f2p games I have played, THIS ONE does it right! You can play the WHOLE GAME, unrestricted, and have a GOOD TIME doing so, FOR FREE -- no strings attached.  Seriously.  I have been playing since they released the game to the Android platform in June of 2013, and I haven't stopped since. This was the first game to really hook me since the original Plants Vs. Zombies game hooked me, and it has managed to keep me hooked far longer than that game did.The way that Tapped Out makes money, is by generating unique content that costs the in-game premium currency that costs real world money, that are ACTUALLY WORTH THE COST (a shocking idea, I know). The content can range from fan-favorite characters that won't unlock unless you buy them (often times originally free during an event, to win, before becoming premium content), to special/cool buildings and decorations, and sometimes limited time characters or event tie-ins. You can also use the premium currency to rush the completion of tasks and building, but in my opinion that is a waste of money.I view the game like a standard MMORPG game, and budget according to the assumption of $15/month subscription fee. I don't buy nearly as much as some of the players do, but of all of the f2p games I have paid, THIS ONE (even if it wasn't a Simpsons game) makes me want to reward the developers for their efforts. (Listen, I am as shocked as you are that EA managed to not screw up a game so badly that I want nothing to do with it. I don't know what to tell you, it is a GOOD game)Yes, the game has bugs (constantly), but what MMORPG doesn't have bugs?I hope that Star Wars/Star Trek/Lord of the Rings and other fan-favorite properties follow the example The Simpsons: Tapped Out is setting, and create similar games, of similar quality.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2W2Z8ZQZZ1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTQ6SIG#wasThisHelpful","R2R2W2Z8ZQZZ1W","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a decent mobile MMORPG-lite game (you MUST be online to play, and you play against other players).Unlike Spartan Wars: Empire of Honor, which I hated, and which was no fun, because the other players tear new players apart pretty much immediately, THIS game gives new players a chance to breathe, and to get their feet under them.The Hobbit game AUTOMATICALLY protects all new player for 7 real-time days, and also allows players to build vaults in their towns to protect a certain minimum percent of their resources from other players, and The Hobbit game regularly lets players win items that will protect their towns for a certain period of time, all for free. That makes The Hobbit game playable enough for new players, that even if other players are picking on them, they can still soldier on and build up their town, and eventually even get even with those who picked on them, if they want -- ALL without having to spend any money to do so.In contrast, Spartan Wars throws you to the wolves, IMMEDIATELY. That means that the other players are free to attack you, and take ALL of your resources, relentlessly, while you, somehow, try to build up your city. It is impossible unless you pay, or join a powerful enough alliance that will protect you long enough so you can get your feet under you. So, unless you pay them for magical protections/etc. in the game, you pretty much have NO CHANCE of surviving the game.The Middle Earth tie-ins for this game provide a pleasant atmosphere for the game to take place. It is basically a real-time, card-type/power-type, strategy game. It is similar to an RTS, except you cannot control how your armies fight, or your base defenses fight.Make no mistake, though, this game IS a Player vs. Player (PvP) game, and you WILL be attacked. That, essentially, is the whole game, after all. In the early stages, it will be all about leveling up, and unlocking more powerful units and resource buildings. Then, in the later stages it will be about building up your armies, and getting even for what was done to you earlier ^_^You can join a guild/alliance if you want, but that is WAY too much work for me. I would rather just soldier on alone, and survive or fail on my own. I like this game enough, and have had enough fun with it, that I have bought their premium currency a couple of times, and used it to help speed myself down the path to revenge.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOIG0RPUI6UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9IGYJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3QOIG0RPUI6UG","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game, like The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-earth is an MMORPG-lite game. You MUST be online to play, and the gameplay is in a PvP world populated with other players.HOWEVER, unlike in The Hobbit game, this game throws you to the wolves, IMMEDIATELY. That means that the other players are free to attack you, and take ALL of your resources, relentlessly, while you, somehow, try to build up your city. It is impossible unless you pay, or join a powerful enough alliance that will protect you long enough so you can get your feet under you. So, unless you pay them for magical protections/etc. in the game, you pretty much have NO CHANCE of surviving the game. The WORST kind of PvP anarchy and brutality is on full display in this ""game,"" and the trolls populating it are welcome to it.In contrast, The Hobbit game AUTOMATICALLY protects all new player for 7 real-time days, and also allows players to build vaults in their towns to protect a certain minimum percent of their resources of other players, and The Hobbit game regularly lets players win items that will protect their towns for a certain period of time, all for free. That makes The Hobbit game playable enough for new players, that even if other players are picking on them, they can still soldier on and build up their town, and eventually even get even with those who picked on them, if they want -- ALL without having to spend any money to do so.I played for 3 days, and during that time my little, puny town with barely any resources at all, was attacked at least hourly from every neighbor within a 2-screen radius of where my town was. It was almost hilarious how badly they picked on new players. I tried to soldier on and hoped that the game would provide SOME mechanic to alleviate the brutal player abuse in the game -- but there was nothing. So, I ended up using the various game pieces I had to destroy all of my resource generating building, and then I deleted the game. They can pick at the empty bones of my town until they realize I'm never coming back, and give up. I would have just deleted my town, but I couldn't find a way to do that.All of this is because of the insane business model this game, and many like it, are using. If they were charging a fee up-front, then their business would revolve around keeping paying customers happy. If that was the business model they were using, then I guarantee you that there would be game mechanics in place to allow new players to get their feet under them, before being thrown to the wolves. But, their game mechanic is to pretend that the game is free, but in order to get you to pay, they have hobbled the game to such a degree, that it is mostly unplayable unless you pay them, or you are willing to endure an INSANELY long wait time to build up resources, and your armies, while having everything constantly stolen from you by players oftentimes barely more powerful than you are, perpetuating a vicious cycle for those who stick it out long enough to become strong enough to attack other players.The game is zero fun, so I rate it 0 stars (but I gave it 1 star, because Amazon made me).","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFV1J42F9IH7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5TMK22#wasThisHelpful","RFV1J42F9IH7M","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is for fans of the Muppets, ONLY.There isn't a lot to do in the game. Basically, you clear stages for Muppets to perform. The Muppets perform a rhythm/scat/beatbox/a Capella song on each stage, each Muppet adding their own part to the song, usually by just making some sort of noise, occasionally actually singing.You earn money automatically from each Muppet, and they earn more if they are happier, and of a higher level. You level them up by using the money to buy food.That's about it, that's the whole game.You can use in-game money to buy additional set pieces and decorations for the Muppets and the stages, and you can also use in-game money to buy some of the Muppets for each stage. For the rest of the Muppets, it is trivial to get them from ""Harv-E"" the robot that you can use to generate the Muppets by basically trying to ""win"" them in a gambling setup. For each stage, though, there are always a few Muppets that are very hard to get that way. The idea being that you will get impatient and spend diamonds to get them (the premium currency for this ""free"" app). However, it has been my experience that almost every Muppet is winnable if you are just patient enough to keep trying the free way. The exception is limited-time Muppets, who are almost impossible to win in the given time frame. But, meh, there isn't enough GAME in this game to justify me spending any money on it. There is ZERO story line, and ZERO to do, besides level up the Muppets, and buy stuff for their stage. That's it, that is all there is to do.Like I said, this is a decent time waster to have on your phone while waiting in line at a grocery store or something, but I wouldn't pay any money for this. If they want to get money out of me, first of all, just charge me up-front, and secondly, provide content WORTH money. Not costumes and characters, or eliminating arbitrary wait times. Provide story lines, and expansion packs with new lands/levels/etc. THEN I will be happy to shell out some $$$ for you.4 stars (for fans of the Muppets, 2 stars for everyone else).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ7LLIEKP9R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E83G68K#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ7LLIEKP9R1","APBDZ88BBTN4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APBDZ88BBTN4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Bocce kit is fun. The idea of ""glow in the dark"" Bocce is great.However, there are a few things that really lessen the fun:1. One of the balls was almost out of light the moment we turned it on2. Maybe the blues were made in different batches, but they're a little different from each other.3. The light for the pallino is too bright. I shines through making a bright white spotThis could be a lot of fun if you're just trying to get your family introduced to Bocce for the first time.The balls actually feel heavier than I expected. Are you going to use them in a pro match? No (but that'd be cool).The lighting is great, they glow well except for as mentioned about the pallino. The white spot on it is so bright, we don't even want to look at it.It really is a shame that the balls aren't completely round. They bulge where the battery access is located. Rolling one of the balls, we can see it rolling unevenly. Seems like something that wouldn't be hard to have gotten right from the start if they had done testing, or maybe their process is off, and will hopefully fix it.

"Looking at some of the manufacturer responses, this supplement uses the ubiquinone form. A little bit of research on the good ol' information super highway shows that your body can make use of both types of CoQ10 (ubiquinone and ubiquinol).Which one is faster absorbed? Hard to say. The Viva labs has the black pepper extract which is to help absorption.Noticeable results? I haven't noticed any increase in energy. Does that mean the supplement doesn't work? I don' think so, there are many factors that can affect energy levels, and isolating one can be hard.

This can be confusing during the day to see if you've left it on or not -- The bluetooth indicator is a bright blue right within the speaker top. It's a little annoying.

"We've used Magnesium Oxide with Zinc in the past as a magnesium supplement. It did have a slight laxative effect if you took all three tablets.I've heard that different magnesium variations get absorbed to varying degrees by the body, so I was excited to test the Magnesium by Viva labs.The first thing of note is that the tablets are large and the serving size is two. The odd thing is that these are about four times as large as the tablets we currently had and the daily percent value is halved. These give you only 50% of the RDA. That could be because it's absorbed much more readily, but it's odd.It has been recommended by other sources online (I know, I know), but this type of Magnesium seems to be rated at really being absorbed better by the body.Didn't notice any side effects with with this, so it seems good.

"I'm comparing this case against the Spiegen Capsule case which has a very similar appearance (a clear case for the iPhone 6s).-- Size ---The first thing I noticed about the Speck case is that it is bulky. Compared to the Spiegen, it's a couple milimeters thicker.This can be a good thing for drop protection, but a couple mm make a huge difference in how big the case feels. It's really noticeable how much the case extends up past the glass.This is one of their selling points as it's supposed to help protect the glass if the iPhone is dropped and lands glass side down on a flat surface.-- Tacky Buttons --The volume buttons on the Speck are tacky, not in a fashion or appearance sense, but in actual feel. The plastic is slightly sticky, and it does not feel good.The Spiegen case buttons are not as soft and are easier to push feeling more like a natural extension of the phone.-- The product branding --One thing about a clear case is that it's meant to disappear to the eye and showcase the beauty of an expensive phone.However, the Speck case has a logo mark and lettering that's a couple inches long right on the back of the case and actually over the Apple logo.That is tacky in the fashion sense of the word.The other element that just doesn't make sense is that the Speck website address is imprinted under the volume buttons and it's backwards.Yep. You need a mirror to read it. It's also tacky again as it's right on the volume buttons. We don't really need to see the huge Speck logo, and the Speck website to know that this is a Speck case.-- Overall Case Feel --The back of the case is a hard plastic which makes it slippery. It can slip in and out of pockets okay, but it can also slip in cars and on dashes.The Spiegen case I have has just a tiny amount of grip to it making it not slide as easy.-- Military Grade --I didn't know that there were military standards for drop a phone. I'd like to see more about those claims since the case marketing material really pushes it.-- Who is this case for? ---If you consistently drop your phone, you may want to look at this case. If you just want some good protection, the Spiegen is the winner at half the price, and no, I don't work for Spiegen, I've just found theirs is a better case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTP4YQ95IR3X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EUR0BI#wasThisHelpful","RTP4YQ95IR3X5","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've used other body measurement scales, and we like this iHealth, but results may vary...literally.The body fat percentage shows about 5% higher than another scale we tested. Which one is right?The one that give the lower reading of course!Seriously though, the scale gave a higher percentage, and that may be more accurate, but the scale isn't consistent. The body fat percentage can vary 2% or more from day to day, and it varies throughout the day. From our other scales we've tried, it's clear that different times of day can produce different results based on the amount of water you've drunk, etc. However our other scale varies only about 1% and is much more consistent reading to reading.Even testing against another iHealth scale (different version), the iHealth is different by a pound than it's own sister scale (or brother scale, you choose).The thing that saves it is the Wifi connection. You con't have to have your phone on or paired to the scale. Just stand on it, and the results are uploaded to the iHealth website, and then back to your phone through the app.However, it's really annoying to have to download an app, and it makes you create an account where you have to give up birthdate information, especially with this app/website that tracks your weight, body fat %, lean muscle mass, bone weight, BMI, and body water %.iHealth hasn't done the best job with it's apps. It's current incarnation is a lot better than the past, but for some reason instead of updating their app, they created a version 2.0 that we had to download, then they had a popup saying not to use that app, but to go back to the main app which had then been updated.Doesn't instill the best of confidence for a company that is storing your personal health information on their servers.It would be nice to know how well the company is protecting our data (encryption of this data is a must).Anyway, I give it 4 stars (borderline 3.5) because of once it's all set up and working, it works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152RVLRDVM6UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2N86JI#wasThisHelpful","R152RVLRDVM6UU","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm moderately familiar with the research on Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and MSM.We've had one doctor recommend all three of these as supplements, so were were excited to try this.It may be benefiting, it really may, but I don't feel any improvement, and to earn a good rating, I should feel something.Of course, after taking it for some time, I looked at the directions and it states to take two, and I've only been taking one. Shame on me, I'm going to go for two and see how things go.These are rather large capsules, and when you take a number of supplements, it can get overwhelming, so I try not to overdo it.So, the jury is still out, and I'll continue to try it, perhaps with time and adding one more, things will get better.The thing is that they say Guaranteed in their product title (as of this writing).

"Not being a huge watch connoisseur, it took some time to actually figure out how to actually get the thing on.1. The metal extender (fold-over clasp)The watch has a stainless steel extender that connects the two portions of the leather band. This feature allows the the metal clasp holding the pin through the pinhole on the leather strap to always stay in place.It makes for an easier mechanism for removing the watch from your wrist (with practice).TIP: You've really got to pull hard to get the fold-over clasp open. Once you've secured the pin clasp over the leather strap, you can just pull the two straps near where they come together and the fold-over clasp will open.2. The pin clasp (bracket with the pin to secure the band).We really tried to push the leather band through the pin clasp, but the band was way too thick (and so were we).The clasp with the pin also hinges. You'll see ""axle"" for the hinge on both sides of the clasp. Pull the clasp open, and you'll then be able to slide it over the leather and secure the pin through the adjustment hole on the leather strap that meets your comfort level.Once that is secured, you can use the fold over clasp to remove or secure the watch--just make sure that the leather strap is taken out of both of the leather holding loops.Overall, great watch. The watch casing is a little large, but it is still beautiful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5O7A3RF6P4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ULAH2E#wasThisHelpful","R1D5O7A3RF6P4Q","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one powerful hair dryer. The force of the air surprised us. The old hair dryer we had was also a Conair.There are a couple of quirks though.1. It's a bit heavier.  Not a big deal, but if you're older or have shoulder/hand/wrist issues, this Conair is weightier and could affect that.2. Control sliders too close  The sliders for the controls are right next to each other. You have a left side and a right side, and it's easy to get mixed up which controls which when you're not looking at them.

"This is the second Norelco I've used, and boy have they come a long way.The shaver is whisper quiet compared to other shavers I've used, and the trimming action is fantastic leaving a much smoother shave than my previous electric shaver.The pivoting head really helps to shave around neck and under the jaw.Plus, the design is sleek and it has a great feel.But...The bulky docking station was a big red flag when I pulled it out of the box. I couldn't believe how huge the thing was.I placed the shaver in the dock and thought when it's time to clean, how is the connector head going to fit over the charging end of the shaver. I did an initial test, and it didn't fit.Great.When it was time to clean, I plugged in the docking base, and tried to get the docks connector to fit over the shavers, and it just wouldn't (and yes, the shaver was pointing the right way).You've got the blades positioned down inside the dock and don't want to hurt them, but I put way too much pressure than should be necessary to get the dock connector over the shaver.The cleaning cycle started, and a minute or so into it, the dock's connector popped up. The manual said that the shaver would charge during the cleaning, so that didn't seem normal.Overall, the shaver is great. The cleaning station is so big and bulky, and are the chemicals cleaning it really better than just a rinse under the sink after each use? Seems like a big waste and waste of space on the counter.I do like that the shaver comes with a traveling case, but my old norelco had a protective cap for the blades, seems like an oversight to miss that in this model.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZQPYO4SL0XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","R2MZQPYO4SL0XG","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our second Fluxx game. Our first was aimed more at kids, and the rules reflected that.We thought the Batman Fluxx would be the same, but we found the game a little harder than the children's Fluxx although both are based on cartoons.It took us a while to get used to some of the new rules, and the powers the Creepers had, and then it became more fun.We did run into a rule that just simply didn't make sense of it's implications. It just wasn't clear how it could be applied, and it was really frustrating. We all had different opinions on what it meant. I think if they had run the game by a few more people that error could have been caught, and it could have been worded clearly.All in all, it's a fun game. The Batman theme is fun. It's fun to have the creepers be the villains from the show, and their cards and the rules really give the villains some power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32WHOUOJ7UJF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111E4EAA#wasThisHelpful","R32WHOUOJ7UJF5","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The game had a lot of potential, and there are certainly enough kids interested in frozen to make this game a success, and that's the problem, it's just not that great of a game.Yes, the game is supposed to teach 4-7 year olds,  but to make it a great game, it should appeal to older kids as well.Overall, the game is simplistic, it's just not a lot of fun.This is comparing it to other LeapTV games that we've tried that are fun, that are much more engaging. That's why this one was kind of a let down.Sure the kids played it, but they didn't enjoy it as much as the other games out there that are more challenging and educational.Specifics:Let's get into some of the specifics.The game is made up of mini-games that the kids can select and then play. The games are prefaced by Elsa and Anna talking to each other (this gets repetitive real quick).The ice skating number game has you select the that 5 or 6 numbers should go: 101, 102, etc., the Elsa skates the path. Sorry, but it's embarrassing how dull that game was, and having 101, 102, etc be the numbers for a 4-year-old is not engaging, and it certainly isn't engaging for the older kids.The addition games. The older kids wanted some multiplication, they got bored with the simple addition, but the point is that the game wasn't fun. It's just an equation asking for the answer. Also, on one screen the equation was backwards it had: ? = 3 + 2 rather than 3 + 2 = ?The point being they could have made the math portions fun, it just feels like they took some basic math games and put a Frozen spin on it, when they could have been more creative, and more engaging in the math games.Not sure if it's the game or the LeapTV, but the first time we put in the game, the sound wouldn't work.The graphics were a bit of a disappointment too. The slide game with Olaf was a bit jittery and the game play was way to slow. They should have sped it up a bit, again to make it more fun.No, the kids didn't hate or dislike the game, but as a parent, it's a big disappointment and a big waste of potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSDT2RP7OZ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1PPGM#wasThisHelpful","R3KSDT2RP7OZ0F","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's the right blend of toughness and style.The waste can be adjusted by an elastic sewn into the waste and can be tightened at the end by buttons on either side of the waste (interior side).The cargo pockets are velcro and one of the cargo pockets has a dark brown square patch with the Wrangler logo.

"The game has a lot of rules that make startup a bit of a chore.Once you get familiar, the game goes quick, but becomes a little monotonous. It's not as fun as Ticket to Ride. We thought it might be kind of similar to 7 Wonders, but it's not at all.The game play is pretty simple once you get going, play a card, pick a new card.It would be more fun if the lost cities were named in the game, but we didn't find that anywhere. There's not much reason to the researcher vs the adventurer other than the researcher gives double the points.Seems like the game had a lot of potential, but ended up being fairly simple. Not much strategy, and a little bit of luck.However, I give it four stars because the kids liked playing it.

"Ramone's Body Paint shop is a good addition to the Cars playset.You can connect it with the other Cars playsets, but I'd be careful about using the water in it anywhere you're concerned about spills.Ramone's was not as easy to put together as the other sets we've tried. Some of the instructions are confusing. Just make sure when applying the hanging hood stickers that the pieces are right side up. It's hard to tell from the instructions. We also left out a piece after having already placed the roof on which was frustrating to get apart and fix.In terms of play, we had trouble getting the car to change. The water in the open container needs to be warm.We got gold water from the tap, and after that didn't work, from the fridge for the sprayer, but that didn't work either.You need to have ice in the water source. So finally getting the ice water, we tried it, and the color of the car is pretty amazing. It comes out bright red. I thought it'd be a little bit of a change, but it's pretty amazing.If you hold the car, it will start to turn yellow again where your fingers touch it. The warmth from your hand will change where you hold to yellow again, but then it fades back to red when you release it.You can dry the car, and it will stay red for about 5 minutes and slowly return to yellow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TS1TN4TTGTCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TFYK#wasThisHelpful","R1TS1TN4TTGTCZ","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used phones by BLU before, and this is by far the most elegant of their phones. The feel of the phone easily rivals anything that Samsung has put out there (although the power and volume placements should be positioned higher).The display is high-res, and the software responsive.However, that's where we get to the quirks. They really need more testing, it feels like the software is still in beta.Here are the examples:1. Encryption doesn't workI've tried using the encrypt function multiple times (yes, it's plugged in), and the popup window says it may take about an hour.When I've done this on other Android phones (Other BLU phones even), a notification appears showing the progress of the encryption.Here, it just does nothing. After waiting an hour or so, the ""encrypt phone"" button is still an option, and it just lets you press it again, but doesn't seem to do anything.2. App icons there, but not installed?This was really weird. After setting up the phone and tying a Google account to it, I tried launching a few of the apps. The icons are there, but the phone said the app wasn't installed. This happened with multiple apps.Really strange. Google play also didn't display any of the apps as being installed. After a short while, the Google play store said I needed to try again to log in. Pressing the retry button did nothing, and not other screen in the Google Play store would work.After restarting the phone, Google Play worked again, and apps finally started to appear as being installed. A glitch, yes, but it doesn't instill much confidence especially with a device that can store personal information.3. ""I've Known""This one was funny. One of the confirmation windows appeared when either installing an app or changing a setting and instead of the button stating ""I understand"" or ""Okay"", the button text read: ""I've Known""So those are some of the quirks, but what keeps it four stars are what it has going for it:1. PriceThe phone is a great deal.2. BatteryThe phone does have good battery life. Although, the reading in the battery stats will often seem out of whack.After a full charge the battery estimator said it only had 8 days left, but a while later, and another full charge, it said it had 30 days.The battery has performed well, and of course, brightness settings, usages, and apps will greatly affect your mileage here.3. Dual Sim cardCould be handy for international travelers with two sim cards.4. The designThe phone feels like a real phone compared to the other two BLU phones we've tried (one a phablet, and not very good, and one a regular phone but with a plastic backing), this phone feels great.5. AccessoriesThe phone comes with a silicone case and a screen protector.I'm not a fan of the screen protectors. I have noticed that the display glass seems to get dirtier easier than an iPhone. Not sure how that works, but I find specks stuck to the glass when I haven't seen that on an iPhone.Overall, it's a pretty good phone if you can get past the quirks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEO9JHW6R27M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129TQLPW#wasThisHelpful","RWEO9JHW6R27M","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adventure Time Fluxx is a pretty good game that takes a little getting used to.This was our first ever Fluxx type game, so we weren't quite sure what to expect but were excited to try something new.The idea centers around that the rules can change as the game progresses.What that means is that instead of drawing one card at the beginning of each turn, a new rule card played could change that to drawing two or three. Likewise, a new rule card may mandate that players play all the cards in their hand each turn.Many more rule cards can change the play of the game.Goal cards determine the requirements for winning the game. So not only the rules can change, but the way a player can win the game.The game is fun, and our family enjoyed playing it. It took a little bit to get used to, and they weren't that much into the Adventure Time theme for the game, but ti was still fun.The description said that basic math is involved, but don't expect this to be a math-based game or instructional game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UK2K2DKBBHE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCTMC7E#wasThisHelpful","R2UK2K2DKBBHE2","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These post cards are pretty good, but there are few things to watch out for.1. The Print qualityThis isn't so much a problem with the paper, but with the printer/paper combo. If your printer doesn't print graphics well (horizontal lines appearing in solid color blocks), your post cards won't look as professional.Print a test card on some regular paper, or a test graphic before buying these, and you can see if your printer can print to the quality you'd like. Some printers also let you choose the quality (some like to save ink), so there may be a setting to put it on high quality to get a better image.2. The cards say feed one at a time (no mass printing)The cards say to feed one at a time. You'll probably be able to get away with putting them in the tray a few at a time depending on your printer.If you're printer bends the paper too much, you may need to use the front feeder area (on our printer it's one at a time), and this produces less bend.3. Perforated edgesThe cards have perforated edges, but instead of having just one edge all the way around, the bottom and top are perforated twice for some reason.4.

"I was very excited to get the smart plug. We'd tried a few wemo products and found them to be difficult to use, bulky and just plain not fun.The iHome smart plug is sleek, small (ish), and held lots of promise.Unfortunately, it's got some issues.First, the positives:1. Sleek design2. Covers only one plug (other devices are so bulky, the cover both plugs on an outlet)3. Sleek design (worth two points)4. Ability to use Siri to control the outletThe problems however are disappointing.First, you have to turn on Keychain (iOS). Maybe that's a HomeKit thing, but keychain had to be turned on, and even after turning on Keychain and checking the privacy settings, the app kept asking to ""Continue"" with the notice that Keychain had to be turned on and the privacy settings set.Another downside is that although the app shows ""Usage"" (when the devices have been turned on or off), that's it. It would be great to have the option to know how much power is being consumed. Other competing devices offer this feature.The app requires you to create an iHome account which I wish wasn't necessary, just one more step to getting started.There are no instructions that come with the device other than a quick start guide. It would be better if there were some instructions describing what rules are (maybe they should be called schedules).Siri can recognize commands and turn off the outlet, but there isn't a user guide that says what sort of things you can say.You can turn off an outlet or if you have it as part of a ""room"" in the app, you can turn off the smart outlets in the room.However, if you picked a name for the outlet that Siri has a hard time understanding, then you'll find yourself repeating the command. If you go to change the name of the device, you may get error after error like I did which was frustrating.By far the best feature is the ability to use Siri to turn off the outlet. Just make sure to pick a name for it that's easy for Siri to pick up exactly.Hopefully, in future versions of the app, these bugs will be cleared up. It works reliably with voice command, so if you can get past the other bugs, and are patient, it could work for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOSWN265ZOKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ACFEI0#wasThisHelpful","R3QOSWN265ZOKE","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Blackout is an interesting read. What would happen if teens were infected by a virus that gave them powers. (Minor spoilers ahead) The wrinkle is that there are teens who have been trained as terrorists and using their power to wreck havoc.The book keeps you reading, and the chapters are short which helps with the pacing.I did have trouble with the believability of the military personnel. Some of the dialog they were given just didn't seem real. It also stretched believability that teens, all teens, would be rounded up to testing facilities hundreds of miles from their homes without a major fuss from the populous. It was a convenient way to get the characters together, but I had a tough time swallowing it.The other challenge to believability was how the roundup was handled by the military and how the teens were treated.The powers that the kids had were interesting.

The click action is solid, and it twists to have a flatter form factor for traveling, and the construction feels solid, but when it's something that you'll use everyday and doesn't feel good on your palm and wrist, then that's a problem.Perhaps if you have larger hands, it would work better for you.The other drawback is that the scroll bar is inconsistent.

"This is a great necklace, and the pendant is heavier than I expected. It's quite thick and not reversible.The square cut diamonds in the bottom right and top left are interesting. The square cuts don't have the silver division between the diamonds (Pave Setting), and so the beauty of those diamonds meshes together and isn't as defined as the round-cut.Still, it's a very beautiful pendant and necklace.

"These headphones looked so strange, they had to be good right?Why go to the trouble of such a different design to have the quality not measure up?Well, that's what's happened with this headphones.The standard headphones that come with the iPhone provide 3x's better base, fit better, and don't look so goofy.The headphones come with different sizes for the plug cover, but even on the smallest size, the bulk of the headphone weighs it down making it fall out easily.The treble sounds somewhat tinny, and the base is almost nonexistent compared to the iPhone headphones.The name indicates that these are about ""clarity."" And yes, things are clear, but it's not ""better sound."" Better sound means better across the entire range.So, if you're looking to listen to music, these aren't the best choice.The cables are flat and a little unwieldy.It's also difficult to tell which is the right vs left ear bud.I really thought these would be fantastic because of the design supposedly making the sound better, but alas they come up lacking in many regards.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11OAQZ6V0WK46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSM8NIS#wasThisHelpful","R11OAQZ6V0WK46","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first Shannara book. It seems like somewhere I read that you didn't have to read the other books to read this one.Well...the first chapter proved that wrong. There was quite a bit going on that seemed to have greater meaning if you had read the previous books.The first chapter also seemed slow to me, but then things picked up when we get to Reyn. I found Reyn's storyline to be the most interesting.There is quite a bit of point of view changes in the story and even many in different chapters, sometimes that made it hard to keep track who's POV we're in and ended up being a little jarring.The book kept me reading to the end, and was interesting, but I probably would have gotten much more out of it had I started with earlier Shannara novels.So if this is your first go at the Shannara books, give a thought to starting at the beginning of the series.

"A hula hoop that can count? Now that's a good idea.Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well. In fact, we had a lot of trouble with it.The hoop has to be assembled, and when assembled, the hoop isn't firm. You can feel the bend in the joints. A real hoop is much easier to hula.It might be worth it if the counter works, but it's not accurate at all. It over counts, then under counts. It has a little button that hits against you when the hoop cycles and it changes the counter (which is a simple analog counter).The counter mechanism is huge and adds quit a bit of weight to the hoop. Each member in our family that tried it commented on how it didn't count right. Also the heavy counter hurts if it hits you on the ankle or foot when the hoop falls.If you want to count hoops, get a regular hoop and count in your head.

"Good to know that they still make VGA cables. This cable feels high quality and has gold plated connectors. The cable is sturdy, but still bendable. The only thing about it that may make it hard to use for some connection needs is that that the connector heads are quite large. The actual VGA connector is standard sized, but the housing around it for gripping seems twice as long as a run-of-the-mill VGA cable. Some monitors have a tight space for the VGA cable head as it is, so that's the only downside as it could be difficult to use in those situations. The monitor we have is like that, but the cable still fits in the space, just not as easily as the shorter head cables.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J69S3T5FGCIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PML35RC#wasThisHelpful","R3J69S3T5FGCIY","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This booster is big, a lot bigger than the previous Graco booster we were using.The problem with the Graco is that it didn't offer much back support. It looked like our child was sitting straight up against a wall. Not comfortable at all.This booster seems much more comfortable for our child. He likes it, and it offers a better sitting position.The head guards/rests on this are huge but offer better support for napping. The head rest extends vertically to an almost ridiculous amount. If your child is close to NBA height, the booster will extend to meet his/her height. It's crazy.The sides (wing tips) expand out as well. This is a little more confusing. If a child has extremely broad shoulders, then you might want to expand the wing tips, but it seems like if that's necessary (or to fully raise the head rest), a child would be big enough to not need the backing of the booster.The backing can be removed and the base used only.The one confusing thing was finding the seatbelt guide. It's hidden on the headrest and obscured by the wing tips.Great booster.

"The premise of the game is fun, helping to make guests (various people on the guest cards) happy by serving them desserts that they like.At first, I was skeptical, I thought it would be hokey, but it wasn't.We played with the max number of people, and each thought it was a fun game (for adults and kids). The fun thing is that the game is about helping the guests get what they want instead of a game where you get only what you want. It's a fun spin and a good undertone to the game, but again, it's not all kittens and rainbows, you're definitely motivated to win, it's just that win comes by helping people. Fun idea.The game isn't overly complicated. The one thing is that playing with 5 people, we ran out of new guests before the game was up. There were still some in the to-be-served area. It might have been possible for the cards to be all used up without a winner, although the chances would be slim at that, it seemed like a possibility.I do like that there is an advanced way to play the game to keep it interested.All in all, fun game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USBB8FH53O2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U05Y830#wasThisHelpful","R2USBB8FH53O2C","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pendant is a silver heart with a smaller heart (the one with the decoration) inside.The inner heart rotates and the opposite side has the word ""MOM"" inscribed in a non cursive script (looks like the Arial font, plain, just like: MOM). As of this review only one picture is listed for the item. Hopefully, they'll post another so you can see the reverse side of the inner pendant.For an idea for the size:The pendant looks great with a great luster to it. The heart itself is about .75 inches tall and about an inch if you add the clasp at the top.This would make a great gift from a child to his or her mom.It comes in a nice pull-away top box. The only issue was that after opening the box, we discovered the necklace and pendant bunched up at the bottom of the box. There's the inner display holder, but they should do a better job at getting the pendant to display correctly after it's been tossed about in the shipping process. Presentation can be everything with jewelry, so make sure to open before gifting it and making the pendant presentable in it's box. I've seen other boxes that do a much better job at keeping the necklace and pendant in place.

"There's some things to love about this camera pack, and there's a number of things that are in a word: goofy.I'm rounding a 3.5 star review up to 4. If you're wondering between this and a GoPro, there are a few things to consider as well.----------- Form Factor -------------The Sony looks like a miniature video camera device compared to the GoPro which looks like a little cube.The problem is that the cube approach is so much more practical for an outdoor adventure camera.  -- Head Mounting --A GoPro can be mounted with straps to your head. Yes, it looks goofy, but it works. The Sony however has to be strapped ***to the side of your head.***I'm not sure they thought this through. The lens can achieve 170 degree viewing. You're getting the side of your head in the picture, and the head strap is extremely uncomfortable, not to mention the camera feels like it's going to flop off the side of your head.Where can the head mount work? If it's attached to a helmet, you avoid the uncomfortable feel of the head band. -- Hand Held --Because the design is long, it offers a good area for you to grip when hand holding, however, it's harder to keep level than a cube design (GoPro). Just imagine holding your phone like you normally would for a video, the rectangular shape make it easy to line up almost subconsciously to produce a level video. The way you hold it with your palm facing away from you also helps.Now imagine turning your phone so the longest edge points away from you. All of a sudden, it's much harder to keep it level. You're wrist also feels much more unnatural.That's what it's like holding this camera because of the long form factor, it's harder to keep the video level and it doesn't feel good on the wrist compared with a handheld filming from a phone or a GoPro. -- Mounted --The above problem goes away if you purchase the separate video pole/mount, but there's a little issue with the mount built into the camera. It's not the standard size tripod/camera mount. It's smaller. You have to use an adapter (included) to mount on a standard sized mount. This is definitely one of those goofy things that should have been fixed. The waterproof case (included) does have the larger mount size. Why not just make both the same instead of requiring a goofy (there it is again) adapter? -- Buttons and Access --The form factor makes the hdmi and usb ports accessible on the bottom of the device, they're really hard to get open if you've just cut your fingernails. Just FYI.It comes with the mini/micro USB cable, but it would have been more handy to have it come with the mini HDMI cord as those aren't as common to have around.The micro SD card is accessed through the back, and it's not clear which way the micro SD card should enter. I have a hard time remembering.----------- Accessories ------------- The Water Proof Case --The included Water Proof case is great. Except around the controls, there's lots of nooks that take a long time to dry out. Even after a day of drying out, we're still getting water drops out of the nooks.The side buttons on the case are not easy to press. They should have been made bigger.The case lets through audio okay. It's a little muffled, but audio in underwater recording we did came out very well, and the sound is dampened a bit when recording out of the water with the case on. -- Live View Wrist Band --Wow. Get ready to strap a TV to your wrist. This think is bulky.You can use the app on your phone to achieve pretty much the same thing, and we've used that much more than the live view wrist band.If this were sleek, it would make the whole package worth it, but unfortunately, it's not. It's giant and awkward.-- The clips --The clips are difficult to work. Because of the form factor, you have to use these funny clips to side mount the camera. It's a ton of extra bulk that could have been fixed if the camera were just a cube, and you could front mount it easier.----------- Software -----------They really needed to work on the menus for this puppy. Just figuring out how to turn it off was a problem the first time we used it. It's not intuitive, and that counts for a lot. The options between the video types and slow motion are also not very clear.Along with the software is the app that you can download. The app worked fine, and you can transfer videos straight to your phone. That's really handy and big plus. The app still has some quirks, but it's better than the wrist viewer.-------So far, things aren't looking so good for the Sony. Its shape is not a good choice. GoPro wins there. The case, clips, and that bulky wrist weight, leave much to be desired.So why 4 stars????----------- The Quality of the Video -----------This is where the camera shines. Perhaps, let's hope anyway this is the reason, the form factor allowed for better video, a better lens and digital sensor.The 170 wide angle view is fantastic, and the picture is clear, clean, and crisp.I've seen too many low quality GoPro videos (older/less expensive models, the new/higher end ones will rival this for sure). It's nice to seem some high quality video out of this device.If you enable the image stabilization (recommended if you're walking with it without a steady cam), you lose the full 170 degrees as it uses the constricted space for the stabilization. It goes down to 120 degrees. The stabilized video is good. On other cameras with similar stabilization, it comes through a little too obvious and almost like you're walking on a ship that's moving up and down with the waves. The stabilization here feels much more natural.The Slow Motion video is really good as well, however, those menus make it harder than it should be. Note to the programers, do more user testing, and make the menu and terminology clear.So, if you're okay with all the goofy things with this camera and its accessories, you'll enjoy the quality of the finished video. I'd recommend getting the--- Update 6/15/2015  ---One thing that we've noticed that has been a drawback is that when you take pictures after getting the camera wet, there can be a water drop on the bulbous lens. The drop distorts the picture.It's unfortunate. Maybe it's because the lens area of the case is so big that it just offers a larger area for drops to appear.So just be warned that when talking pictures after the camera has gotten wet to make sure there's not a big drop on the lens.You'd think the drop would go away quick, but it doesn't you need to wipe it off.Sometimes the drops are there after getting it wet, and sometimes they're not, but since you can't review the pictures until you've connected to your computer/phone, or remove viewing device, it really is disappointing to see picture after picture was distorted due to water drops on the case.Because the GoPros generally have a smaller lens bulb area, they may not be as prone to this problem. Something to consider when making your purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371C28QVUPQDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CO9X4#wasThisHelpful","R371C28QVUPQDT","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good Pack N' Play with a few things needing improvements:-- Portability --One of the main selling points of this Pack N' Play is that it is portable. It's made smaller than other playards which makes it easier to haul around. The bag has shoulder straps so you can carry it if you're going to head outside with it.The main pad is well cushioned and feels like it may be made of memory foam or at least a high quality foam.-- The Shade --The portability of the playard will make it more likely that you'll end up taking it with you places because it's easier to carry, so compared to other playards, you may actually use it outside a lot, and thus need to use the shade.We had a few issues with the shade. The snaps on the shade cover are hard to attach. It seems like any snaps that size are always hard. Maybe it's just us, and if they could come off easily, that would be bad, but nevertheless, they're tougher to snap than they should be.The cover is great for creating shade, but it does obstruct your view. The playard is ventilated on the sides, but use common sense if it's in full sun, it's going to get hot in there for your infant so be careful.Also, the way our's came packaged, the shade was formed in a U shape over the Pack N' Play, but the U shape was backwards. It made it seem like it was pre-bent or molded into the U shape, but when we went to assemble, we thought was it made backwards? We just had it bend it the other way and the latches fit like they were supposed to.-- The size --The playard is smaller than your normal sized Pack N' Play, so a standard pad cover isn't going to work very well.The smaller size is a much tighter fit for older toddlers.-- Changing Pad --The changing pad that attaches is a nice addition and very handy.-- The Bassinet --It's easy to zipper-in the bassinet. That's a plus for sure. You use the same pad on the bottom and insert the sides into sleeves hooked on the bassinet. The instructions weren't clear because they show if you see the warning imprint, the bassinet hasn't been set up right.Problem: There are warning signs all over it. If you squint you can see in the instructions which warning sign they're talking about and it's not the warning sign on the sleeves which are not covered up.It was confusing, so just be aware of that.-- Overall ---Overall, a good playard. You'll find it very handy for trips. The lighter weight and shoulder straps make it very handy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E71J91CYHADI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PX8PM8E#wasThisHelpful","R3E71J91CYHADI","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's surprising how will the Powerline 1200 works. There are a few things that could be improved, but setup was fairly easy, and we tested it in a number of locations and setups, and it worked with good speed each time.First thing to remember is that if your internet provider gives you slow speeds, or your main router is slow, this won't make your internet faster. However, there are lots of good reasons to use the powerline1. Avoiding Wifi InterferenceIf your neighbors have all set up wifi, there's the chance they're using the same frequency an channel setup which can interfere with your wifi router's signal. The Powerline can come in really handy in this case as you can connect your device anywhere in your home that has a plug and bypass the wireless interference.2. For better in-network streamingIf you have a media server and want higher speeds than your wifi can deliver, you can connect this to your television for faster streaming from your server. Also if you use NAS or network storage, you can get faster transfer speeds than many wifi routers provide. Again, it all depends on where the bottlenecks in your network are. Having a large distribution pipe on one end won't increase the speed if there's a bottle neck somewhere in the line (slow router, slow hard-drive/sever speeds).3. Extending coverageYes, you can buy wifi extenders for your network, but if you really don't need wifi in a particular area and just need a wired connection, this can work great.Probably many more use cases (presentations where the wifi isn't reliable, etc), but on to how well it actually works.--- Connection ----We tested it in multiple outlets in our home, and the signal was always strong. The connection lit up green each time indicating a good signal, and the speed seemed just as good as the wifi connection when we disabled the one and switched back and forth to see if there was a noticeable difference.--- Surge Protectors ---The documentation says to plug it straight into the wall, but we tested both that way, and having one of them plugged into a surge protector. It took just a little longer it seems like to make the connection in that case, but after that, the connection was fine.--- Setup ----The instructions are pretty simple, but it would be great if there were a different color indicator, or an additional LED to show that the connection is encrypted. At first, we plugged in the devices to the wall (but not the network yet), and pressed the security button, and nothing happened. Was it secure? Who knew?Looking back at the instructions, it says that the power button will blink for a few seconds when establishing the secure connection.We did a reset on both incase we messed something up, plugged in the network cables to both devices and waiting for a link to establish. Once we saw the internet working, then we pressed the security button (tip it says hold for two seconds, that's all it really needs).When trying to do the reset, you really only need to press the reset button for one second. Holding it for longer didn't do the trick. Weird.The power light did start to blink, and then we pressed the security button on the second unit. The link was re-established and we assume it is secure, but it'd be nice to see a ""secure"" indicator or something. Seems like a big oversight given how we would like the assurance of knowing our networks are secure.--- Security ----The documentation merely states that the devices are secure and that they share an encryption key when setting up security. However, it would be nice to know what strength and what type of security. Another oversight for something as important as the security of your home network.*** Update: A Frequently Asked Questions page on the Netgear site states: ""Earlier versions based on HomePlug 1.0 support 56-bit DES encryption. Later versions based on HomePlug AV support 128-bit AES encryption."" Also, the company stated that the signal cannot cross an electrical panel or circuit, so your neighbors may not be able to jump on, but in an apartment if you're on the same circuit, it's possible. ***This is the newer version and should support 128 AES as it uses HomePlug AV.Also, the documentation online states that this can cover an area bout 5,000 square feet. So if you live in an apartment, and a nosy neighbor discovers you're using one of these, they could potentially hop on your network just like having an extra plug into your router sent into their apartment, unless you have the security enabled.--- Overall ----This is a great device. I'm glad they have the security option there, but it would be nice to know more about it, and to see a continuing visual when it is enabled. All someone needs to do is a reset on the devices (which takes one second), then they link back up and you wouldn't be able to tell that the security had just been turned off. Hope they fix that in future versions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKB30A58YH4C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6DBGJM#wasThisHelpful","RKB30A58YH4C2","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our previous wagon was one of the ""red tubs"" big, plastic, and hard to store.The advantage to this wagon is that it folds up more compact than our stroller does!We'll be taking this with us on lots of walks.The ability to fold is its greatest feature, and there are a few other things we like about it and a couple things that could be improved.Pros:1. Ability to foldThis makes it great to store, or fit nicely in a car trunk if your traveling somewhere. It's very easy to fold. Again, compared to our stroller, it's more compact when folded and easier to fold.2. Sturdy CanopyThe canopy supports on our old wagon were plastic, these are metal, and the canopy itself seems thicker and higher quality. The canopy folds up (just like a windshield sun guard for your car).Could use some slight improvements:1. AssemblyThe instructions show that there is a right and left front wheel and that it's important to get them in the right socket, but they are not clearly marked, and then you wonder, wait, my left or the wagon's left. Tip: feel up the black vertical wheel support and you'll be able to feel the L and the R imprinted. They are hard to see, and the instructions refer to them as the right and left of the wagon. It is important to get them on the correct side. You can tell by how the red dot in the center of the wheel lines up with the wagon when the wheels are straight. The instructions do show this, but you have to flip the page.Also, not quite sure why you have to attach the little underside bumper pieces when that could have been done before the wagon was shipped.2. CanopyThe canopy is great, sturdy, and tall, but it snaps onto the support struts, and it's not easy to get the thing to snap on. It shows it's tough and won't come off easily, but it is hard to snap.3. Knee/Foot SpaceThe bottom isn't as deep as the red tub version, so for older kids, it's a tighter squeeze.4. NoiseThe back wheels squeal. It's loud. Nothing that some WD-40 can't fix, but man, what a wail.5. Telescoping handleIt's great that the handle telescopes, but it doesn't feel as sturdy as it should be. Even though tightening at the base, there's still some give in the handle. Wish it were more sturdy.These points aren't major game changers, just things to be aware of.OverallThe best feature of the wagon is the ability to fold and easily be stored or carried. 5 Stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HZ1FSN3Y8WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD3EVDW#wasThisHelpful","R35HZ1FSN3Y8WX","A15CL28ALB7MTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15CL28ALB7MTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is really a good product for younger kids and indoor use. It really is. My only real issue is the quality. Foam kid products just always end up being a bad idea. They tear up so easily. For some reason, the handlebar is constantly being taken off of this and used as a weapon. The unicorn head is foam and is somewhat in the way when jumping. I just wish it were anything but foam. With a toddler in the house, we've already had a few bites taken out of this thing, despite my best efforts to make the kids put it up. It is fun. Hop on in anywhere. It squeaks when you hop. No weight limit. Even the toddler manages to hop a few times.  My kids (2, 4, 5, 7, and 9) all like hopping around on this jumper.

"When you scan these into your iHealth glucometer, it automatically has them expire in 90 days. So, even if you have more test strips, which are not expired in the bottle, because they were opened 90+ days ago, you cannot use them. I am not diabetic and have a glucometer only for occasional use during pregnancy, so it can easily be 90 days since I last checked my blood sugar. And I have to open a brand new bottle for that check. Even though I have plenty of unexpired strips sitting in a bottle that has been opened twice 95 days ago. Very frustrating. There is also no way to override the system and just use it anyway. And if you scan the second bottle and use the first, the 90 day clock starts on the second, even though you didn't even open it. And heaven forbid you scan the wrong bottle. As soon as you scan it, it starts the 90 day clock, even if you didn't open the bottle or scanned the bottle on accident, not knowing the other bottle was the open bottle.

This is the second time I bought the Mrs. Meyers dryer sheets, and honestly, I only bought them the second time because I forgot how much I disliked them the first time.

The actual sheets are like wax paper, which you tear in half. I don't like this at all. Apparently, it is more green.

My only complaint about the stick is that your skin has to be completely dry to get it to rub on. It is so thick that the slightest amount of sweat makes it incredibly difficult to rub on. You have to dry your kid's face completely. I also tried rubbing it on my hands and then rubbing it on the baby's face, and that didn't work out so well, either.

"I have been cloth diapering for about 9 years now (yes, straight), so I have had more than a few cloth diapers come and go around here. This newborn all in one is a really good diaper. The inside is a microfiber fleece. The insert is sewn into the front of the diaper, so it lifts in the wash and dry cycle, making it pretty fast drying for an all in one. You can also add a doubler under the insert, but for a newborn, it really isn't necessary. In snaps down to fit a tiny baby and then you can also use it for a bigger baby. That means the life on these is much longer than the average newborn diaper. My only real complaint, and the reason I'll stick with mostly fitteds and covers, is the lack of leg gussets. Newborn diapers tend to leak with the poopsplosions of those early days, even paper diapers do. So, I do find that my fitteds and covers result in zero diaper emergencies, where these can leak with the really bad poopsplosions.

"My 8 year old daughter love the Nerf Rebelle products. This gun and holsters fits into her collection really well. Ours only came with 4 darts, not 8 as shown. It works by pulling the hammer on the back (which is much easier for smaller hands than the cocking mechanism of other Nerf guns).

"I've been using this seat for my toddler in my Nissan NV. Rear-facing, it is much taller and hits the seat in front of it much more than the Combi seat he was using. He is 21 months old and weighs about 25 lbs, so he fits in this seat rear-facing extremely well. It fits very snug rear facing, which is a plus since I was having issues with our previous seat in this vehicle. The chest clip requires two hands to unclip. The bottom buckle can be buckled one side at a time. (It is not a puzzle clip.) I do wish it had come with strap covers over the shoulder area, but it didn't. The seat belt holders when the seat is not in use are great. They actually work, unlike so many other seats we have tried. Installation in the car was very easy using the LATCH. I also found the way the bottom of the seat was made was good for getting the seat at the proper recline for rear-facing without having to use a towel or pool noodle.Overall, a good seat for the price. Decent rear-facing weight limits. Easy install. Fits well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100ADFX6FY89U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RQTW4#wasThisHelpful","R100ADFX6FY89U","A3FMPT5IH0CJ50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FMPT5IH0CJ50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My seven year old was moderately interested in this story. The story moves and has pictures for young readers. (My son is in second grade.) He seemed to loose interest a few chapters in and had to be encouraged to keep going. Once he got to the end, he said he really liked it, but I did have to prod him a bit to get him there. The story is high action and adventure where the main character, a boy named Max, finds himself in the middle of a war between bugs and lizards.

It is small enough to carry around in her bag, but big enough that she feels like she has plenty of cards. And she still has room for some more cards.

"**Changing my review from 5 to 2 stars after several months of us. Original Review below the updated review.**So, after several months with this glucometer, that I only use occasionally during pregnancy as I do not have a medical condition requiring daily us, I'm unhappy with this. First, I got rid of my iPhone. I didn't even think about the glucometer when I did it. It only occurred to me when I needed the glucometer and got it out, only to realize I couldn't use it. So, I waited for my husband to get home and borrowed his iPhone.Then I go to use my glucose strips and the bottle I had opened wouldn't work. Though they were unexpired, the machine automatically expires them 90 days after they were opened. So I have to scan and open a brand new bottle, as there was no way to override the smart glucometer who just knew my strips had been opened too long. Super annoying. I really wish they'd package the strips individually or in smaller groups so people like me don't waste 20 strips.**Original Review**This glucometer system was easy to use and stores results in an easy to access way. Using your iPhone has its advantages, mainly the storage of results and notes and such. It also comes with disadvantages, it takes a little longer to set up, won't work without your iPhone, and takes a little longer to do.The system comes with lancets, the reader that goes in your headphone port, 4 covers for the reader (which seems like overkill, but I guess they wanted you to have color options- blue, pink, orange, white), a carrying case, batteries (one extra), and plastic bags to cover your phone while you use the device. It does not come with the testing strips. Not a single one. You have to buy those separately. They are cheaper than your average box of strips, though.Prior to use, you'll have to install the battery (which actually proved difficult for me). Download and set up the app on your phone. Set up your lancet. And scan your bottle of testing strips (that ARE NOT INCLUDED). Once you do all of that, which takes about 15 minutes including the time I spent fighting the button battery, you'll be ready to test.Results appear quickly (about 10-15 seconds), they are large and have a color gauge to tell you if it is ""good"" or ""bad"". It marks the date and time automatically and allows you to select details (before eating, after eating, etc.) and has a place to put notes. Results can then be pulled up as needed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OV54P16PFKJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4T3CRM#wasThisHelpful","R3OV54P16PFKJY","A3FMPT5IH0CJ50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FMPT5IH0CJ50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had heard a lot of good things about the SodaStream, so I decided it was time to get one. This kit came with the soda stream, a tiny CO2 cartridge, and a sample of soda syrups. I was pretty irritated that half the syrups were diet. We don't use artificial sweeteners, so these were a complete waste to us. However, the Soda Stream itself is great. Easy to use. It also came with a rebate of some sort for upgrading the tiny CO2 canister once empty for a full size canister.Since we purchased the SodaStream and several of the SodaStream syrups, we have come to realize that we don't like their syrups. Even their regular sodas contain sucralose. The taste has just been off because of that, even for things like Root Beer and Cream Soda. Instead, we decided to use Monin soda syrups instead. Essentially, you could use anything with the Soda Stream, not just the SodaStream labeled syrups. (We've done essential oil infused fizzy water, as well.)

The box had to be taped back together the first day after my 5 year old stepped on it.It is a cute toy, I would just like to see the pieces slightly larger and the box more durable, since it is a part of the set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6HZVYL8673G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JWWTEM#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6HZVYL8673G","A3FMPT5IH0CJ50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FMPT5IH0CJ50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The range of motion on this microphone kit is really impressive. There are 3 different joints: two in the arm and one near the microphone itself. Combined, this makes the whole thing very flexible and even the pop filter has a flexible goose neck that you can twist and turn with ease. The base uses a clamp to grip onto any surface. I currently have it clamped onto my bookshelf, but make sure that you tighten it couple times a month to be safe.There was actually no instructions that came with kit because everything was so simple. There are no tools required and all you have to do is look at a photo to know which part goes where. Everything looks high quality and very professional, which is why I like it so much. I personally think the kit itself without the microphone is worth the 31 dollars.After testing the microphone out for 2 hours, I find that this microphone has a tough time picking up sound unless you're 3-5 inches away from it. I wanted to use this microphone as a nice to way to look professional when I'm streaming games or even talk to my friend, but if you have to put the microphone that close to your face, then it's going to hindrance. After moving the microphone around and trying all different directions, I found a sweet spot for me. This is something you're going to need to experiment with and I think if you're in the market for a good microphone kit, then this will definitely do the job.*I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8ZQHF6ISLQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016KAU0E4#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8ZQHF6ISLQY","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a perfectly fine backpack to use as a laptop or school backpack. It looks very straight forward and won't turn any eyes, which I like. I steer away from backpacks that usually look too extravagant for me. I really like the foam padding on the back, it's actually really thick and soft. This backpack does make a decent amount of noise when you walk around because of all the zippers that' are on it.The reason for all the zippers is because of pouches in this backpack. The amount of storage and pouches in this backpack is insane. It's like the nesting dolls of backpacks. Each pouch has their own pouches within.

"If there is one thing that I have to commend Dice on, it would be re-creating the authenticity of Star Wars. The Star Wars theme was captured beautifully. Music, sound effects, and visual effects combine so well to give you that immersive feeling in this game. Even if you have an underlying hate of the game for whatever reason, one thing you cannot deny is how beautiful the game looks and sounds.I wish the same thing could be said for the actual gameplay. Moments where you’re running alongside your teammates, with lasers flying past your face and explosions going on all around you are extremely exciting. However, with that said, the gameplay still feels very awkward. Vehicle camera angles could be better and the controls are frustrating to handle. This really surprised me because Dice is the master of vehicles. The first few hours of game play were extremely fun, but sooner or later, it'll dull on you. The fact that you can play key characters in this game like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker was really fun. Not only because you're playing these iconic characters, but because they're moves feel so cool and you can turn the game around if you play them correctly.The map design on Walker Assault modes are terrible, with the rebel side having the largest disadvantage because of their horrible spawn points. For horde mode, the AI felt like actual Storm troopers in the movie. By that, I mean they miss every single shot and sometimes run around aimlessly. In the end, it’s still a fun game mode for you to play with your friend in co-op. This game is definitely curated towards the casual player. There just aren’t enough diverse weapons, skills, or customization that would really improve your gameplay. This game was definitely catered towards casual Star Wars fans who wanted to enjoy a Star Wars game.Overall, the game isn’t perfect, and I don’t expect it to be for a very long time.

There is a version of this with a longer cable, so you sure to buy one instead if you need one.

"If you're someone who owns a lot of keys, then you might want to consider this key holder. I tested it out and it was able to hold 4 keys on each side without any problem. It doesn't really hold the keys in place, they will most likely move out of place in your pocket as you move around. It also comes with a few extra parts that I've provided in the photos. This is a great product, but only for someone who has a lot of keys. It holds on to keys well enough that you'll never hear any jingling in your pockets when you walk around.

"The thing that surprised me the most is the audio quality on this headset. I own a Gamescom 780, as well as a Sennheiser 598 and the audio is on this headset is comparable to those. I'm loving the bass on this headset, it was definitely not something I was expecting. You can actually feel the bass because of the vibration from the headset itself and it'll definitely improve your gaming experience. The blue LED lights on either side of the headphones are extremely bright. The options to turn off the bass, lights, and volume are all located on the left side of the vehicle.The cord itself is coiled and covered in a rubber sleeve for protection. I would've liked it better without the rubber sleeve because it makes the product feel cheap, but the extra protection is definitely nice. The top of the headset reminds of a Siberia V2. The top of the headset can extend to fit the shape of your head. Unlike most headsets that wrap around your head, it feels like this headset is pulling on the top of your head because of its band.Since this is a open-ear headphone, do note that you will pick up outside noise. For example, I am able to hear the fan from my computer when I use this headset. The upside is that with open-ear headsets, the sound stage is amazing. Surround sound is more immersive and you will easily be able to tell which direction enemy footsteps are coming from. The leather padding on the ears and underside of the headband feels extremely soft and smooth. Definitely a high quality padding that will make sure your ears stay comfortable throughout playing.As for the microphone, I can't honestly attest to it because I haven't been able to test it yet. Next time I play some games with my friends, I'll make sure you let you know how it sounds.★I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KG4NBMTB9O87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R2KG4NBMTB9O87","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a great device to charge all of your devices at once. You might wonder what makes this device better than just a regular computer USB or a wall charger. Well, I have to say that it's definitely the charging speed and the ability to charge multiple devices at once. I really do notice a significant increase in the speed in which my iPhone, tablet, and Bluetooth headphones charge. I just plug this charger near my living room and my whole family uses it. There are times when all 5 USB ports would be filled at the same time and it would maintain the same charging speed. My phone used to take over 4 hours of charging in order to get a full charge, but this charger cut that time by an hour and a half.

"Out of all the products I've reviewed, this keyboard is among one of my favorites. The keyboard itself is just so well designed and functions so well. Starting with the red buttons on the top, it has shortcuts to open up your Outlook, internet browser, and control your volume, which I think was great because I use them so much. The keyboard doesn't have any mechanical switches, but it still sounds really nice. As someone who can type 132 wpm, switching to this keyboard from my Razer Blackwidow didn't feel awkward at all. I was still able to type comfortably and clock 123 wpm on Typeracer on my first try.Something else that impressed me is the backlight on this keyboard.

"This tablet won't match any of the standards Apple or Android tablets, but it's more than good enough to get by. Just keep in mind that you get what you paid for.The touchscreen on this monitor is actually very good. It's responsive and has certain multi-touch functionalities. The resolution itself feels lacking in many aspects: You have to tilt the screen at a certain angle in order to see it clearly. Otherwise, it will have this weird gray tint to it. in other words, it has bad viewing angles.The speakers are located on the back of the tablet and it's actually not that bad. The volume is high enough that you'll be able to hear it easily whether you hold it in your hand or lay it on a surface. App functionality is perfectly fine on this tablet. You can easily browse through apps like Facebook or even play games like Candy Crush without a glitch. Something I really like about this tablet is the screen protector that it comes with. It is already pre-installed on the tablet itself and saves you the trouble of buying one and putting one on yourself.The camera isn't great on this tablet. It's only a 2.0 MP camera that can't take photos of anything that is moving or else it comes out incredibly blurry. The coloring on the photos itself is pretty bad as well. Mostly black, white, and gray so it's very hard to get detailed photos. The battery life is surprisingly good; I fully charged this device and left it on standby overnight and it was at 75% the next day. It will definitely offer you a solid 3-5 hours of use, depending on what you're doing.In conclusion, this is a great tablet for the casual users. I see people using this tablet for reading Kindle books, watching YouTube videos, playing apps or going on Facebook.

"This router is a pretty big step up from what I was previously using, which was the basic Verizon Fios router. I've been using this router for a while now and I think I finally have a good opinion of it.The router itself has a very old fashion look to it that I really like. It can be mounted using the brackets given to you or set on a flat surface. For the most part, this is a really good router for a casual user. What I mean by that is if you're someone who would heavily test the settings in the UI or set VPNs and Qos options, then this not going to be a good experience for you because of the glitches you might encounter. On the other hand, for people like me, this is a great router to use. My signal strength as well as connection has vastly improved over my previous model. There are times at night where my old Verizon router would drop connection and reset itself because there were too many devices for it to handle. This router has remained steady and call me crazy, but I definitely noticed a greater range of Wifi and speed increase.First thing I noticed when I tried to install this router is that it doesn't have a Coax Cable adapter--it has been extremely difficult for me to run a WAN cable all the way across the room and try to plug it into the router. I had to move around my piano and my cabinets until I was finally being able to connect them together.The instructions are a little outdated, but still steered you towards the right path on setting up the device. I didn't use them until the later parts of the installation when I had to put in my IP address. You are required to be a bit tech savvy if you want to set this up by yourself. If you do get stuck like I did, however, you can call up their customer support center which is based here in the U.S. and they should be able to help you out.The Qos option was what really caught my attention. Most of you can relate how awful the connection is when everyone in your house is using the WiFi. With the Qos offered by the router, you can actually limit how much bandwidth gets devoted to each device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJIYX26SQR86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1XIPFO#wasThisHelpful","R3VJIYX26SQR86","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Please take note that this is a transmitter, not a speaker. The little dots on the surface of the device might look like speaker holes, but don't be fooled. I was having trouble using this device at first, but I was able to figure it out after I emailed their support. They answered back really fast and sent back a detailed instruction. Just take the aux cord and connect this device to your TV/PC, or any other device that you have. Turn it on and let it pair onto your Bluetooth earphones/speakers. I'm using it right now to listen to music from my PC that's transmitting to my Bluetooth headset. This is meant for someone who doesn't have Bluetooth functionality of their devices and is a quick and easy way with no software installation.One gripe I do have with this device, and the reason I took one star off, was because of the static in the background. For example, if i was to watch a music video on Youtube, I would be able to hear the small static sound in the background when there is no music playing. As soon as I start playing the music video, the static goes away completely, but once it gets quiet the static returns.

"This belt looks amazing straight out the box. It's extremely flexible and you can definitely feel the quality on this. I only wish that I got the medium size instead of the large. I'm a size 35-36 waist size, but the large size of this belt was 4 inches too long for me. Make sure that you go one size smaller when you buy this belt.The colors on this belt are really nice. The entire backside of the belt is smooth to the touch, while the front of the belt feels rougher due to all the stitching.

"This is a really awesome doorbell kit. Remember that there are 2 different sets, the one I received comes with 1 plug-in receiver, 1 wireless remote door button, adhesive, and screws.You only need 1 receiver-- the receivers are very loud. I plugged it in downstairs in my living room and was able to hear it all the way upstairs with my bedroom door closed. Since it has a range of 1,000 ft, you can virtually plug this on any floor of your house and still get the signal. The sound of the chime is adjustable. You have a total of 4 different volume options that you can choose from. I love the variety of sounds that you can get. You have a total of 52 different sounds and 4 volume options so you can really just mix and match to your liking.The wireless remote is what you put outside by your door. To install the battery that comes with it, you just pop the bottom of the wireless remote and after that, put the battery in and the case back on, peel off the adhesive, and slap it on the back. Note that you can also just screw the remote into your door if you don't want to use the adhesive, but it's pretty strong and I don't think it's going to fall off. The remote will glow blue when you press down on it to show you that it's working.Overall, I really like the design of this door bell. It's sleek, stylish, and doesn't make a huge dent in your pocket. The installation was super easy, the chimes are loud, and I don't have a problem with it at all.* I received this product for free in exchange for a honest review* Pictures will be uploaded soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1SJOVLPO2RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151DD066#wasThisHelpful","RW1SJOVLPO2RF","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the way this earphone sounds. Unlike most earphones I've used that are under $15, it doesn't have that high treble and sharp S sound. Instead, this earphone has a richer and warmer sound than your typical earphone. Considering the price is only $15, that's pretty impressive.They really went all out with the whole green theme. Even the spare earbuds that comes with this purchase have tints of green in them. The LED light itself is green when you first turn on this device. Connectivity have been great for the most part. I have crystal clear connection, even when I'm all the way across my bedroom.I haven't tested the battery life to its full extent--I wasn't about to sit there for 8 hours and test it, but I've used it for the past 2 hours, and it still hasn't died. It comes pre-charged straight out the box so that was really convenient. The inner ear hook helps the earphone stay in your ear and the earphone itself really stays in there. Overall, this is a great Bluetooth headset to buy for only $15.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHLNSSQB9E4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155WFTOY#wasThisHelpful","R3VHLNSSQB9E4F","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dental floss is similarly priced to all the other ones on Amazon. You get 200m of dental floss for only $10.59 and if you do the math, you can see that it's either at the same value as the other dental floss, or much better. One reason I like this dental floss over others is because of the Prime shipping option. The other dental floss on Amazon comes as a add-on and you have to purchase 25 dollars worth of stuff to get it shipped. This purchase comes with 4 individual packs of 50m dental floss and the dental floss itself gives off a really minty scent when I first opened the zip lock bag that contains it. The floss itself is extremely thin-- it will be able to get into all the nook and cranny between your teeth, but it is also wider than most dental floss I've used. That means that it'll cover a better surface area when you use this.I like the amount of mint on this. Not too strong, but not weak in flavor either. It gives you that sharp mint feeling when you breath in between your teeth and I really like that. I also like the small metal cutter located on the top of the dental floss. Just simply wrap the floss around it, pull, and it cuts the floss off. Overall, this is a nice and dependable product. The cap closes and opens easily enough and the dental floss itself is stored within the container so it won't become easily contaminated.I guess if I had to nit-pick on something, it would be that once in a blue moon, the floss itself would leave behind shavings. I assumed it was just the mint, but sometimes it is the floss itself breaking apart.* I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUAIRM4C9D3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165O7NTU#wasThisHelpful","R3TUAIRM4C9D3A","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest thing that popped out at me when I was testing this product was the sound. I've tested a lot of Bluetooth headsets in the past and I've always hated how they sounded. They always had these high treble sounds and sharp S sounds. This earphone, however, sound AMAZING. The sounds are rich and warm-- it reminds me of the sounds I get from my Sennheiser 598. I'm sitting here listening to Adele's new song Hello, and it just sounds really great.The build quality is above average. The buttons themselves are made from plastic, but the band is made from a very flexible silicon. It will not tear, nor will it move around easily when you run because it does have some rigidness and weight to it. The ear-hooks themselves are especially rigid--it might be because my ears are weirdly shaped, but I have difficulty fitting it behind my ear. It might be different for you, but I wasn't able to fit it completely behind my ears.I love how easily accessible the volume changer, pause and play, and answer call buttons were. Connection was extremely easy well, just hold down on the play button and it'll turn on. Once it's turned on, it automatically searches for any devices and connects to them. Signal was great the entire time I was listening to music on this; no static and no break in connection as well. I should note that it also comes with it's own USB charger and changeable earbuds.Overall, this is a very good Bluetooth earphone, especially if you're someone who wants to hear good sound quality when you run.

"This is an extremely nice watch for only 33 dollars: The watch itself is made from stainless steel and real brown calf leather which really gives it that classic look. It includes other accessories such as: A laced bag to hold your box, a pouch that contains your manual and warranty information, and a hair clip which I found weird since this is a MEN's watch.There is no doubt that this is a really high quality watch -- You notice that from the moment you hold it. I really like the simplicity of it; unlike most watches these days that have so many features that clutters the analog face, this watch only shows date and day, which I really like.The functionality and design of the watch is simplistic as well. You pull or push on the crown of the watch to turn the watch on or off. You can also use the same crown to adjust language settings from English to Spanish depending on your preferred language.

"If you're an outdoorsy type of person that loves to go hiking and camping, then this is the absolute perfect external battery charger for you. The battery in this charger is quite big, holding a 8,000 mAh charge. Just to give you an idea of how big that is, an iPhone 6+ requires around 3,000 mAh, so it is enough to charge it twice over.This charger comes with a few interesting features. The solar power charging is very convenient when you're outdoors and have access to direct sunlight. A full charge using only solar power takes around 8 hours, but it is a convenient and cost-effective way to charge your devices. The thing I love the most about this charger is the flashlight that comes installed in it.  You simply press twice on the power button to turn on the bright white LED light. By pressing the power button again, you can switch between the settings on the flashlight to make it blink periodically or rapidly. That is such a great tool to have if you're outdoors; not only does it help you charge your devices, it can also double as a flashlight.The external battery itself is well protect with thick coat of silicon. It is heavy duty in quality, but still maintains a light weight. One thing I do notice is that the coating on the side picks up debris very easily. Just from taking it out the box, I notice tiny pieces of dust all over it. It's not a big deal to me and shouldn't be for you, if you plan to take these things outdoors.To wrap things up, this item also comes with it's own USB cable for charging via USB port if you want a faster charge, and it comes with a metal hook so you can attach the charger onto your backpack.* I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPNXBB6MUI5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSRFA82#wasThisHelpful","R2PPNXBB6MUI5J","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think most of us feel pretty hesitant to buy another Assassin’s Creed game after the last disaster that is ""Unity"". I still remember the first few weeks, yes weeks, of single digit frames, week late patches, and game-breaking glitches that came out with the game. Luckily, those problems aren’t as apparent in Syndicate. Don’t get me wrong...this game has a couple of bugs here and there, but definitely not as bad as Unity and it’s actually playable.I played this game for about 5 hours overnight and I just wanted to give you guys my thoughts on it so far.Pros:Twins- I'm loving the decision of dividing the main role into 2 people. Evie and Jacob are like polar opposites of each other and their sibling rivalry really keeps the story alive for me. I love that they both have their own skill trees; Evie takes a traditional assassin route, while Jacob is a brawler in the streets.Victorian Industrial Revolution- With a new era comes with new characters, history, architecture, and technological advances. Historical characters like Charles Dickens and Alex Graham Bell are just a couple of historical characters that will appear in this game. This game has a fun and wittier side to it than most AC games, and I really like that about it. I LOVE the rope launcher; it is literally my favorite item in the entire franchise. It makes traversing the entire map really fun again and gives climbing a fresh new feel.Cons:Same problems as always- Controlling your character’s movements have become easier with each passing AC game, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. You still get moments where you hop on to the wrong ledge, or the character just doesn’t do what you want. Combat was pretty cool at first because of the new takedowns and skills. But, it does get boring sooner or later because of the repetitiveness. At some point, you just realize that you're spamming the same buttons as you're automatically killing enemies one after another.That’s just my thoughts on the game so far, but there are a lot of things I didn’t touch on yet such as graphics and story. I just wanted to give you a brief overview and update it when I beat the game. So far though, I’d give it a 8/10.

"I played this game for more than 2 hours already and I know it's not much, but I just wanted to tell you guys my thoughts on it so far. The combat is very unique in its own way. Unlike most JRPGs, it's not actually turn based. Don't get me wrong, turn based games are fine. I love games like Final Fantasy Tactics, but eventually I just got tired of the slow combat. The combat style in this game is so fun and refreshing; it's fluid, interactive, and you can dash and sidestep behind creatures to evade their attacks. To be fair, there's quite a bit of hack and slash In the beginning of the game, but that's because of the lack of skills available to you. As you level up and acquire new combos with your skills and teammates, it gets insanely addicting.The story itself is actually very good so far. The main character you play is the ""Chosen One"" otherwise known as the ""Shepard"". He is among the small amount of people who can see Seraphims (spirit like people in tune with the elements. A seraph generally has magical powers related to one of the four elements: Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth.The Shepard can harness this energy to fight his enemies.Anyways, I really like the game so far and I will update this review as soon as I finish this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HAXDL15QIOIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8WTMKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HAXDL15QIOIQ","AOOIYMKA5J6V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOOIYMKA5J6V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For only 23 dollars, this purchase gives you some really great utensils. Utensil set include: Spatula, soup ladle, mixing spoon, draining spoon, and pasta fork. I love the non-stick aspect of all of these utensils. The normal spatula I use always accumulates a lot of grease and undesirables after cooking, and this spatula has been so great to make sure nothing sticks to it. I really like the high temperature resistance of these utensils. That means that these spatulas will last much longer than your regular kitchenware, especially the ones that are made from plastic. I've had plastic spatulas in the past where they were noticeably melting around the edges over time. It actually worries me that the plastic would get in my food so I would end up throwing them out.

There are so many things going on at once and it feels like you're holding your breath almost all the time.

Definitely much more confident in her abilities and grown up as opposed to last season. I really don't like the fact that they're still trying to shove HYDRA down our throats. I was really hoping that we would be moving on.

"When we last saw Barry Allen in season 1, he was desperately trying to stop a vortex from swallowing Central City. It was definitely a dramatic way to cap off the season and left the audience wanting for more. Season 2 didn't start off with a bang, but it paced along very well. It doesn't continue immediately from the ending of season 1, but rather 6 months after. You'd think that the disaster level event would have brought the team closer, but it actually left the team worse off. Barry taking the events that occurred especially hard, putting the blame on himself.I'm very excited to see how this show will continue to develop as the weeks go by. This show's potential is limitless as they continue to introduce iconic Flash characters from the comics. Atom Smasher looked great for the most part. The costume design, especially the helmet, looked amazing, but the awkward looking CGI did throw me off a bit.

First of all, I love how secure these caps are, once you close them, they remain closed even under pressure. I tried my hardest to squeeze open the bottle cap and I even stepped on it, but in the end, it remained shut. I think that in itself is the greatest feature. How many times where I had to bring an entire bottle of shampoo with me during a business trip or vacation and I open my luggage to see shampoo and soap everywhere. This is such a great bottle to store anything from shampoos to hand sanitizes. Another feature I like about this travel bottle is the hole on the top.

"These silicone travel bottles are really fantastic. Unlike most shampoo or body wash bottles that you bring with you during trips, these will actually stand the weight of your luggage. Since they are made of silicon, they're less likely to break or crack under the pressure of your heavy luggage. I love the fact that with this product, I no longer have to bring the entire bottle of shampoo with me anymore. I just twist off the top and pour the amount I need into it and it's sealed shut. Another great feature that's really useful is the suction cup on one side of the bottle. This way, you can stick this on most tile surfaces and just push on the bottle to squeeze the liquid out.

"These collapsible dog bowls are great for small to medium sized dogs. I can't imagine a Great Dane drinking out of this dog bowl, it simply isn't big enough. I really love the portability of these things. It can very simply fit into your back pockets, or if you want to hook this onto your belt or backpack, it has a little hole on the edge of the bowl specially designed for that purpose. This purchase comes with 4 different colored dog bowls, but don't think that this is limited to dogs. If you have an outdoor or indoor cat, you can just put this anywhere around the house; it's really the perfect size food/water bowl for a cat.

"For those of you that are curious, a 18500 mAh battery is a really big battery supply! Just to give you an example, a iPhone 6+ battery is around 2,915 mAh, that means that this external battery charger will actually be able to charge that phone 6 times! That is a whole lot of power. This is definitely great for those who has to go on a long trip, has a long work day that requires their devices, or have multiple devices that need charging (you can charge 2 devices at the same time).

"You should note that although the title says it will be able to hold a iPhone 6+, it actually doesn't. I got this in the mail a few days ago and couldn't get my phone to fit -- it's simply not wide enough. If you have a case on your phone, you might actually need to take the case off in order for it to fit. What I really like about this bike mount is that it has a ball bearing design, meaning that it will have a lot of flexibility. You will be able to turn the bike mount in a 270 degree angle and adjust it to your liking.

"Winters in Detroit are cold, windy and very harsh. With this three piece accessory set I can keep my face and hands safe from the weather and looking amazing!A lot of the time when I'm outside I'm using my hands and can't shove them into my pockets. The gloves included in this set are so soft and keep me warm all day long! The felt-like fabric is perfect for bitter autumn days and keeps my fingers toasty without letting them get sticky and gross. The sewn-in cuffs stay rolled even after a lot of movement and can be rolled back to cover any exposed wrists.When it gets really cold out, covering my face and head is absolutely required for the sake of my skin (and sanity!). The hat is cut in a round, wide fashion without an obvious front or back so it's easy to pull on quickly while I'm on my way out the door. The scarf is simple and easy to wrap without any indication of fraying or stretching.This three piece red outerwear set has made my autumn much more enjoyable!

I like having a selection of different pieces to wear and Cocorina's nose hoops have been an interesting addition!I do take my piercings out daily to clean them and therefore have the opportunity to change them regularly. With the four color options that came in this pack I'm able to choose a hoop to fit any mood or occasion!

" 0:49 Mins I bake a lot, which already creates a ton of dishes to wash afterwards. Whenever I see (two beaten eggs) in a recipe I cringe, because that used to mean wasting an entire mixing bowl and whisk - but now that I've got the Bella Sunshine egg whisk I can beat my eggs without losing any bowls!Baking from scratch can require a lot of attention, especially when working with a whirling stand mixer and yeast. This whisk is self-contained and lets me beat eggs with just one hand! I'm easily able to fill and shake this mixer and set it aside until it's needed. The green plastic ""sprout"" in the middle works to beat and blend together yolks and whites, as well as many other viscous materials to create a perfect mixture.Since I do bake often I need all of my tools to be easy to wash. I was so excited to find that the top and bottom of this whisk fit into the top of my dishwasher and came out sparkling clean! Both halves of the shaker, as well as the plastic sprout, are made of durable plastic and easy to hand wash as well.Bella Sunshine's plastic whisk has made my baking much easier and my creations much tastier!

"We grind herbs on a regular basis and have gone through a number of flimsy, unstable grinders. DuraCrush's large grinder is super strong and requires almost no effort!Strong teeth can make grinding a large amount of herb almost effortless.

Of course if anything does get stuck or left behind the included brush makes cleaning quick and painless.The bottom sections of this grinder are great for separating large matter from fine pollen without any extra work!

"My dogs have picked up a new bad habit of barking at the mailman, and I don't like the thought of my dogs being the ""scary""' dogs on the block. Doggone Silent's electronic bark collar has been a great tool at helping them learn to stay quiet!My dogs are all pit bull mixes and even though they're extremely sweet, they can be stubborn at times. This collar quickly and consistently reacts when they bark, which provides valuable feedback to my dogs faster than I can provide it. This collar emits warning beeps at first that are sharp and clear, and my dogs have responded to the tones quickly from the start. If my dogs do continue to bark the collar will emit a small static shock that quickly snaps my dogs out of the mindset of barking. Of course, if there is a true emergency and my dogs continue to bark this unit has a safety shutoff that will prevent my dogs from being senselessly shocked over and over again.Since I'm using this primarily on a dog that's new to e-collars in general I need a collar that's easy to adjust. With the two clearly labeled buttons to adjust sensitivity up and down I can easily start him at the lowest sensitivity and work our way backwards. Because the buttons are on the side of the small plastic unit there's no risk of them being accidentally pressed, and the two metal contacts coming out of the back of the unit assure there's skin contact at all times.Doggone SIlent's electronic no-bark collar has been a great training tool that we're already seeing results with!

" 0:38 Mins My dogs are a bit exciteable and when they're out in public I like to make sure that nothing can go wrong, since all three are pit bull mixes. This black dog muzzle from JD Gems is a quality training tool that's comfortable and reliable!With three mixed breed dogs in the house I need a muzzle that's easy to adjust to accommodate different nose shapes. The top strap of this muzzle is made from a wide piece of strong velcro that can be opened and adjusted as needed to provide a proper fit for any dog. Underneath is a mesh panel that allows for lots of airflow, while still providing enough restraint to keep even the most dog-phobic stranger at ease.If my dogs ever do need the restraint of the muzzle I can be sure it won't slip off or break loose at the back, thanks to the locking black buckle on the back of the headstrap! Located in the middle of the buckle is a red sliding lock that prevents the sides of the plastic buckle from being pressed in and removed. Since the color of the lock is very bright and stands out it's easy to find and unlock quickly after walks.JD Gems has made a great muzzle that works perfectly for my pit mixes! I did receive this muzzle at a discount but price doesn't change how sturdy this muzzle is, nor does it effect my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13W5E5TOACEX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0O1RGO#wasThisHelpful","R13W5E5TOACEX0","A2D6YE8BZM0ECI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D6YE8BZM0ECI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Like most consoles the Wii has unique screws, but Blingbing has made a great tri-wing screwdriver that fits the screws perfectly!Since it is a sensitive piece of equipment it's important to find precise tools that work well.

TrueXplorers travel size cosmetic bag has been a strong, sturdy bag that holds everything I could need!I have a hard time deciding on shades of eyeliner and shadow, and like to keep a lot of options on hand. This bag features several large zippered pouches that hold plenty of pallets and tubes of cosmetics securely without letting them roll around or fall out. There's a mesh zippered pocket just under the hanging hook for small items, several long pockets perfect for eyeliner or brushes, a large zippered pouch behind the pockets and a large mesh storage pocket on the bottom that holds everything! With such a wide variety of places to store items it's very easy to keep everything organized without having to think about it.Of course being able to fit all of my makeup (and a toothbrush, some floss, toothpaste, deodorant...) into one bag is meaningless if I can't get the bag to close. With its deep sides and durable outer zipper this bag is easy to fold closed and take with me wherever I want to go!

The IncrediSonic VUE VR glasses have been an easy and comfortable way to view every angle!I have an unusual phone and was having a hard time getting it to fit into a pair of cardboard VR glasses. With its solid enclosure and magnetic flap I was easily able to fit my phone into these glasses and it held in place no matter how I turned my head! Unfortunately these glasses are a bit heavier and really cut into the bridge of my nose, but I've found that holding them off of it will alleviate some of the discomfort while I use them.Since my phone is completely inaccessible when in these goggles, the included bluetooth remove has proved invaluable. With its control stick and two function sets I've been able to navigate both menus and video games as needed. I was able to pair the remote quickly with my Android device and while each button doesn't function perfectly it's been a great help in navigating while wearing the glasses.The IncrediSonic VUE VR glasses are a fun toy that fascinate me every time I put them on!

By setting it into one of these Toch holders I can easily keep an eye on it and not lose it! The adorable design and black plastic construction make this holder look great when it's sitting out and when it's not in use it just looks like a cute little figure.Since there are two pieces in this set it's easy to hold up even large items! My cell phone fits into one holder easily, both horizontally and vertically, without wiggling or falling out.

"We've been setting up for a yard sale and we needed something that would help us keep a shade over items we had on our driveway. Thor Outdoor's guyline tensioners were great for helping us hold up and adjust our cover!We have a large solar cover and no readily available trees, so we have to work with rope and anything else we can find. These tensioners made tying up our cover so quick and easy, since we didn't need to endlessly adjust before tying our ropes! We were easily able to slide these tensioners up and down as we needed and each one stayed in place when we let it go.For how small each of these tensioners are, they're each incredibly strong! They held their place through a rainstorm and the additional weight of standing water a few hours after we put our cover up.

Candyseason's 6-gallon garbage bags have been great to use in all our smaller bins!Large trash bags can look messy when they overflow out of smaller bins. These 6-gallon bags are just big enough for a standard office-sized wastepaper basket without having a ton of plastic left over that needs to be rolled away or tied up. The bag fits equally well in shorter, wide containers and tall skinny bins, which we appreciate since we have very random trash bins around the house.The thin blue plastic of these garbage bags make them perfect for paper disposal!

" 0:45 Mins I have an extremely active pit bull mix that needs lots of play and structure to behave himself. OxGord's dog ball launcher has made it easy for me to encourage him to run without completely tiring myself out at the same time!Fetch is my dog's favorite game and unfortunately he's too quick of a runner for my short throw. With it's long, flexible plastic handle this ball launcher makes it easy to throw a ball clear across the yard with just a flick of my arm! This launcher is so strong that I was honestly worried that I may clear our back fence if I wasn't careful, and I was able to throw the ball with enough speed that my dog didn't outrun it.Picking up a ball covered in dog drool is gross. By simply pressing down on the tennis ball with the top of the launcher I was easily able to pick up the ball and re-load it without having to get my hands all slimy. My dog has taken a lot of joy in being able to drop the ball at my feet as he runs by instead of me having to coax him to pick it up again and drop it into my hand like we were doing before. Even if the tennis ball becomes damaged - as often happens with strong dogs like pit bulls - this launcher is still able to get a good grip as long as the fabric around the ball is intact.My dog and I have both been overjoyed with Oxgord's ball launcher, and we've been having a blast playing with it!

Removing all the air from a bag took only a minute or two and when we were finished we had flat packs of fabric that have taken up almost no space at all!Of course, the jumbo-sized bag isn't for everything. Included in this back was a small travel bag that was so easy to use! I loaded some off-season tops into it, rolled the air out and was surprised by how little space the finished package took up! The travel bag easily fits a day or two's worth of clothing, making it perfect for quick trips.Blue Key World has made an amazing set of vacuum storage bags that I'm very impressed with!

"My skin is extremely fair and I need to use sunblock even on overcast days. Rahda Beauty's SPF30 face moisturizer has kept my face soft and protected!I drive for work on a regular basis and have gotten sunburned in the car in the past. After applying this moisturizer I found that my face didn't get pink or burn even after a whole day of driving! Because it is 30SPF I apply it twice through my day, but even with two applications I haven't had any problems with breakouts or oily skin.It's hard to find a moisturizer that works and offers sun protection. I was so happy to find that my face was hydrated and felt amazing after using this lotion. My face usually feels tight after cleansing but this moisturizer provided instant relief and keeps my cheeks and forehead feeling great for hours after applying it. I was very pleased to find that the thick cream absorbed cleanly into my skin and didn't leave any residue or take forever to apply.Rahda Beauty has impressed me again and I'm glad that this face moisturizer is the same quality as the rest of their products!

"I'm in my car a lot delivering food and my store requests that I call in while on the road. I've never been a fan of holding my phone to my head while driving, and I was so excited to try Ubegood's bluetooth receiver to use my entire car as a bluetooth device!My phone is a bit older and while it has a 3.5mm audio input, that's about the most technologically advanced thing in my car. With its attached charger and audio jack I was able to set this unit up quickly and start using it the day I received it. The long lengths of cord make this device very easy to install and I could even use the charging ports located near my rear seats if I wanted without running out of cord.Since I do need my phone for work I wanted a transmitter that I can rely on. This transmitter works without interruption and delivers a steady stream of music or phone audio right out of my car's existing speaker system! I was able to quickly pair my cell phone to the unit and haven't had any issues with the two devices working together.Ubegood's bluetooth wireless transmitter has made my work days much safer!

"I've wanted to bring some more color into my living room, and figured updating our throw pillows was a good first step. This linen throw pillow cover from WayHomeDecor is a beautiful cover that I'm proud to display in my home!I've loved elephants since I was a little kid, and I was so excited to see this colorful cover featured a beautiful elephant across it! The vibrant color combination in the body of the elephant is bright and extremely colorful with a variety of hues. Each color is printed onto the tan-colored linen and really adds a splash of color anywhere I set it.No one enjoys an uncomfortable pillow and even decorative pillows should be able to be relaxed on. WayHomeDecor's pillow cover is made of cotton linen which keeps the pillow cool and breathable. The linen itself is a bit rough but not so much that my bare skin is unable to tolerate it. The invisible zipper tucks safely away into the seam and doesn't stuck out or get caught on anything.WayHomeDecor's throw pillow cover is one of my favorite design touches in my entire house!

"As someone with a smaller chest finding strapless bras that stay on is always a challenge, since I don't have much to hold a bra up. Thanks to HOVEOX's stretch strapless bra I can still have the support I want without having to pull my bra up every eight seconds!Some strapless bras I've tried in the past have been so uncomfortable that I could barely wear them. HOVEOX's strapless bra is made from a wonderful light and stretchy material that keeps it in place without cutting into my skin. The top and bottom elastic stay exactly where I put them without making me feel constricted or trapped.Since I don't have much of a chest finding a bra that helps me work with what I've got is very important to me. I was pleased to find when I put on this bra that it doesn't squish or compress my chest at all and still leaves me looking natural! It's been great at providing support - and therefore confidence - throughout all-day activities where a bra with straps simply wouldn't do.HOVEOX's strapless bra has been a wonderful addition to my closet!

Kangaroo's 25-pack of mini beach balls is a fun, safe way that we can make lots of local kids happy!Kids love colors, especially bright ones. Each design in this pack of beach balls is brightly colored and screams fun! Several of the balls feature sea creatures, and the smiley face one has been a big hit with every age. There are two shades of traditional striped beach balls as well for that time-honored look. The vinyl on each ball is thick and each color is vibrant and sure to last!Since we're giving these to kids of all ages we were really looking for something that even tiny hands could grab. Each of these 25 beach balls blows up to just over 4"" wide and fits toddler hands and bigger! The air nozzle closes up tight and tucks back into the body of the ball so there's nothing sticking out. The small size has been a hit with kids of all ages and we've seen a lot of new games spring up in my house now that I gave my kids a few to play with!Kangaroo's 25 pack of mini beach balls has been a big hit with my boys and I hope it's a big hit with the neighborhood kids too!

Susenstone's rubber blue LED watch has been a great choice that has held its own against food, dishes and more!My work place is known for their sauce, so I needed a watch that I could easily wash that sauce from after a busy shift. This watch's rubber exterior easily rinses clean and doesn't hold any food mess! The smooth finish is easy to wipe off and has held its color through weeks of continuous wear at work.Being conscious of the time all the time is crucial in a kitchen. This watch displays the current time clearly using its large blue LEDs, and with just the push of a button I can check the time or date. I was really hoping for a watch that would constantly display at least the time which this one does not, but the time loads quickly when the button is pressed and it's still relatively easy to check the time as I go.Susenstone's rubber watch has really made my shifts at work easier!

The lead has held up wonderfully to jolts and pulls while my puppy is in the yard and doesn't rub him raw if he gets it looped around a foot!We've been training commands at a distance with all three of our dogs.

"We spend a good part of our summer on camping trips, and aside from our tent I try to make sure everything I take can fit into a single backpack. D-FantiX's pop up LED camping lantern is an extremely bright lantern that folds down to just a fraction of its full height!We've used large plastic lanterns before, and the space that they take up in my pack is barely worth the light they provide. D-FantiX's lantern folds and locks down into a small puck shape that's easy to squeeze into my bag. The handle on top, as well as the flashlight lens, don't protrude from the plastic top and bottom so there's nothing to get caught on even if I throw it into a pile of clothing. The power button is very small and doesn't risk being turned on in my bag, which I appreciate since batteries can be scarce.Once we've reached our campsite, this lantern really springs into action to light up our tents! When at its full height the bright LED bulbs cast light in every direction, perfect for illuminating an entire tent. With its variable brightness setting this lantern can be used for reading, card games, or anything else. When it's folded down and powered on the lens on the bottom of the lantern functions as a flashlight for a great focused beam of light.D-FantiX's pop-up lantern is a great choice for every camping trip!

"We have three amazing cats in my home that all have their peculiar habits. When I noticed that one of my cats was starting to get annoyed at having to step into scattered litter, I decided to upgrade one of our boxes and this high-sided litter box from Two Meows has been a wonderful choice!With its high sides and step, this litter box is great for keeping all the litter in with every step! The front step is covered in small holes which allow any litter stuck to my cats' paws to fall back into the box. The high sides keep litter from being kicked out while the cat is using the box, and the top of the box features a small inward lip to prevent litter from being kicked up and over the sides.My stepson cleans our litter boxes as part of his chores, so I try to be nice and make sure whatever boxes we use are easy to clean. This box features an open design which both he and my cats appreciate. The two-piece design allows him to remove the step and sides if he wants to make scooping out the box even easier.

When they're not in use each set is held together by a key ring that's perfect to hang from a cup hook and really helps to keep them from being separated or lost.I bake a lot which requires precise measurements. Each cup and spoon in this set is the perfect size and clearly labeled, so I know exactly which one to grab. The measuring cups all have a small spout on the side which makes pouring liquids mess-free, and the measuring spoons are wide and shallow for easy filling.

"I usually don't wear more than mascara on a daily basis because I'm not a huge fan of my makeup smudging and fading halfway through the day. NYX's glam shadow sticks have completely changed my opinion about wearing eyeshadow on a daily basis and I'm extremely surprised with my results!I've always found that powder eye shadow fades and smudges after a few hours without using a pricey primer, and even when I do use an eye primer the shadow near the crease of my lid always fades near the end of the day. These shadow sticks are AMAZING for their staying power! I've never had to touch-up my eye makeup when using them, since the pigment stays exactly where I put it. When I first received the package I swatched each stick on my forearm to test the color and see if I would have any reaction to it. Not only did they not irritate my skin, but the color stayed on my arm all night through an hour's worth of dishes and six hours working in a kitchen! I had five colored lines on my arm until the next morning when I finally decided to use makeup remover on them and take them off completely. In over ten years of wearing makeup I've never had that sort of result from any eye shadow from any brand.These sticks are extremely easy to work with, even with how long they last! I've found it very easy to blend the pigment from these sticks with my usual brushes, and the colors in this pack compliment each other nicely. The colors themselves are somewhat metallic and very rich, even with only one layer. Each color glides on smoothly and evenly, just as easy as using a crayon!NYX's glam shadow sticks are my new favorite eye shadow and I've actually been brave enough to wear them to work!

I'm so glad I decided to try Vaadi Herbals refreshing fruit face pack, because I've never had a face mask treat my skin so well!Most face packs I've used have worked on faith - I leave it on my face for half an hour and have faith that it's done something, even though I don't notice it. This was NOT the case with this fruit face pack! As soon as I washed it off I noticed my skin felt incredibly smooth and my pores had almost completely disappeared. My cheeks and forehead glow without feeling dried out and my skin not only feels better, but looks so much better after using it that my husband actually noticed and asked what I had done!I can be extremely clumsy at times and have accidentally gotten this face pack into my eye at least once. I was very thrilled to find that the ingredients are not only gentle on my skin but produced no irritation if I got it into the wrong place. The apple, lemon and cucumber that make up this mask are extremely effective together without causing any of the damage I'd receive if I used them on their own, and the combination of fruits and other ingredients in this mask helps to keep it a great color and easy to use!Vaadi Herbals has impressed me again with its incredible beauty products, and I was so excited with my results that I simply had to give my mother my second tube!

Each cushion is perfectly sized to fit just beneath my toes and doesn't extend in areas where it would be uncomfortable.Since I walk all night every night I have to have insoles that don't slip or slide.

"I prefer to use a BB cream on my face in the morning, and I've never been able to blend it the way I'd like with just my fingers. Susentone's 4pc blending sponge set has been a great way to blend my makeup without having to lug around a giant sponge!There's nothing worse than a visible line of foundation, especially when I've spend an hour on my hair and makeup before noticing. Each of these four sponges works to spread and blend foundation evenly without leaving a noticeable space. The large rounded ends on all four sponges are great for cheeks and foreheads, while the tapered tips get into eye areas and around my nose without a struggle. These four sponges come in two shapes, either hourglass or teardrop, and help blend around any facial feature.Some blending sponges I've seen in the past have been huge - easily the size of my palm - and way too large to fit into my regular makeup bag. These four sponges are surprisingly small at only an inch or two high and maybe an inch across. Because of their small size I found it was easy to sneak one into my purse and another into my relatively small makeup case without having to sacrifice much space at all. I also found that, because there are two of each shape, I was able to give two away and make my sister's day as well!Susenstone's blending sponges are a great way to apply makeup like a pro and I'm very pleased with the results I've had!

"We've been dismantling watches for a jewelry project and have wanted to make sure every piece we made could be easily worn without weighing someone down. Smart Weigh's high precision digital scale has been a great tool to help us accurately determine exactly what we're working with!Watch parts are extremely small and we needed a compact scale to weigh them on that we'd still be able to see them on. This jeweler's scale is self-contained with a clear acrylic flip-top that keeps our pieces safely on the scale until we're ready to pick them up again. The display at the front of this scale is easy to read, and the four buttons are easy to press and use. The power switch on the left quickly turns the scale on, and the mode button next to it makes it easy to cycle through different units of measurement. The tare buttons works quickly to zero the scale, and the pieces button has made counting tiny cogs and springs so easy!Included with this scale were anything you could need for working with and weighing tiny pieces. This scale is battery-powered and two batteries were included with it, and there are spaces in the included hard-shell case for a backup set. Two 20g weights are tucked into the molded Styrofoam as well so it's easy to verify that the scale is working properly. Tucked just below the scale is a pair of long-handled tweezers for picking up extremely tiny objects, and an owner's manual was discretely placed into a velcro and mesh pocket inside the top of the case.Smart Weigh's digital high precision scale is so much more than I was expecting in a scale!

"I love unique serving items, and enjoy impressing guests with my finds. Classique's Moscow mule mug is a very cool mug that stands out on a table!Typically when people think of cups, they imagine either a glass or a ceramic mug. This mug is made from solid copper, which no one is ever expecting, and shines beautifully on my table! The metal construction transfers heat and when this mug is full of a cold drink a wonderful layer of condensation forms on the outside. The handle is a bit lighter than the rest of the mug and gleams brightly.A lot of typical ceramic mugs are small and don't hold much liquid at once. This copper mug is extremely large and holds a surprising amount of drink - far more than it looks like it should! Unfortunately, because of the metal design this cup does have restrictions (no hot liquids, no soaking) and must be washed promptly by hand, which has made it hard to use on a regular basis.

"With summer drawing to a close insects and spiders are looking for a new warm place to stay, and inside my home has always been an attractive option to them. Thanks to Hoont's powerful plug-in pest repellent I can make my house a much less desirable place for them to spend their winters!We live less than a mile from the Great Lakes and get a variety of bugs that aren't easily controlled with one method of pest control. Hoont's indoor pest repellent works using both electromagnetic and ultrasonic technology to drive away pests of all kinds! The electromagnetic waves penetrate through our walls at all times, driving out anything living within them or trying to get in. The ultrasonic tones can be set to either fixed or variable, so that if pests are becoming used to one tone it can be changed to drive them back again.Outlets are scarce in my home and we need to get the most out of everything we plug in. This pest repellent is not only an effective way to control insects, but also an unobtrusive night light that helps to guide our way! We placed our unit in our kitchen against an exterior-facing wall to help keep outdoor pests back and it's become an easy way for us to find our sink without turning on switches and waking people or dogs up.Hoont's plug-in pest repellent has been a wonderful way to keep my home bug-free!

"In my subdivision we have gas pole lamps in front of every home.  It looks nice, and adds an extra layer of safety to the subdivision.  However the site planners made a big mistake they planted the pole lamps just inches away from the drive way.  It's fine most of the time because we don't park in front of it, but just about every time we have a dinner party or several guest come over invariable someone parks next to it and when they open their door BAM the mantle breaks and we're left with no light.  Because of that I've gone through a lot of mantles.  For the price/performance aspect these are the best I could fine.  The hard kind I find are more fragile and prone to breaking up with even less force against the pole.  At least these are fabric and can withstand a little bump here and there.  However with time the material gets more brittle and will break and fall off when someone bumps there door against the pole.Regarding the mantle itself.  It comes pressed and squished up, which is fine because it's just fabric.  You have to grab the ring and pull on the fabric an kind of shape it.  I've learned from experience that before you light it and while it's soft you have to try to shape it somewhat like a nice rounded shape.  Once it's been lit, it'll keep that shape.  Following the instructions you need to turn off the gas insert the mantle and then light it on fire - then wait till it's burned through.  It'll turn black and smoke a lot then it will turn ashy colored, and the flame will go out.  After that you can turn on the gas, and relight it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3NG0U895J9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJDELQ#wasThisHelpful","RT3NG0U895J9W","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sony Xperia Z is a big phone - it's not much different than a phablet.  I might just get a phablet next time around and get a bigger screen with the big phone, if they come out with one that is water resistant/waterproof that is.Anyway, I wanted a slim bumper case that only help protect from bumps on the corners because that's basically where most of the wear and tear show up.  I didn't want any extra bulk around the back of the phone.  There are some super slim cases that cover the sides and back but they look like they barely cover the front edges.  This was pretty much the best option if I didn't want a metal bumper and potentially loose signal strength.  It's pretty much what I was looking for except the quality is not so great.  For the price it's about what you could expect.  I actually wouldn't mind paying more to get one with better quality.  Also the bumper is a little fatter than I would like.  It extends out on the front and back a good bit.  Good for protection, but it makes the phone feel even bulkier.  I bought a similar bumper case for my wife's iphone but it was a brand name one that cost about three times as much but it's slimmer and much better quality than this product.I ran into a couple problems though.  The case interferes with some headphone jacks.  I had to take a dremmel to it to make room.  Same goes for micro usb adapters.  I had to take a dremmel to that opening as well to make room.  Another issue is that since the battery dies really quickly on this phone I use a extended battery that was designed to snap on to the phone, so that means I have to take the case off to put the battery on.  I kind of solved that by buying a slim external battery that I just hold onto which actually has better battery capacity.  However the whole package, phone & case, & external battery pack is just too bulky.  So now I don't use a case at all and use the snap on extended battery.I'm still giving the product 4 stars because it was pretty much the kind of case I was looking for and if I didn't need to attach an extended battery (every day) then I would've kept using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357ZDRDHBE21H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZ8PBAA#wasThisHelpful","R357ZDRDHBE21H","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a D-Link Dir-655 at my business, it's an older router but a workhorse that's served me well for years.  I started using some previously unused rooms that are farther away from the router and the signal would not reach back there.  I researched my options and considered upgrading the router & wifi adapters to the newer standards or getting an extender or running cables.  I tried this Securify Almond router and it was really easy to set up and I was able to get a signal in the back rooms, but the speeds were not very fast.  I ran a bunch of speed tests trying all different kinds of ways to set it up and changing the position.  Still it would work but not as fast I would like.Since my router was getting long in the tooth I decided to try to upgrade it to the latest and greatest and see if that would be any better.  I wanted to try that option vs running ethernet lines because who knows where I would want to set up computers in the future and I'd rather not have to keep running new lines.  I purchased the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 R7000.  It was pretty easy to setup.  It was a lot of busy work because I have ip cameras with port forwarding and other stuff, but it was still relatively painless and easy enough that I didn't need any tech support.  But I was surprised to see that it actually reached the back rooms just about as well as using an extender with my old router and the Securify Almond in b/g/n.  However in 5g AC it's blazing fast - just as fast a wired ethernet connection.  Granted your devices need to be compatible or upgraded with AC wifi adapter.I'm sending the Securify Almond back and going with the newer tech.  Yeah it's going to cost more, but I rather be spending more to upgrade to newer standards and hopefully have a longer future than going with already outdated tech.  I'm still giving this product 3 stars because it really is very easy to set up and if you don't want to upgrade your router and wifi adapters it's a good option, I'm not giving it more because it's pretty pricey for what it does though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KICN979N9KB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NZ31S#wasThisHelpful","R3KICN979N9KB5","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I just looked under light bulb here until I found something that looked right and I found it.  Then I see they have adapters so I can just use regular bulbs instead of these weirdo gu24's.

However the light fixtures I'm using it for is too small for a standard bulb and the adapter together as it sticks out too far, so it really defeats the point of getting this to use a standard bulb.

"Updated review below...Original review 04/19/2014:This could've been a great product but it's not.  First of all it's a battery case, as in... it's also a case, as in... it should protect the phone or at the very least cover enough of it that it give you a sense (maybe even just a false sense) of security.  It fails at that.  The case does not cover up to the front of the device, well actually it kind of does on one side and not at all on the other... huh?  On the side with the charger connector the protective edges go up to the top edge of the phone to just barely (but not really) offer some protection to the corners or edges, but for some reason it only goes up half way on the other side, so basically the other side has no edge protection and no corner protection.  OK, whatever, that's weird.  So the case is kind of lopsided/tilted from one side to the other.  I can't tell if the whole thing is lopsided or just the battery part, but it fits weird and not flat and not flush.  I figured that out after mashing my phone into it for DAYS trying to figure out why won't it sit flush.  It's always uneven, and I'm kind of OC, and one of my compulsive habits is that I CAN""T STAND it when a lid is not on a cup or container perfectly flush - like soda cups at fast food restaurants or tupperware and tupperware like containers.Ok, next.  Well, as for an extended battery, it's kind of short there as well.  I've used it just about every day since I bought it, so I have a lot of cycles done so I have a pretty good assessment.  It will recharge my phone fully from about ~35ish%.  Below that and it doesn't reach 100%.By itself it's pretty light, on the phone all of a sudden the combination becomes really bulky and heavy, so I guess I wouldn't have used it as a case anyway.  Because of that I put it on and off all the time.  As another reviewer mentioned the little connectors are tiny and fragile.  Mine haven't broken off, but they are tiny.  Actually skinny, like little needles, and they are wobbly.  They are held in by springs I guess so they give, which makes them wobbly.  I can totally see them breaking off if you're not careful.  There is also a wonky edge that juts out where the connector pins are, I guess it's the housing for the spring mechanism.  It's pointy and just adds another odd visual feature to an already lopsided design that totally contrasts the Omnibalance design philosophy of the Sony Xperia.The kick stand is a joke, not even worth mentioning and don't know why they include it.  The concept of having a kick stand is nice, just a bad execution.  Flimsy, doesn't hold the heavy phone and battery up, and doesn't stay in position.I thought about the higher capacity version of this battery case to deal with the issue of not fully charging below 35%, but the other issues I have would still be there.The one positive about this is the price, and that's the only reason I'm not going below 3 stars.  It kind of gets the job done, and at an inexpensive price.I bought a bumper case for my phone so it's too much of a hassle to remove that and put this on, so I just bought a slim anker case which is actually more compact and has nearly double battery capacity.Update 09/01/14:So it's a little awkward to carry two loose devices in my pocket so I went back to using this battery case and gave away my slim anker case.  It worked fine for a while (just I had to remember that it doesn't charge all the way if the battery level gets low).  Well, now after I've used it several months (recharging it daily) it now doesn't charge very well at all, maybe only gives it a boost of about 20%. I'm in a pickle because I don't know if I want to order another or buy another slim anker case, or just get a newer xperia with the larger battery capacity already inside.  I have to do something because the battery in the phone just doesn't last me a full day.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMOE6AEU58QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWXDIXO#wasThisHelpful","R3CMOE6AEU58QF","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an android guy and my wife is an iphone girl.  She recently upgraded to the iphone 5s, with her old iphone 4s she used to have one of those case back external batteries where you had to use their specific phone case.  This time around she wanted to be able to use any pretty case she wanted so I had to find another external batter for her to use.  I bought one of those lipstick batteries, but it's still an odd shape and it's awkward to hold both together if you want to talk and keep charging it (which the case back chargers are awesome for).  I saw this battery when it had zero reviews, and just saved it in my wish list to keep an eye on it.  In just a few weeks time it started getting great reviews, so I was like ""SOLD!"", and bought one.Just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back without even charging it or trying to charge my wife's phone.  In fact I'm too embarrassed to show it to her and not even going to mention it to her.  I usually don't bother her with techie stuff and just figure out what she needs and just order stuff and give it to her, and she's happy as long as it work and is easy enough to use and convenient.BUT, the construction on this thing is awful.  It looks like something they put together in one of those urban city hacker/maker spaces, or like what they build in my nephews middle school robotics club.  The back of the metal case looks nice, but the front has wonky machine grooves on the insides of the curves that cuts out into the bevel edge and it really shows very well because the crappy plastic cover doesn't fit right all the way around and doesn't sit flush.  On the side with the button, it sits so high off the case and the gap is so big you can actually see inside.  I went back to look at the pictures and you know what, the gap shows in the pictures.  Look carefully you can see a sliver of a black gap towards the end where the checker board plastic cover meets the bevel edge.  I totally didn't notice in the smoothed over photo shop, but it shows clear as day in actual life.Also, maybe I'm not very observant but I had just assumed it was metal all the way around, I didn't notice from the pictures or descriptions the top part was plastic until I got it.  I went back and noticed it does say the top is plastic in the diagram in one of the pictures.  However, I just want to clarify that it's more like cheap acrylic that they use on dollar store toys that was just trimmed to fit by hand, and not a custom molded plastic cover.OK, well even with all that I was almost going to give it a try, because it really is about the size of an iphone 5/5s.  It seems it would be convenient to stack them with a short chord and charge while using it, but 2 things.  First the output is not in the center it's off center, so I can't use the overpriced mini usb to lightning chord because it's so short it can only be bent back to go directly from the output in one device right above it to the input of the other, which would have been perfect it the output was in the center so it would plug right into the iphone which has it's input right in the center.  The only way to use it, is with a long chord, which is really awkward.But, even that might be overcome by a slightly longer mini chord, I saw some that were 5"" however...All those items I described really only makes the product lose 2 or three stars.  The main reason I'm giving this 1 star or zero if I could, is because it's pretty obvious the manufacturer is loading this item with fake positive reviews.  If you look you'll see that the majority of the people giving positive reviews have only reviewed or mostly only reviewed items in this manufacturers product line up and not much else, and they sound very similar, and are all done in about the same time period, and have goofy grammar.  It does looks like there is a review from someone that got a free product to test, take what you will from that review.  I'm giving this 1 star to balance the questionable reviews and to give everyone a heads up that the actual build quality is nothing like the pictures provided.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYPU6OC7GPTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ9GMGK#wasThisHelpful","R1CYPU6OC7GPTX","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 10/28/14:I see that Kenu has a model now for larger phones (phablets): http://www.amazon.com/Kenu-Airframe-Car-Mount-Phablets/dp/B00LU5LWQK/ref=pd_sim_cps_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=12KH68PGYH3BMQVVFSFCI think the larger model would address a lot (not all) of the issues I had with this particular model, so I am going to up my review by one star in appreciation of Kenu listening to their customers and making changes to suit larger phones.  Ironically, I've decided to downsize my phone to a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact so I'll be keeping the original model and using it with the new phone.  I've actually supported a new mount on Kickstarter and looking forward to giving it a try when it's estimated to ship in late November, but it's kickstarter so I'm not holding my breath - and which is why I'm not mentioning the name of the device as I don't want to recommended a product that turned out to be vaporware.Update 07/05/14:Apparently this review has gotten a lot of views and some comments, so I thought I would update it.My wife got frustrated with another car mount that I had with clips that are more difficult to install and remove (because she thinks it's a big eyesore and she didn't want to look at it) so she ripped it out and broke it - without remorse.  So, I went back to trying to make this clip work.  It doesn't play well with my Sony Xperia Z with a case, so I just roll without a case now.  It does makes it easier to clip in and out without using the case, and I've gotten better at it with practice.  I can clip my phone in one handed now that I've gotten used to the action of the springs, you need to push up against the right side of the clip to open it up. Removing is tricky but still doable, and sometimes it does slide around on vents - though I can do it now without it completely falling off the vents.Someone, commented that they had no problem using this case with an LG G2 phone.  My father has that phone so I'm familiar with it.  What makes my phone any many other big android phones different is that the LG G2 has all the buttons on the back, so that means you can clip it right in the middle and you can man handle the phone without worrying about pressing any buttons - as apposed to my phone which has the volume rocker and power button taking up most of the middle of the phone, leaving only a little area in the top or bottom.  I've got to feel for where the buttons are on my phone and clip it in so that it doesn't keep pressing down on the volume, and I've done this enough times now that I've gotten used to it.  However, even though I've gotten better at clipping in my phone it's still wobbles when I drive since I can only clip in from the bottom or top.  I like to keep my phone in landscape, for gps etc, so my phone falls over completely upside down, so I've found a work around for that as well.  I've figured out a vent placement that let's me put the phone in a lopsided landscape mode where one side of the phone rests against a radio nob - it doesn't leave any room for adjustment, and the screen is very crooked but at least it's not flopping around any more.Since I have found a way to make this work, I'm bumping up my original 1 star review to a 3 star. I've had to make comprises to make this car mount work and it's not perfect, but it's ok.Original Review:At first I thought this was an awesome minimalist design.  I even showed it off to friends and recommended it.  However after using it for some time I have changed my opinion and decided it's terrible in practical use.Clip.  The way it attaches to your vehicle is with slide on clips - they are metal clips with rubber boots on them - and you slide it onto your ac vents.  The rubber pieces detached from mine after removing it from the vents only after a few times.  I reattached them with epoxy.  However even still it doesn't hold still.  It's constantly wiggling loose.  You can bend the clips a little bit to get them tighter, but that doesn't help, it still wiggles loose.Clamp.  It clamps onto your phone by a spring loaded side clamps.  The force of the spring is very strong.  It makes sense because it has to really hold onto your phone, but it's really strong.  If you have an iphone your phone is much narrower so it's a little easier, if you have an android phone and one with a bigger screen (like mine at 5"") the phone is bigger so you have to really fight with the clamps to open wide enough.  It's is a two handed affair to clip your phone in and out, and it's not fast and easy at that.  It's a struggle each time to pull and grab and at the same time the weak vent clip doesn't hold tight so the whole thing wiggles around and half the time just pops off the ac vent.Clamp length.  This was obviously designed to fit thin square edged phones (ie iphone) and not much else, because it only extends out a short length, plus it has pointy rubber hooks that are supposed to hold the phone edges, but they are too short for larger devices so it ends up only holding your phone in with pointy rubber hooks and not whole side.  If you have a case, it probably won't fit or hold tight.  If you have a phone with a rounded back, it probably won't hold.  If you have a phone with an extended battery pack, it probably won't fit.  I had a phone with an extended battery pack with a rounded back and it would go in, but one bump in the road or a turn and it would pop off and the phone would go flying into the foot well, where I have to hope it doesn't slide under my brake or gas pedal or I don't wreck trying to grab for it. I upgraded to a new phone and it's too big with a case, well it fits just barely with a very minimal case but it's a struggle and it doesn't hold very well.Narrow design.  Because it only holds with two narrow clamps it may be a challenge to find a place to clamp onto your phone securely.  Most android phones have power and volume rockers on the side (and around the middle or at least mine do), so you basically have to clamp onto a bottom or top edge, which makes the phone top or bottom heavy - which relating to the issue of the wobbly vent clamp - it causes the phone to tilt and move around quite a lot while driving.  I have to constantly readjust the angle of the phone and I drive a prius v for goodness sakes so it's not like I'm hot rodding it.So basically I would only consider this if you have an iphone without a case or a very minimalist case.  I'm way past my time to return, so I'm going to stick it in a drawer and move on to the another car mount.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3CLAR2GN11C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D901B4W#wasThisHelpful","R1S3CLAR2GN11C","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 10/30/14:There are a lot of dead spots in the wireless reception so the sound goes in and out as you walk around the room. I noticed at first but didn't think it was that bad, but everyone that uses it complain to me every time.  With the one mic not working and reception dropping out I'm forced to move on to another wireless mic setup.Update 05/21/14:I'm taking away one star.  The one mic is continually going in and out, and mostly out when I need it for a gig.  I have too many gigs coming up to send this in for repair and as long as the other 3 mics are working I'll just keep using it. I'm glad I purchased the squaretrade warranty now.Update 04/29/14:It's been almost two months since I've had this system and I ran into an issue.  All of a sudden one of the channels stopped working.  I spent an afternoon trying to troubleshoot it - changing channels, changing batteries, unplugging all cables, etc. - and nothing seemed to work.  The display and led on the mic seemed to show the mic was fine, but there are two small red led's on the receiver for each channel, one shows that it's connected and the other lights up when a sound comes through.  The first light showing it should be connected would never come on.  The other three channels works fine.  I gave up and decided it was nothing I could troubleshoot, so I contacted the seller the next day.  They responded in just a few hours with instructions to return the device (and they included a paid shipping label) so they could test the unit.  Today (the following day) I went to pack the system, but decided to test it just in case and it's working fine, like nothing was wrong.  I don't know, since it's wireless system I'm only guessing there was some interference.  One thing I noticed is that each channel/mic are set to work on a particular frequency band.  You can adjust/change the frequency within that band for each mic/channel but they are separated so that neither can overlap.  That also means you can't test one mic with another other mic to make sure it's a problem with the receiver or the mic.  Anyhow, it's working fine now.  All I can do is just keep an eye on it to see if/when it happens again and if it does if I can try to figure out if it is interference and where it may be coming from.  For now I'm still satisfied with the system and the sellers customer service.Original Review:I've used Shure, GTD Audio and now this Awisco wireless mic systems.  Shure are probably the most well regarded and expensive systems.  Shure does have entry level systems which cost twice or more than GTD Audio & Awisco but their entry level stuff isn't really better than the no name brand, especially build quality wise.  The GTD Audio wireless systems seem to have the most reviews on Amazon so I gave them a try.  They were ok, nothing stellar.  The mic's look really cheap with the plastic cladding.  I experienced a lot of feedback with them and then after about a year an a half the receiver stopped picking up one mic.  The system was cheap so not a huge deal.  After researching a little more I decided to try these Awisco with basically a leap of faith because there are hardly any reviews here.First of all the price is very inexpensive - I know it's all relative to what you're used to, but for me $399 for a four mic wireless system seems pretty inexpensive as long as they work the way their supposed to.  Even the least expensive Shure's would be double or more like triple that price for 4 mics.  They looked better than the GTD Audio in the pictures too.  When I opened the box I noticed it was packaged really really well.  Custom foam cutouts.  Everything bagged and taped very carefully and almost perfectly.  Then I looked at the mics and the receiver and the build quality is way better than GTD Audio and probably even better than the low end Shure stuff.  It came with four - 1/4"" cables for each channel, and you can connect them to control the volume individually or it also has connections for a mixed line with all the channels combined into one line.  Make sure you connect the cable to the right slot to get separated channels or mixed.  I would have preferred xlr speaker connections but in practice they work just fine.  There is a single all mixed xlr connector, but I like to control the volumes and effects individually so I don't really have a use for that.The mic's are pretty nice as well.  They feel more solid than the low end Shures and way better than GTD Audio.  It has an on and off switch - it's not a push button, but an actual switch that slides up and down with definite clicks to let you know if you turned it on or off.  Also the display is nice.  It has an LCD that shows you the frequency and battery indicators.  There is also a led light, which when you turn on the mic it glows red to let you know it's searching for a signal and then turns off when it's locked in with the receiver, which takes only a second if that - and it's nice to know for certain you are connected to the receiver before you start talking.  There are volume controls on the receiver for each mic/channel.  The manufacturer also preset each mic to a channel frequency to match the receiver, plus labeled each antenna (with color coded labels with text) for the right frequency (you have to screw in each antenna, so look for the frequency number or the same color stickers and attach them to the right one).It was pretty much plug and play.  All the channels were all preprogrammed so all I had to do was plug everything in and turn it on.  I also like the fact it comes with rack attachments with all the screws - which only come on the more expensive Shures (if you don't want to just tape it down onto a rack shelf).I do have a caveat - I'm not a sound expert or a singer.  Saying that, they sound fine.  I have enough controls and effects in my mixer to get the right sound I want anyway, and the signal coming in is clear and full enough to work with.  I tried to see if I could get feedback, and by doing things that usually gets me all kinds of feedback from the GTD Audio or the Shures I couldn't reproduce feedback, or at least I had to really boost the gain to levels I would never actually use to finally get a little feedback.  I did try to walk around my facility to look for dropouts.  I have a 5,000 square foot room that I use this in and I walked around the entire room with each mic.  I did notice drop outs in some places.  Keep in mind I have the receiver installed in a rack, that is itself inside a steel cabinet, and the antennas are in the back so they are not really line of site.  I would imagine you could reduce some of the drop outs by placing the receiver outside of a cabinet and having all the antennas in a line of site of the mics - I don't really know though as I haven't tested them that way.  The drop outs are very subtle and only a fraction of a second, and I think you would have to be looking for them to notice, and you would have to be standing in just the right place.  The stage is closer to the receiver and I didn't notice dropouts anywhere around the stage otherwise I would have put some tape down to mark them. I really only noticed the dropouts in the middle of the room, where I doubt we'll have any performers using the mics anyway.  I also tried using the mic's really close to each other - another sure way of getting feedback.  At least in my tests they seemed to be able to handle it without any problem. I tried walking in front of the loudspeakers and they passed that test as well - just walking around in front of the speaker while talking, I didn't actually put the mic right up to the speakers.Each mic uses 2 AA batteries, and they even include batteries in the box.  That was nice, but I prefer to use eneloop rechargeable batteries.  The battery compartment slide cover is a little fidgety but not really hard to use.  As I mentioned before there are battery level indicators on the little lcd.  With the eneloop batteries they seem to last a really long time.  I haven't timed it to exact number of hours yet, but I used to replace the batteries in the GTD after every gig to be on the safe side because the indicators only had like three bars total and after every gig they were down to one bar.  On the Awisco there are a lot of bars so you have a better idea of how much you have left.The manual is not really big and detailed but at least it looks like it was put together with some thought and it's in an intelligible english and has just enough to figure out what you need - at least for me.One thing I can't comment on yet is long term durability.  The price of the GTD Audio is comparable if not a little less but I was only able to get a year and a half out of the receiver.  I'm hoping these will last longer.  For the heck of it I purchased a square trade warranty which I never really do for electronics, but from my experience with wireless mic systems I thought it might be a good idea.I wanted to mention that I read another review for the two channel/mic version of this system and he mentioned the mic's were made from metal.  I read though in his comments that he purchased an previous version of that system and it may have changed.  I wanted to clarify that the mic's I received were plastic an not metal.  They feel nice though still plastic.Something else I wanted to comment on is sound from handling the mic.  I had a Shure Beta 58 wireless mic that didn't make a lot of noise from handling, then I tried the entry level SM58 and it was like someone was stroking sandpaper over the mic and I had to return it.  The GTD Audio wasn't really that bad as far as that goes.  The Awisco does pick up some noise but you really have to bump it or grab it from one hand to the other roughly to even notice.  Nothing near as bad as the Shure SM58 did.  If you're just holding the SM58 and your hand changes position even slightly or you even just tighten or loosen your grip it amplified it like crazy.  If you're just holding the Awisco mics and you need to adjust your hand or you're moving around a lot it's fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SNJLGQKWAHAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040I90JU#wasThisHelpful","R2SNJLGQKWAHAS","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the positive reviews I ordered this, but had to return it right away.  I've owned another shure wireless mic system with a wireless beta 58 mic and had good experiences, but it was a different design than this.  I've also used other wireless mic systems from other manufacturers.  From the reviews I thought this would be a good economical way to get another shure system with two mic's.  When it arrived I hooked it up for a test and right away it was amplifying every single movement of my hand, and very loudly.  Maybe if I leave it in a mic stand I could do away with that, but this is a wireless mic so my intention is to be holding it so I can move around the stage or room.  Any slight movement of my hand on any part of the body of the mic is heard throughout the room.  It's not acceptable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEYNA8DNZFTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRQ5C1I#wasThisHelpful","R2XEYNA8DNZFTV","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most businesses we have to prop the front door open very often.  It's a heavy aluminum frame glass front commercial door with a strong auto closing spring.  I've been going through door stops like they were door mats (which means every few months).  We've been using the kind that swing down that they have at the local hardware superstores, and I pay extra for the heavy duty kind.  But they get beat up and the springs mess up and the whole thing becomes useless after a while.  I searched online for another solution and found these that you step on and the part that grabs the floor slides down.  I wasn't too sure about it, but what the heck I can try it and if it doesn't work, it's not like it would be any different than what I am doing.  First of all it's heavy and big.  Everything about it heavy duty.  I don't know how it will work in the long run, but it seems to be sturdier than the swing down type.  It mounted pretty easy, but I didn't account for the bulky size of it.  After installing the door wouldn't close because it's so big the front part bumped up against the door frame and the door couldn't close all the way.  I had to take it off, move it over about half and inch and re-install it.  After that it was fine.Couple observations though.  It's not as intuitive to use as a swing down door stop.  So I've noticed people fiddling with it to figure it out.  Also since it doesn't swing down and hit the ground at an angle it doesn't grab as well so you have to work it a little to make it stop the door from closing.  If you don't have a strong auto closing door, maybe that wouldn't be an issue, but for ours it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGPJDVU038LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRZLW9I#wasThisHelpful","R2SGPJDVU038LZ","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was at a Japanese supermarket on a business trip right about when my daughter was born 7 years ago.  I saw this and noticed the construction looked better and more precise than anything I could find at any local baby or department stores.  It worked great.  It really is made very well, the build tolerances on it could make Lexus envious.  You can clip the tiniest finger nails with this thing and it works just as well now as it did the first day we bought it.  My sister-in-law just had a baby and the first thing we thought of giving her was one of these.  We still use it for our daughter so we couldn't give her ours, thankfully found it here on amazon and we ordered one for her.  We had it shipped to us first so we could mail to her in Canada and when it arrived it looked just like the one we have, so it seems they are still made the same.  Buy this once and be done with it.  This little thing is so treasured in our household that we have a special place we keep it so we don't loose it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJXVP7QNUW0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FHS97Y#wasThisHelpful","R3HJXVP7QNUW0Q","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to mention I HATE watery soap.  I hate it when people (cheapskates) somehow think that when you only have a little soap left that if you mix in water then presto you have a full container of hand soap.  First of all you have to use ten times as much to get any kind of lather going and second it feels icky.  My wife knows never to mix water with the hand soap at our house.  At my business I occasionally find that someone mysteriously mixes the soap containers with water (I think it's the janitors just being lazy, because I'm the owner and I'm not that cheap to tell my janitors to do that).  Whenever I catch that I dump out the whole thing down the sink.  I don't want my patrons to think I'm being that cheap and I don't like washing my own hands with icky watery soap.That being said, you do have to mix water with soap in this dispenser, and I was apprehensive, but it's not bad.  I use a different brand liquid hand soap, and not anything made by or recommended by the manufacturer and have gotten good results.  As others have mentioned I do pump it 2-3 times to get enough soap to wash my hands, but it's more just preference as I like a lot of lather.  I do notice that if you get impatient and slam down quickly that the mix is more watery.  If you press more normally or even slower the lather is thicker.As far as the pump itself, the whole top part screws off and then you're left with the clear bottom container.  It's actually kind of small - maybe half the size of the whole dispenser.  There are fill lines so you don't really have to guess, but there are no real instructions other than that.  First you put in water up to about 60% of the container, then pour in soap till the container is about 80% full, then leave the rest empty - I guess it needs the air to mix in.  So you really don't have that much product overall.  I noticed the soap was all swirly in the container and there were no instructions so I just put the top back on and shook up the whole thing so it was mixed well.  I don't notice any drip from where the soap comes out, but I do notice the bottom is constantly wet.  I don't know if it's just from water spilling onto the sink from using the pump or leaking from the pump itself - I'll have to figure out and update this.  There is a black foam pad on the bottom to keep it from sliding around, but since it's always wet I'm having  wash it off and dry it on occasion.Overall, though I like that it does save on soap use and the foaming lather is alright so we'll keep using it.Updated 04/19/14I finally figured out the excess water was coming from the soap dispenser and not just over spill from the faucet or spilling off of peoples hands.  The top of the actual clear soap container has a big wide opening and just a narrow threading band, so there is not much purchase area for the threading to hold tight.  Also, the outer top part comes down over the whole thing so it's impossible to see how it's screwed on.  If it's tilted and not seated on flat then you have gaps where liquid can get out.  If you over tighten then the threading gives and it pops and spins around again and if its not on just right it could leak.  I have two of the dispensers and one tightens more securely than the other, but oddly enough, the one that seems to tighten securely seems to be the one that leaks more, and the one that the threading seems loose and keeps spinning around unless I finesse it just before the point it will pop loose seems to not leak.Also, as I mentioned the actual soap container is very small.  Just for kicks I tried to estimate how much this thing is actually saving in soap use since I tend to give it a few pumps every time I use it instead of just once for a regular liquid soap dispenser.  I used another 'normal' soap dispenser to pump in soap to the fill line.  I counted about 50 pumps give or take to fill to the fill line.  I used this dispenser in our downstairs restroom that's near our living room which gets the most use.  With 3 people in our house I would guess each person uses it about 3 times a day, so that would be 3 x 3 for about 9 pumps of soap per day with the regular dispenser, so 50 pumps of soap would be equivalent to about 5-6 days worth of soap if I were using regular liquid soap dispenser.  Though to be more accurate I probably did give a harder pump than I would normally do when I was filling the container to get it filled quicker so let's just say it's a little over a weeks worth.  I've noticed that this foaming dispenser has to be refilled after a little less than three weeks which seemed pretty quick compared to a normal liquid soap dispenser, but after measuring out and comparing it does look like I'm stretching about a little more than a weeks worth of soap that I would use in a normal soap dispenser to a little less than 3 weeks with this thing, so that's not really a full 70% savings but still close at probably around 60 something percent that I'm seeing.I mentioned earlier that I run a business.  I thought about using these in my business but decided not to because it doesn't really seem sturdy enough to handle commercial use, especially with a finicky closing top that tends to leak.  Also, the capacity is so small it would be more frustrating having to refill way more often.  So, I'm just using it at home and it's fine for residential use, as long you're careful screwing on the top.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUCK895STKPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPMEJAW#wasThisHelpful","R3VUCK895STKPI","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 6 of these chained together for uplighting on a stage.  I usually leave it on the fade program and it will fade from one color to the next, though occasionally I'll use other settings.  It's a nice effect and really upgrades the background look of the stage.  I don't use the remote and should have purchased the version of this light without it because if you have them set up as master and slave the remote will override the slave setting and cause the other lights to change.  You pretty much have to have the remote inches away from the master light, and if you're going to be that close it's just as easy to use the controls on the bar itself.  These come with easy tool-less bolts that you can pretty much tighten and loosen with just your hands, but I would recommend changing them out for screws with allen heads.  People keep fidgeting with the angle of the lights and I had one stolen once.  I went to lowes and got the allen head screws and solved that problem.  Just take the existing bolt with you so you can find the right threading, size and length.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQF52ZAHZJ6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045EP4WG#wasThisHelpful","R3VQF52ZAHZJ6N","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a carpet cleaner come clean my carpet at my business and he used something like this on a drill to remove gum.  I purchased this and tried it.  It takes a lot of finesse, and even if you're careful the roughed up carpet it leaves behind might be uglier than if you had left the gum in, but it works for our purpose.  Just don't overdo it, and use a brush to clean up the carped and scissors to trim the loose strands.

"I loved the first season.  It didn't have a lot of special effects, but it was like Jaws in which they really pushed the story and creating tension to make up for the lacking effects.  The show really grabbed your attention and made you anticipate the next episode.  In season two you can tell the budget got bigger.  The look became more film like, gritty and the action was bumped up.  Some of the characters were just gone from season 1 without explanation and I feel the tone really changed and there was less focus on keeping up the tension and anticipation.  It was still entertaining but I felt they were spending more time trying to incorporate the gee wiz special effects and got a little lazy with the story and character development.  Season 3 was disappointing compared to the first two.  In the first season each episode was crucial to developing the story and characters.  In the second season a little bit less so, and in the third season you could probably have skipped most of the season and not miss much.  You really have to watch the entire 3rd season to be able to judge it, and if you do that it was fine and worth watching, but on an episode by episode comparison not as strong and entertaining as the first two seasons.  I'm on the fence about the 4th season.  Not really as excited to see it, but I probably will when/if it's included with prime membership.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TR1QCZNLGQG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EC8BA28#wasThisHelpful","R3TR1QCZNLGQG8","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 7 year old daughter that really wanted to see this movie.  We really don't let her watch PG-13 movies yet but I thought since it was a contemporary take on Snow White and had Amanda Bynes (when she was somewhat normal) it might be o.k.  The story line is fine and follows somewhat the story of Snow White but there are some strong sexual innuendo and a good bit of foul language that I wish I had known about beforehand.  We don't use any foul language in our house, so thankfully our daughter not knowing any better did not pick up on it and never even noticed (I hope).  I guess I should have known that going in to a PG-13 movie.  As a movie, it's just o.k.  The content I would say is more suitable for older teens and if I was that age I'd probably still just give it 3 stars.  It's not really one of Amanda Bynes' best movies.  If you have smaller kids, I would recommend skipping it until they're older.  It's not the worst movie to show young children and we came through unscathed and if you ask my daughter she would probably say she liked the movie, it's just as a parent I would have rather to have not let her see the movie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WODRSUK55PZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015QQTDK#wasThisHelpful","R1WODRSUK55PZK","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a flood/spot light for work and picked up a Stanley rechargeable spot light at my local wholesale club.  The brightness was fine but the battery life was atrocious.  I decided to do a little research and get a better light and for the price, light output, battery life, and size this seemed like the best buy.  I've had it for a few weeks now and I can say it does not disappoint.  Battery life is great, we use this just about everyday and so far it hasn't run out of power between charges and we use it a good bit.  The light output is fine, it has a brighter spot in the middle and then a larger ring of light that's much less brighter but still usable.  I have much more expensive bicycle lights that put out more lumens and have just as long battery life, but they are small making them easy to drop or misplace.  For work I want a big light that's easy to carry with a big grip and easy to find in the tool box or on the shelf and easy to set down and pick up quickly, it's just an added bonus that it's not all that expensive.  It is heavier I guess due to the type of battery type, but it's still light enough to carry without really noticing - it's no anchor by any means.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4HE8W3YHSQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RQE6ZO#wasThisHelpful","R3T4HE8W3YHSQ4","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We got the citrine because the color my daughter first wanted actually is sold out everywhere even on Speedo's website.  My daughter is tiny for her age and we want her swimsuit to fit just right and even a little tight is fine so we sized down.  It turned out to be too small. We changed for her right size and it was actually just right, so sizing fits.  My daughter likes the suit and says she feels like a pro athlete when she wears it.  She's just 6 so she's got a long way to go though.  She's been taking lessons for nearly two years and she's gotten pretty good so it was time to grow out of the cutesy swim suites from the kids clothing shops.

"I needed this to display a 7"" tablet for people to use without my supervision and without the worry that they would walk away with the tablet.  I'm using a nook tablet that are available pretty cheap and actually about the same price as this stand but better to buy the tablet and this stand than having to replace a tablet often.  It fits perfectly, well since it's adjustable it can clamp down to any ""mini"" tablet pretty much.  It holds the tablet fine and it's not loose and is really locked down without any worry someone could just pry it loose by hand.  It uses one of those barrel keys like on bike locks.  The lock is a little hard to get to, but it's ok at least for me as I don't plan on taking it out of the stand again.  The stand looks a little different than the picture.  The tablet actually faces the other way around if that makes sense.  There is a long steel cable that connects to the slider bar on the holder and you can wrap the cable around whatever to make it secure, and you can coil the cable through the hole in the base stand as well.  The tablet can be rotated, but it takes a few steps and once it's rotated it has to be locked into that position, so it can't be adjusted or rotated easily 'on the fly'.  The part that the tablet clamp part is connected to the base stand is where the device can be rotated, but that part actually wobbles a little even after clamping down.  It's also a bid off center, well I guess that depends on your tablet and how far out the sliding clamp has to slide out, but for me it's off center so it's difficult to rotate it so that it feels like the table it level.  It's not a two position landscape or vertical option or even clicks, it's all loose and you have to go by your eye and your judgement if it's level.  Also since it wiggles a little even after it's set strait it tilts a little.  The stand can be bolted down I guess if you need more security, as it has holes in the base, but there is no extra hardware to do that.  You would have to provide your own bolts, nuts, screws or whatever.  As far as price I do think it's on the high side for what it is but it looked like the most secure option without having something custom built.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVN46NL59ALO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8THRQW#wasThisHelpful","RLVN46NL59ALO","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have three of these.  I believe this is an older design but is still being sold as I bought all of mine at different times.  My first one several years ago and the third one just recently (end of 2013).  This was one of the best buys for capacity and price then and amazingly still is.  As you can imagine I've had lots of power outages and these things have been lifesavers (well computer savers).  I use them at home and at the office.  It has plenty of information you need on the lcd.  It's reliable and not fussy, and just plain does what it's suppose to.  The capacity is nice so I can run a lot off it and get enough backup time (for me).  In my office I use clear wireless internet so that's plugged in, my wireless router, pc, two monitors, a laser printer, voip modem, phone, NAS.

"I bought another no name brand thin case that actually looks just like this one for another tablet I have and didn't really like it very much, it didn't fit perfectly and the cover didn't lay flat, was too stiff in the folds, the seams don't line up, and the materials felt cheap.There are not a lot of choices for the new ipad air yet so I thought I'd try one of the 'cheap' kinds from a different seller this time.  From the pictures it actually looked exactly like the other cheap one I bought, but once I took it out of the box I could tell a difference.  The packaging while not great was still better than that last one.  The materials are better, and the fit is perfect - exactly perfect.  The cover lays flat, and folds easily.  Everything I didn't like about the case I bought from the other seller was better with this one.  The price is great on this too, saves a lot over the case apple sells.  It has the magnetic cover that closes tight and turns the screen off and on, which works perfectly.  When closed all the seams match and looks like a custom cover should look.  The back part that clips in has just enough of the front exposed that the metal bevel of the ipad still shows which is a nice touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJR68C5Q1WDDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6C614K#wasThisHelpful","RJR68C5Q1WDDM","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend and I compared a lot of screen protectors for our phones that we've both gone through and we've pretty much decided for the clear type Tech Armor is the best.  It is cut just a bit smaller than the actual screen size and that's a good thing, because it allows a slight margin of error when you apply the protector, but just enough that hardly any bare screen is showing or is hardly noticeable.  Also the adhesive is really good, it sticky enough to stick and stay but doesn't attract a lot of lint before laying it on, and it doesn't leave any residue, it's also really easy to use the tape to remove any stray lint.  The included cleaning cloth is better too because it doesn't leave a lot lint, some cloths that we had actually left more lint than it removed.  I bough this for my family's new ipad air and it went on perfect the first time (though I had a lot of practice putting on screen savers for all my phones, wife's, parents, etc.)  I had to remove lint/dust from two places and used the tape and came off fine.

I replaced most of my computers with SSD's but one of them had a 1 tb 7200 rpm boot drive that I didn't really want to go breaking up to use a smaller SSD because 1tb ssd are still crazy expensive.

It seems there are a lot of the manual hand drills to choose from.  This one seemed to have the best overall reviews.

"My six year old daughter went through a horse phase and we watched any video we could find with horses. I thought she might like this so we watched the first couple episodes.  While she seemed to enjoy them while watching the videos she never really mentioned it again afterwards and didn't really care to watch other episodes.  It may be because she got over the horse thing and has moved on.  It seems kids have so much available to them now it's really easy to get distracted by something new.

"Our old shower squeegee had a hard blade that didn't do so well, so I searched for one with a softer rubber blade.  This one is almost perfect except ours leaves streaks.  The rubber is soft and almost leaves the glass perfectly spotless but the edges of the blade have manufacturing ridges that are not perfectly smooth so it leaves streaks in a few places but a really big one right in the middle.  So while the rest of the blade works mostly fine I get this big streak down the middle.  I tried smoothing out the ridge of the blade as best I could but the streak stays there.  As far as width it's not really that long though not really too short either, but if it did a good job it would be fine.  In order to get rid of the streak I have to overlay my swipes so it effectively reduces the swiping width by half.  If I press down ridiculously hard it makes a clean swipe about half the time, so that's what I'm doing now until we get another squeegee.  It may just be a manufacturing goof with mine, so ymmv. Except for the streak in the middle of the blade this would be a nice squeegee as otherwise everything else about it is fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVEE316Y0SXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8RZNEM#wasThisHelpful","RXVEE316Y0SXZ","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My six year old daughter saw this somewhere and begged for one.  She absolutely loves it.  She turns it on every night.  We've had it for a while and it's held up well, actually my daughter is pretty good about taking care of her things so she really doesn't break anything.  She likes the colors.  The amber color is the dimmest setting and the purple and green are pretty bright - almost too bright.  You can set it to automatically switch through all the color but it's too jarring going from the dimmer color to the really bright colors so we never use that function.  She usually just sets it to the amber color with the 10 minute timer.  Actually she still hasn't figured out there is a timer as she always falls asleep before the timer cuts off the lights, otherwise if she knew there was a timer I know she would demand we don't use the timer and she would probably leave it on all night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYDD1RR0OB5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ACRPR6#wasThisHelpful","R3VYDD1RR0OB5S","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Side by side it's a lot better in materials and construction compared to cheap bows that come with beginner violins.  Side by side with higher end bows you can tell it's not in the same league but well it's fine for my wife's purpose of just playing for fun.

"I needed to drill holes through an aluminum retail store front door to install new locks myself instead of paying a locksmith $400 to do it.  These worked fine enough.  I lubricated with some oil and that just made things messy as the shards of metal just got sticky and stuck to everything, and there were lots of metal flying everywhere.  The combo guide drill and cutter made the process a little quicker, but the guide would crawl a little until it bit into the metal.

"I was looking for a taller than normal table/desk to use as a DJ stand, and this fit the bill.  Similarly priced DJ stands are very flimsy, and sturdier professional stands cost many times more than this.  This is the perfect table size and height.  From reading the other reviews I assumed the worst as far as material quality and it pretty much met my expectations of very weak particle board filler with a laminate outer.  I have other furniture like this and from my experience the only way to make these sturdy is to assemble with wood glue and let the original bolts pretty much just be the clamping force to let the glue dry.  The only draw back with that is that you're never going to be able to disassemble the table, as long as you're ok with that the glue is going to make the desk/table a lot more sturdier.  I have my table assembled and the glue has dried and like the results.  It's been used a few times for gigs and it's worked fine.  I plan to drill some holes for cables and then it'll be perfect.  I don't need to move it so it doesn't have to be portable for me, if you need a table that can fold or is easy to move this isn't a good option, but if you want a DJ stand that you can leave at home or a business this is pretty nice for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDCWV9OUOSM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TLKL8O#wasThisHelpful","RTDCWV9OUOSM6","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this drive at the end of May to ""upgrade"" from a standard 1TB 7200rpm drive.  From the beginning I didn't notice any discernible improvement in speed.  I thought I'd give it time to speed up after using the drive for a while.  It never improved.  Towards the end of August my pc would not boot from the drive.  I went back to using the old 7200rpm drive I replaced, but surprisingly the the SSHD still showed up on my computer as another drive so I left it on the pc as an extra drive.  More recently the computer would lag and freeze up and it seemed like it was coinciding with the clicks from the hard drive so I decided to upgrade the drive before some catastrophe.  I just recently upgraded to a WD 10,000 rpm drive and I noticed a definite improvement immediately.  But I also noticed that my pc would not work right with the SSHD still attached (lagging and freezing), but when I unconnected it the pc ran perfect.  So I'm thinking the freezing up was not from my 7200rpm drive acting up but the SSHD being connected to the computer even as a spare slave drive.  Either way I'm satisfied with the WD velociraptor drive and keeping it and tossing out the SSHD and giving up on the hybrid concept.  This particular pc I had a 1tb drive so that is why I considered the SSHD or the 10,000 rpm drive.  All my other pc's I've upgraded to SSD and really there is no comparison to an SSD and anything else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWH5O68NTPON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B99JUBQ#wasThisHelpful","RAWH5O68NTPON","A374QI8U7LHH96","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374QI8U7LHH96?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So my mother who is nearing 70 asks me to look in to one of these for her so she can work out while watching tv.  I read all the reviews and people have compliments and complaints about every one of these from the cheap ones to the very expensive models, so seems to me there really isn't much difference and you really don't get what you pay for.  Since I know she really isn't going to be working out all that vigorously and will probably quit using after a couple times I pick out this because the reviews are mixed but fairly good and it's cheap.  I had it shipped to my parents home and my father said it was pretty easy to put together.  It's been over six months now and my mother loves it, she still uses it regularly, and it's held up pretty well.

"This is a great dash cam.  It comes packaged in a box and it includes the dash cam, manual, suction cup mount, 8GB sd card, cigarette lighter adapter, and mini usb cable.  So basically it comes with everything you need to use it right out of the box.  The manual is detailed and easy to read and in proper English.  I especially like that an 8GB sd card is included with this which will store about 70 minutes of video.  You can also expand up to a 32GB card.The camera itself is small but I like it because it is not in the way when mounted on the dash.  The video quality is full HD 1080p and looks really good.  You can see details like license plates and the video looks really clear and good.  You can also take still photos which come out very clear and sharp.  The night vision also looks pretty good on this camera.  It also has a G sensor which will detect significant or sudden movement and automatically lock the video file being produced at the time.  The camera also has a 4X zoom function as well as 170 degree wide angle lens so you get more of the road in view.This is a great camera for the price.  I see some of the negative reviews mentioned that the manual was bad and they couldn't get it going but like I said I thought the manual was good.  Perhaps they made a new manual since then.

"This thing is HUGE.  I took a photo next to a sharpie so you can see just how BIG it is.  It is also SHARP, so be careful.  It does come with a cover so can store it safely.  It works great for zesting fruits as well as for cheese.  It really is fantastic I was surprised how well it worked.  I find it easier to shred cheese with this type versus the flat kind.  The handle is big and easy to hold. It also has a hook if you choose to hang it up.  Great tool everyone needs this!

"I like to use these teeth whitening pens as a touch-up.  I normally buy them at the dollar store so I compared the two to find that this one uses Carbamide Peroxide and my dollar pen uses Hydrogen peroxide.  A study published in Journal of the American Dental Association showed that carbamide peroxide appeared to produce slightly more dramatic results at first.I do think this pen did work better than what I was using. I have been using it twice daily. It is easy to use and makes me feel good knowing it was made in the USA. I also like that it left my mouth feeling really fresh due to the peppermint oil.  I will have to see what I think when I run out if I will pay more for this or continue using the cheap ones.

"This bed is adorable! It came well packaged with no damage.  The box was smaller than expected and not heavy at all.  The box does have a photo of a bed on the outside so keep that in mind if your child is around when the mail comes. It took me about 20 minutes to put this together...it was VERY easy.  Everything is labeled and marked and the instructions are easy to understand.The beds can be used as bunk beds as shown in the photos, OR you can have them separate.  They included an extra 4 of the circular bed post tops so you can separate them if that is what you prefer. It also did come with the bedding and pillows for each bunk. The ladder just rests against the bed, it is not attached.  Either way it is absolutely adorable. It is fairly sturdy but I am thinking it may break if a small child tried to get it on it. It will fit dolls up to 18"" tall including American girl.

"I love these containers. They have compartments so you can put foods together in the same container that you don't want touching.  The container sizes are big enough to fit anything I have cooked so far.  The tops are raised so if the food is taller than the container the lid will still fit on without smushing the food.  They would be great for meal planning, kids lunches, or just storing leftover dinner.  It's pretty great they can go from the freezer to the microwave to the dishwasher.  Plus they are BPA free.

"I really like this case (and I am very picky about my cases)  The back is a shiny plastic and the sides (gray parts) are a grippy plastic.  I really like how it feels in my hand.

It is hard to reach without fingernails.  I can live with it though because I really like the case. The apple logo cutout is not protected but I have a screen protector on the back of my phone to cover it.  The kickstand ring is some kind of actual metal with a tape adhesive on the back.

"This comforter came packaged nicely in a clear zippered bag.  When I opened it I washed it immediately.  The tag says the material is 100% microfiber.  The material is not as soft as I thought it would be.  It is not scratchy and hard but it is not ""silky"" as described.  It has stitching across to keep the filling from shifting which is nice.  It has a nice thickness to it.  I tried to show the thickness in the photos.The sizes of the comforters are not listed but it was a little small for my bed.  I do have a really tall mattress though so if you have no feather-beds or toppers on your mattress you should be okay.  I put this comforter inside a duvet which I think is the best use for it.  Unless you like the plain white comforter look.  My duvet cover is 104 inches x 90 inches and you can see in the photos it is a bit smaller than the duvet.I think is comforter is decent.

"I had seen all over the internet people were using this to whiten their teeth so I was excited to try it.  It comes in a huge resealable bag.  Inside it is a very fine black powder.  There is a scoop inside the bag.  When I reached in to dig it out the powder got on my arm and hand.  It doesn't just brush off.. you need soap and water to get it off.  It was kind of like when you check the oil in your car and your covered in black.So I put a bit on my toothbrush and then started brushing my teeth with it.  It didn't really taste like anything but it was crazy looking. I kind of brushed around.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to let it sit or what so I started trying to rinse.  It took quite a bit of rinsing to get it off.  It got in my gumline and in between my teeth so I had to brush really good and then floss to get it all off. It won't fully come out of my toothbrush which is now a shade of gray.  You may want to use a spare one for this.  I think it did whiten my teeth slightly...maybe.  I think I may need to leave it on longer.  The main thing to note is that it is messy.

"This speaker was bigger than I expected.  It comes nicely packaged in a box so it would make a great gift.  It has many features that regular shower speakers don't.  It has separate buttons for everything so you don't have to do any of that press once for volume, press twice for skip, etc.  It is nice to have the buttons for each.  It also has a digital clock which is great if you need to keep an eye on the time getting ready for work or school.  You can even answer the phone with it when connected.  I also really like that is rechargeable so I never need to buy batteries.It also has an FM radio with saved presets!  There has been a ton of times I got in the shower without having my phone's bluetooth enabled so I couldn't listen to anything on my old shower speaker.  With this one if I forget my phone I can still listen to the radio.  Plus I can save my favorite stations so I don't have to spend half of my shower scanning for stations.

"These sound amazing for the price.  These get 5 stars from me because they have an excellent sound and the price is amazing.  They are well packaged and would make a great gift.Looks: The headphones look great. They look well made and the cord is nice quality.  I don't see it unraveling. There is a button on the cord for pause/play and to take phone calls.  The plug that inserts into your phone/device is made so it won't come apart or rip.Feel: They come with 3 different sized tips to ensure a comfortable fit.  They are comfortable to wear and lightweight.  The cord is very long (4 1/2 feet).  The actual earbuds detach from the cord.  I am not sure why so I will probably never use that feature.Sound: These headphones sound really good.  They stay clear and crisp at high volumes and get pretty loud.

They are VERY comfortable to wear.  The padding on the ears is just right and there is also some padding on the top. I wore them for a good while and they didn't start hurting like some others do. The cable has a volume control and play/stop button, Mic and it worked perfect with my iPhone (just make sure you plug the right end into your phone).  The cable is also the flat style that doesn't tangle.Sound: Wow.  They sound great.  I listened to an assortment of genres of music and they all sound great.  Everything is so crystal clear and the bass is very nice.  They get very loud and the music still stays perfect at high volumes.  You can hear everything.  I really enjoyed listening to music with them.Cons: The person sitting near you can hear what your listening to if you have it fairly loud, so if your trying to listen to Taylor Swift on the down low people can hear it :)Sample provided in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQELQXYOLYKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R3SQELQXYOLYKX","A1E23CDHJ7U8JA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E23CDHJ7U8JA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After a few episodes I googled it because I thought there was no way this could be a ""true story"".

I am a huge LOTR fan so it took a bit to get past Bilbo Baggins playing the lead, but he is actually a wonderful actor now that I see him playing in something else. Billy Bob Thornton is also really good in this. The story is crazy and will keep you very entertained.  The supporting cast are all very good.  Once you start you won't be able to stop.

I have grown to love King Uther too, he reminds me of the clueless king in the old cartoon Robin Hood movie who sucks his thumb.It is family friendly so any age can watch it, but it is not corny at all.

"Before trying this my only experience was with the cardboard VR viewers.  I have an iPhone 6 plus which was too big to fit in any of the cardboard ones so I always had to kind of just hold my phone up to it ghetto style.When this arrived it comes in a nice box.  When I took it out of the box the glasses looked really nice.  It is lighter than it appears.  The head strap is full adjustable with velcro on the top and the sides.  The part that touches your face is very nicely padded and it is really comfortable to wear.  There are knobs on each side AND and wheel on the top that you can turn to adjust the focus.The back where you insert your phone opens and closes with a magnet closure so all you have to do to open it is pull, but it also stays closed when in use.  Inside there is an adjustable phone holder than you snap your phone into.  Like I said I have an iPhone 6 plus with a case on it and it fit!  It was a pretty tight fit but I got it in there.  Depending on how thick your case is you may need to take it off.Using it was fun.  It is sooooo much better than cardboard.  It is far more comfortable and the ability to focus it makes a big difference. It is a little heavier than cardboard but I think this is more comfortable since it's padded nicely. There is also a cutout on the sides so you can hear your phones speaker while your using it (or for the cord if your using headphones).  Also, there is plastic on the inside lenses, make sure you take it off.  I think these are great for the price and really fun to play with.

"My dog (a yellow lab) has really bad skin allergies in the summer time.  It was so bad the first year he had to go on steroids and his skin was bright red and he scratched himself constantly.  The vet gave me this shampoo and told me to bathe him often.  She told me to lather him up and then leave it on about 30 minutes before rinsing.  It helped tremendously.Now that I know he has allergies, I bathe him frequently with this shampoo to help keep his skin under control.  He does still scratch but it is much more manageable and we have not had to go back to the vet.  This is much cheaper on Amazon than at the vet's office.  I also use the Davis Dog and Cat Chlorhexidine Spray, 4 Percent, 8-Ounce in between baths.Another huge plus is that this is the only shampoo that makes my dog smell good.  I have tried countless shampoos and he is always left smelling like wet dog.  I was shocked the first time I used this because he actually smelled fresh and his fur felt really soft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OXX1G35QIXCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078LOU3W#wasThisHelpful","R2OXX1G35QIXCA","A1E23CDHJ7U8JA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E23CDHJ7U8JA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is 100% organic Ceylon cinnamon. It comes in a resealable bag and contains 4.23 oz.  It is very high quality and you can tell by the taste and aroma. Most cinnamon sold in the United States is the cassia variety. Ceylon cinnamon has a sweeter, more delicate flavor than cassia.  Ceylon is also a healthier choice.  It also contains antioxidants and less of the blood thinning chemical Coumarin.  If you use cinnamon often you should definitely be using Ceylon, and this one is highly recommended.

"This is one of the best turmeric powders I have tried!  It comes in a large resealable bag and contains 4.23 oz.  It is an amazing spice and so healthy for you.  I use it mostly in cooking and it can be added to many dishes (not just curry) including rice, veggies, scrambled eggs, soups, and you can even add it to smoothies!  A really good salad dressing is olive oil, lemon juice, turmeric, and salt + pepper.Another cool thing is you can give it to dogs.  A small amount added to their food has been shown to ward off cancer and other diseases. Make sure to consult a vet to make sure it's right for you of course. Highly recommend Kazu!

"Rejoice, Hermes Press has released another volume of Frank Robbins' Masterpiece Johnny Hazard.  This volume collects four serialized stories starting in May 1949 and going through January 1951.Johnny Hazard is a globe hopping pilot who's adventures are very much in the mode Terry and The Pirates and Steve Canyon. Hazard actually predated Steve Canyon by three years.Frank Robbins style is from the same school as Noel Sickles and Milton Caniff.  He is a little known master who deserves much more attention.This volume is 304 pages in landscape format with two daily strips to a page.  The paper is heavy glossy stock with sharp black printing.  While I found an occasional partial letter missing from a word balloon it is very good reproduction.The page size is smaller then your average strip collection.  But as some have pointed out , the strips are actually the same size as in The Phantom and Buck Rogers collections.  You are just missing lots of white space.  This was done by Hermes Press to make the books in the same price range as the other collections even though they have a reduced demand.""Grob and Shah Sharik"" is the opening epic in this collection.  This story runs about 200 daily strips or nine months. It starts in China and ends in the Middle East.  It introduces a trio of new villains. Grob the portly leader, Slink his Fez wearing right hand man and the Beautiful American Feme Fatale Velvet.Johnny gets mixed up with this trio and their plans to sell planes to Shah Sharik. In the end Velvet ends up helping Johnny and they end up stranded in the desert.Here the pair meet ""Ventro The Great"" for a much smaller 80 strip story.  The story involves a Ventriloquist and bandit raiders.The third story ""Passport To Paradise"" is a taunt 160 strip spy thriller taking place on the road to Burma.  Paradise it turns out is a beautiful Asian woman who cleverly disguises herself at first meeting. Velvet departs at the end of this adventure.The final 80 strip story ""Sadie, The System"" features Johnny and Paradise trying to protect a million dollars in raw diamonds from a pair of European Thiefs.Hermes Press has now completed a little over six years of Daily Comic Strips in Four Volumes.  Since Robbins run was over 30 years their is much more to come including the Sunday's.Hermes Press is a very small publisher so your support is greatly needed if you want to see future volumes. Don't wait to purchase this and the previous volumes.  Robbins stuff deserves to be in print.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DGYOC9EJ8KS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613450974#wasThisHelpful","R3DGYOC9EJ8KS5","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to correct and clarify one of the other erroneous reviews on Amazon, this is not a Hap & Leonard novel or part of that series.  The only thing it shares with those books is the author and a rural setting.This novel is a stand alone novel about a plucky young girl,  seventeen year old Dot Sherman.  Dot works as roller skating car hop for local Dairy Queen knock off , The Dairy Bob.Dot has to come to terms with a few issues like abandonment and rage.  She longs to break out of her Trailer Park life and find a better life.But along the way she must solve a few mysteries.  Why did her father leave one day to get cigarettes and never return ? And who is this previously unknown Uncle that enters her life ?The book also depicts Dot's first exploration into the world of dating plus the formation of a roller derby team.I find it amazing that Joe Lansdale,  writer of ultra violent Men's Adventures can write such a quiet and touching Novel.I read this Novel over the weekend amid reports of Terrorists attacks in Paris, and it was the perfect remedy to brighten my troubled mind in these scary times.  I really hope more people discover this hidden little gem.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJCE5QZ5KWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067179#wasThisHelpful","R3BJCE5QZ5KWM","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was exactly twenty years this month that the first Birds Of Prey special was released in November 1995.  DC Comics seemed unwilling to commit to full fledged series so between 1995 and 1998 a whole slew of one shots , one mini-series and an appearance in the anthology series Showcase 96 all came out.  These all appeared one after another.This 288 page collection is the start of DC's attempt to collect all the Birds appearances in chronological order. The paper is slick and glossy with a card stock cover.Birds Of Prey was created by Chuck Dixon , a top notch Action writer who started by writing the adventures of Airboy for Eclipse Comics.  Gary Frank, current British superstar did the first special and remained on the project by doing all the covers in this collection.  Editor Jordan B. Gorfinkel was the third creator.  He would go on to write their 2nd adventure for Showcase 96.The original team is only the crippled Barbara Gordon former Batgirl now called Oracle.  Plus Dinah Lance , Black Canary.  She is a down on her luck, and recovering from the death of Oliver Queen.The first special was a massive 56 pager from Dixon and Frank.  Gary Frank early art here resembles Steranko and Paul Gulacy.  This excellent start gives us the first globe hopping adventure and brings back Dixon's villainess Lynx.Next is the Showcase adventure which is by Gorfinkel and new artist Jennifer Graves.  The art is rather pedestrian compared to the others in this collection.  It teams Black Canary with Lois Lane.Next up is the Birds Of Prey four issue series called Manhunt.  Chuck Dixon returns and Matt Haley takes over the art.  Haley is another excellent artist. This time Black Canary teams up with The Huntress and Catwoman much to dismay of Oracle.  Lady Shiva also makes an appearance working for the bad guys.The next one shot is called Revolution and it ends in a rift between Oracle and Black Canary.  Dixon teams with Italian artist Stefano Raffaele.The next one shot called Wolves picks up on the continuity from the last book with gals not working together.  This is my favorite story from the collection as Oracle and Black Canary have parallel solo adventures and bad romances.  It nice to see more of Barbara , and especially Barbara in action. The late Dick Giordano penciled the Dixon story.We conclude with the final one shot titled Batgirl.  Since at the time no Batgirl existed in the DC Universe this one will leave you confused until close to the end when an explanation is made.  This story is by Dixon and Greg Land.  Land would be involved with the characters when they finally get their own book in 1999.The second collection is all ready solicited and should be as much fun as this inexpensive volume.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G2OCX0TTZ94K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401258166#wasThisHelpful","R1G2OCX0TTZ94K","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This almost 300 page Trade Paperback collects the seven comics directly leading up to Tim Drake's emergence as Robin. Plus the five issue Robin comic.The character of Tim Drake was created by Marv Wolfman and Pat Broderick in Batman #436 ( 1989).  He was named after Batman director Tim Burton.Unlike most origins, Tim's was plotted very slowly over a period of over a year.  He is mostly just a background character in Dectective and Batman until the four issue run ( collected here) Detective #618 through #621.  This 1990 story ""Rite of Passage"" features Tim's bickering Rich Parents being abducted in Haiti.  Batman sets out to rescue the parents, while Tim longingly looks at the Robin costume in glass case and works unraveling a different domestic crime case with his computer skills. Batman comes back unsuccessful after rescuing them they quickly drink some poisoned water.  Janet Drake dies and Jack Drake is paralyzed.This very dark tale is brought to you by Scottish Writer Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle.  As it turns out Grant and Breyfogle successful run on Detective ended with this saga and they quickly jumped over to the better selling Batman comic.Then the story of Tim is continued in Batman #455 to #457 which is collected next.  This Grant and Breyfogle three issue arc is called ""Identity Crisis"". Clever title.  This story line features Vicky Vale as a reporter in trouble and the villain is The Scarecrow.  Defying Bruce's orders Tim rescues The Batman and is finally rewarded by getting the Robin costume in the final panel.Speaking of the Robin costume this book has a nice bonus in the back of it , eight pages of possible costume designs for Robin.  The winning design was created by Neal Adams.Next comes the five part Main Course the Robin mini-series that debuted a month later from Chuck Dixon and Tom Lyle.  With beautiful covers by England's Brian Bolland.This globe hopping saga starts with Tim in France and ends in Hong Kong.  The main bad guy looks a little dated today with Snake Tattoo on his bare chest and his mullet hair cut.  We also are re-introduced to Lady Shiva , a character who goes back to Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter #5 in 1975.  We are also introduced to morally ambiguous Lynx.This is a great collection and I look forward to the follow up collections announced.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0NG1VB94PGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401258573#wasThisHelpful","R1D0NG1VB94PGJ","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago Dynamite Entertainment realizing the early John Carter books are in public domain started publishing Warlord Of Mars comics not using the name John Carter , but just calling it Warlord Of Mars .  The estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs sued Dynamite.  While the legal results have not been made public,  it has been announced that they are now working with the full cooperation of Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. This book is the results of that newly made agreement.The book was rebooted bringing in long time comic writer Ron Marz.  Marz has a love for the Burroughs characters and was prior to this assignment already writing both The Mucker and Korak for Edgar RIce Burroughs Inc. Online Comic Strips.This Trade Paperback collects the first six issues from the Ongoing John Carter series.  The storyline is called Invaders Of Mars. It involves a nemesis  who John Carter battled during the Civil War.  A Union Officer named Captain Joshua Clark.  Clark through a parallel storyline has now become his own Warlord for a different alien race who want to invade Barsoom (Mars).The art for the book is very good and features a very multi-national flavour as is common with many of Dynamite books.  The excellent interiors (for the first five chapters ) are by Abhishek Malsuni from New Dehli , India.  Chapter Six is from Mexican artist Roberto Castro .  Castro's art is a little bit sketchier but not jaringly different.The cover for this trade is from American Superstar J. Scott Campbell.  With issue #2 Brazilian artist Ed Benes takes over as the main cover artist.  Since this is Dynamite you have an entire slew of variant covers and those are collected in a gallery in the back of this book. Trying to collect all these variants can be pricey and a good incentive to just wait for the trade.This is a very handsome volume and Dynamite's best Warlord Of Mars book yet.  It gets my Highest Recommendation.It has been a very good year for Edgar Rice Burroughs in comics.  I am also recommending the Tarzan newspaper strip collections by Manning , Foster and Hogarth, The excellent adaptations from Sequential Pulp and of course the online comic strips .","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOSJ2QKTSNNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606907565#wasThisHelpful","R2SOSJ2QKTSNNH","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year's first Epic Collection of Moon Knight was a surprise hit for the Epic line.  So now one year later we get a direct sequel.  This collection is again over 500 pages but this time it is all from a two year period 1981 and 1982 when Moon Knight got his own monthly comic.  Collected are Moon Knight #5 through #23 plus the back up stories and related text pieces contained in those issues. The reproduction is equally as good as the first volume and you get a heavy card stock cover once again.  My one complaint about the format is I think the re-coloring done for the cover is too dark and obscures the art.This volume is largely a success because of the skills of two men who do over 90% of this volume.  Doug Moench and Bill Sienkiewicz.Doug Moench is Moon Knight's co-creator who brought him to life in Werewolf by Night #32 as a foe for the Werewolf.  While some of his early 1970's writing was a little pretentious and over written by the time Moon Knight got his own book he was really at the top of his game doing some excellent work.  His storylines are very diverse and non-repetitive.Young Bill Sienkiewicz was actually brought to Marvel by his mentor Neal Adams who recommended him to the Editor Archie Goodwin.  Sienkiewicz worked on the Moon Knight backups in the Rampaging Hulk Magazine. They served as just the right forum to get him noticed.  He quickly emerged as a fan favorite artist.Sienkiewicz inks about half of his stories and they are beautiful and my preference.  Frank Giacoia inks one issue and is a poor fit destroying the intricate line work. Steve Mitchell is very good and Klaus Janson is excellent.Moon Knight for those unfamiliar with the character had four separate and distinct personalities.  Marc Spector the Mercenary who started it all.  Marc Spector gets his own back up stories in this volume.  They read like a cross between paperback novels featuring the Destroyer and Indiana Jones.Steven Grant the suave, rich Playboy from the Bruce Wayne mold. Jake Lockely the gritty Taxi Driver and Moon Knight himself.  The personalities are so different it is a borderline personality disorder.Moench develops an excellent supporting cast also.  Marlene Alraune is his girl Friday who keeps it all together.  Jean-Paul DuChamp called ""Frenchy"" is a skilled Helicopter Pilot.  Plus the civilian friends of Jake Lockely like Betrand Crowley .  Crowley is a highly intelligent homeless man.  Gena Landers is greasy spoon waitress who also aides on occasion with or without her sons.With issue #15 the comic became a Direct Sales only comic. These comics where not sold in other sources then comic book shops and were not returnable.  Moon Knight was a very successful Direct Sales Comic.  This meant generally several things.  First stories aimed for an older adult audience.  While Moench's Moon Knight stories seemed aimed at adults since the Black and White magazines, now he no longer had the Comics Code to contend with.  The price was increased from 50 cents to 75 cents and the kid aimed advertising disappeared.  That meant the story pages went from 22 pages an issue to 28 pages.  Moon Knight #20 and #23 featured extra long stories but the other seven issues included here either had text back up features or related back up stories.This book is actually even better then the first volume and comes highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLK0K95DGAYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785198105#wasThisHelpful","R2MLK0K95DGAYM","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The creator's of this book say it was inspired by Buffy The Vampire Slayer but the book seems more like a young Japanese Supernatural version of the X-Men.Written by Jim Zubkavich know as Jim Zub.  He is the Canadian writer of Skull Kickers . The art is by American artist Steven Cummings.  Cummings beautiful Anime inspired art is what turns this project into a 5 Star ratings for me.This beautiful Hard Cover is oversized and comes loaded with so many extras you might want to double dip even if he have all the issues or both trades.  This collection is 300 pages long.  It includes the first 10 issues of the Wayward comic plus all the multiple covers and variant covers.  Also you get a ton of Character sketches and pre-production art work. Plus a 34 page lavishly illustrated text article on the back ground of the characters and Japanese Myths that this book uses.  And then finally a giant five page fold out poster which came tipped in the book.  This is a ton of value added bonus material.The story for for you total newbies is about Rori Lane a girl of mixed descent.  She has been staying with her father in Ireland but when the book opens she is returning to Toyko to be with her mother.The first five issues form a small arc about Rory discovering her own powers and meeting other youths with similar supernatural powers.  At the end of the first five issues a big battle takes place with results in Rori as well as another of her friends disappearing from Toyko.The second five issues opens three months later with entirely new character named Ohara Emi a perfect Japanese School Girl .  She of course also has powers. Eventually she meets some of Rori's friends.  Meanwhile we find out what happened with Rori and by the end of issue ten all our Heroes have met and come together with a mission statement.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33DIFY91GETWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632154730#wasThisHelpful","R33DIFY91GETWR","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Corben is one of those working masters of American Comics who doesn't get neatly the recognition he deserves.  For almost 50 years Richard Corben has been doing some of the best of Science Fiction , Fantasy and Horror Comics in the Industry.Now Dark Horse collects his newest work a five issue mini-series released early in 2015 now collected in this inexpensive (under $20) Beautiful Hard Cover collection which features all the covers plus pre-production sketches and other material.  Corben is assisted by his daughter Beth Corben Reed who did much of the air brush coloring.While the date of the story is never given it appears to be set in the 1920's. It is set in the winter in Massachusetts.  The lead protagonist is named Clark Elwood , a racist and self-absorbed college student.  Clark falls for a odd looking but voluptuous young woman at the college.  When Clark finds her doing nude modeling she flees back to her back woods home town named Lame Dog.  Once Clark reaches the town things turn horrifically gruesome.The stories features all the Corben Standards with Nudity, Sex , Violence and Horror.  The story successfully mixes the Native American legends and mythos with that of H P Lovecraft.  This book is definitely not recommend for children.I hope some day Richard Corben returns to his ground breaking legendary series DEN and we get a comprehensive Hard Cover Collection, but in the meantime enjoy his latest creation.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSXFU1K2KEH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616557699#wasThisHelpful","RYSXFU1K2KEH6","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I originally thought Jet Powers was a Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers clone he is actually more of Doc Savage character since he lives in the present day ( the 1950's) rather then in the future. His subtitle is ""Man Of Science"". He is a scientist, an inventor as well as an explorer and adventurer.  He lives in a underground laboratory cavern in the American South West desert Mesa.  He has a distinctive white crew cut hair and a chiseled face.  He resembled actor Jeff Chandler.Jet Powers appeared in a mere four issues of his own comic which was simply entitled Jet.  Each issue had three separate stories.  After the end of that book Jet Powers was simply repurposed as an Air Force pilot in the Korean War.  This Comic was called The American Air Forces and was published in 1951 to 1953.  Jet had a story in six of eight issues published and these war stories are also included.This is companion book to the Cave Girl volume published in 2014.  It was published by Dark Horse and put together by their Kitchen Sink Imprint.  It is a quality Hard Cover but slightly over priced for only 168 pages.  It has excellent introduction and afterwards by John Wooley and James Vance. The other introduction by Steve Rude is rather pointless since he had never even heard of the character before being asked to write an Introduction.The publishers have once more decided to use the tan paper to give it the realistic look of a comic of that era.  I would have preferred white paper like a Marvel Masterwork.  The color restoration is slightly better then the Cave Girl volume where the quality for a couple stories were inferior to the rest.  The restoration is much better then the color Xerox's of say PS Artbooks,  but no where as good as a Marvel Masterwork. All the dot matrix coloring has been converted to solid colors and the bleeding over the line blotches have been removed.Bob Powell art is excellent here and he really excels at the Science Fiction settings. This art is comparable to the excellent EC comics work done by Wally Wood and Al Williamson. His knowledge of then current Air Craft and Military equipment saves the rather generic later done War Stories from being a disappointment.The writing is thought to be the work of then M.E. Comics workhorse Gardner Fox. Fox also did most the other recent collections of M.E. Comics like Thunda, Ghost Rider and Cave Girl.There is some speculation that Powell have written, co-written or plotted some of these stories.  Regardless they are superior to the above listed efforts.  While these stories are totally zanny and unbelievable they are intricately plotted with a lot happening in each story.  The stories all run a mere seven to ten pages each.In the very first episode we meet the evil Mr. Sinn who is unfortunately a racist Yellow Peril stereotype.  Dr. Sinn has created a machine which is causing worldwide Earthquakes and massive destruction. It is up to Jet Powers and his Graviton Gun to save the day.The stories run the gamut from Alien Invasion, Time Travel , Giant Grasshoppers, Robot's gone wild and Animals on the loose.  Jet also gets involved in war between the friendly Martians and The Evil Venusians. In one of the most startling stories a Radioactive Death Dust settles on the earth killing most of the population before Jet Powers can invent a remedy for the survivors.The book has a tighter continuity then you would expect for a book published in 1951 .  Not only do villains reappear but some stories are direct sequels to others.  The Martian War and The Death Dust stories both get a follow up story.The only other major re-occuring character is the beautiful Su Shan.  She is of Asian decent and modeled after Milton Caniff's Dragon Lady. Su Shan and Jet Powers have a very bizarre relationship. She appears in the very first episode as Dr. Sinn's assistant. When Dr. Sinn throws her out of his plane, Jet rescues her.  In the next couple episodes she appears to be being held in Jet's underground laboratory against her will. Twice she tries to leave and return to Dr. Sinn.  When Jet rescues her the for a third time she starts kissing him and now they are boyfriend and girlfriend.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWCM9V73TABF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616557648#wasThisHelpful","R3OWCM9V73TABF","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Your enjoyment of this book will depend on your love of Jack Kirby and your expectations of this book.What you won't get is any complete Kirby Comic stories, any never seen or never published art.  Or even any real information on the life of man besides superficial information that most of us are already aware of.What you do get is a beautiful art book crammed with covers, splash pages and pin-ups done by Jack ""The King "" Kirby done for Marvel Comics during his three stays at Marvel.The book is done on High Quality glossy paper stock .  It is a beautiful Hard Cover done in the Landscape ( wider then tall ) 240 pages that all fit in a classy Heavy Duty slip case.In preparation for this review I did something that I expect few will do with this type of book.  I read it cover to cover.  The writing is by John Rhett Thomas who really does little except introduce each chapter and provide complete credits for every cover and splash page .  Sometimes he also provides a sentence or two talking about the art or the importance of a story.The book is set up chronologically into six chapters.  Chapter One is Jack Kirby and Joe Simon: Timely's Golden Age.  This focuses on Captain America and The Vision,  but does include many of the other great covers he did during this era.Chapter Two Monsters And Cowboys: Jack Kirby And The Atlas Era focuses on the time he became Stan Lee's main muse after the death of Joe Manleey in 1959.  He did a few stories starting in 1956, but starting in 1959 through his departure in 1970 his production was phenomenal.This is the subject on my favorite chapter November 1961: The Month That Changed Marvel.  This of course is the month that Jack illustrated the 25 page Fantastic Four #1 and it's cover.  But here the focus is on that book and the twelve other stories and nine other covers he also did that month.  Monsters, Superheroes, Westerns and Romances,  all total 119 pages for that month alone.The next chapter is massive since it covers The Marvel Age: King Kirby. This is his superhero work from 1961 to 1970. Since it runs 150 pages each character gets his own sub-chapter.  The Fantastic Four, Ant-Man /Giant-Man and The wasp, The Hulk,  Spider-Man,  Iron-Man, Thor, The Avengers, Captain America, X-Men, Sgt. Fury, Nick Fury, Sub-Mariner, Silver Surfer, Ka-Zar, Inhumans and even Not Brand Echh.Chapter Six is The Return Of The King and deals with the three years when Jack returned after his DC Comics stay.  Again we get sub-chapters with Captain America, The Eternals, Black Panther, Machine Man and Devil Dinosaur.  I assume no copyright agreement could be reached so we are sadly missing any art for 2001.The final chapter is a very short reminiscence by Neal Kirby, his son.  While this is entertaining it is very brief (four pages with illustrations) and might have just been included as an afterward rather then an entire chapter.We also get an Introduction by Joe Quesada.  Plus sprinkled in through the volume are small sidebar stories from a multitude of Comic Creators. These include John Cassaday, Mark Bagley, Alan Weiss, Ryan Stegman, Michael Allred, Ramon K. Perez, Steve Rude, Dan Jurgens, Karl Kessel, Keith Giffen, Sal Buscema, Terry Austin, Nick Bradshaw, Klaus Janson,  Rick Remember, Tom Scoli, Rich Buckler and Andy Lanning.  These are very brief and talk about the time they met Kirby or what Kirby meant to them.  The name quite obviously missing from the list above is one Stan Lee.If you want deep insight into the man this is not your book. But if you just want to look at a collection of beautiful art work then this comes Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X4V6AGN5UD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785197931#wasThisHelpful","R32X4V6AGN5UD1","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With very little fanfare the American Comics Library has brought out this sequel to the excellent Five Volume set of the much adored run of Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson.In 1980 the strip was offered to George Evans , a life time comic illustrator who had helped Al Williamson on occasions Ghost Illustrate some of the previous run. Evans would pick up the baton and write and illustrate the strip for sixteen additional years until his retirement in 1996. It was then decided to cancel the strip rather then look for a successor.George Evans started in comic books in 1947 working for the publisher Fiction House.  When working for DC he frequently turned down chances to work on superhero comics believing it not to be a good fit for his realistic style.His most famous comic work was in the 1950's working for EC Comics.  His work on their Aces High Comic is brilliant and reflects his life long love of airplanes.  In the 60's he spent a decade ghosting for George Wunder's Terry & The Pirates.Since this work was done at both the twilight of George's career and the death of daily Adventure Comic Strips it has been seen by very few and ran in a only select few newspapers.Both George Evans and this last hurrah for Secret Agent Phil Corrigan deserve a much wider audience and appreciation.As of right now there has been no announcement of a follow-up offering.  I suspect like the similar John Prentice volumes of Rip Kirby as long as they sell enough another will follow.  Sadly some of these experiments do not have as much such success like the Dick Moore run on Gasoline Alley.  So it is important for comic strip fans to support this volume now.This comic strip started in 1934 as follow up to the success of Dick Tracy.  The inaugural creators selected for this project are Flash Gordon artist Alex Raymond and the father of Hard Boiled Detective Fiction , Dashiell Hammett. IDW has just released that volume this past May and you can read my overly kind review for it also on Amazon.  Beautiful art , but poor writing.This collection features two and a half years of large daily strips reproduced in crisp black and white on heavy stock paper.  Three strips to the page on large landscape size.The strips in this collection are a blend of action, adventure spy stories with two outright Science Fiction tales throw in to my surprise and delight. Most of the storylines run a compact fifteen or so weeks. I know most of the Comic Syndicates at the time much preferred this.While decades earlier Phil Corrigan was married off. His wife  Wilda was rarely used in the Goodwin/ Williamson era and now is gone entirely.  She seems to be entirely written out of the strip  and Corrigan has numerous female companions. Anna Kreemar is the Chief's niece introduced in George Evans's second storyline.  She is beautiful but spoiled. They have a love/hate relationship.  Anna appears in about half of the storylines collected here and is the only other re-occuring character besides the now nameless Chief who dishes out his assignments. Phil Corrigan started his career working for the U.S. Government but in the 60's and 70's it became an unknown organization.  Now it is the 80's and George Evans decides it is OK for Corrigan's employers to be the government again.The adventures criss cross the globe and George Evans likes to use made up countries with obvious real world analogs rather then offend anyone.In Evan's very first story we get a story about a man who holds an entire town hostage with the claim he can set fire to all the water in the town.  Especially chilling is the tale about a group of young cult like members in Hawaii and the deadly weapon they invent called the Nothing Bomb.The two Science Fiction stories mentioned earlier involve a young boy who discovers an alien in a rural town in first story. And then a story about a artificial life called the Emperor taking over Phil's agency and gaining control over the agents.In all the stories are very diverse and entertaining.  The story about an avant garde troupe of entertainers and Anna's desire to sing brings lots of humour to the mix.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9H30ZUU0391/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631404199#wasThisHelpful","R3M9H30ZUU0391","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Adventure novel was first serialized in six issues of the great Argosy Pulp Magazine in 1930 and 1931 and has never been reprinted before.  That is too bad , because it is rip-roaring good story.The novel was written by Fred MacIsaac who was a favorite of Argosy readers and would go on to create the character of The Rambler who regularly appear in Dime Detective.The Novel is printed in large easy to read print in and features a cover painting by Paul Stahr and all the orginal six illustrations from the Pulp Magazine.  This is part of the Altus Press first ten books in their new Argosy Library.It is my third book read in this series and like the previous two I devoured they are excellent. They have been doing a great job of selecting neglected classics.Balata the novel's title referrers to a kind of very durable rubber discovered in South America.  Today Balata is still used and is they key ingredient in quality golf balls.  In 1930 the Rubber trade had moved from South America to the cheaper Asian countries, but then the discovery of Balata started a get rich boom similar to the Gold Rush.Young Pete Holcomb's career was not working out the way he planned so Pete agrees to follow his rich college buddy Les Gorman down to explore his Balata claim in the Amazon Jungles.  Gorman's beautiful but rugged sister Louise insisted on going. Also hired is World renowned explorer Felix Dexter. These four form the core of the party and a love triangle also develops.They must build boats and hire crew and porters,  meanwhile a very greedy rubber Plantation owner will stop at nothing to stop their deadly trip.They also must face danger with the Jungle's nasty creatures and Cannibal Natives.  At one point our hero finds himself separated from the party and forced to live among the cannibals.This is a non-stop fun action, adventure romp with a little politics and romance thrown in to flavour it.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID94LAS5ODED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618271830#wasThisHelpful","R1ID94LAS5ODED","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been waiting decades for The Burroughs Estate to authorize a new Tarzan Novel.  It is my belief that they have selected the perfect author.  Will Murray's continuation of Doc Savage has been a ton of fun.This new novel brings us back to one of my favorite Lost World Civilizations Pal-ul-don.  We meet both old friends and new ones in this delightful romp.The creation of the Turtle People is great addition to the Burroughs Universe.  The same with the majestic elephant Torn Ear.I was both upset and discouraged to see a couple ""haters"" who gave this book a bad review then appear to be then give reviewers ""unhelpful "" votes.  Don't listen to these few negative individuals and spend some time immersed in world of your favorite jungle Lord.Just a reminder the Hardcover can be ordered from LuLu and I will be ordering a second copy because the Hardcover contains the expanded wrap around cover from Joe Devito and an additional short story.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDBJWN737Q68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618272098#wasThisHelpful","R2SDBJWN737Q68","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel was serialized in the Pulp magazine Argosy in 1937.  It is not a bad Lost World novel.  The story follows Hugh Lambert who is heading a Boy's Camp.  Soon he discovers the mystery of the little people who live under the lake Wanooka.You get a bit of a love triangle , as well as meeting two different competing Aquatic cultures.The book is put together using various different story telling tools like Medical Reports , News Articles as well as the Journal of Hugh Lambert.  This is an attempt to make it seem factual.This review is of the physical audio CD set rather then the digital download.I have enjoyed quite a few of these Radio Archives Audio Books and they suffer from a couple problems.  First off it would be nice if they either had a very large pause or the narrator would  simply tell you when the C.D. is over, as they are they would immediately start the CD over before I realized it.Second while narrator Milton Bagby has a decent voice it is very limited.  He has a voice that makes you think both Rural and Ancient.  So listening I kept imagining every character as the same type of person,  all Old Farmers, which is not what they are.I am sure I would have enjoyed the book more by simply reading it.Still worth a listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPCOF9UBS1MYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9KFUDG#wasThisHelpful","RPCOF9UBS1MYV","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thick tome collects most of the earliest adventures of Marvel's second Kung-Fu series starting in 1974 with eleven issues in Marvel Premiere continuing with his fifteen issue solo series from 1975 to 1977 and winding up with two issues of Marvel Team-Up from 1977 Marvel Team-Up #63 and #64.  All total 28 comics are included making it a whopping 528 pages.The cover is a durable cardboard stock and the printing is crisp with bright vibrant colors.Now comes my real only complaint and if anyone knows Marvel's explanation please leave a comment here.  This volume does not include any of Iron-Fist's black and white appearances from Deadly Hands Of Kung-Fu magazine done during this time period.  The Moon Knight volume does include them but maybe only because they where later colored and released in a comic format.  Regardless I can understand that decision, but not the decision to totally exclude the two crossovers books Marvel Team-Up #31 (1975) and Marvel Two-In-One #25 (from 1977 ). Both of these feature Iron Fist in a lead role. Granted these are both rather weak stories and are not needed to enjoy this volume. I just thought these volumes would be comprehensive including all major appearances.Iron Fist was the brain child of then current Editor-in-chief Roy Thomas and his friend Gil Kane.  His origin story takes place in Marvel Premiere #15 and #16. The text page from Marvel Premiere # 15 should have probably been included since it explains how they were inspired by Bill Everett's creation of Amazing Man.  Roy explained in an interview that he was already a fan of Kung-Fu movies even prior to Bruce Lee and thought the name Iron Fist would make a great hero.  With Stan Lee's O.K. they proceeded.  Gil Kane's  Iron Fist costume is a knock out and has varied very little over the years.Gil Kane who had divorce related money problems and never stayed on a book long and preferred to just do covers where the page rate was higher.  That is why Gil departed after just one issue but did the majority of the covers included in this collection.  Rounding out the debut was Dick Giordano one of the best inkers in the business.  Giordano would ink the first five issues.But Roy didn't stick around long himself as Marvel Premiere #16  was only plotted by Roy and then scripted by Len Wein.  That same issue featured the debut of new penciler Larry Hama.  G.I. Joe main writer Hama actually started as a penciler.  Hama was actually either a very good penciler or Dick Giordano just did magic on the next four issues because they look pretty good.The Origin story had always puzzled me because they seem to be setting up a great nemesis in the form of Harold Meachum.  He is responsible for the deaths of both Danny Rand's parents.  So I naturally thought he would become the ultimate bad guy and they would spend their days battling. In Marvel Premiere #17 and # 18 new writer Doug Moench takes over and decides to flip the script so instead when Danny seeks revenge he finds Harold had lost his legs and is confined to a wheelchair.  Next Harold is quickly murdered by an unknown assailant.In Moench's last issue Marvel Premiere #19 we get the introduction of Colleen Wing and her archaeologist father Professor Wing.Marvel Premiere #20 to #23 introduces a whole new creative team who last for three issues.  Tony Isabella as writer and Arvell Jones on pencils.  While Mr. Jones' early pencils here are rather we weak  , one neat thing this team tried to incorporate is showing us real Kung-fu moves in the stories. This of course only lasted the three issues.  In Marvel Premiere #20 Isabella has Iron Fist face his first regular Marvel villain as Batroc The Leaper made a great foil for Iron Fist.  Isabella also introduces Danny's love interest and lady with a bionic arm , Misty Knight.Finally in Marvel Premiere #23 we get some consistency.  This is Iron Fist's ninth issue and fifth new writer.  Chris Claremont would stay on the book for the remaining 20 issues. Claremont's writing seems to evolve and get better and better as it continues.Marvel Premiere # 23 and #24 featured art by new artist Pat Broderick. MP #23 introduces a new villain Warhawk while MP #24 brings back Monstroid, a lame villain from Marvel Team-Up #5.  Broderick's art is actually quite nice but according to reports he missed his deadline and was fired off the book by John Verpoorten production manager.  Broderick went on to become a mainstay on such books as Micronauts and Firestorm.In Marvel Premiere #24 we are introduced to a Chris Claremont tradition, heroes relaxing by playing softball.  The little bearded fellow on page 184 is Claremont himself.  Can anyone name the entire Bullpen staff on the top of page 185 ?  The only one I am sure of is Roy Thomas on the far right.John Verpooten then hired John Byrne for his very first regular Marvel assignment.  John Byrne started with Iron Fist's final appearance in Marvel Premiere which was #25 and continued for the next 18 issues.Claremont and Bryne together and separately would become the key components of the success of Marvel for an era starting in the late 1970's and extending until the mid 1980's.  And Iron Fist is the book where they really started to put it all together.One interesting footnote here is in both the Iron Fist's Marvel Premiere run and his solo book's runs both books seem to yo-yo back in forth in frequency from Monthly to Bi-Monthly switching up every couple months.Marvel Premiere #25 features the villain Angar the Screamer and leads directly into Iron Fist #1.  This also starts a long storyline about the abduction of Colleen Wing.  An appearance by Iron-Man kicks of Iron Fist #1.The quest to rescue Colleen continues til issue #7 and includes the new nemesis Master Khan.In Iron Fist #8 to #10 meets Chaka Crime Lord of New York and gets framed for a crime. The artist pictured on page 343 is John Byrne himself.John Byrne is partially color blind.  He said he had been doing the book for over a year before some one told him Iron Fist's  costume was actually Green and Yellow.  He saw it as Brown and Yellow.In Iron Fist #11 and #12 the Wrecking Crew are loose and Iron Fist needs the help of Captain America to put them away again. This one has yet another cameo next to Matt Murdoch on page 398 are editors Jim Shooter and Roger Stern.Then in Iron Fist #13 and #14 we get a glance of things to come with an X-Men crossover.  I love the fact that Misty Knight and Jean Grey are roommates.Iron Fist  #15 starts a story about the Steel Dragon , the son of the man who trained Danny Rand.  When the book was canceled the storyline picked up two months later in the pages of Marvel Team-Up #63 and #64.Marvel Team-Up #64 actually is labelled a Spider-Man and Daughters Of The Dragon crossover.  It was covered dated December 1977 the same month that John Byrne became the new regular penciler on X-Men.This is a super fun collection especially when Claremont and Bryne take over.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DL0983B6QGNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519164X#wasThisHelpful","R3DL0983B6QGNL","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canton Street Press is a new small publisher of archival comic book material.  They are the former owners of the online comic retailer Tales Of Wonder.  I own both of their previous two collections and was quite an advocate for them.This collection reprints the now public domain comic material from the Magazine Enterprises Ghost Rider comics #1 to #5 in their entirety.  Plus you get the first four appearances of Ghost Rider from Tim Holt #11 to #14.  All of these originally dated from 1949 to 1951.The book was produced in a quality format with good quality paper and a sewn binding. While some restoration has been done, it quite frankly is not up to even the quality of the first two books Canton Street Press has produced.  My overall feeling is it is that it is all too dark and could have been greatly improved with just lightening it up some more.  If you don't have a problem with quality of the PSArtbooks editions you shouldn't be too disappointed.  Because it is of a similar calibre.  One clue I can find for this decline in restoration quality is the publishers said in an a recent interview that this had been done for a couple years and had just been put on hold.  Perhaps it even pre-dates the earlier work.My other complaint about the book is the giant leap in price point.  The Airboy was $24.99 then Canteen Kate was $28.99 now this is $49.99.  That is quite a price jump.Tony Isabella gives a fun and informative introduction. That introduction is dated April 2013.  More proof that this material was put together much earlier.Even though the Tim Holt comics are older then the Ghost Rider comics they are in the back of the book.  The only reason I can think for this is both Tim Holt #11 and the first story in Ghost Rider #1 tell the same origin story.  This way you read the better, more defining origin first.US Marshal Rex Fury was secretly Calico Kid appearing in earlier issues of Tim Holt Comics , but suddenly with Tim Holt  #11 Rex stopped being the Calico Kid and adopted an entirely new identity as the Ghost Rider.  None of the earlier Calico Kid adventures are included , nor are all the Ghost Rider stories from Tim Holt Comics included.  In fact we have material enough for three or four more like sized volumes.  Since this is only volume one , we can hope for more.Sing-Song the racist Asian stereotype is his faithful sidekick.  He also had the same role for the Calico Kid.  Sing-Song  is actually there for more then just comedy relief as he becomes more of a full partner and helps save the day in some stories.Ray Krank is credited with writing the first Ghost Rider story but most of the others have all been credited to Gardner Fox . Gardner Fox's importance in comics history is closely identified with his work done during the Silver Age of DC Comics.The stories themselves all vary in writing quality but all run a compact six to eight pages.  More story often happens in six pages of these, then in six issues of a current comic.Another thing to remember are these stories are pre-code comics.  For example in the story from Tim Holt #11 it opens with Rex being worked over by some evil American Indians. Our Hero's face is depicted with numerous cuts and blood streaming down his face.  That same story closes with evil Indian being impaled with a jagged wagon wheel spoke.The non-cover artwork is all the work of Dick Ayers.  Ayers of course is remembered for his Sgt. Fury and his other early Marvel work.  In 1967 Marvel brought back the western Ghost Rider but changed his alias to Carter Slade.  Dick Ayers also illustrated that version of Ghost Rider drawing him exactly the same.  While Magazine Enterprises was long dead, I am not sure wether Marvel was in their legal rights to do that.Frank Frazetta is one of the main reasons collectors first sought out this material . The Frazetta covers for Ghost Rider #2 to #5 are all included and a big selling point.I am really hoping we get another volume and really hoping the restoration improves.  Because this is really fun material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TGHFTDY3KM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934044040#wasThisHelpful","R6TGHFTDY3KM8","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This recent trade paperback includes all the first appearances of Scott Lang as Ant Man in his first three years in comics.  From the years 1979 to 1982.  In total eleven full comics and two small snippets of a story in which Lang makes a mere cameo. The eleven full comics consist of the two issues of the Marvel Premiere debut, four issues of Iron-Man ,three issues of The Avengers and an issue each of Marvel Team-Up and Marvel Two-In-One.If you want to know more about Hank Pym pick up the Ant Man / Giant Man Epic Collection.  But for your Scott Lang fix you need to start here.David Michelinie wrote every single appearance here of Scott Lang except one and deserves all the credit here for molding that character into the form everyone recognizes today.  Most early superheroes where all pretty cookie cutter similar.  But Scott Lang was certainly different , being an ex-convict and a single father of a nine year old daughter.The collection starts out with a four page snippet from Avengers #181 which appeared one month before his costumed debut.  Basically Tony Stark hires Scott Lang to put in a new security system in the Avengers Mansion.Marvel Premiere #47 and #48 is Scott Lang's debut and origin as Ant-Man.  David Michelinie and the great John Byrne on pencils. Scott is released from a three year stint in Prison.  Unlike the movie no attempt is made to ""soft sell "" his crimes.  He was a burglar and now he is going straight.  The Handbook entry in the back of the book says Scott is divorced but no mentions anex-wife. But she is not seen or mentioned in this story.  Cassie is 9 years old and has been staying with Scott's sister until he is released from Jail.While he intends to follow the straight and narrow path he soon discovers Cassie has some serious Heart conditions.  The one specialist who has a chance of fixing Cassie, Dr. Sondheim is abducted by Cross Technologies.Scott steals the Ant-Man suit from Hank Pym and breaks into Cross Technologies to rescue the doctor.  CEO Darren Cross also has heart conditions but his treatment had transformed him into a pink brutish Hulk.  After everything is resolved Hank Pym (now Yellowjacket ) gives Scott his blessings to continue.Next we get another snippet cameo from Iron-Man #125 .  Scott Lang now working for Stark Industries breaks back into Ryker's Island prison to get something for his boss.In Iron-Man #131 to #134 we get a three part story.  Michelinie and Jerry Bingham on pencils.  Dr. Sondheim and Tony Stark are trying to capture and cure The Hulk in the first two parts.  After the Hulk battle fries Tony's armored suit Ant-Man spends all of #134 inside the suit making repairs.Next is Avengers #195 and #196 a two part story by Michelinie and  legend George Perez.  The story teams up Ant-Man with Yellowjacket and the Wasp. This story introduces the Taskmaster who would become Scott Lang's Arch-nemisis and appear in four issues in this collection. The Taskmaster had the ability to mimic any skill or agility he merely witnessed.  He also heads a school for henchmen in training.In Marvel Team-Up #103 by Michelinie and Jerry Bingham (again) the Taskmaster returns and demonstrates to his Henchmen Class how is it is easy to take down Spider-Man.  But Scott must save the day.In Iron-Man #152 by Michelinie and Luke McDonnell Stark Industries comes under attack.  This is almost an Ant-Man solo story since Iron-Man only appears on a page and a half.Marvel Two-In-One #87 ( the only non Michelinie story ) is by Tom DeFalco and Ron Wilson.  When the The Thing goes to a sub-atomic world Ant-Man is called in for a rescue.Avengers #223 is the final story it is by Michelinie and Greg Larocque.  Hawkeye and Ant-Man team up when it is discovered a carnival had been taken over by a secret villain.  Could it be the Taskmaster yet again ?While I believe the list price is a little steep for a 232 page collection. I can't deny this is some great writing and art and a great way to discover or rediscover this material.So, buy this book , then go see the movie again.  It will make it all the more fun.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXCR5ARLC89E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192662#wasThisHelpful","R1PXCR5ARLC89E","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This handsome oversized trade paperback reprints the almost lost novel of Lester Dent.  Lester Dent was the co-creator and main writer of Doc Savage who's adventures were attributed to Kenneth Robeson , a house name.This long novel was serialized in six parts in the high class pulp magazine Argosy from November 1937 to January 1938.  This novel has sadly never been reprinted since it's inaugural appearance.  Also restored for the first time is a chapter and a half of material accidentally not printed by the publisher.This edition is volume one in Altus Press exciting new Argosy Library reprinting the best of Argosy.  So far ten books have been printed all of equal quality.  This edition features the original Rudolph Belarski cover painting and all the original illustrations done for the pulp version.It also features an excellent introduction by Pulp Historian and Doc Savage current writer Will Murray.  Plus in the back we get Dent's outline for the second never written Genius Jones novel.According to Will Murray in the summer of 1936 the publishers of Doc Savage Street & Smith were planning on the magazine going to a twice a month frequency.  When those plans were put on hold they then had two years worth of stories and Dent was given a reprieve.  So Dent set out to break into the high paying Argosy marketplace.  Which he did with a couple smaller stories and this lone novel.  After six months Street & Smith once more came knocking, and more Doc Savage meant Dent would never return to this equally deserving creation.Genius Jones is the story of a stoic pulp hero raised in the arctic wilderness to superhuman ability who enters the world of 1930's New York with screwball comedic results.Polar Jones and his young son are part of an arctic expedition. When World War I breaks out the German member of the expedition poisons everyone including himself but not young Jones.  Raised by one half crazed member who survived for awhile,  Jones grows up living on seal meat and reading encyclopedias.When they first try to rescue the muscular giant off an iceberg he shoots the rescuer because the man is a German and Jones doesn't know the war has ended.The second attempt is made by Polyphemus Ward one of the ugliest and richest men in the world.  Ward is looking for a successor to give a way his Millions after he is gone.  He has a test for Genius Jones first.  Jones must give away $100,000 to one thousand deserving impoverished individuals.The cast of regulars for this adventure includes Genius Jones new best friend Funny Pegger, a portly comedy writer and Vix, a ravishing red headed girl Friday.For antagonists we have the evil Lyman Lee , Ward's second in command who thinks Ward's fortunes should be his.  Plus Glacia the knockout, voluptuous blonde who is a first rate Gold Digger.  Since Jones has never even met a female trouble ensues.We get a lot of ""fish out of water"" style comedy , but often Dent sneaks in some sly social commentary.  Dent really is a quite skilled writer and this whole story moves quickly and makes you eager for more.It's too bad Hollywood never encountered this material it would have made a great Scewball Comedy under the direction of Frank Capra or one of his peers.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEA4BVH9BFK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618271822#wasThisHelpful","RHEA4BVH9BFK7","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a combination of a European high art graphic novel and an American Superhero book.  I believe this book was first printed in France for the European market in 2014, now it has been translated and printed in a style resembling the European Album format by Image Comics.The book itself is gorgeous Hard Cover with a sewn binding and large oversized pages. The European style uses much larger original art and is reproduced much larger.  Most pages therefore contain many more panels and story then an American comic.  So if you reduce it you do the album's art a great disservice.  Thankfully we get the large size here.French writer Xavier Dorison is well known in the Franco-Belgian comic art scene.  His Long John Silver series has drawn raves and he was recently selected as new writer for the legendary barbarian series Thorgal.  Dorison has also done screen writing and film work.Terry and Rachel Dodson are renowned American artists.  They have been all over the Industry working on the top books.  Along with Adam Hughes and Frank Cho, they are considered the best artists in business who can draw beautiful woman.  Terry Dodson pencils and colors, while wife Rachel inks with her very smooth ink brush technique .  Their current Marvel contract allows them to also work in the European market.  Their first effort was for Les Humanoids Muse.It is 1977 and Soviet Superspy Vera Yelnikov has a secret mission, go to the USA and become a Superhero.  She goes to Hollywood and becomes a driver and assistant to a sleazy American Director.  She even has an American secret identity as Alabama Jones.  Because really, who could tell the difference between a southern red neck and a soviet agent .On her first mission she must defeat a right wing moral zealot called The Carpenter.  The Carpenter fights the moral decay by murdering those more liberal then him and literally nailing the offenders down.Although that description sounds pretty brutal , this book is mostly light hearted and PG-13 rated.  Vera appears to have a high sex drive but that action all happens off screen.The Red One's costume is a skin tight red leather outfit which was deliberately created too small so that we see ample cleavage.  For weapons she brandishes a matching Hammer and Sickle made from special alloys.The back pages give us pre-production illustrations and ideas.  In early  incarnations she was known as both The Red Widow and Red Skin.Now for my very minor complaint.  The story is continued.  So please, please purchase this beautiful book so that we get more.  It is priced at a mere $16.99 and you can find it for much cheaper.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSUC3GZ9NM7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632154005#wasThisHelpful","RYSUC3GZ9NM7J","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Donald Westlake became an iconic writer as Richard Stark the writer of the Parker Novels.

"I write this on the eve of the multi million dollar big screen debut of Ant Man. This Epic Collection of course is timed to hit right before the movie.  It is a lavish 448 pages of fun reprinting the very earliest adventures of Hank Pym as both Ant Man and then as Gaint Man. All of these stories are from the pages are from Tales To Astonish and first appeared in 1962 to 1964.  In all you get 26 Hank Pym stories , 8 of the Tales Told By the Wasp stories and the behind the scenes Let's Learn About Hank and Jan Back Up.  All under a durable cardboard cover.I read a recent interview with Evangeline Lilly star of the above mentioned Ant Man movie and she says she asked for some Ant Man comics and said that they where awful.  She says she hoped to get her hands on the original material because she knew that it must be better.Well here is a secret Ms. Lilly, while no true fan of Stan Lee or Jack Kirby could ever call this material ""awful "" it surely does not stand up as fine literature and was a actually one of Marvel's first superhero flops.But I, like most of superhero fandom have come to love the little guy (sometimes big guy) and had a blast reading these clunky but charming 53 year old stories.The very first story was a one off which appeared in January 1962 issue of Tales To Astonish #27.  This comic at the time featured a selection of Weird Monster and Science Fiction stories.  The Man In The Ant Hill was a seven page story which features scientist Henry Pym who invents a solution that when poured on anything makes it smaller.  At no time does Hank become a superhero.  This story owes a lot to the Richard Matheson's novel and subsequent movie The Incredible Shrinking Man from 1956 and 1957 respectively.  The plot is by Stan Lee, script by his little brother Larry Leiber and art by Jack ""King"" Kirby. This story first appeared the same month as Fantastic Four #2 , so depending on your prospective Ant Man might be considered Marvel's second silver age superhero series. Marvel Comic's Fantastic Four was selling quite well and it was decided more superhero books would sell better.  So ten months after his first appearance in the September 1962 issue of Tales Of Astonish ( #35 ) Henry Pym gets a costume and becomes Ant Man.Ant Man's powers are he can shrink to ant size but remain as powerful as a normal human. He can also talk to ants with use of a special helmet. His formula quickly evolves as the stories go along in the earliest ones he pours a liquid on himself to shrink or grow. In Tales To Astonish #39 it becomes a reducing gas and finally in Tales To Astonish #49 it becomes a capsule they have contained on their belts.In Tales to Astonish #36 Henry Pym's third adventure we are introduced to his most wonky invention and new means of transportation.  A remote controlled giant catapult.  He gets inside and then shoots himself across town to where ever a crime may be happening.  Then it is the job of thousands of ants to form a soft cushion with their bodies for his landing.  I can't help but believe numerous ants would have been killed and maimed in this reckless action.  I expect the movie to leave out ""The Ant Catapult "".The first seven stories are all scripted by Larry Lieber from a Stan Lee plot. Jack Kirby on art.  The first stories feature some very lame villains that are either Aliens or Scooby Do styled villains who's identity is revealed at the end of the story.They say you can judge a Superhero by how good his Rogues Gallery of Villains are , well that may be the reason why Henry Pym eventually lost his book.  His are terrible.  Egghead is his arch nemesis and appears in three stories.  In his second appearance Egghead becomes a Zoologist so he can unleash an Ant-Eater on Ant Man. The Human Top also appears in three issues.  The Magican is in two stories and my favorite lame villain the Porcupine is also in two stories.With issue #41 Don Heck would become the regular artist as Kirby was needed elsewhere. I like Don's art quite a bit here , especially when he inks himself.  He displays a fine line style with much more intricate details then his later work.Tales Of Astonish #44 was an important issue for several reasons. First because it introduced Janet Van Dyne and The Wasp.  Strangely the strip up to this point did not have a single reoccurring character except for Henry Pym. She is mere teen ager. While her age is never revealed Hank mentions repeatedly how young she is in these early stories.  In this story it is revealed that Pym had a Russian wife who was killed defecting.  Janet is a very young spitting image of the late Maria Pym . Dr. Vernon Van Dyne comes to visit Hank.  He is Janet's father and a fellow scientist.  Janet's father is then killed by an alien , so on their second meeting Hank asks Janet to become a superhero and avenge his death.Tales To Astonish #44 also marks the debut of a new scripter as H.E. Huntley replaces Larry Leiber for a five issue run.  H.E. Huntley was actually Golden Age Timely Comics writer and artist Ernie Huntley Hart.  Ernie Hart was most famous for his 1943 creation of Timely's funny animal character Super Rabbit.  Hart's stories are more wordy then Lieber's but still followed Stan Lee's wonky plots.Tales Of Astonish #49 is the next important issue.  Stan Lee takes over full writing duties for the first time , Jack Kirby returns to the book for three issues and Hank first becomes Gaint Man.  You can't help but wonder if this wasn't all part of one big push to make the book more successful.Jack Kirby would be inked by the departing Don Heck on Tales Of Astonish#49, then legend Steve Ditko on #50 and finally Dick Ayers on #51.  Dick Ayers then would become the regular penciler for the duration of this volume starting with Tales To.Astonish #52.Lee and Ayers would remain as the creative team for the duration of this collection but Larry Lieber would return as the penciler and scripter of the eight Tales Told By The Wasp series.  Only one of these feature an actual Wasp story ,for the rest the Wasp merely introduces some small sci-fi story.  These are strange stories and we are never told wether we are supposed to believe these stories or wether the Wasp is just fabricating all of them.  They closely resemble the Tales Of The Watcher stories which Larry Lieber also did many of.  The Watcher ones  at least makes a lot more sense with him as a host then the Wasp ones. One wonders if Stan Lee, perhaps had a shoe box full of unused stories from the previous science fiction era and he just gave them to his little brother with the instructions to make this into Wasp and Watcher stories.Tales Of Astonish #57 featured a crossover with Spider-Man and the final story ( #59 ) featured in this collection is the return of The Hulk .  The Hulk would get his own regular feature with the very next issue.  That event would eventually spell the demise of the Giant Man and the Wasp feature.  The Hulk strip would always be the more popular strip and soon Giant Man was replaced with the Sub-Mariner.But for now let us go back in time and revisit these wacky tales from the dawn of the Marvel Age.  Who would have ever have guessed Ant Man would ever get his own movie.Highly Recommended. Fun Awaits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TYOAVVCQ4G5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785198504#wasThisHelpful","R3TYOAVVCQ4G5K","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great pulp hero very much in the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter on Mars.  These early pulp adventures are being reprinted once more from the pages of Argosy Magazine complete with an original pulp painting and all the other original pulp line drawings.  It is in a large trade paperback size with easy to read print. So while you can get the material from many sources this is the definitive edition you want to own.Things are not going well for Harry Thorne of Earth.  He is broke and is dumped by girlfriend.  Fortunately he has a chance to exchange bodies with a Martian Prince.  Some day I would like to read a book about the Martian trapped in Harry's body but that may never happened.Harry who happens to be a master fencer,  gets many chances to defend his honor and slay strange creatures in this rousing adventure.  There is also a civil war brewing.  He rides winged Dragon like creatures years before Anne McCaffrey's books.He also meets two beautiful princess and he most choose from them.  Personally I think he made the wrong choice, but I saw the writing on the wall.I am a huge Edgar Rice Burroughs lover so I want to weigh in on the debate about whether Kline was a pale imitation or a worthy successor.  Well this Kline novel is not as good as the best Burroughs, but it certainly is better then some of his later work.I enjoyed the heck out of it .  And remember to buy the Altus Press version.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3EMVQAUNOZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618271911#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3EMVQAUNOZX","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well EuroComics and IDW brought us their excellent first edition of this European Masterpiece in January, now six short months later we get another volume. I hope this means can look forward to another volume around the beginning of the year.  In total this series will be 12 volumes.  EuroComics started with volume 3 , since the earlier material was released recently by another publisher.  That publisher did an inferior production and that material will be correctly done at some future point by EuroComics.Anyways, that makes this volume four.  While you can start with this volume , and it makes perfect sense, I recommend starting with the the third volume since it introduces a few characters you will meet again here.For those of you unfamiliar with Corto Maltese, he is a legend in European Graphic Novels.  Think Tintin , but for adults.  Created by Italian artist Hugo Pratt with a style that influenced many of the American greats.  It is one beautifully composed panel after another of stark black and whites. EuroComics has done a new translation and released it in an oversized edition of that matches the original size.Corto Maltese was a Captain and an explorer who sailed the Islands of the Caribbean and the continent of South America in these early adventures all set in 1917.When last we left our hero he was suffering from Amnesia after being shot in the head. In the first story Mushroom Head Professor Steiner ( Corto's elderly alcoholic companion) seeks to restore his mind.  We meet Levi Colombia a reoccurring character who is a  wealthy Treasure Hunter.  The story concerns a shrunken head of a white man and how it came to be.In the second story Banana Congo, Corto gets caught up in a local revolution and we meet for the first time the beautiful mercenary Venexiana Stevenson.In Voodoo For President we meet back up with the girl who accidentally shot Corto in the head.  She has come to a small island and bought a sugar plantation.  But now she is accused of using Zombies for workers.In the next story Sweet Dream Lagoon , a British deserter is hiding in a South American jungle.  He is deliriously sick and his life is cleverly revealed through a series of fever dreams.In the final story in this volume A Tale Of Two Grandfathers Corto is recruited by Levi Colombia to find a white man's grandson who is half native .  His parents have been killed and It is discovered he is being raised by his other Grandfather, a primitive native.All five of these stories are excellent and each has its own distinct tone.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2276IAFXFKSMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631403176#wasThisHelpful","R2276IAFXFKSMU","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume collects material from the 1995 to 1998 Dark Horse run of Tarzan.  Tarzan #1 to #20 plus the one shot special A Tale Of Mugambi.  These are some great Tarzan stories done with an All Star cast of creators and priced at under $25 for over 500 pages which makes it is also a great deal.  The production values and the reproduction are top notch and reproduced on slick glossy paper.  Comparing them to Marvel's Epic Collection which also run about 500 pages a volume. But thid is on better paper and can be found for about $10 to $15 cheaper.Now for my two complaints.  First these are reproduced slightly smaller then standard comic size . Not as small as a digest but some where in between digest and standard comic size.  They are completely readable even by me with my ancient eyes,  but I still would have preferred the bigger size even if it warranted a price increase.My second complaint is that includes the covers of only 13 issues out of the 21 possiable covers are reproduced here.  I sure wish the other 8 could have been included here since the covers are a thing of beauty, done by some greats.  You get Arthur Suydam, Igor Kordey, Christopher Schenck, Bernie Wrightson, Mike Kaluta,  Mark Schultz and John Totleben who paints some beautiful pieces for the final story.The book opens with the Mugambi one shot. Mugambi is Tarzan's African friend who plays a large role in Burroughs The Beasts Of Tarzan novel. The story has the feel of Mythology or Legend.  The story comes from a talented pair of Croatians. Darco Macan the writer went on to do much for Dark Horse's Star Wars run.  Artist Igor Kordey you might remember from his work on Grant Morrison's X-Men run.  Kordey's art reminds of a cross between Richard Corben and Frank Quitely.Next comes the longest story of this volume which is Tarzan's Jungle Fury.  It ran six issues of the ongoing Tarzan comic. Written by Bruce Jones one of the greats who emerged from the independent explosion and Pacific Comics.  It was penciled by then newcomer Christopher Schenck and inked by current Prince Valiant artist Thomas Yeates.  Tarzan is accompanied by his French friend Paul D'Arnot on this adventure along with two beautiful woman . A white female doctor and a native princess. The story is about a parasitic plant life which grows wildly inside the human body.  Tarzan has brought this plague back to the jungle after his recent visit to Barsoom.  Jane is one of the first infected and Tarzan most find a cure.The next story Legion Of Hate is four part story written by Allen Gross of Insight Studios.  Schenck stays on for pencils but George Freeman takes over the inking.  Canadian Freeman burst on the scene with Captain Canuck.  His inking is just as good as Yeates, which may be hard to believe.  The story is about Nazi's and the two tribes of Amazon woman Tarzan first encountered in the novel Tarzan The Magnificent.  The Amazons possess a emerald which gives them control over anyone, soon the Nazis  have taken it and are using it for their own diabolical means. These first two stories are very entertaining and faithful to Edgar Rice Burroughs.Next we get three small two part stories written by Canadian colorist Lovern Kindzierski and illustrated by a team of French artists Stan Manoukian and Vince Roucher . All three of these stories take place in 1909.  Since the first Tarzan novel was first published in 1912, I first assumed these to be an error.  But according to Win Scott Eckert's timeline these could be correct.Anyways the stories appear to have happened right after the first Tarzan novel and before the Return Of Tarzan.In the first one Le Monstre, Tarzan and Paul D'Arnot have returned to Paul's native France they briefly encounter Pablo Picasso before the main story which is a retelling of The Phantom Of The Opera with Tarzan.In the second one  The Modern Prometheus, Lord Greystroke arrives in New York and promptly meets Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Nicholas Tesla.  Then they encounter Thomas Edison who is cast in the Victor Frankenstein role for a retelling of Frankenstein.  While I found the first one to be a clever change of pace , starting with this story I wished they would return to the jungles and lost worlds of Africa.But in the third one Tooth And Nail we get a retelling of Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde.  Much to my dismay Tarzan has now become a full fledged Detective, it appears, and he must solve this case.Finally things turn back to status quo in Tarzan Vs. The Moon Men , a four part story which crosses Tarzan over with another world created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The world of The Moon Maid and The Moon Men.  This was a very fun treat for me and included an appearance by Korak who falls for a Moon princess.Working on this last story we have an all star cast including Tim Truman scripting,  Thomas Yeates now on pencils and the great Al Williamson inking.All in all this collection includes fantastic art , some great stories and over 500 pages of Tarzan art.  It deserves a place on the shelf of every Edgar Rice Burroughs fan.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AYAA7TZVDMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616556625#wasThisHelpful","R11AYAA7TZVDMX","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well I have been making my way through all the Black Mask Audio series and this is the best yet (at least so far ). Under this great Rafael DeSota pulp cover are one of the first great hard boiled characters beginnings,  a six part collection of interconnected short stories about the first great Asian detective plus a fantastic stand alone story by an almost unknown author.Carroll John Daly is the lost father of hard boiled Detective Fiction.  The man single handedly evented a new genre of fiction. Long before Chandler or Hammett came Daly and his most famous creation Race Williams.  Knights Of The Open Palm is the very first Race Williams story. It is an anti Klu Klux Klan story published in 1923.Next we get six part the Jo Gar story about the thief of nine diamonds.  Written by Raoul Whitfield under the Ramon Decolta alias.  Jo Gar is Spanish Filipino Detective who solved murders and mysteries in 1930's Philippines.  In this one the mystery goes from his native island , to a cruise ship , to Hawaii and San Francisco.  I highly recommend the Atlus Press very thick collection of all the Jo Gar stories.  See my review also on Amazon.The title story The Ring On The Hand Of Death is not part of any series but is really the show stopper of the collection.  It is about a sixteen year old Depression Youth who witnessed a murder. The author William Rollins Jr. was a Marxist and an early out of the closet Homosexual.  Don't let any of that dissuade you this is a great story and not to be missed.Buy this collection, you will not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBT8DCD8SSFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EJ0HH6#wasThisHelpful","R1YBT8DCD8SSFL","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The late Mark Gruenwald wrote Captain America for 10 years .  From 1985 to 1995. In Epic Captain America Collection volume 12 we saw the very beginning of Greenwald's run , now in this volume 16 we pick up with Gruenwald's run at the half way point in 1990 and 1991.  Included are Captain America # 372 to #386 (15 issues ) plus Captain America Annuals #9 and #10.Nobody will ever confuse Gruenwald with Alan Moore or this with Watchmen but it is a very fun read.  Gruenwald loved this book and these characters and it is obvious in every story he writes. Gruenwald loved back up stories starring his supporting characters and almost every issue has at least one five page back up.  The Annuals and the triple sized Captain America # 383 have multiple back ups. All of these quirky little stories are included and make this so much more fun.The lead feature is mostly penciled by Ron Lim .  Lim is a prolific artist who made a name for him self during the Indy Boom illustrating Malibu Comics Ex-Mutants.  Inking Ron is Philippine artist Danny Bulanadi who gives it a nice polish.  The back ups are mostly the work of Mark Bagley who is active today.When I remembered that Marvel Annuals at the time mostly featured continued story crossovers that ran in three or more Annuals I was worried we would be treated to incomprehensible story fragments, but that doesn't seem to be too much of a problem. The lead story in Captain America Annual #9 is the very first part of The Terminus Factor.  Written by Roy and Dann Thomas the story is written well enough so that is has an ending , even though it goes on.  We also get a full page text wrap up explaining what happens in the rest of the story.  This is a vast improvement over some of the other Epic Collections from the 90's which have one sentence wrap ups that are worthless.  Art is provided by Jim Valentino done just before he left Marvel to help form Image Comics.  Mark Bagley illustrates a large flashback story with Cap and Bucky meeting the Howling Commandos in WW2. Nomad is the final back up.Comics used to be written for kids.  In the 90's it was still believed that kids formed the majority of readers.  Kids are off school for the summer ,so Marvel had many of their books go bi-weekly during the summer.  Streets Of Poison is the bi-weekly Captain America story for 1990. It actually goes over by one month and runs seven issues Captain America #372 to #378.  The story involves Red Skull and his lieutenant Crossbones distributing the drug Ice. He is opposed by rival drug lord the Kingpin and his lieutenants Bullseye and Typhoid Mary.Since for a large portion of the story Cap is under the influence of the Drug Ice he ends up battling some heroes also including his girlfriend Diamondback plus the Black Widow and Daredevil.The back up story for these same 7 issues is the patriotic garbed superhero Battlestar.  Battlestar meets USAgent and gets captured by the Power Broker who first gave both of them their powers.  Gosh, I love Gruenwald's quirky superhero creations.  My favorite is portly hero dressed in scarlet spandex.  The Red Zeppelin.Captain America #379 is by Guest penciler Chris Marinnan. It teams Cap with Quasar,  Gruenwald's other long term series.  They battle Nefarius who has kidnapped Moonstone. The back up switches to Diamonback and sets up the next three part arc.Captain America #380 to #382 is Serpent Society three parter about Diamondback being put on trail by the Society. Diamondback is unsure of Cap's loyalty and so she recruits Paladin.USAgent takes over the back up for Captain America #380 to #383 It starts out as just an origin story but turns disturbingly dark as you realize Johnny Walker (USAgent ) is mentally unstable and tortured his fellow heroes.Besides the final USAgent story,  Captain America #383 is triple sized 50th Anniversary issue.  The lead story I think was Gruenwald's attempt to do something like Jack Kirby's Bicentennial Battles issue. In the story Cap meets imaginary heroes of American Folk Lore. This is pretty stupid story who's explanation and Hawkeye reveal makes no sense.  My favorite story in this issue is the Red Skull story which explains how Skull and Crossbones first met.Captain America #384 is the only issue without a back up and a done in one issue.  Captain America finds out a fellow hero is trapped in ice so he goes to explore thinking it is his former side kick D-Man.  Well it turns out to be Golden Age Hero Jack Frost.Captain America #385 and #386 features two returning characters from the Stern /Bryne run on Cap. Bernie Rosenthal re-enters Cap's life and has changed her mind about a life with Steve Rogers.  Mike the Fireman some how gets involved in a some militant group called The Watchdogs.In the back up Diamondback returns in a back up story designed to prepare us for the next six week bi-weekly summer storyline which sadly is not included.Instead we finish with Captain America Annual #10.  It starts with part three of the Von Strucker Gambit.  While the story was not to my liking it does have some nice Mike Manley art.Next we get two solo stories for two members of Gruenwald's Serpent Society. Bushmaster and Sidewinder get their own tale.The Bushmaster one is excellent and features some of the last art done by Marvel Legend Don Heck.The final annual tale is by Fabian Nicieza and is warm up for his Nomad ongoing series.The back matter consists of stuff done for Marvel Year In Review, some copies of original art and the Marvel Age interviews with Jack Kirby and Joe Simon.The cover of this book by Ron Lim and Jim Lee and is great.Mark Gruenwald who died in 1996 at the age of 43 left us with a legacy of ten years of Cap books and you can feel his love of Cap and all his wacky, goofy characters on every page.  I look forward to the next Gruenwald Epic Collection.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22OMTK48DKXHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192654#wasThisHelpful","R22OMTK48DKXHF","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well like clockwork the Prince Valiant oversized strip collections have been appearing twice a year around June and December and each is a cause of celebration.  Volume 11 lovingly reproduces another two year's worth of strips.  This volume from 1957 and 1958.Even though I bought all the paperback editions Fantagraphics did years ago, these Hard Covers are an improvement in both reproduction and value being twice as large.The accompanying text pieces this volume feature the advertising art of Hal Foster and the firm he first worked for.  Brian M Kane does an article about the advertising executive Reinhold Palenske , a brilliant artist in his own rite.  While the afterward focuses on Hal Foster's advertising art he did for Palenske-Young.When we join this volume Hal Foster had been doing the strip for twenty years (1937) and Valiant was married with three kids. Arn,  a pre-teen youth and the twin girls Karen and Valeta just emerging from the toddler age.The book bookends with Prince Valiant going in disguise.  In the opening storyline as a Palmer.  A Palmer is a medieval  crusader who had been to the Holy Lands.  Then as we wind up the volume Val is disguised as a Minstrel in a quest to find the missing Sir Gawain.In between we get a bunch of great stories including the story of how Prince Valiant first discovers his great red stallion , the war horse Arvak.  Prince Valiant's crest has always featured a red steed now he has a living totem.Young Arn is also fostered off to another kingdom.  Arn experiences loneliness and meets his foster sister Frytha.  While Arn finds Frytha  quite lovely she is nicknamed The Monster for  the evil pranks the spoiled girl pulls.Meanwhile Aleta and the twins make their first arrival at Camelot. The Beautiful Aleta encounters jealously from Queen Guinevere and needs to resolve that problem.In one of the most touching and heart breaking stories Valiant acquires two teen age squires. One of them a reckless, brave youth meets a very grisly demise. Wracked with grief Prince Valiant goes on a rampage.As always Hal Foster demonstrates a wide diversity in stories.  While the majority of it is rousing adventure we do get moments of quiet family life , romance and even mysticism as Merlin makes an appearance.This beautiful volumes deserve to sit on the shelf of every true comic fan.  The illustrations of Hal Foster need to be savoured by all for years to come.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GLUGYPRLUU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606998285#wasThisHelpful","R17GLUGYPRLUU6","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version of the Maltese Falcon is the exact version that was serialized in Black Mask magazine in 1929.  It seems with each version Dasheil Hammett changed it and polished it up some.  Since it was serialized over a period of months each new installment featured a what has gone on before recap.  In the trade paperback version you have the luxury of skipping over these recaps and it might become monotonous.  I listened to it in my car while driving locally over a period of a week so I didn't mind the constant recaps.By the way if you are a big fan of the 1941 Humphrey Bogart classic give the the first version a try.  It has Richardo Cortez as Sam Spade.  Since it came out in 1931 before they movie code went into effect it is quite racy for it's time.  Satan Was A Lady is the second (1936) version and not as good with a more comedic take. But it does have Betty Davis in it.The narration is very good.  This is a six disc set . The Maltese Falcon is 5 and a half discs then you have two very small short stories. The better of them was written by Frederick Brown . Brown was mostly know for his science fiction but he was a master of the short, short.Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF4JFC77QLXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611744644#wasThisHelpful","R3EF4JFC77QLXR","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection contains Fantastic Four #176 to #191.  Cover dated November 1976 to February 1978.  If you do your math you would think you are getting Sixteen issues. But sadly you only get Fourteen full issues because two of them are total reprints with only the new covers included in this collection.  Story wise the first half of the book was mostly Roy Thomas while the back half was mostly Len Wein.  But since both of them seemed to be having trouble making deadlines we had many other writers helping out.  The penciling features Nine stories by George Perez, Three by Sal Buscema and Two from Ron Wilson.  Inking was Joe Sinnott for twelve  issues with Dave Hunt and Tony DeZungia each inking one issue a piece.This is the first time ( I believe ) Marvel has gone with the split introductions.  Roy Thomas talks about his involvement with the first half of the book then hands it off to Len Wein.  But instead of following suite Len just tells a story of discovering FF #1 on the newsstands as a boy.Roy kicks off things in a big way with FF #176 which was the re-introduction of Impossible Man. This was a wacky fun ride with the FF meeting the Marvel Bullpen.  Featured in the Bullpen is Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, George Perez, Joe Sinnott,  John Verpooten, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway,  Marie Severin and Archie Goodwin.  Jack Kirby penciled this cover (one of four in this collection) and probably deserves a plotting assist credit.  Jack drew the Impossible Man with his two hands looking like Iron-Man and Thor,  when Roy and George saw this they changed the story to include this scene.  The Impossible Man was created way back in FF #11 , at the time of his appearance he was dismissed by fans who hated this cartoony green alien.  Stan had forbidden his return.  But Roy not only brought him back but he made him a regular character of the FF's supporting cast.  Fortunately for Roy fandom had changed over the years and they now loved the little green imp.Fantastic Four #177 was an equally fun and zanny romp.  The Frightful Four ( currently three ) were holding try-outs for their fourth member.  Not since The Legion Of Substitute Superheroes have we seen such wacky doings.Now here is a mystery and an error I discovered and hope to set straight.  If you look at the writers credits in the front of the book you will see Mike Friedrich listed as a writer for FF #178.  Wow I couldn't find anything to back this up.  After burning up the internet and not finding anything , I decided to unbag my original copy of FF #178 .  There on the letters page was my answer.  Mike Friedrich had nothing to do with FF#178 , but he in  fact co-plotted FF #177 with Roy.  And in fact Mike Friedrich created the best of the try-out heroes, Captain Ultra and The Texas Twister according to an acknowledgement from Roy.  This fact is not mentioned by Roy in the introduction,  but he did write thousands of pages of comics, so I am sure he can not recollect every detail.  His memory is still much better the Stan's.FF #177 also introduces Tigra and the returning Thundra as regular supporting characters along side The Impossible Man .  At least until Len Wein comes on board.  Both of these girls experience unrequited love for Ben Grim , a funny change of pace.FF #178 is where things starting go bad for Reed , he previously lost his stretching ability.  Now the Reed Richards from counter earth ( he is also a purple monster called the Brute) takes his place on the team and the original is tossed into the Negative Zone.In the continuation of this story in FF #179 Gerry Conway comes on board to plot the story and script the first three pages for Roy.  Ron Wilson also comes on board to illustrate two issues.  As inked by Joe Sinnott the art still looks pretty good.Issue #180 is a reprint of Bedlam At The Baxter Building from FF #101.  Here is where things get wonky.  The cover for #180 was clearly meant for FF #179 since it depicts events from that issue.  My guess is that since it was a Jack Kirby piece it didn't come in from the west coast in time for FF #179 , so they had Al Milgrom whip a different version.But in the meantime what to do with cover John Romita had done for the reprint issue.  Well they used it for FF #181 which would sadly be the last we would see of Roy for awhile.  Clearly he was having deadline problems and his commitment to Conan and Savage Sword Of Conan won out.  Reed is still stuck in the Negative Zone but now he must team up with Annihilus.Sal Buscema does the art for the next two issues  FF # 182 and #183,  which finishes up the counter earth Reed Vs. Reed in the Negative Zone saga.  The first part is cobbled together by committee.  Len Wein, Jim  Shooter and Archie Goodwin plot it with Bill Mantlo scripting it.  Mantlo gets solo credit for the second part.In Fantastic Four #184  Len Wein starts his run with the missing George Perez he hasn't done the book for five months.  This is the start of a good three part story FF #184 through FF #186 dealing with Witches and New Salem.It starts when Nanny, Agatha Harkness disappears with young Franklin Richards in tow.  First we meet the Elminator , then Agatha's power mad son Nicholas Scratch finally an entire team of witchcraft powered superheroes called Salem's Seven.FF  #187 and FF #188 is a good two parter with two classic villains teaming up. Klaw and The Molecule Man. Of course as is the theme of this volume things go badly for Reed as he is transformed into The Molecule Man.  The Watcher and the returning Impossible Man guest star.  At the end of this story a depressed Reed announces he is leaving the team.  Sue follows him.Well during the introduction Len admits he was currently writing Spider-Man, The Hulk and Thor at the time this was assigned to him and a week behind on all of them .  So I imagine the deadline got to him for FF #189 was yet another reprint issue, the 2nd in 9 Months.Apparently that wasn't enough time for Len and George because FF  # 190 appears to be a quickie fill in issue.  The only really good thing about this issue is the Jack Kirby cover. The story is by Marv Wolfman with very rushed looking art from Sal Buscema and Tony DeZungia. I got the feeling this whole thing was put together in under a week.  It is now revealed the whole team is breaking up . We see Ben with Alicia Masters reminiscing about a dozen random past battles.  This is low point for the volume .We end on a better story in FF #191 .  Wein and Perez reunite for the final story of the team breaking up.  The Plunderer pops up towards the end just so the FF can get together and fight someone.The extras are very slim this volume with only the editorial page from FF #176 reprinted.In Summation despite the lack of consistency from the creators I found this volume to be ,with one exception ,a lot of fun and the art of Perez and Sinnott is simply fantastic.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W51MZHW260JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785191925#wasThisHelpful","R3W51MZHW260JY","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank you Library Of American Comics for this volume.  While I have the early Sunday strips in collections from three different publishers , I have yet to find a collection of the dailies.This is a fantastic collection of the very first adventure newspaper comic strip.  These strips first appeared over 85 years ago in 1929 and 1930.  The original plan was for them to adapt each Tarzan novel separately and sell them each as unique series.  The plan included each novel would be adapted over a period of 10 weeks or 60 individual strips.  Later in fear of exhausting source material it was decided that they might stretch out continuities past the ten week limit.This volume features the first four novels of Tarzan collected or about a years worth of material.While the Library Of American Comics Essentials was launched with much bravado , I wonder about it's continued success.  The wait time between volumes has increased and no future volumes past this seventh have been announced.  Also we have gotten two price increases.  The list on first volumes was $19.99 , then it was $24.99 , now they are $29.99.Well even at that price I still think they are a perfect format to display an older strip which needs the space.  One daily strip to a page is like reading a Hard Cover Collection in which some collector has found pristine original strips and cut out each one and carefully bound them together.The nine page illustrated introduction by Burroughs expert Henry G. Franke III is worth the price of the book alone.  He is very insightful and I learned a lot.If I have one complaint with this volume is that it could have been enlarged even more.  Each daily was composed of five individual panels each with a paragraph of text under each one.  The text is really small by current standards.  Just to clarify these early strips  just like the Tarzan Sunday's and the Prince Valiant Sunday's feature no word balloons, just text beneath illustrations.  Starting with the second novel only 4 panels were used, this made it easier to read.The first adaptation of Tarzan Of The Apes is adapted by Ralph W. Palmer . Palmer in fact adapted all the stories included here. The art was by Hal Foster, who was at the time just another advertisement artist and this was just another assignment.  Foster had no realization he would later become the premiere action adventure comic strip artist in the field and it would bring him fame, money and recognition.The 300 panels Hal Foster contributed to the first novel's adaptation are brilliant and rich in details. But since Foster had other advertising work to do another artist was chosen for the second story.The Return Of Tarzan followed after a three month gap.  Like the first  story it is 60 strips but now a reasonable 4 panels a page.  Rex Maxon was the artist selected.If you are familiar with Rex Maxon you have probably have heard stories vilifying him.  Poor Rex Maxon was actually a pretty good artist and this volume should rectify that impression.  First off he had to follow in the shoes of now legendary Hal Foster and then second because Maxon was not immediately available an artist named Hugh Hutton ghosted the first strips.  Burroughs and his artistic son Jack hated these first strips and would spend a lot of time trying to get Maxon removed from both this and the later Sunday Tarzan strips.  Neither realizing that their initial impression was based on art that was not even Maxon.  The introduction says Maxon tried to correct Hutton's art.  The first daily to carry Maxon name was episodes six.Maxon art continued to improve on the third and fourth novels adapted here.  It should be noted that from Maxon's start there would be no more three month wait between adaptations.  One would finish on a Saturday and come Monday a new adventure would start.With Burroughs permission The Beasts Of Tarzan was 84 dailies while The Son of Tarzan ran 96 dailies.With this volume finished we still have decades full of Tarzan dailies that deserve to be reprinted.  I have high hopes for the success of both the LOAC Essentials format and the continuation of Tarzan.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCR36XKPBJ9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402617#wasThisHelpful","R3SCR36XKPBJ9U","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first heard about this book at the Windy City Pulp Convention where author Ron Fortier who had read an advance copy was extolling it's virtues. The idea of the late Mickey Spillane and Max Allen Collins writing a western got me very interested and I pre-ordered it upon returning home.The origin of the novel has been covered in other reviews ,but more importantly in Collins own introduction.  So here is the short version.  Mickey Spilliane was friends with John Wayne . Wayne asked Spilliane to write a screenplay for him. For various reasons It was never produced.  Max Allen Collins took the screenplay and converted it to novel form.I am a very late convert to the virtues of the western . Like Collins himself I have read very few Westerns. Also like Collins I enjoy the movie cowboys such as the movies of Anthony Mann and Sergio Leone.I mention those two directors for a reason.  This novel reminds me of both. The story structure reminds me of one of those good old fifties Westerns (Which is when this was first crafted ).  But then we get some of modern ultraviolence like in a spaghetti western.  I think the violence is more of the tough , hard boiled style of Spilliane and Collins brought over from their crime books rather then any spaghetti western influence which didn't even exist when the screenplay was written.The story hits a lot of classic Western troupes. A town held hostage by the evil sheriff, the misguided harlot , the beautiful but spunky ranchers daughter and the town drunk who proves himself in the end.And of course the stranger . The loner with the mysterious past who rides into town just as things have escalated to a breaking point.This book will not change your life but it is good old fashioned fun.Max Allen Collins has a contract to write at least two more novels. He has recently completed his second Caleb York novel, The Big Showdown. It is more to form , a murder mystery story.Sales of this introductory novel have been rather slow , so I encourage any fence sitters to purchase this book now so we can continue to enjoy the adventures of Caleb York.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IEJY1MWER6QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617735949#wasThisHelpful","R1IEJY1MWER6QN","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This handsome hardcover collects the Rip Kirby strips from October 1964 through July 1967.  We get over  two and half years reproduced in crisp black and white on heavy white paper.Labeled the first modern detective the strip started in 1946 by master illustrator Alex Raymond. After his tragic death in 1956, John Prentice was selected to continue the strip. And continue it, he did . It ran till 1999.John Prentice it turned out was also an excellent artist in his own right . His fine line art was three times the recipient of  National Cartoonist Society award for Story Comic Strip. The first two years he won 1966 and 1967 are featured in this very volume.It's no secret that most adventure strips relied heavily on ghosts, assistants or background artists.  In volume seven Al Williamson contributed a lot. In this volume the talented Alden McWilliams helped out some in 1964 and 1965.  Then in 1966 following his firing at DC comics Superman artist Wayne Boring was hired by Prentice to help.Fred Dickenson writes the stories featuring a variety of different genres.  We get straight detective, action adventure, soap opera, romance and even a wild science fiction romp.Comic historian and fellow comic creator Brian Walker continues his series of Introductions with more information about Prentice accompanied by some early Prentice work from the Romance Comics genre.The stories featured in this volume are :1) The Planted Butler.  This is an adventure which draws heavily on Desmond.  Desmond is former safe cracker reformed by Rip who becomes his butler and loyal companion.  Desmond is featured in all of the included stories.2) In The Hands Of The Avenger.  This is a story set in the middle east about a Sheik friend of Kirby who asks for help with his arrogant son.3) The Gibson Girl.  In this story Prentice is able to take Rip back to the early 1900's without using time travel.  It is a story about an actress filming a movie about a turn of the century murder. She insists everyone must stay in character so we get Rip in old fashioned clothes driving a horse and buggy.  Rip must find out who is threatening the actress as well as solve the original case.4)  A Hundred Fathoms Dead.  This is my second favorite story which features great art and an action adventure reminiscent of Thunderball. You get panels with beautiful underwater scenes, lost sunken treasures, beautiful girls in swimsuits and a maniacal villain.5) The Chameleon Strikes. In this story we meet a character from Rip's past who is a master of disguise.6) Is There, In Truth, No Beauty ?  This was my least favorite of the volume simply because it is based on a very wobbly foundation. It assumes that a beautiful woman who puts up her hair up and wears glasses becomes an ugly duckling. The story does introduce a new cast member though as Rip adopts Lucky a beagle.7)  An Old Detective In New Atlantis .  While this story may have upset many Detective purist it is my favorite.  This story is pure Sci--Fi schlock with it's spaceships and time travel and a futuristic princess who needs Rip's help. The art has many fans wondering whether Al Williamson or Alden McWilliams were involved, but instead my research indicates it is from the time when Wayne Boring first became involved.8) The Wheeler Dealer . This is a story set on a cruise ship about a pretty gal involved in a plan to swindle millionaires out of money.9) Mission: Find That Girl.  In this story Rip meets yet another gal with questionable morals.  She starts out as a fake gypsy and ends up being sought by a murderer.10)  The Hairpin Escapade.  While I was disappointed by the lack of an appearance by either of Rip Kirby's main two love interests Honey Dorian and Pagan Lee, I was delighted by the return of the Amour Sisters who appeared in a volume six story  competing for Rip's affections. They are rich,  but spoiled siblings.  The lovely brunette Mumu and here equally enticing blonde sister Tutu. This is mostly a comedic story about a stolen crown.  Desmond and his fellow butler Wiggins play a large role.11)  The Troubles Of Nelson Chatfield.  I found this story very unique in its very extended set-up.  You don't even see Rip until almost four weeks into the story.  The story itself is about an owner of a luxury Island resort who starts experiencing a series of negative incidents.The Library Of American Comics and IDW released the Alex Raymond four volumes in rapid order. Then as an experiment they released a John Prentice volume, to see if the market would support it.  These books, I understand,  barely break even  But it is labor of love for LOAC head honcho Dean Mullaney and he has said as long as they don't loose money, he will keep publishing them.  So once a year for the last four years we have now been treated to an annual new edition.Please support these handsome collections so that they will keep producing them.  This is worthwhile addition to the library of every true fan of classic comic strips.  I urge your purchase, so that we may keep enjoying this wonderful series.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5OWFRKENPYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631403044#wasThisHelpful","R2U5OWFRKENPYO","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shortly after the announcement of A Guardians Of The Galaxy movie marvel decided to reboot the comic in 2013 putting their A-listers on the book Brain Michael Bendis and Steve McNiven in 2013. This oversized collection reprints the contents of the first two trades or 12 comics.  Over 300 pages of mostly beautiful comic art.  Plus all the covers and numerous alternate covers are reproduced.The lead story from GOTG #0.1 tells the origin of Star Lord. It is brilliant and starts things off with a bang.For some reason Bendis puts Iron Man on the team. The rest of the team includes all the favourites we would get to know from the movie Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot and Rocket Raccoon.  There has been lots of discussion about whether Tony Stark belongs on the team or not.  Personally I am rather neutral on the matter . I don't think he adds much but I am not upset about his presence here.Star Lord argues with his father and then the gang intercepts Angela, who they think may be attacking Earth.  Angela is Neil Gaiman's Valkyrie like fallen Angel created for Image Comics in Spawn #9 in 1993.  So after a lawsuit and Two Decades she is back .  This is a mildly entertaining story certainly not worth all the build up.In issue #2 Sara Pichelli joins McNiven on art . She is an equally talented artist who also produces beautiful art. But in issue #8 and #9 fellow Italian artist Francesco Francavilla takes over. I love Francavilla's art on his prior assignments which are mostly gritty pulp characters and the heavy blacks adds lots of mood.  In this book it is jarring contrast to polished detailed art of McNiven and Pichelli. It just doesn't work.Issue #10 brings Kevin Maguire on for the issue.  Maguire is a much better fit .Unfortunately the second half of the book plays off the one of Marvel's big events ""Infinity"".  Having not read that book I have no idea what is going on and quickly found myself losing interest.  Why Marvel finds the need to force these events on their readers is a matter too big for this review.The book closes out with four short solo stories of mixed quality. I enjoyed the Groot and Rocket Raccoon stories but was bored by the Drax and Gamora stories.In summary I loved much of the art. I was very excited by the inaugural story and was having a good time till the crossover hit and then I became confused and frustrated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXFGOPVP010V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785194002#wasThisHelpful","RNXFGOPVP010V","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of Robert Heinlein Juvenile Science Fiction novels written in 1957.  The fact that is 58 years old and the fact that it was written for young boys are two facts I had a hard time believing as I read this complex, but highly entertaining story of one boys journey from slave to one of the most important men in the universe.Thorby the lead protagonist boyhood is told as he lives among four completely different cultures.  When the book opens he is slave . He is sold to a crippled beggar who is secretly much more.  Next he boards a spaceship  and becomes a part of a trader society.  Then he becomes part of military organization.  Finally he returns to Earth to find out that he is an important member of a powerful giant corporation.The book deals with Economics, Poltics, Morality, Freedom and many complex issues that might not be easily digested by adults let alone minors.I listened to Blackstone Audio version which is excellently narrated by Grover Gardner . The only jarring problem I found is he uses many multinational accents to represent different alien races.  So you might here an alien with a middle eastern accent or an extraterrestrial with a southern drawl.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIAGPJO5HOD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482947226#wasThisHelpful","RUIAGPJO5HOD0","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This will be a short review because there are 66 other reviews and in all likelihood no one will ever read it.This is one of the very earliest Hard Case Crime Books written under an alias by publisher Charles Ardai.  It was nominated for both an Edgar and a Shamus award. It is every bit as good as the classic Hard Boiled fiction from people like Lawrence Block,  Donald Westlake and Earl Stanley Gardner.The cover is by the master of Femme Fatale paperback covers Robert McGinnis and I love his work but something about the anatomy of this woman looks all wrong. The leg is way too long and in an impossible position.I solved the surprise twist ending about 2/3 of the way through the book which made me wonder about the intelligence of the protagonist, but still I had enough fun that it has made me eager to read it's sequel.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BIZXHILNCWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857683152#wasThisHelpful","R27BIZXHILNCWZ","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank You Titan Publishing for continuing to publish one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time.  We are in the home stretch to completion which will run either 30 or 31 volumes. It seems Titan has settled in to a schedule with a new volume arriving every six months.This volume once again features the excellent writing of the late Peter O'Donnell and the skillful fine line work of Enric Badia Romero.  Once again we get three complete stories which ran over sixteen months from February 1994 till May 1995.New for this volume is Rick Norwood who takes over the introductions from Lawrence Blackmore.  Mr. Norwood is the publisher of Comics Revue and the editor many fine classic comic strip collections. He is a wise choice and provides three delightful introductions for the three stories.Guido The Jinx is the first story and my favorite of this collection, and not just because it features Modesty in a Cave Girl bikini for the duration.  Modesty and faithful sidekick Willie Garvin decide to travel the historic Silk Road which runs between China and the Mediterranean just for kicks. They meet a movie production company and get talked into being stunt actors.  Will there they encounter a few characters from their past and we get a highly entertaining story.In The Killing Distance things get much more serious when Modesty discovers a contract has been taken out for the death of their boss Sir Gerald Tarant.  Modesty and Willie must discover who it is and find a means to stop ""the hit"".In the final story The Aristo ,our heroes encounter modern pirates and a young hostage about to give birth.What I always love about O'Donnell's writing is the variety of stories he can tell and this volume is no exception. For those new to Modesty you can really start with any volume.  My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQNV9H5OA02Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781167125#wasThisHelpful","R2JQNV9H5OA02Y","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Epic Collection features some wonderful stories from the Roy Thomas's very fertile imagination . 450 pages of some of the best Avengers tales ever told . In crisp white paper with vibrant colors this book lovingly reproduces Avengers #57 to Avengers #76 , plus the Black Knight solo story from Marvel Superheroes #17.  Twenty one comics from the years 1968 to 1970.The writing is all Roy Thomas .  Stan's right hand man had broke out of his shell and was producing better work then his creative boss. Art wise we have some very polished work by John Buscema and Gene Colan.  Two veterans at the top of their game. Also included is some very early work from Barry Smith and Sal Buscema. Plus a one shot story from two Golden Age artists Frank Giacoia and Howard Purcell.This Epic Collection was timed to coincide with the Avengers second movie, and in fact the day I came home from the movie the box containing this volume was on my door step. I was very excited to re-read this introduction to the Vision.Avengers #57 and Avengers #58 break down as single stories each with having their own endings but combined they give you a fuller introduction to the Vision. In the first book Ultron creates the Vision , and the Avengers defeat Utron. In the second story the Avengers consider the ramifications of accepting The Vision as a member.For these two stories and the next one John Buscema is beautifully inked by George Klein.  Klein was a Golden Age artist who did much early Timely Comic work before heading to DC in 1955. He became one of DC's mainstays inking a lot of Curt Swan and Superman Family books.  In 1968 not yet Editor-in-chief Carmine Infantino was instructed to fire some of old dead wood and bring in fresh talent.  Klein was fired with six others including Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.  Stan gave Klein work for the remainder of his career.The next story in Avengers #59 and #60 is almost as famous as the first one . It introduces Yellowjacket and the wedding of Janet and Hank. Mickey Demeo who inked the second part was Mike Esposito under an alias.Avengers #61 is a single issue story which not only brings back inker George Klein but The Black Knight and guest star Doctor Strange in his full face mask costume.Avengers #62 is another classic story which focus on The Black Panther and introduces his new nemesis The Man-Ape.Avengers#63 and #64 is yet another famous yarn in which Clint Barton becomes the focus of the story when Clint uses Hank Pym's growth serum and  becomes Goliath. Old Ant-Man foe Egghead shows up and we meet Clint's brother.  Gene Colan starts his brief three issue run.In Avengers #65 the man who trained Hawkeye , The Swordsman returns. More great Gene Colan art.In Avengers #66 through #68 Ultron returns becoming an even a bigger and badder menace.  The first two issues are done by a very young Barry Smith who's early art very much emulates Jack Kirby style with a touch of Steranko thrown in.  Avengers #67 was one of  George Klein's final jobs as he died shortly after.  In #68 Sal Buscema makes his Avengers  penciling debut.  At this point Sal had only done one other penciling job for Marvel a Gunhawks story for Marvel's Western anthology.  Despite this, his work here looks very polished. I don't know if John Buscema actually pitched in or if Sal who was inking his big brother on Silver Surfer just absorbed all his style.Avengers #69 through #71 is a three parter which brings back Kang and ads an important new villain called The Grandmaster.  The two engage in a battle of cosmic chess when in the first two issues the Avengers battle the Squadron Sinister.  The Sinister Squadron are analogs for DC's Justice League.  The Squadron Sinister then begot The Squadron Supreme , which became lasting heroes in the Marvel Mythology.  In the final part of the story The Avengers must then fight an early version of the Invaders.In Avengers #71 and #72 they battle Scorpio and His Zodiac Crew, who have been threatening Nick Fury.  Nick , Rick Jones and Captain Marvel quest star.  #72 concludes Sal's first Avengers assignment.Avengers #73 and #74 focuses on The Black Panther and The Sons the Serpent return in a story about race relations.  Frank Giacoia draws the first part and John Buscema returns as regular artist for second part.  The story features some heavy handed politics.Starting with Issue #74 John Buscema is paired with his perfect partner Tom Palmer. Palmer's fine line and cross hatching just made the art ""pop"".The final two part story Avengers #75 and #76 introduces Arkon , a Sword and Sorcery Hero who serves as a test run for Roy's run on Conan a half a year later.  The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver also return in this very entertaining story. I kind of like the romance between Wanda and Arkon.The book closes with the Black Knight story from Marvel Superheroes #17. The reprint book at the time featured a new lead story every issue  in a pilot type way like DC's Showcase. Howard Purcell produces some rather bland art for Roy's uninspired tale.Extras for this volume are a pair of unused covers and some original art.With the possible exception of Black Knight tale , this is some of Roy's best and most creative work.  I had read many of these stories as an 11 and 12 year old boy and I am happy to say I found them just as entertaining today.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWQYZPWV95NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785191658#wasThisHelpful","R2CWQYZPWV95NL","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in 1961 by Lawrence Block under a pseudonym this gritty novel is dripping in plulpy noir.I double dipped on this one.  I bought the paperback when it came out but decided to purchase the AudioGo unabridged CD , when I saw it being remaindered at Half Price Book.It is a very fun read and follows five different men who are hired to assassinate Fidel Castro shortly after he comes into power.  The story takes turns following the five would be murders with a factual history of Castro's rise to power mingled in.  But Block decides not to totally follow history, so this becomes an alternate history. I am not going to reveal when this happens because it will totally ruin a surprise.I have been making my way through both the Hard Case Crime books and the novels of Lawerence Block with a goal of reading them all. So far I have yet to be disappointed by either.Recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQNJPQMP85T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609988302#wasThisHelpful","ROQNJPQMP85T9","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While every adventutre comic strip fan knows about Alex Raymond's legendary run on Flash Gordon and Jungle Jim , not everyone is aware of run on this daily strip which he started mere weeks after Flash Gordon in 1934.  This collection features not only the entire Raymond run but 11 months of Charles Flanders rarely seen strips . More then 800 daily strips or almost 3 years  (34 months) of strips.The writing is by two of Mystery Fiction's biggest names.  Dashiell Hammett the founder of Hard Boiled and author of the Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man.  And later Leslie Charteris author of the Simon Templar, The Saint stories.The series was started by King Features to compete with Dick Tracy which started in 1931 and was having phenomenal success.  The comic syndicate spent a lot of time putting together what they thought would be the perfect team.  Hammett was a literary giant at the top of his success and Raymond a virtually new and untested talent.  Although the series never delivered the quantity of readers they had hoped for, it ran until 1996.  American Comics Library has previously released the 13 year run written by Archie Goodwin and beautifully illustrated by Al Williamson. These later strips ran under the revised title as Secret Agent Corrigan.  Also just recently announced is the continuation of Archie Goodwin's run starting in 1980 with artist George Evans.Reading these early strips you can see for yourself  their origins.  Dasheill Hammett did four storylines for Secret Agent X-9.  The first story ran a rambling 9 months.  Every succeeding story was shorter.  The second story was a compact three months, the third was even shorter while the final one ran a mere 5 weeks.If there is a problem with these early stories , it is the fault of writer Hammett and not artist Raymond who produced panel after panel of beautiful art.To be fair to Hammett had had no experience in this field.  He also was battling Alcoholism and found a much better source of income that came pouring in from Hollywood after he had already committed to this project.The introduction suggests Hammett based his writing here on the early hero pulp novels of such characters as The Shadow and Doc Savage.  But to my knowledge they more resemble the more disjointed writing of a Movie Serial or Chapter Play.In the first story they jump back and forth from a simple murder, to a pirate episode, then back to a state side drama involving a secret mob boss called The Top.  As X-9  encounters pirates who plan to steal two million dollars in gold bullion from a Luxury Cruise Ship.  What the gold is doing on this type of  boat is not explained.  After the gold is moved to the pirate ship it is bombed by X-9.  Everyone congratulates him completely forgetting about the gold.  When this story finally ends the big reveal of The Top is anti-climatic.The second storyline once again features a secret bad guy named the Mask.  The story ramps up the action as we travel to a ranch in Wyoming.Finally in the third story we get two panels in which Secret Agent X-9 talks about his past . Until then the reader knows nothing about him not even his real name.  He goes by the name Mr. Dexter but we are told that is not his name.After the short fourth Hammett story Don Moore ( the scripter of Flash Gordon and Jungle Jim ) comes in to help Raymond for two stories.  But it seems the syndicate was not happy and hired yet another big name writer.  King Features next hired British Mystery writer Leslie Charteris who had moved to the USA in 1932 to start a career in screen writing.Charteris wrote four Agent X-9 with only the first one being illustrated by Alex Raymond.  The other three included here are by the above mentioned Charles Flanders.  These three stories are new to me and rarely seen.  While Charteris would only spend a little over a year on the strip ,this experience would help him out when The Saint would get his own comic strip in 1948.  That strip would last for 13 years.The failure for this strip to become the success it seemed destined for is often attributed to duo nature of the character sometimes being just a straight detective story then becoming a wild secret agent at times.  The organization X-9 reported to was initially just a secret government agency, but then became the FBI during the years in which the FBI was highly respected. In later years when the FBI fell out favor , X-9 once again just reported to a Secret Government Agency.Re-Reading the strips , I think the biggest problem with the strip is the total lack of any personality for Mr. Dexter and the total lack of any other reocurring supporting characters or villains.I think the first story should have had a flash back to his very tragic origin giving the reader some emotional resonance instead of him being just a generic action hero. This would have helped greatly.  Also a cast of reoccurring supporting characters , a regular love interest and better villains would cemented faithful readers.Presentation wise The American Comics Library hits yet another home run with excellent reproduction, quality paper, and an entertaining introduction. If I have one complaint , and its not really a complaint, it is that the book is too large. The book is a couple inches taller then their standard size used by Steve Canyon and Little Orphan Annie.  It just made it less portable then the others and I found I needed to read from one stationary spot instead of lugging it around with me.  Still I would never advocate for this beautiful art to be printed in a reduced size.  Still this books contains over 300 pages.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN8N16RB4SA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402110#wasThisHelpful","RHN8N16RB4SA7","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always thought this was a great concept that never quite lived up to its potential.  It was based on an idea Marv Wolfman had in 1970 about an Manhattan office building being  transported to a primeval world.After DC comics vetoed the idea Marv brought the concept to Marvel.  Marv and then editor-in-chief Roy Thomas hammered that concept to a bi-monthly series in 1975. Instead of an office building, we got a lead character Jim Scully and three supporting characters all who are transported through the Bermuda Triangle to a Prehistoric world.Collected in this trade are all eight issues of the Skull The Slayer comic and the two issues of  Marvel Two In One  which concluded the series.The four characters all have some form of chip on their shoulders and have trouble gelling as a group. Jim Scully, who becomes Skull the Slayer , is a former Vietnam War P.O.W. who comes home from the war to find his wife has divorced him and is with another man, his parents are dead and his brother is a drug addict who tries to kill him.  Scully then kills his own brother in self-defense but is charged with murder.The other three survivors of the crashed airplane are Jeff Walker a teen aged youth who's father is an overbearing US Senator. Dr. Corey the angry oppressed black man and Ann Reynolds , Corey's assistant, the angry oppressed woman's libber.Steve Gan did the art for the first three issues. Gan is a Filipino artist , not as well known as many of his many of his Filipino colleagues. He was the co-creator of Star Lord.  His art especially for the first two issues is beautiful and perfectly suites this concept. Gan has a fine line style that reminds me of Al Williamson.In issue one we get the introduction with the airplane crash and the characters meeting in this Prehistoric world.Issue two continues with the protagonists bickering and discovering ancient (now dead) astronauts. Scully removes a belt from an alien carcass and gains enhanced strength when wearing it.I love the first two issues but with number three Marv seems to loose his focus as  they suddenly encounter a time tower and robotic dinosaurs.Around this time Marv Wolfman is promoted to Editor-In-Chief and dumps several of his writing assignments.  Issue #4 introduces an entirely new creative team . ""Together again for the fourth time "" proclaims the splash page are the team of Steve Englehart, Sal Buscema and Mike Esposito.  They had all previously worked on Avengers, Defenders and Captain America.Steve Englehart is my favorite 1970's writer but what he does to this book in one issue totally torpedoes the concept. He turns the already hard to identify with Jim Scully into a total A-hole , then kills off the three supporting cast members as Scully shows no concern.  The plot also stinks with robotic versions of Merlin and the Black Knight.Then in issue #5 Bill Mantlo takes over and tries to finish this train wreck of a story and return things to status quo.  Mantlo even resurrects the slain trio.Sal Buscema remains on the book to it's conclusion but is now inked by Sony Trinidad, another Filipino artist and in issue #6 Steve Gan.  In the end of issue #5 Scully saves the life of Dr. Corey and the four start gelling as a team .Issues #6 through #8 are much better and the return of the dinosaur and lost world concept. Mantlo has Scully experience Vietnam flashbacks which relate to the story. He also plants some future issue teasers which never come to fruition as Issue #8 ends on a cliff hanger.A little over a year later Marv Wolfman would return to the world of Skull The Slayer and put a closure to the concept in Marvel Two In One #35 and #36.  Ernie Chan , yet a third Filipino artist illustrates the two issues which has Ben Grimm , The Thing , pilot a plane and rescue our four characters.  Since the concept of Two In One is The Thing plus a different quest star every month Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic joins them for #36.  Actually Reed is only in the final eight pages but it qualifies him for cover billing.While this would wrap up Jim Scully's savage world adventures , the man would reappear later as the costumed character the Blazing Skull.In conclusion this is , for the most part , a fun read , which had some problems along the way and could have been great . Mike Grell's Warlord  was a similar concept which was also started later in that same year 1975 , but would go onto to greater fame because of it's creator stability .  Skull The Slayer just never quite lived up to it's potential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGCWLMBL1DET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785193979#wasThisHelpful","R2GGCWLMBL1DET","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The addition of George Perez to Steve Englehart's very imaginative run makes this volume an instant classic and a delight to re-read.  Collected in this edition are thirteen issues of the Avengers from 1975 and 1976. Avengers #136 to #149.The art for this collection is divided up with George Tuska penciling four issues, George Perez doing seven and Don Heck doing a two issue fill in written by Tony Isabella.Avengers #136 is listed on the Masterwork cover but all you really get is the new Gil Kane cover since it was a reprint of the recently collected Beast solo story from Amazing Adventures #12.Avengers #137 and #138 is the two part story that kicks off the volume. George Tuska and inker Vince Colletta are the art team. While some argue about their artistic merits , I find their art to be so Iconic that it delights me.  The over all theme of the entire volume would be the ""Building Of The Team "" with many Avengers entering and exiting the team.  This volume features the return of Janet and Hank Pym as the Wasp and the Yellowjacket.  Plus Moondragon takes a more active role and The Beast debuts in his new furry form . The villain for this pair of issues appears to be the Stranger , but in reality turns out to be someone else.  According to Englehart's excellent introduction he was disappointed with George Tuska's initial depiction of the Beast so he recruited Jim Starlin to redraw his first head shot .Some of the other touches I enjoyed from this story was seeing the Vision and the Scarlet Witch on Honeymoon vacation and Hank McCoy disguising himself as Edward G. Robinson.In Avengers # 139 Hank Pym's nemesis Whirlwind returns to battle him while his wife lays helpless in the Hospital.Hank Pym is injured in that battle also and can not stop growing , so in Avengers #140 the returning Vision must go inside the body of Hank  Pym. This is entire flip of Roy Thomas classic story (Avengers #93 ) where Hank Pym entered the body of the Vision .George Perez makes his debut as regular penciler in Avengers #141 in a story which brings Marvel's teen romance character Patsy Walker in to the Avengers world. Engelhart had previously used her in his Beast solo stories and now continues her storyline here.  This issue also reintroduces the Squadron Supreme who are all clever analogs of DC's Justice League of America.  My favorite inside joke is that the Green Arrow analog the Golden Archer has a secret identity as a man named McDonald.  Get it. Kang is the villain.Englehart has a simultaneous story going on that started with Avengers #142  and #143 which follows Thor and Moondragon as they go back in time and discover that Hawkeye has joined all Marvel's Western Heroes on a team. So the Avengers meet Two Gun Kid, Ringo Kid, Rawhide Kid and Night Rider (formerly Ghost Rider ). This is a great adventure and my favorite of the collection.  We do get a few pages of the present day storyline with the Squadron Supreme, but that is the ""B"" story.Avengers #144 returns our focus back to the Squadron Supreme as Patsy Walker becomes an actual Super Hero, the Hellcat.When the Western time travel story ends Two Gun Kid accompanies Hawkeye back to the future and they ride off together. Steve Englehart urges readers to follow their future adventures in the pages of Marvel Spotlight.  Sadly this was never to have happened.Next we get two fill in issues Avengers #145 and #146 which breaks the continuity of Englehart's story.  Apparently Englehart is still ticked off about it because 40 years later in his introduction he refuses to comment on it other then to indicate their was a war raging for editorial control since Stan Lee left the position.  That much is true when this volume started Len Wien was Editor In Chief , then Marv Wolfman and by Avengers #150 Gerry Conway would have the position and upset Englehart enough so that he leave both the Avengers and Marvel.Anyways the two parter appears to be have done for the just canceled Giant Size Avengers. Tony Isabella writes this strange story from an idea by Scott Edelman.  Don Heck does the art and Keith Pollard ads three additional pages at the beginning of Avengers # 146 to stretch it out two issues. The one shot villain or villainess The Assassin is seen at the beginning of the story with a costume which appears to be a set of chain mail with a hood that goes down past his knees golfing. This page cracked me up as imagined actually golfing in an outfit like this.The plot has a lot of holes in it and the characters actions all seem pretty strange.Avengers #147 to #149 returns Englehart and Perez to the book and finishes up the Squadron Supreme storyline which now highlights the Serpent Crown introduced in the Sub-Mariner book.  Just a point of clarification when Roy Thomas first introduced this concept the Squadron Sinister was a group of four villains including NightHawk who went good.  Later Roy introduces the Squadron Supreme as good guys , some of who have the same costumes even, but they had different identities.  This apparently confused for many including the editorial staff who twice in this volume call the Squadron Supreme the Squadron Sinister on the covers of Avengers #141 and #147.  Then even Englehart gets confused as he had Iron Man referring to his recent battle with Doctor Spectrum not realizing it was the other Doctor Spectrum from the Squadron Sinister.The back matter consists of art used for Avengers Marvel Treasury edition,  promotional Avengers ads, and original art reproductions. The art and color restoration are excellent and Steve Englehart's excellent introduction runs three pages so he can cover his final couple of stories from the next volume.For 40 year old stories , I found this volume to be highly entertaining and I give it my strongest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI69F7P4IDWXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785191968#wasThisHelpful","RI69F7P4IDWXE","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Epic Collection format with phone book size and great full color reproduction on quality paper.  But this is the first one that kind of became a chore to finish.  I debated giving it only three stars but I decided to be generous and round this 3.5 star book up.Collected from the cover dated years of 1991 and 1992 we get three connected Annuals, ten issues of Amazing Spider-Man and a stand alone graphic novel.The volume starts with three connected Annuals, Amazing Spider-Man Annual #25, Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #11 and Web of Spider-Man Annual #7.  During this time Marvel had decided to make the Annuals 64 pages long so you get over 50 pages of new content.  Each had a lead story of around 25 pages then a bunch of smaller stories featuring Spider-Man related characters.  These are also included.The lead connected storyline is written by David Michelinie and spins out of characters and concepts from his then current Iron Man run.  The art is by Guang Yap for the first and last part and Marvel Legend Marie Severin for the middle section.  The story is about Roxxon Industries creation of a synthetic Vibranium . Spider-Man teams with Iron Man and the Black Panther to take on Sunturian, The Ghost, The Kingpin and Ultron.The backups are a good idea in concept , but turn out to be mostly a waste of space.  We get four different three page ""the origin of...."" stories with Spider-Man, Green Goblin, Hobgoblin and Venom.  Venom gets another story ""The Truck Stop Of Doom "" which is just as good as the title suggests.  Fred Hembeck does a story of young Peter Parker story which is fun. My favorite is The Outlaws three part story. The Outlaws are a bunch of quasi heroes and reformed villains from the pages of Spider-Man.  They are Silver Sable, The Prowler, Will-o-wisp , Sand Man and Rocket Racer.  Rocket Racer also gets his own solo story battling Speed Demon.  Steve Ditko does a Chance story.  And even The Rhino gets his own story which is really just a Spider-Man story, since Spider-Man appears on page two defeats Rhino and it over.When Erik Larsen left Amazing Spider-Man it was decided to bring Mark Bagley over to the book following his 25 issue run on New Warriors.  Amazing Spider-Man#351 and #352 starts Bagley's run as regular artist for the book with Michelinie as writer. In the story Nova teams up with Spider-Man to battle a three headed Sentinel.Nova returns for guest writer All Milgrom's six part ""Round Robin"" story (Amazing Spider-Man #353 to #358 )which ran all summer as the book came out every two weeks.  This story featured a bloated All Action adventure against The Secret Empire and Midnight who died in the pages of Moon Knight and is brought back here as an evil cyborg.Also guest starring are a bunch more of the 90's Who's Who with Nova, The Punisher, Darkhawk and the hero who's name sounds like a Porno Movie title Night Thrasher.At this point Mark Bagley had now done eight issues in five months so Chris Marrinan comes in for Amazing Spider-Man #359 and #360 . This two part story welcomes back David Michelinie and Cardiac. My favorite part of this story was the use of Peter Parker's supporting cast of friends and Daily Bugle work mates. Up until this story only Mary Jane and Aunt May had been used.Finally we close with the strange graphic novel ""Fear Itself "" which should not be confused with the recent 100 part Mega Event.  The story is plotted by Gerry Conway and scripted by Conway and Stan Lee. If anyone knows the back story of Stan's involvement, I would love to hear it. I can't imagine in 1992 Conway got behind and Stan just came in to help out.  Anyways the plot reads like something out of an Alistair MacLean adventure novel.  Spider-Man and Silver Sable explore an old castle in Germany and battle Nazi's and Ninjas.  The art by Bronze Age Spider-Man legend Ross Andru is some of his best and the last time he would draw Spider-Man before dying in 1993.One of the problems that all these stories share is a carefree and happy Peter Parker.  This is not the character I know and love.  I think his biggest worry is Aunt May's new infatuation with Pro Wrestling.For supplemental material you get information and samples of Mark Bagley's try out book entry,  covers done for collected editions and Spider-Man related trading cards.Recommend for fans of Mark Bagley or ""Die Hard "" Epic Collection collectors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20C7LF71MQKC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785192689#wasThisHelpful","R20C7LF71MQKC9","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Travel back in time to 1972 and 1973 when these stories first appeared in Iron Man issues #54 to #67. Fourteen comics have been reprinted and remastered so that they look outstanding on glossy paper with laser sharp reproductions.The lions share of the creative work here is from young writer Mike Friedrich who had just jumped on the book with #48 but would have a lengthy run. He was only 22 years old but had already had spent 5 years working at DC comics.George Tuska started comics in 1939. He worked on Fawcett's Captain Marvel in the 40's and the Buck Rogers newspaper strip in the 60's. His Iron Man run lasted almost 10 years.Iron Man #54 opens the collection with an Iron Man and Sub-Mariner battle. Sub-Mariner legend Bill Everett gives Tuska a hand penciling his creation. Madame McEvil the hot looking villainess with the bald head would later become a part of both the Thanos legacy and Avengers team as Moondragon.Next we get the big one as Jim Starlin takes over Iron Man #55 with his creations of Thanos and cast.  Including first appearances of not just Thanos but Dax the Destroyer, the Blood Brothers, Mentor and Starfox.  Starlin would create the characters, plot the story and pencil the works.  Friedrich does scripting.  This is a great story.Starlin would stay on the book for a second issue but now just as a penciler in issue #56. It is nice art but  Steve Gerber writes a rather lame issue with one shot villains Rasputin and Fangor. Even the cameo from Dr. Strange does not save this bizarre story.George Tuska returns for the two part battle with the Mandarin and the Unicorn in Iron Man #57 and #58. Steve Gerber plots the two issues and scripts the first part.  Friedrich scripts the second part and returns as writer for the remainder of the book.  The Mandarin is undercover as Gene Kahn .  This is a fun story which brings back Happy Hogan and Pepper back into the supporting cast.Iron Man #59 is a good single story in which Stark goes to Detroit where he spends most of the rest of this book. He battles returning villain Firebrand and gets a new love interest in the form of Roxie Gilbert (Firebrand's sister ).In Iron Man #60 and #61 we get shellhead fighting Daredevil's old foe the Masked Marauder.Next we get a single story (Iron Man #62 ) with another old villain Whiplash. Young  P. Craig Russell does a fill in issue early in his career.  John Romita Sr. is called in to do so many art corrections he actually gets a credit on the title page.  It mostly looks like he had to fix faces that might have looked too different.Next we get what someone on the title page of Iron Man #66 calls ""perhaps the greatest Iron Man saga ever told"".  I disagree and found this four part story to be my least favorite of the entire volume. I found it be a convoluted mess in which Friedrich is so eager to surprise us that the story stops making sense. Dr Spectrum is a cool villain . He was created to be an alternate earth version of the Green Lantern in the Squadron Sinster.  Now he needlessly becomes a Skrull who can hop to different bodies.  Iron Man spends an entire issue battling the villain Rokk only to find out he is a creation of Dr Spectrum's prism gem. Then in the final part Thor appears to battle an Iron Man possessed by the entity that was formerly in Dr Spectrum body. But who is in Iron Man costume that gets possessed ? We see Tony Stark, Happy Hogan and former sparring partner Eddie March all in the Iron Man suit.It is Eddie March who gets his clock cleaned by Thor.  Poor Eddie is forever taking abuse. In the final story from Iron Man #67 to save Eddie's life Tony subjects Eddie to the same experiment that turned Happy Hogun into the villain called the Freak.  It of course also changes Eddie in to the Freak. The Freak is eventually restored to Eddie March after a big fight but it is revealed that Eddie sustains enough injuries in the battle that he will be in a wheelchair for life.  Poor Eddie.This a fun collection of Iron Man stories which takes me back to my boyhood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7OTYJUCWTF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785191909#wasThisHelpful","R3F7OTYJUCWTF1","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six months ago I bought the first Ms. Marvel trade and was delighted by how fresh, original and charming the first volume was.  Now I am very happy to report that the second collection is just as great.G. Willow Wilson takes on a new journey of exploration for our heroine Kamala Khan.  Kamala is a Pakistani American and ""fan girl"" attending  High school in New Jersey.  The six issues collected here are from single issues #6 to #11 published in 2014.The first two issues in this volume form a single story which serves as a prequel the main saga. In th his arc Ms. Marvel has her first official team up as she battles along side of Wolverine who has lost his healing factor.  As has been proven in the past Logan (Wolverine) has pretty good chemistry with teen aged girls . Kitty Pryde and Jubilee come to mind.  The action takes place in the sewers with giant alligators.  Kamala initially thought she was a mutant but Logan figures out her secret.While regular artist Adrian Alphona takes a break Jacob Wyatt steps in for the two issue series. His art is similar enough to the previous art that it is not jarring. Wyatt style resembles Mike Allred but done with a finer line . His Wolverine looks a little fat in some panels, other then that I have no complaints.At the end of this of this arc Wolverine speaks to Medusa of the Inhumans and she takes an interest in Kamala and sends Lockjaw to locate her.Then for the remainder of the four issues Lockjaw becomes Ms. Marvel's sidekick as they battle the evil Inventor.  The villain who's head looks like a cockatiel. Along the way  Kamala's High School comes under attack by a giant robot.For these final four issues regular artist Adrian Alphona returns.  His charming style looks like a cross between Anime and Mad Magazine.  It is the perfect accompaniment to G. Willow Wilson's delightful storytelling.This book is very highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5S57VQJ0BTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEC30NY#wasThisHelpful","RW5S57VQJ0BTS","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The third volume features another nine issues of Eclipse Comics Airboy ( Airboy #26 through #34) plus an Airboy spin off The Air Maidens plus two crossovers.  One with Mr. Monster and one with The Prowler. Over 300 pages of fun 1980's comics.These volumes are big and thick like an Marvel Epic Collection done on thicker paper then an Epic book.  Unfortunately IDW is still using that tan pseudo aged paper stock which mutes the vibrant colors and makes them look dull.The book features a great new cover from Tim Truman and another informative introduction by original writer Chuck Dixon.  The book opens with the Air Maidens special. The team consists of Valkyrie , the new Black Angel whom we met in the Valkyrie mini-series plus the new creation of La Lupina a female Hispanic version of Sky Wolf.  The story showcases some nice ""good girl art"" from Larry Elmore a great from the TSR school of gaming books and magazines.The lead Airboy story for issues #26 to #30 is a great five part battle royale with all of Airboy's villains teaming up to combat all of his allies. Lots of fun. We get eight Sky Wolf backs set in the 1950's plus a lead in story to the Mr. Monster crossover.  The two Sky Wolf back ups done by Dan Spiegle are things of beauty. The first of these stories which featured Sky Wolf and Riot talking is a touching tale and my favorite of the entire volume.In the Mr. Monster story, The Heap also is featured. This is another touching tale of a washed up alcoholic comic artist named Everett W. Coleman.  This character I believe is inspired by Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett who's battle with the bottle prevented him from ever getting the acclaim he deserved.  Plastic Man's creator Bill Cole who committed suicide at an early age may also be the other inspiration.The book ends with The Prowler crossover which who was a Tim Truman and John K Snyder creation.  By my calculations we have two more archives to go and I eagerly await them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMLFJUGVQ0U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402161#wasThisHelpful","R2KMLFJUGVQ0U2","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hardcover book collects Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming new creator owned comic.  Fifteen years earlier the same two creators  broke new ground with the award winning series Powers.  Can the two catch lighting in a bottle twice is what I set  to find out.Bendis started his comic career as a writer and artist of crime fiction and is now returning to it so it seems a very natural fit.  I find Bendis to be Marvel's consistently best scripter who rarely disappoints.Omeing conversely does not fair as well in my opinion. It all depends on who is paired with. Of course I loved his Powers work at the time and thought he was Artistic Genius, while other times I find his work to be too stiff and primitive for my liking.I know Bendis , a one time artist himself, spends a lot of thought pairing the correct artist to the correct project.  By the end of the volume Oeming had won me over on this project and I could not imagine a different artist.One problem I had , especially early in the volume, was several times I was confused on panel layout in not knowing if the panels flowed across a two page spread or if each page was made to read separately.  I found this distracting and could have been fixed with either better page layout or by the colorist using different color palettes on each page so that you knew when the pages were a separate entity.Colorist Taka Soma uses mostly dark monochromatic color schemes.  This coupled with Omeing's heavy use of black and black space makes the results look a little too dark for my taste.  I would have preferred either more pastels colors or perhaps skipping the coloring entirely and just going black and white for a very noir feel.As for the story itself it is an excellent tale of a parallel reality in which the Crime families have been the dominant way of life.  Society in America is controlled by five crime families each with its own territory.The story opens with Valentine Gallo becoming a ""made man"" and sent on a mission which should have been a cake walk.  He was to give a senator a suitcase.  It ends up killing the senator and he finds himself in trouble with both the CIA and all the families.His only ally a sexy ginger hit-woman named Jagger Rose. Even Valentine's own mother tells him a dangerous secret which shocks him to his core.Along the way Bendis breaks the Valentine narrative to give us key glimpses into the alternate history in which the Crime Families made a major difference in how things turned out.The books contains the first six issues including a double sized first issue published by Marvel's Icon line in 2014.  Also included is the covers and alternate covers plus the Bendis script for the first issue . Plus you get the original sketches and character designs done by both Bendis and Oeming.This is just the start of a rich and powerful epic and the more I read the more I got drawn into this world.  I highly recommend this volume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGD3G5W102BT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519150X#wasThisHelpful","RGD3G5W102BT3","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sometimes don't see the point in reviewing something like this book which already has 24 other reviews. Does anyone really need to read 25 reviews before deciding to spend their $8 on a paperback.So here goes anyway. I love Max Allen Collins Quarry and can not wait for the Cinemax TV series.  Quarry is a stone cold killer. At the time of this writing there are 11 Quarry novels and a short story collection.The first novel originally called the Broker is now titled Quarry.  I recommend you read it first.  After that read them in any order. They jump around in the years that they are set in so it doesn't really matter.  Collins will bring you up to speed.  This is my 7th.The plot this time revolves around Quarry getting caught in between two warring illegal gambling operations. Hence the title.Quarry is no longer just a killer, now he kills the killers before they can kill you for a price.  I think this makes him a quasi good guy, but that is a fine line.In this story he kills people, gets beaten up a lot, beats up people and has a lot of sex.  If this is the kind of thing you enjoy you will love this book.  Nobody does it better then Max Allen Collins. Also Ron Lesner does an excellent cover.And if by any chance you really did read this review please either click on the ""helpful"" button or leave a comment saying yes I actually read your review, which will impress the heck out of me. In the meantime I will hold my breath and check in every few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FUJ94MOR5LU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LXS758#wasThisHelpful","R3FUJ94MOR5LU0","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Horse has taken this rare European graphic novel and given it a very fitting classy new edition it so rightly deserves.  The one thing this volume could use is some background information so I will attempt to provide that in the course of this review.Joe Kubert's contributions to the field of comics art are legendary. First as artist himself with beautiful art starting in Golden Age of comics with illustrations for early DC superheroes like the Flash and Hawkman spanning to his award-winning graphic novels done in the last couple decades of his life.  Second as the father of Adam and Andy Kubert his equally talented sons.  And third as the creator of The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art where he has mentored hundreds of people working today in comics, animation and related fields.This 230 page graphic novel was originally printed in Italian in 2001. There was an obscure English-language version printed in 2005 by a company called SAF comics.  I also own that version, it is printed in black and white and is a softcover.  This is printed on glossy high quality paper in full color in Hard Cover with a dust jacket. If you own or have seen the Kubert Tarzan Archives also done by Dark Horse this is done in the exact same format with equally good production values.Tex Willer is the longest running Italian comic book.  First created in 1948 and continuing today.  Over 1,100 regular Tex Willer comics have been published plus large 230 page TexOne specials of which this is one of. Tex has worldwide appeal, in the Nordic countries his adventures rate almost as much admiration as those of the Donald Duck family of books.Tex Willer has a long history and continuity with three regular traveling companions and a large cast of continuing characters and villains. For this story it was decided that Tex would ride alone hence the subtitle The Lonesome Rider.As a favor to the Italian publishers of his Graphic Novels , Joe agreed to do this story for them provided he had unlimited time to complete it. According to an interview he says he worked on it on and off for seven years while teaching full time and taking other side work.The story itself written by current Tex Willer writer Claudio Nizzi is a good one but a little bit of a cliche.  On his way to visit a farm couple and their teen daughter who he has not seen in around fifteen years Tex discovers all three have been recently murdered by three whites and an Indian.  They discover Tex in pursuit and dump him and his horse over a cliff.  Recovering from the fall the story splinters in to four separate storylines as he pursues each killer alone.The art by Joe Kubert is kinetic and powerful with lush swatches of black inking. Every brush stroke is purposely placed.  The coloring I am guessing was done in house by Dark Horse and strangely not credited.  The coloring is done in a traditional flat style with subdued tones which do not distract from the art. I would not like to see this done with current overrendered style with the dark palate which is in current vogue.One minor disappointment is on pages 9 through pages 13 Joe Kubert originally drew the young lady bathing nude . Even though the front side naughty bits are totally covered the Italian publisher who is described as very Catholic forced Joe to make her bathing in a full length petty coat, which seems strange. Even stranger after she is murdered she is clearly depicted as nude.  I have seen scans of a limited edition of the original art published in an earlier promotional version done for the Nordic countries.  Also in that Graphic Novel it had depictions of Tex Willer's supporting cast who do not appear in story.  Those would have made great extras.But what we do get is excellent and a welcome addition to any lover of Joe Kubert's art and a classic Western story which is a fun read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEN6WSNLRTEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161655620X#wasThisHelpful","RUEN6WSNLRTEB","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the AudioGo audio book which came out in 2012.  First any book written by Donald Westlake is well worth reading or listening to.The book is the final in the John Dortmunder series because Mr. Westlake would die shortly after writing it.  The Dortmunder books are the polar opposite of the Parker books he would write under his Richard Stark alias.  The Parker books about are also about a thief but they are cold, calculating and hard boiled. The Dortmunder books are about a gang of crooks we are bumbling misfits. The books are loaded with humor. This one especially had me laughing out loud.The premise is a reality show company wants to make a TV show out of Dortmunder's crew robbing something, meanwhile the crew wants to pull a job ripping off the TV shows parent company.  Westlake shares some hilarious insights into the nature of Reality TV.While this is the last book in the series, newcomers will have no problems getting into the story.  The first book in the series has been made into the movie ""The Hot Rock"". The narrator does an excellent job of creating different voices for all of Dortmunder's motley crew.Very entertaining and Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38AP0DVNY4PRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160998806X#wasThisHelpful","R38AP0DVNY4PRY","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is volume seventeen of what was meant to be the definitive Conan run. The series started so wonderfully with the team of Kurt Busiek and Cary Nord. It has maintained a pretty high quality run up until the recent two year series by Brian Wood which many fans (myself included) found to be lacking in both the writer's and artist's portrayal of Robert E Howard's barbarian.So how does the new team do ?  The writing by new writer Fred Van Lente is quite good but suffers a little from a slow start where Conan seems to wandering around for awhile and numbing himself with alcohol from the loss of Belit. By the third issue (this was originally published as six comics ) the main plot was starting to really come to together and from then on I greatly enjoyed the book. This is the point in the story when Conan takes a position as Captain of the guards. I really enjoyed Fred's run on Marvel's Hercules and expect even greater things for him in the future as he settles into the book.Brian Ching was announced as the regular artist but unfortunately was able to complete only the first half of the book, but will return in future volumes. Brian Ching is a Californian artist who has been making a name for himself on Dark Horse's Star Wars books. I found the art initially to be a bit too cartoony for my taste. His depiction of Conan is a little too much like that of during Brian Wood's run where he looked like a scrawny ""emo "" teen.  While not quite that bad I would like to see him a little more muscular.By the third issue either Brian's art improved or I just started to enjoy his style a lot more I am not sure which.  But I saw John Buscema like characteristics to Brian's art start to emerge.  Then he was gone.Replacing him for the second half of the book is Brazilian artist Eduardo Francisco.  Mr Francisco reminds me a little of Mike Deodota , but not quite as polished. The styles are similar so it isn't too jarring.The colors by Michael Atiyeh are excellent and helps unify the art.So bottom line is the book been restored to the level of greatness it once held in my heart ?  Well to be honest, no.  But I think it is well on the road to recovery and I expect bigger and better things in the future. I encourage you to sample this volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SP2Y4P7JODY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161655522X#wasThisHelpful","R39SP2Y4P7JODY","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the problems inherit in Doc Savage seems to be the need to re-imagine the character for a new generation. DC comics did this poorly twice. Now rising comics writer Chris Roberson takes a stab at it with six single issues and one two part story all loosely connected. Also collected is the 2014 Annual by an entirely different team. All nine of these comics where published by Dynamite Comics in 2014.I so badly wanted to love this book and give it five stars but it just falls short. Roberson concept for the series is to start with issue #1 set in 1933 then advance the story a decade or so every issue until the final two set in 2014. For those interested #2 is set in 1949, #3 in 1961, #4 in 1979, #5 in 1988 and issue #6 in 2000.Due to events in the story Doc ages very little, his cousin Pat does age but at a reduced rate , but the famous five sidekicks all age normally so that they are only featured in the first couple stories. So Chris Roberson spends a lot of time introducing new sidekicks who last a couple issues then are replaced by new ones. Yes this is more politicaly correct as we get more females and nationalities on to the team. But I think Roberson has bitten off more then he can chew as there just is not enough space to flesh out all these characters and most of them seem rather bland. The other major idea Roberson seems fascinated with is Doc's manipulation of the criminal Brain as a means to reform them. This an idea that really doesn't work today and by dwelling on it makes Doc look less heroic which may or may not be Roberson's point. But just wished he would not have gone there.Part of the fun of a Doc Savage novel is crazy and outlandish villains. This story would have benefited from maybe one also Immortal villain to tie the stories together or at least more colorful ones.The art from female Brazilian artist Bilquis Evely is technically drafted quite well with very solid intricate panels.  The only fault I find in her work is the characters look quite stiff and posed. She also draws uniformly neutral faces with very little emotion.The eight covers painted by Alex Ross are things of beauty and worth the price of the book alone.  John Cassidy provides eight alternative covers, each a tribute to an earlier incarnation of Doc. These are also excellent.  Roberto Castro provides the art for Doc Savage Annual. His art while not as detailed as Evely's is much more kinetic and dynamic. I preferred it to the main story's.The Annual is written by Shannon Eric Denton . It starts early in Doc's career in 1930 then goes back earlier to World War One with Doc and his aides battling side by side.  Overall I think I enjoyed this story more then the series.  Two things bothered about the story. First seeing two Colonels and a General all in the trenches fighting together with enlisted men and lesser officers. Secondly the portrayal of Doc Savage as a womanizer.Overall as a Doc Savage fan I am recommending this omnibus.  It was a lot of fun seeing The Man Of Bronze back in any incarnation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WS8HNL2NEIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160690583X#wasThisHelpful","R10WS8HNL2NEIY","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I have been reading all the Masterworks I have found that Sub-Mariner run to be the most consistently excellent of all the Marvel Silver Age Masterworks. Well this volume takes a little dip in quality as teen aged Gerry Conway takes over for Roy Thomas .This volume collects Sub-Mariner 39 to 49 with Daredevil 77 as an added bonus. These books all originally published in 1971 and 1972 have been loving restored so they look perfect.The first story from Sub-Mariner 39 is Roy Thomas's swan song as he departs the book.  As the story opens Lady Dorma has been killed and Namor has returned to New York and the abandoned Prison Island as his new ""Fortress of Solitude"". In this story he demonstrates a new super power, the ability to punch stone walls and sculpt aquatic statutes. Why he won't prefer a palace under water is not explained. Besides that question this is a tight little story that sets up Namor's quest for his father and a whirlwind tour of the USA and other dimensions. The art for this issue is by Ross Andru and Jim Mooney and is very solid.Next we get Daredevil 77 . While this does features the best art in the book, Gene Colan and Tom Palmer, it does not really need to be included.  It was just recently printed in a Daredevil Masterworks.  Sub-Mariner does not show up till the story is half through. Not a bad story but I skimmed it since I just read it. The coloring error from original is carried over for the third time as Mary Jane Watson becomes a blonde.The second part of this story in Sub-Mariner 40 is not as successful. At the end DD 77 Namor and Spiderman where brought to another dimension so that they can fight a lame bad guy named Turalla.  This story is way over written and kind of confusing. SpiderMan just kind of hangs around and has no purpose in the story. Nice art by Colan but Sam Grainger is not a good fit inking.OK let me make a few things clear before I rip on Gerry Conway a little. First he was just breaking into comics with only a dozen or so scripts written.  Second he was a mere teen aged boy just learning his craft. Third he learned very quickly and became one of my favorites. I found his first five issues to be problematic, but the last five issues in this collection are quite enjoyable.Now on to Sub-Mariner 41 and 42 this two parter was either inspired by the TV show Dark Shadows or the writings of HP Lovecraft or both. The story starts off clear enough with Namor being knocked out the sky by some nameless force. But then we meet one lame monster after another and by the second issue things have become so muddled I don't what is going on. Just as try to stop my head from spinning up pops up two robotic characters who work for Mr. Kline. They fight for two pages then disappear forever. Mr. Conway just loads every page with word balloons but it serves no purpose. It is like Gerry is just trying to impress the readers with his large vocabulary and has given up on this train wreck up a plot. The art for both of these issues is not helped by George Tuska who delivers some lackluster pencils.The Sub-Mariner world tour continues as Namor goes to Boston and we meet another lame-o from another the people of the Black Sea. This one is named Tuval  instead of Turalla . Sub-Mariner 43 is the issue in which Marvel for one month tried to emulate DC's attempt to go double size for a quarter. It would be interesting to find out how much notice the creators got but this one seems very padded. Much better scripting by Gerry even if I did like the basic plot. Very nice art from Gene Colan and Mike Esposito helps.Sub-Mariner 44 and 45 is a two parter that was created to be a single issue but then cut in half when Marvel quickly went back to 32 page comics. I believe Golden Age reprint stories appeared as back ups but are not included in this collection. This story I enjoyed and brings back the classic pairing of Namor and The Human Torch.  Conway cranks up the soap opera elements of his writing which would become a his trademark. Marie Severin does the art for both parts.Gene Colan returns in Sub-Mariner 46 as Namor finally gets to meet and then lose his Dad.  A good story but I wish Gerry had kept Captain McKenzie around longer. Also Namor gets Amnesia once again.This Masterworks volume closes on a high note as we get Conway's best yarn a three parter all illustrated by Colan in Sub-Mariner 47, 48 and 49. Still in tour mode we start in Chicago for the first issue before we head to New Orleans for the final two parts.  We meet Cindy Jones who looks to be a love interest for Namor. She would leave the book in issue 50  right after Conway departed. The plot involves Doctor Doom, Modok and the Cosmic Cube.All together this is mixed bag with a good first story , then some dip in the quality of the writing . Finally it finishes quite strong.The next volume brings back Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett for a nice run as writer or co-writer and penciler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S62QT7W2BI0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785191844#wasThisHelpful","R2S62QT7W2BI0V","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a life long comics fan makes a new discovery it is a happy day. Such was a day was in late 2011 when the first volume Classic Comics Press  Cisco Kid comic strips collection arrived.  I had long ago learned to respect the taste of publisher Charles Pelto and I pre-ordered the book blind.  Of course I had heard of Cisco Kid, but as a youth I avoided anything in the War or Western genre.But the first volume totally blew me away.  Good stories and the art of Jose Luis Salinas was just fantastic. Clearly in the school of Alex Raymond and Al Williamson came master illustrator Jose Luis Salinas. This Argentine artist did beautiful fine line as good as the best of them.  Excited for more I waited and waited. Now after over three years comes the second volume and it is every bit as good, if not better then that first volume.Cisco Kid was created by famous writer O.Henry in 1907 in the early pulps. He went on to star in 28 feature films and 156 episodes of one TV's first color TV shows.  I have been exploring some of these and all though they may be a little juvenile they are not bad. But I like my Cisco in Black and White. The Black and White of Salinas daily comic strip. Sadly a Sunday section was never created.This book features an excellent introduction by Marvel Comics ground breaker Don McGregor and another article about Salinas life featuring many illustrations by Salinas in color. And the Main Course 25 months worth of daily strips from February 1953 to March 1955. Eight complete stories and 248 pages.The second story ""The Artist"" was shot from Production Proofs and looks perfect. But the rest of it was shot from sixty year old newspaper clippings. Considering this, they look amazing and I would not want to guess how many countless man hours went into this restoration process. This was especially difficult when seeing the intricate fine line work produced by Salinas. The artist I think Salinas mostly closely resembles would be EC Comics Legend Reed Crandall.  We have beautiful Iconic full length panels of Bar Room Brawls and Scenic Outdoor Panoramas. I often found myself pulled out of the story as I became lost just studying the art.I was planning to go over each story individually since I have read it cover to cover but I would like to keep this review short enough to keep your interest and still let you have the fun of watching the stories unravel.  The stories are the work of writer Rod Reed. Since the comic strip was created shortly after the TV series they ran simultaneously at this time.  So the strip had to appeal to both the younger crowd who adored the TV show and the adults who still avidly read the Comic Strips section in the 1950's.The stories are mostly self contained but we do see some overlap a few tomes like when Pancho disappears after one story or Cisco is still still romancing a young lady.  Rod Reed does a pretty good job at mixing up the stories. So we get a pulse pounding action romp, then a more humor filled story followed by one with lots of Romance.  And make no mistake about it Cisco was ""a ladies man"" unlike most do-gooders of this era. Pancho his portly side kick was both comedy relief and a deadly sharp shooter himself.""Probation For Waco"""" was my favorite story of this volume,  An aged ex-con Cisco Kid put in jail comes looking for Cisco. Life is rough for him, nobody will hire him and he can't force himself to ""rat"" out another criminal so that Cisco will trust him.  This is a poignant little story.This volume comes with my Highest Recommendation.  The publisher has promised a shorter time between volumes which is great because I am already eager for more of this almost lost Classic.  This is a book that deserves shelf space in the library of every serious connoisseur of classic comic art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFGJKIC3W7RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990412016#wasThisHelpful","RLFGJKIC3W7RR","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never seen a book listed on Amazon that more badly needed a review then this one. Neither the cover or the very cryptic description gives you any idea of what this book is even about.I assumed from the cover it was a novel about the sea-faring adventures of one Abel Smith.  What this is a collection of six inter-connceted short stories featuring a youth from Nantucket who after a time on a whaler ship settles in the town of Yerba Buena, California.  It starts in the year 1846.  I had to goggle Yerba Buena after the first story to discover that this is the city that will become San Francisco.  This fact is explained in later stories but an introduction might have served to set it up better.These stories all appeared in different issues of the pulp magazine Short Stories in 1945 and 1946. Short Stories for those unfamiliar, was one of the upper tier of pulps publishing some up the best fiction to be found.Yerba Buena was a small,just emerging town which had just come under the USA flag.  Being on the San Francisco Bay it was becoming a major west coast harbor and a stopping point for many ships.  The stories themselves are all about doing commerce in this frontier town. If this sounds a little boring you have not read much H. Bedford Jones. The man could write a phone book and make it interesting. I can not imagine an author today writing about Economics in a frontier town and giving us six such enchanting stories. Now days it all about action and explosions. This is about one man using his brain to resolve problems and outwit his competition.The very first story deals with 22 year old Abel Smith's first day in Yerba Buena and how he arrives with two dollars in his pocket and by the end of the day he is a partner in a General Store.  The stories progress over a period of time with many re-occrring characters we meet.  In each story Smith has a different problem and each story has it's own resolution which involves Smith being just a little bit more clever then his opponents and out thinking them.In one story he helps start a flour mill, in another he goes on a salvage mission for the cargo of a ship wreck , in yet another his business partner is upset with him for what he thinks are foolish purchases,The sixth stories introduces a love interest for Abel Smith and definitely ties up all the sub-plots into a neat little finale. The fantastic but misleading cover by Rudolph Belarski is from an 1939 issue of Argosy.  The six issues of Short Stories covers which featured Alex Smith stories in their contents are shown on the back cover. Unfortunately they are all smaller then postage stamp size so it hard to know if any of them even featured Alex Smith, my guess is no. We also get all seven of the original illustrations by Fred Humiston.All together a beautiful package with clear large print on quality white paper. Just to nitpick a small issue , I did find a couple typos. This is a first for any Altus Book I have read.H. Bedford Jones is known as ""The King Of The Pulps"" not only because quantity (200 novels, 400 novelettes and 800 short stories) but for his quality. This is one of 10 matched editions Altus Press has released so far with new ones just recently announced.  I plan to read them all and I think you should too.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0NPN0ZXY4QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618271679#wasThisHelpful","R1M0NPN0ZXY4QI","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stark House Press brings us the first three novels (of six) written about former Mob Man Daniel Port.  Written in 1956 and 1957 for the emerging Men's Action Market taking place in the new 'Paperback"" format for the leader in this genre Gold Medal Books.Peter Rabe (real name Rabinowitsch) who had only moderate success at the time is now being placed in much higher regard for his Hard Boiled Prose thanks in no small part to Stark House Press who has previously reprinted 14 of Rabe novels in seven deluxe double collections.The titles of the three novels are quite generic and just different ways of saying ""I think I might Die Soon"". My single complaint with this volume is the cover. It is terrible. I know it was done by Stark House Press publisher Mark Sheppard, but please , part of the appeal of these books at the time was the lurid eye catching paintings. I know Stark House might not have the deep pockets to commission new art like Hard Case Crime does, but I find nothing wrong this using the original or re-purposing a great painting.The first novel Dig My Grave Deep is the introduction to the character and explains how Daniel Port is able to leave mobster gang job. Like in a real Mafia organization a lot of the criminal activity deals with real estate and politics. This is only a small portion of the novel but it is an area in which it seemed to slow down the action and pace of the story and made it the weakest of three. Still it is an excellent novel and a necessary set up to the series. The parts involving the want-to-be made man Ramon and his beautiful sister I found to be very realistic and the high light of the book. Rabe writes great three dimensional characters.In the second novel Port is now out of the outfit and moved on. A dying ex-criminal is released from prison.  He just wants to die free but a young punk gangster has other plans for him. With no place to turn he seeks out Daniel Port. This is a dark and tragic Noir in the classic sense and most of the characters have a sense of impending doom hanging over them. Letty the Gun Moll who just wants to dance is an especially tragic figue. She is used by every body in the story including Daniel Port.  For my money this novel packs a gut wrenching impact and was my clear favorite of three. As Rick Ollermann points out in his excellent introduction Peter Rabe follows no formula and these three books are all quite different in tone and style.In the final novel It's My Funeral we encounter a Daniel Port who seems happier and more well adjusted to his new life style. He has moved out to Hollywood and is pursuing a pretty night club singer. His past once more invades his happiness as he encounters an old enemy who wants to use him.  Meanwhile Daniel is trying to help a movie actress who is being black mailed with some pornographic film.  This one packs lots of twists and turns as we try to unravel this intricate plot. During the story we get Peter Rabe's not too subtle take on fame and happiness is on display.  Again this is different type of story and one that we might see in today's era of recent books and media.This is a nice package in over-sized Trade format with typo free easy to read print. I eagerly await the final three novels in a matching omnibus. My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8MR13W4S0KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933586656#wasThisHelpful","RY8MR13W4S0KY","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off there seems to be a debate rising about the format and the amount of white space on the pages. As publisher Daniel Herman explains in an text piece good source material for these rare 1946 and 1947 strips was hard to come by forcing Hermes Press to use both dailies from the the full size strips and the truncated strips some papers ran because of the War caused paper shortage.  If you look on page 258 and 259 for example you can see the two different sizes in comparison.  Short of waiting and locating only full size strips I don't see how this white space problem could have been avoided.  Another complaint is about the shiny glossy paper used by Hermes Press. Personally I have zero complaints about that, I think that is personnel choice . I know I dislike it when publishers use off-white or tan colored paper to make the strips look aged or closer to their pulpy originals.In summation ""No"" these are not quite matching the quality of those put out by The American Library Of Comics .But ""Yes"" they have done a good job at restoration and I will treasure having this volume in my library. The Phantom is America's first costumed super-hero and these stories are a ton of fun.The first story about a brave little girl is called PRINCESS VALERIE. She is abducted by conspirators to her grandfathers throne. This is a charming story. When Valerie is put in a cannibals pot to simmer she complains that they don't know how to give a little girl a bath correctly. This is the last daily strip continuity that Ray Moore (the Phantom's first artist ) would work on because of the nerve damaged he received in World War 2.Starting with QUEEN ASTRA OF TRONDELAY Wilson McCoy would work solo on the strip. This is another jungle adventure with a spoiled and cruel queen who abducts a young man on the eve of his wedding.  Later she develops a crush on The Phantom himself.In the story MISTER HOG the ghost who walks returns to the USA to pursue his love interest in Diane Palmer . But Diane has been tricked into working for Mister Hog, a hideous Crime Boss.  While this is am entertaining story the quality of the reproductions for this story varies greatly with some of the strips look quite poor and some feature fuzzy line work.ROMANCE AND THE VESTAL PIRATES is the final story of the volume and the longest, It covers over a hundred pages and ran for eight months. It is also my favorite of the volume. It starts with a romantic soap opera story and then finishes with another romantic soapy ending. In the middle there is an exciting adventure story involving modern day pirates on a yacht.  The story demonstrates the wide range of Lee Falk's writing skills jumping from humor to romance to action and adventure.As a long time collector of The Phantom I have quite the collection of The Frew Comic Books which reprint the classic strips.  Unlike the earlier volumes  in which I had read most of those stories I found all of these quite new to me.  I am delighted that this series is being reprinted comprehensively in a deluxe Hard Cover format.  Publisher  Daniel Herman promises they have excellent source material for the remaining decades of strips.  I know I will be on board and excited for each release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGQNIM2MZH1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613450826#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGQNIM2MZH1R","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I have never considered myself a Digest collector, I had been a subscriber of the Science Fiction Digests for decades. This digest sized fanzine completely sucked me in and I ended up reading it cover to cover.  The production is flawless and I found no typos. It was filled with tons of cover reproductions and the the two new prose stories had numerous illustrations. The Joe Wehrle Jr. cover was excellent and convinced me to buy this book.My favorite articles of course are related to the SF digests the article about H.L.Gold's run at Galaxy and the interview with current Fantasy & Science Fiction editor Gordon Van Gelder.  That article had the only one error I noticed when the interviewer stated TV Guide was no longer published. I have been a four decade long subscriber. True, it is no longer a digest  (now the size of Time or People) and no longer weekly. It comes out about 30 times a year with numerous double issues covering two weeks.The Archie digests were a gateway to bring my pre-teen daughters into the world of reading, They loved them and I subscribed to a ton of them for them.  I found that article very informative.Even the articles about magazines I never cared about like FATE and CORNET, I found interesting and has tempted me to look for back issues.And WOW the price is a steal . If you are a reader of any kind I recommend this wonderful new book for you. It is great I can't wait for the next issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DGJ306HVAU5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506118267#wasThisHelpful","R2DGJ306HVAU5Y","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume 5 of Steve Canyon brings us another two years of Steve Canyon from 1955 and 1956. The Dailies are printed in crisp black and white and the Sundays in lush full color. Truly the strip has never looked better.Milton Caniff a master from the chiaroscuro school of art is at the top of his game here.  After eight years of doing Steve Canyon, it was a bonafide success and Caniff felt confident enough to tell some very experimental and unique stories here.The first story winds up a stoy-line introduced in the last volume with General Index and his wife with a shaddy past Delta. Pipper the Piper readers should be aware was based on John F. Kennedy.The next story-line reintroduces Doe Redwood while Reed Kimberly who resembles Terry Lee (from Terry and the Pirates) enjoys a romance with a young lady.  Things end very darkly for Doe.  But this story is not nearly as dark as the next one.The next story is my absolute favorite of the volume and a total gut-wrencher. It follows Summer Smith now Summer Olsen as she is trying to escape the evil clutches of the Villainess Copper Calhoon. Copper has her under watch and seems determined to wreck her life and bring her back under her control. Summer experiences a brief taste of happiness in the form of a budding romance. In the meantime Steve plays almost a cameo role in the storyline. We know Canyon is on a path to see Summer.  When he finally meets Summer he completely destroys her life. This by far is one Caniff's best.Caniff must of realized how dark this story was because next he does a 180 and the strip reintroduces Happy Easter and his troop of Hooligans. This starts out as a series of gag and humor strips mostly until ""the Scarlet Princess"" story-line emerges. This story is about actress Savannah Gay getting Happy to finance her next movie.  Besides being beautiful Savannah really has no redeeming qualities, so I found Steve and her romance kind of strange.Next we go very dark place once again for the story involving young General Shanty Town. This is a very realistic and heart breaking story which packs an wallop. The unrequited love story is also very well told.Finally we close out the volume with the Introduction of Steve's cousin Poteet Canyon. Poteet would become a very integral part of the strip for the next three decades so it is fascinating to see her origins.Bruce Canwell does an excellent job once again with his Introduction.He not only sets the stage letting you know what was going on during these years but gives you insights to the makings of the stories featured here.I can not praise high enough the quality of this book from Dean Mullaney and The Library Of American Comics.  It is a delight and made to be treasured and read over and over.My Highest Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q14CAW6TX8ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631401785#wasThisHelpful","R1Q14CAW6TX8ZI","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Masterworks collection reprints 12 issues of Thor from 1973 and 1974. Thor #217 to Thor #228. the writing is by a young Gerry Conway and the art is by Big John Busema for the first ten issues then Rich Buckler steps in for a very capable two issue fill in.  As Gerry points out in his introduction the writing is an improvement from last volume and much more cohesive.  The art is very good.  I remember reading these as High School student and being a bit disappointed in the book at the time. As teenager still desperately clinging to art form my peers found juvenile I found their flying ship ""The Starjammer"" too stupid and very unrealistic.My favorite Thor stories  and the ones I think work best are the ones soaked deeply in Mythology and Legends or the ones with Thor on Earth doing the ""Fish Out Of Water"" type story. Gerry don't do a whole lot of that and mostly uses the book as his venue to do big sprawling Science Fiction stories.The book opens with Thor #217 with Thor and his band of Heroes returning on the StarJammer to find evil duplicates in all their positions in Asgard.Our heroes don't stay is Asgard long as The Starjammmer is refitted and a three issue Space Opera tale  is launcfhed. Thor #218 to Thor #220 Gerry reveals were based on John W. Campbell's ""The Black Star Passes"".Next Greek God Pluto has abducted the lovely young Norse Goddess Krista. So in Thor #221 to #223 Thor goes to Olympus and then to Earth to gain Krista back.  Thor acts like a knuckle head in this story, first believing Hercules is involved in the abduction, then taking time to arm wrestle Hercules to see who should rescue Krista.  This is the start of twenty issues of Hercules hanging around as Thor's side kick. He stayed in the book until Gerry Conway left.  While I love Hercules it did take the attention away from Thor. Herc is an impulsive, lovable rogue and next to him Thor seemed pretty boring.Finally we get an even bigger five part Space Opera tale in Thor #224 through #228 with The Destroyer, the newly introduced Firelord, Ego the Living Planet and Galactus. My favorite parts of the opus was the early parts set on Earth. Thor is forced to become Dr. Don Blake after a year of him being gone.  Some interesting material is explored by Conway when Don Blake tosses the cane that facilitates their body switch out the window and then wonders if he did it on purpose.As Galactus' new herald it appears Conway had bigger plans for Firelord and he did appear in many Conway written books afterwards but never attained the level of success of the Silver Surfer.While I still hate the Starjammer I had a fun time rediscovering these stories and the Buscema and Buckler art is quite nice. The extras are a bit slim in the back of the book with a single pin-up, a couple pages of original art and art done for Thor's Treasury Edition. The reproduction and color restoration is the same fantastic quality we have come to expect from these volumes.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EIQSQHXH7PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785188568#wasThisHelpful","R31EIQSQHXH7PD","A2DZZRWUY6TRWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZZRWUY6TRWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:44 Mins I have a large kitchen with laminate floors and small children so I've always found cordless vacs convenient and almost a necessity in my household. My first generation Shark sweeper served me well but I always had problems with the battery life. This Electrolux so far has demonstrated an excellent battery life with its lithium battery, which charges from a port on the base. It picks up even the smallest of crumbs but it has a little problem with larger items the size of a Cheerio. What makes this most convenient is that it has a quick release button to take the vacuum off and pick up items the base misses. One thing I do not like about this vacuum is that the base is very wobbly and topples over easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPAWYE8ED78Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","RGPAWYE8ED78Z","A3LOGP4VA9DX46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LOGP4VA9DX46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always liked the look and versatility of sheer curtains. These offer my window a little style and the sheer allows me to let some sun in, see outside but peeping eyes cannot see inside during the day. At night with lights on, you can see inside the house. These are a lot more scratchy than I expected them to be. If I saw them in person, I would have probably passed on them because fabric texture and feel is an important quality for me. That said, you also have to consider the price and they are beautiful to look at from a few feet away. My favorite thing about this window treatment is the lattice print. It's very modern, low key and not the dated traditional lace print that I'm not too fond of for my windows. I don't dislike them or love them. I am satisfied for the cost and do feel it is a good value. I'll order a second set to complete the other windows in the room that they are in.

"I don't have previous experience with bike racks as this is my first one. We recently purchased bikes for the entire family and needed this to transport them to the places we like to go. So far I am very pleased with the 4 bike version of the Vertex.Some of the things that I like about this rack are.1) Super easy to install and I'm not mechanically inclined.2) Lightweight - this is subjective but at approximately 40 pounds, this weighs less than many other things I haul in and out of the car on a daily basis (baby stroller)3) Stable and secure - When loaded with 1 or up to 4 bikes, they are securely held. This surprises me because 4 full size bikes is quite a load. In addition, I appreciate the cable lock so I can lock my large investment of bikes onto the rack when they are unattended.4) Design and style - I really like the sleek and clean look of this rack on the back of my car. I also love that I can swing the arm of bikes or sometimes, empty rack out of my way and access my cargo area via the hatchback. Very cool! I can fit my installed rack into my garage but I don't know if this is typical or if I am just lucky.Overall, I am thrilled with this Thule and would recommend it to those looking for a  bike rack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2IP8FSDVK8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6SBMPG#wasThisHelpful","R2A2IP8FSDVK8R","A3LOGP4VA9DX46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LOGP4VA9DX46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could not have come at a better time! As I type, I am laid up in bed nursing a knee injury. I can use this to control my music and volume. I also love the fact that you can set up a tripod and use it as a remote shutter. It has a hidden keyboard as well. When I first paired it to my iPhone 6, it took over my keyboard, assuming I would use the remote for that. There's a button you press to disable that. It uses two CR2025 batteries. The remote is slim, sleek, feels nice in my hand and has just enough weight to it that it doesn't feel like a cheap piece of plastic. I previously purchased and reviewed a piece of junk labeled as a remote. It was horrible. This Satechi is amazing. I am smitten!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FKLF630GHR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00824948U#wasThisHelpful","R38FKLF630GHR1","A3LOGP4VA9DX46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LOGP4VA9DX46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a person who dislikes clutter in a very bad way, I love the small footprint of this Kenwood Compact Processor and blender. I keep the appliances that I do not use very often stored in the cabinet. Due to this units' compact size, attractive and sleek body, I opt to let this reside on the counter. I often make protein shakes when I come home from the gym and having this out on the counter enables me to start on that as soon as I walk in the door. The motor is not as loud and obnoxious as my old blender and mixes the ingredients to perfection. The reservoir itself is also smaller in size and does not hold as much liquid but for a couple shakes, it's perfect for me.  I do not use a food processor as often so that reservoir stays stored in the cabinet until needed. It chops my veggies to my desired consistency and saves me a ton of trouble when preparing meals. I found clean up pretty easy. There are just a few pieces to clean and reassembling them is a breeze. This unit has 2 speeds. I tend to use the high speed the most for the blender and the low for chopping.  Grating my own blocks of cheese saves me a ton of money on the prestressed variety and it tastes better freshly grated. The feet have suction cups and keep this powerful little gadget from bouncing around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14H6Q0M1WP21F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QS98CWA#wasThisHelpful","R14H6Q0M1WP21F","A3LOGP4VA9DX46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LOGP4VA9DX46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This whimsical flower fan adds a splash of fun color to my daughter's room. The fan comes comes fully assembled except for the blades. The blades are rubber and easy to install by just unsnapping them off and on. The blades being softer than a traditional fan make it a safe option for a mature child's room. I would not put this within reach of a toddler or curious child as they can still get their hair caught up in the blades if they get to close to it.  It is lightweight, produces a good amount of air to small bedroom with its 2 speeds. It is very quiet, so if you're looking for a fan for white noise, this is not the fan for you.

Prep work is eliminated and I don't have to babysit the food. I set it and let it do its thing. Cleaning it does take a little more time than a crockpot but using it takes no pre planning. I can throw frozen items in there without having to thaw them out ahead of time.

"The delivery of this mattress was a very funny event. It showed up on my doorstep in a 3'x4' box and when opened, it presented itself as a large duffle bag (see pics next to my 5'4"" frame). It was a beast to get out of the packaging. I resorted to cutting the duffel as there was NO WAY this mattress would ever be able to fit back inside.The mattress had to regain its shape and size and this process took about 2 days but I could not resist plopping myself on it immediately. Even at its newly uncompressed state, I was infatuated.After letting it sit for 2 days, I decided to give it a whirl overnight and it was amazingly comfortable. The innersrings do not make any noise when shifting. My back feels supported and I woke up feeling refreshed and well rested. This mattress will be used in my child's bedroom and so far she likes it very much. I have no complaints.

"The sixth book in The Last Riders series covers the previous five books and then gives more. I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this one, I had the notion that a rehash of what's gone before would not be worth the read. I've read all the previous books, some I've loved others not quite so much. The same could be said for the characters. But what I hadn't bargained for was how very quickly I became engrossed, yes there are lots from the previous stories, but there are plenty of scenes that readers didn't get to read because they happened in the background,as each book mostly stuck with the scenes the heroine's were in. With it being written from Shade's POV we were we privy to these, it was interesting being inside Shade's head, sometimes during Shade's Fall I didn't always like how he treated Lily, but being able to see his reasoning behind his actions pulled things into focus. I have to say some of the characters whom I previously disliked have changed my mind how I think about them. Except for Bliss if anything I dislike her even more. I wasn't too keen on Lucky either, I had liked him a lot before this book. We'll have to see how his story pans out. The brand new part of the story was dramatic and emotional.

"This is the second book I've read by this author, this story is set in 1850, Maeve Murphy and her two sisters have just buried their father having lost their mother some time before. The landowner wants them off the land and the cottage where they live. Set at a time in history during the Irish famine the three girls decide to sell whatever possessions they have and buy passage to America, they had found a letter and deeds to a cottage just outside Boston, that a past love interest had left their mother, after he had moved to America many years previouslyWhile waiting to board the ship a small boy is badly injured, Maeve immediately comes forward to help the child, back home she was the villager's go to person if you were ill or hurt. When the ships doctor arrives he's so impressed with her treatment of the boy, he offers her a job as his assistant on the voyage. Dr. Flynn Gallagher is a widower and unlike Maeve and her sisters he's from a very wealthy family. He offers to find jobs onboard ship for Maeve's sisters as well. It very soon becomes apparent that the single women on the ship soon see Flynn as husband material. Maeve feels positively dowdy next to the other women, but Flynn seems more drawn towards her, than the others vying for his attention.The whole story is set onboard a ship travelling from Ireland to America. While the author had obviously done her research as to what life onboard a ship in 1850 was like, it did seem like an idealistic view, I'm sure conditions were much worse than are portrayed here. The characters are very engaging and easy to relate to as well. I would have like a bit more chemistry between Maeve and Flynn. There is a slight religious tone to the story but it fitted in with the characters personalities and backgrounds. Overall this story was charming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IG499OROJRLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D62BFG#wasThisHelpful","R3IG499OROJRLG","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've not read this author before but I was drawn to read this by the blurb. I can honestly say that for me this was a great read. It has all the essential elements that make a romantic read IMO. A down on her luck heroine, a hero who is badly scarred and closed off to everyone.Katherine had married Levi Cutter after a whirlwind romance, she fell pregnant very quickly. Levi left Katherine in town while he went off with a promise to return for her once he'd estsblished a home for her and their child. But 5 months go by and no word from Levi. When a stranger turns up claiming to be Levi's brother, informing Katherine that Levi is dead, she's left with little choice except to leave with Noah and return home with him to his ranch.I loved the story and the characters in this, it's one of those books you don't want to end. Noah was a conflicted character having been badly scarred at a very young age, he'd always been in the shadow of his younger brother Levi who was handsome and charming.

There are many twists and turns to the plot, but at the centre of the story is the romance between Lily and Paul. I really liked this story loved the connection and the chemistry between the two leads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226WAO4VQHUCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065M6OCK#wasThisHelpful","R226WAO4VQHUCY","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed every book in the Chaos Bleeds series so far. This one with Shane ""Pussy"" not so much. Reasons? I wasn't convinced of the connection between him and Sasha. Pussy still seemed too hung up on Ashley who had recently been murdered. She had been one of the club whores, and despite Pussy's protestations that they were just friends I wasn't convinced. I liked Sasha she was bowled over by Pussy even though she was blind and didn't know what he looked like, she didn't know him well either, she instinctively trusted him.The drama with Frederick a dangerous and powerful criminal continues there was a confrontation in this, that when it ended I was left thinking is that it! Devil the Chaoes Bleeds president didn't end everything then and there. I didn't get that. So I'm waiting for the book where all the drama the the Chaos Bleeds and the Skulls have been having with Frederick comes to it's final climax.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RR2RCA80AH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMYSZ6I#wasThisHelpful","R25RR2RCA80AH0","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kael is one of a number of vampire kings who rule different areas of the world. Three hundred years ago his mate and queen was killed by the enemy the soul eaters. Since that time he has vowed never to be mated again. But he needs blood to survive, and this is provided by the ""proffered"" human women who are virgins, but Kael refuses to drink directly from them instead he hypnotises them and drains their blood into a goblet with a blade. He never hurts them, that is until the beautiful Shayla is the proffered who is next to serve him.This had all the makings of a good story but it was too short. What there was is very well written. But it is just a story about Kael and Shayla's mating. The sex is really hot and the characters are interesting. But I was left wanting more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPKU4AAVUZGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D5UEGU#wasThisHelpful","R1VPKU4AAVUZGG","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loretta has been divorced from her husband for seventeen years, she left him after she caught him kissing another woman. Young and hotheaded she ran taking her three year old daughter Nona with her.Present day and Nona is is one year away from graduating from college, but she's decided she's not finishing school instead she's staying on her fathers ranch to live the life she loves. Loretta hasn't seen her ex-husband in years but is on her way to his ranch she's determined that Nona is going to go back to school come hell or high water, even if it means that Loretta has to put up with being near Jackson her ex for the summer.First read for me by this author. I really liked her writing style it flows drawing you into the story. Loretta is a fiery redhead with a take no prisoners attitude. Jackson is rather more laid back, he and Loretta had always been a hot mess together, they married young after Loretta became pregnant. What was nice was that although their characters have not altered with age, they have learnt to deal better with their pasts and the present.This is a traditional romance, it's not erotic nor is it filled with loads of sex scenes, so some might find it rather tame. What it does show is a couple reconnecting and finding their way through all the drama, secrets and lies that have affected their lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCU38ORWDFN2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2XZH32#wasThisHelpful","RCU38ORWDFN2G","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many other reviewers have laid out the plot, so I would just like to add that this story is very well written the author certainly knows how to pull a tale together. Her characters are very well drawn and utterly believeable. It's one of those books where you can hardly wait to turn the pages to find out what happens next. If you like a romance that's got drama, angst and bags of emotion and chemistry. I suggest you try this, this is a first read for me by this author, I will certainly be reading more from her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F08HRJOH3CJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FUQ6580#wasThisHelpful","R3F08HRJOH3CJS","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quick read about a young woman who's been pampered and sheltered her whole life by her parents. Rosalie is engaged to be married to Winslow and is looking forward to their wedding when she hears a disturbing rumour. She decides the way to go is to ask Winslow outright if what she's heard is true. Winslow arrogantly confirms that not only does he have a mistress, but she's pregnant and he has no intention of giving her up.Rosalie determines to run away especially after her parents try to tell her that's the norm, that husbands have mistresses. Rosalie leaves and goes to visit her cousin Audra. This is where she meets Garrett the town marshal.This is a pleasant story that is simplistically written, I felt it might have benefitted from a little more depth. In particular there is a complete lack of description of the characters.

"This is the second part of the mini series, the first book The Marriage Betrayal (Mills & Boon Modern) held much promise of a really great story, it was a shame that the second part was not as good, part two kicks off with Tally and Sandor are apart, during this period Tally has started her own business and is doing well although emotionally is another matter.she is asked to return to the house in France where she and Sandor made their home as it is being sold. She needs to retrieve any of her belongings, soon after she arrives Sandor arrives the passion and sexual tension between them is still strong and they end up in bed. But Tally has no intentions of staying with a man who does not love her, Sandor has made it clear to her that the only woman he ever loved when he was younger betrayed him, he does not do love! Tally returns home, only to be blackmailed by her Father to return to the marriage, which is possible as Sandor made it clear to her while they were in France that he wanted her back. Tally goes back to Sandor but keeps her secret! But Sandor has his own secrets! While they were parted he did something, and now the indisputable evidence of that is staring him in the face. He is then forced to tell Tally the truth of what happened during their split. This book was not an easy read too many issues to deal with in a book this length. Tally in this book is a bit of an emotional wreck and is easily manipulated by the people around her. As for Sandor what he did was a multi levelled betrayal in my opinion, it was not just what he did but who he did it with, and he only told Tally when he was forced to! So he was not honest himself!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8R6LL68Q0OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AK2QWK#wasThisHelpful","R3H8R6LL68Q0OK","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read all the books from this authors previous ""Until"" series, Until November being my favourite. Kenton was a character that was introduced in those books here he gets his own story.When Autumn is the last surviving witness to murder in the club where she works as a stripper, one of the bouncers and friend to her Link, sends her out of state to stay with a friend of his Kenton. Autumn is beautiful, but she hates that as people judge her on her looks, which seeing she felt that way I was surprised she would strip for a living even if it was to help her pay her way through getting her nursing degree. Kenton naturally is attracted to Autumn, but has made assumptions about her, once he realises he's made a mistake he tries to put things right, but Autumn is having none of it.This is a romantic and sexy read that I really enjoyed. I liked Kenton a lot even if he was an idiot at the begining. But it was Autumn I liked the best, she's not one of those spineless heroines, she gave as good as she got. I also liked Kentons friend and sidekick Justin, I'd like to read more about him. I'm looking forward to more books in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5A6BUTF21OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N229TLE#wasThisHelpful","R1S5A6BUTF21OQ","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prudence Bosworth is a lowly seamstress. While working at a ball repairing the ladies gowns she comes into contact with Rhys de Winter Duke of St. Cyres, Prudence is captivated by this tall blond green eyed man. When going home later that evening she witnesses him saving a female servant from the attentions of another man, Rhys becomes her hero. What Prudence doesn't see is Rhys bedding the maidservant himself later that night.Prudence is later shocked that day after returning to her lodgings to find a solicitor waiting for her. She then discovers her father, who abandoned her mother when she was pregnant and had fled to America, has died and left her a fortune. She's now an heiress worth a million pounds a year. Rhys the Duke of St.Cyres soon hears of prudence's changed circumstances and as he's stoney broke devises a plan to marry her. But he pretends that he has no idea that she has money, and Prudence who has already put him on a pedestal swallows every lie that falls from his lips.I liked this story Rhys was a really wicked Duke, and despite the state of his finances he lives a hedonistic lifestyle, the lies he tells Prudence were not nice. As for Prudence she's so enamoured of him she can't see the wood for the trees, she's a true romantic, and very innocent where men are concerned. When it all comes to light he gets his comeuppance. Despite all that I really liked him, I liked Prudence as well. This is a nice read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375A224PSLLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061143618#wasThisHelpful","R375A224PSLLZ","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rose suspects her husband is cheating with his new attractive assistant, the hastily arranged business trip to china taking the assistant with him niggles away at her, so she insists on going along. But her husband arranges for her to travel on a separate flight, when she gets to the airport she discovers her ticket is for the next day, and without being able to meet up with her husband as arranged and as she doesn't have his itinery she has no way to find him. Then a man named Monty steps in to help her, he's an ex marine and at 50 he's still attractive, Rose with no experience of airports and foreign travel accepts his help.I had quite a few problems with this short story, in fact I've got a list! Rose has been married to her husband for a long time, they have two grown children so they are very familiar with one another so she certainly shouldn't be hesitant in speaking up, she had enough guts to insist on going. So when her husband suggests she travel alone, why didn't she tell him no way! Then once she realises his deliberate action in booking her a ticket on the wrong day, why didn't she at least try to phone him. In fact she didn't attempt to phone her husband at all! That was totally unrealistic surely she has his number. Then the ending, huh what was that! This story basically went nowhere IMO.

"This is the second book I've read by this author, I really enjoyed the first book this one not so much. Set in the early years of the twentieth century in England. Lady Beatrix had been engaged to Will he's the son of a duke. But when he got offered the chance of a lifetime to go on a archeological dig in Egypt he jumped at it. He wanted Beatrix to go with him , when she refused he called the wedding off. That happened six years ago, Beatrix eventually got over Will and the resulting scandal, and is now engaged to Aiden. Then without a word of warning Will returns from Egypt. Having spent all his inheritance he's hoping to ask Beatrix's relative for a loan.This is a romance story about two people who claimed to love one another, but it always seemed to me that they loved their dream more. Will had always dreamed of going to Egypt to find King Tut's tomb. Beatrix dream was a bit more attainable, she wanted a husband and children and to share her life with the man she loved. Out of the two leads I preferred Beatrix, I found Will had no business expecting a young woman to follow him half way around the world while he blew all his inheritance, his father had died while he was away and he never even came back for the funeral, he had only returned home now when he needed to ask for a loan. He certainly hadn't returned to reclaim Beatrix, that was literally a byproduct of his trip home.I was never quite convinced of this couples love for one another, and this story lacked passion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V875RC2CY0P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VIWNPS#wasThisHelpful","R1V875RC2CY0P0","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caleb with his best friend and Partner Henry started out as fighters, the trust between them is strong. Moving on from fighting they now own a nightclub, but that's mostly a front for all their other activities. When Caleb enters a jewellery store to buy a goodbye gift for the woman he's currently having sex with he meets Donna one of the sales assistants. He's immediately attracted to Donna, she's nothing like the women he usually goes with, and she's not fawning all over him either. Donna is not stupid she can tell Caleb is dangerous, but as hard as she tries to get away from him there's no escape.First I'm guessing this is going to be a two part mini series, as I'm sure we're getting Henry's story as well. This is a grittier read from this author, to be honest I wasn't sure I liked Caleb to begin with, in fact I wasn't sure I liked him much better by the end. Nevertheless he is a larger than life character a true anti hero. He's a bit like Kristen Ashley's Knight on steroids! He steamrolls his way into Donna's life and bed, and as much as Donna knows she should stay away from him, Caleb refuses to take no for an answer. His blunt way of speaking including his dirty talk scares and excites her. Donna does come across as a little bit timid, but when pushed she certainly knows how to hold her own. With hot sex scenes this is a recommended read.If I have a complaint this needed to be longer, as I wanted more. I look forward to Henry's book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSEM5LJBDY5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVK5SZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3JSEM5LJBDY5A","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow I was really disappointed with this story. Overall I've enjoyed this series the first couple of books not so much. But Cash has been an interesting character throughout and I was keen to read his and Rachel's romance.What I didn't expect was to read about Cash having sex with other women numerous times, and that's exactly what happens throughout the first 50% of the story! and he didn't restrict himself just to the club women either. And when he wasn't indulging himself with the female population of Treepoint he made sure he hurt Rachel emotionally by opening his big mouth. I don't want to read about the hero of any book not just this one, having sex with loads of women other than the heroine.

"I'm going to keep this review short, or I'm liable to ramble on about this book as it's one of the best books I've read so far this year, the plot is brilliant, the characters all of them are wonderful, but Marcos is the star for me he's now one of my all time favourite hero's. Katie has that air of innocence and is a good person. Marcos is in his own words is a bad person, a gangster and a thief, he's also a member of a gang with a dangerous reputation. Katie is a high school teacher, they're complete opposites but they just worked. The sex is hot but more than that it's passionate and you can really feel the connection between them.I really loved this book it's a real page turner, a note to the author please don't make us wait too long for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250H062R01CE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVIBKLC#wasThisHelpful","R250H062R01CE0","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Roarke not only owns the club he's also a Dom his long time partner Sam is his sub. For a long time they have hoped to add a woman to their relationship, but have never found the right one, that is till Ava arrives for her interview. But Ava is new to the BDSM scene so they have to go slowly, it doesn't help that she initially thinks they are gay. Ava has a personal issue she's embarrassed about, she fears that once Roarke and Sam find out they will discard her.I really liked this story by an author who is new to me.

Donovan wants Mara but there are a couple of obstacles, his best friend Reece is her overprotective big brother, plus he's 25 to her 18. But Mara is a mature 18 year old and definitely knows what she wants, and whats she wants is Donovan.This contained all the right elements for me that made this a good romantic read, there's lots of sexual tension, and just the right amount of angst and drama. The characters are well drawn as well, Donovan who's had plenty of women in the past knows when he's met the right woman, Mara has always wanted Donovan. So to read how they get together was great.

"This is probably my least favourite of this series so far, I had been looking forward to Butch's story but I felt a little let down by it. Butch I'm afraid to say got on my nerves with his indicisive behaviour. He's left the Skulls for the woman he wants, Cheryl and her son Mathew. Cheryl is a single mother struggling to get by, Butch has seen the other club members old ladies get hurt and doesn't want to risk that with Cheryl. Mathew, Cheryl's son is not Butch's but he's willing to be the father figure in his life. The threat from Butch's past makes an unwelcome return. Dangerous times are ahead.I'd like to say that to get the full picture as to what is happening in the Skull's series you really need to read the Chaos Bleeds series as well as the series cross over into each other. There are a few shocking revelations in this story the biggest regarding The identity of Mathew's father, I didn't see that coming! Overall I think this is more of a transition story and a stepping stone to the big finale. I just wish I could have liked this more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOKSQXZLHVGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7LK8XY#wasThisHelpful","RGOKSQXZLHVGE","A3U41P3MHAEXYU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U41P3MHAEXYU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"J. Armand’s “The Immortal Coil” is a sci-fi fantasy (with action and horror elements) that follows a young man as his life is turned upside down by the arrival of otherworldly intruders. The novel opens with Dorian, an aspiring model, at a casting call. His life seems normal – the hunt for work, relationship with his family, experiencing a new place – until he sees a CDC van in his neighborhood. Strange, right? Turns out, it was just a small sign of what is to come – an encounter with terrifying mutant creatures. Dorian finds himself on a life-or-death adventure, learning about the creatures and trying to figure out a solution. He meets some interesting characters along the way, such as Noah, a martial arts expert whose weapon of choice is a short version of the katana. Armand does an excellent job balancing scifi/fantasy world building with lots of action and adventure. I’m a huge fan of fight scenes, and was pleased to learn Armand writes gripping, vivid scenes that put you right in the thick of the action.

"""Surreal Photography and Effective Advertising” by Raqee S. Najmuldeen is a powerful, well-written book aimed at providing designers a means of coming up with ideas for successful advertisements using surreal photography. Najmuldeen writes about how to combine real-life images in a way that is unique and attention-grabbing while being effective for advertising. One of the things I like about the way Najmuldeen organizes the book is that he builds from the ground up. He opens by discussing the concept of surrealism (its origins, the different styles, its role in photography) before moving onto its usage in advertising in terms of the brand, message, etc. Najmuldeen makes a strong case for the value of surreal photography in successful advertising using well-thought out reasoning, and provides clear steps for implementing the approach in your own work.

"The final book of the Whistleblower Trilogy brings the series to a close with a brilliant, gripping conclusion. In book 3, Candle now has more information about what is happening to him and who is threatening his family. It's just a matter of deciding what to do with that information. And  can he do what he needs to do before it's too late. Heskett deftly balances the need to answer questions generated in the first two books while entertaining the reader with lots of action, suspense, and mystery. I'm usually pretty good at being able to predict endings, but this novella was so packed with twists and turns I was completely caught off guard. 5 stars for the finale to an excellent trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K23ZM3DCE4OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQWMCSY#wasThisHelpful","R2K23ZM3DCE4OL","A22FYOW7753XEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22FYOW7753XEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you liked book 1 of the Whistleblower series, you'll love ""The Legend of Kareem."" Just as Candle thought things were settling down, he receives a mysterious letter and finds himself on a mission to save someone he doesn't know ... or put his wife and unborn child at risk. Once again, Heskett writes with his trademark blend of action, humor, and wit. Candle is a protagonist that fans of the series will grow to love even more in this book. His determination in doing what it takes to keep his family safe is admirable while his no-holds-barred commentary on the humor of situations is more than welcome. I laughed out loud a number of times in between being gripped by the action and suspense. A must-read for series fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276XQDDXFXLPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQL7RSK#wasThisHelpful","R276XQDDXFXLPB","A22FYOW7753XEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22FYOW7753XEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bridget Renshaw's ""Cornucopia"" is a touching, humorous, and fun collection of poems about growing up. The collection is extensive and eclectic, although the theme of growing up runs throughout. There are also humorous illustrations to go along with each poem. The poems are very relatable to children (covering topics like riding a Ferris wheel, doing homework, and helping out the family) , and this would make a great collection to read to a child before bed. The writing is whimsical and fun; one of my favorite poems is the silly ""Chug the Slug.""

On the other side, we have Xonox, a vicious tyrant with dreams of crawling to the top by any means necessary. Hillard has created a fascinating, dog-eat-dog world where only the tough survive.

"Pamela Hamilton and W.T. Hamilton's ""How to Tame Your Ego and Fuel Your Ambition"" is a powerful book about controlling your ego to unlock the power of your ambition. One thing I love about this book is it starts with the basics, for example, explaining what the egoic mind is and how it impacts ambition. As someone with minimal psychology background, I found this to be very helpful. Once the reader has an understanding of the ego, Hamilton moves onto how to tame the negative aspects of the mind and fuel the positive aspects to stoke the flames of ambition. This book outlines a lot of info and covers a lot of ground, but the writing is clear and concise, making it easy to digest. My favorite thing about the book is that it's practical. It's information you can implement into your life to help you reach your goals.

The book is well-written, outlining the criminal's trajectory of crime and including important details about their personal life. The information is thorough yet not too wordy, which makes it a fairly quick read. What I love about this book is the cases are eclectic. You have cases that are classic, famous cases then you have some lesser known ones. You also have a blend of older cases (John Dillinger) and new ones (DC Beltway Sniper).

There's a ton of action, some humor, and plenty of suspense to keep you wondering what happens next. The story reminds me a bit of the Hart to Hart TV detective show.

"Jeffrey Miller's ""No Solid Ground"" is a powerful read that provokes thoughts about the value of ancient wisdom and the danger of not thinking about the future. Part ancient mystery, part personal development, Miller references the Sixth Extinction Event, a rapid change that poses serious threats to humanity while also sharing how to realign the mind and body. Miller outlines a number of transformative exercises to help with the process of getting ourselves in sync with the universe. The author's training in psychotherapy is evident in the professional, scientific approach he takes with the topic. He uses concise yet thorough writing to show the power of the interconnectedness of the self, society, and the universe. What I really like about this book is that it's a ""big picture"" approach to self-improvement. Only by thinking outside oneself can we truly improve ourselves.

If you're looking for a sexy romance that will keep you guessing, you'll enjoy this read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ54A04DQKO0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAILDO0#wasThisHelpful","RZ54A04DQKO0A","A22FYOW7753XEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22FYOW7753XEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love infusing your own water, this bottle is a great way to do it. Prior to this bottle, I was infusing in a water pitcher and then straining through a strainer. This bottle makes infusing water with fruit quick, easy, and portable. Great for trips or exercise. The bottle is sturdy and durable, and is a good size that'll quench your thirst and also be portable. I've been infusing strawberries and blackberries everyday, and have been very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQSEBS08XYGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTD69RI#wasThisHelpful","R2VQSEBS08XYGY","A22FYOW7753XEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22FYOW7753XEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The smell is quite strong when you first open the wrapper, but it's a pleasant rose scent.  (If you're sensitive to scents you might want to pass on this.)

"As the advertising says, this is 8 books in one, and at a very reasonable price.  This book coaches a budding business owner (entrepreneur) through all the necessary steps beginning with a unit on going ""From Idea to Reality.""  In this unit you review your business idea, test the market for it, determine its ""attractiveness"" from several perspectives, and investigate franchises.  And that's just the opening. After that you will determine the best type of business to plan (sole proprietor, S Corp, etc.), write a business plan, and find the funding. (During this time you will determine if a home business or franchise is best for you.)  Then the book gets into the trenches of business management with helpful guidance on building a website, managing legal issues and finances (including an extensive section on profits/losses and working with cash flow), and then covers hiring processes (including how to delegate to get more work done)  and the basics of marketing and image management.As you can see, it's very comprehensive-- and what I like about it is it forces a potential business owner to carefully think through areas s/he might not have even realized were important.  For instance, the section on how to hire and manage people isn't just a guide to basic management-- it includes details like creating a career development plan for your employees.Most entrepreneurs and small business owners have their own areas of expertise and comfort-- one may be particularly good with finance, another with marketing.  What I like about this book is it gives you a working knowledge of all the elements of running your own business which can help you determine where you might need to hire someone else, or get outside consulting for areas which you recognize you are not your strengths.Very educational and well worth the investment-- before you sink money into a business venture only to realize you didn't know what you needed to know!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKOL1UVDPUWA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119049105#wasThisHelpful","RKOL1UVDPUWA9","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this for a few days and am very pleased.  I cannot use regular deodorants and antiperspirants due to allergy/sensitivity issues.  For several years I have been using Trader Joe's unscented deodorant with cotton, which I generally like, but it contains propylene glycol which is not supposed to be good for you.  This product does not contain any bad ingredients and is easy to use-- just put a tiny bit on your fingers and apply under your arms.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  Despite being a liquid, it feels almost dry to the touch right away.  There is a slight smell (kind of minty) which goes away quickly.  So far it has kept me dry (even though it's NOT an antiperspirant) and odor-free.  With summer heat approaching, it will be put to the test and I will come back and revise this review if I encounter any problems.

"I absolutely love this toy.  It's cuter in person than in the pictures. The body is about 10"" high and 6"" wide and the feet and hair (?) add another 2"" each.  It's soft and cuddly and has a small pocket (6"" zipper and the pocket is about 3"" deep) which has just enough room for some small pieces of paper.It comes with a little booklet (translated into 7 languages) which explains that if you're afraid of the dark, worried about homework, having trouble with friends, etc., this little ""Worry Eater"" is here to help.  You just write down your worries, place them in the zipped pocket and he'll hold onto them so you don't have to.  The pouch can only hold a few worries, which I think is good-- rather than having lots of worries pile up each night, the parent/child can throw them away as needed, symbolically letting them go.The concept is wonderful and it's not just for children-- writing down their fears and anxieties is a great way, even for adults, to get them out of your head so you don't ruminate all night about them.  Excellent companion for anyone whose worries or fears keep them up at night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33A315EOQXFRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZ36JLK#wasThisHelpful","R33A315EOQXFRY","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice set which would make a great wedding or shower gift.  The pan is heavy-duty and coated with Xylar so it is nonstick which makes it easy to prepare typical stir-fry or other items with thick sauces which might otherwise stick to a pan.  Because of the nonstick coating, it's best to wash it by hand, which can be a little cumbersome if you don't have a large kitchen sink.  There are also warnings about not heating this type of pan to 500 degrees-- presumably most home cooks will not cook at this high heat level, but it is worth noting that the bottom of the pan does get very hot-- which is why it makes stir-fry dishes so efficiently.  The steamer is a typical bamboo steamer-- it's OK, but the key reason to purchase this would be for the stir-fry pan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG7TBDAWIT96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXAMQ#wasThisHelpful","RG7TBDAWIT96","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have sensitive gums this product is very mild and won't cause the irritation that a stronger mouthwash might.  It does not contain alcohol so you won't have the alcohol burn.  The ingredients are generally good, and it does not contain some of the irritating chemicals found in other mouthwashes.  It has a slightly thick texture (not as watery as other mouthwashes) and a pleasant, mild, slightly minty taste.I found the labeling confusing-- it's supposed to help with discomfort after teeth whitening and other procedures (it even says it's an ""ideal rinse for after teeth-whitening procedures"" and ""use twice a day to reduce sensitivity"")  and yet a separate notice on the product label also specifically says,""Does not relieve or treat sensitive teeth, oral pain or gum disease."" That seems to contradict the advertising.  I also did not like the fact that it arrived with a tag imploring users to give it a 5-star rating on Amazon.Overall the mouthwash is mild, comfortable and non-irritating.

"The first thing I noticed about this flat iron was the smell.  It had a strange burned plastic type odor when I opened the box.  It was encased in a plastic bag (which also smelled) and I thought removing the bag would take care of it but it didn't.  I put it in my bathroom and could still smell it the next day, so out it went to the garage for a few days.  After a week or so, the smell is much less but still there.  When I plugged it in and heated it up, the smell was stronger.  (Please note: the product was fine and not burning-- it just smells.) I did a search to see if this is a typical problem with ceramic flatirons, but smell issues seemed to be related to too much hair product building up-- not an issue with this brand new item.I did use the flat iron-- it's well-made, heats quickly, and the macadamia conditioner provided with it keeps your hair soft.  I tried to look up the conditioner to see if more could be purchased-- at the moment the Remington website shows the product (and wants you to ""pin"" it or ""like""it on social media) but there was no price and no way to add it to your shopping cart, so I'm not sure if this is something you can replace or not.  I'm sure there are similar products available.So...were I just reviewing the quality and performance of the flatiron I would have given it 5 stars-- but the funky smell drops it down to 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ODXD1X8ACEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6C9U#wasThisHelpful","R3ODXD1X8ACEJ","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let’s start with the obvious: at 120 decibels, this is an extremely loud alarm.  There is no chance that you or your nearby neighbors will sleep through it.  That’s one particular advantage if you choose to place it on a garage entry door, an outdoor shed or a patio/screen porch door that’s not directly connected to your house.It’s easy to set up and all the mounting pieces you need to install it are supplied.  You do have to purchase batteries for it (3-AAA).  You can set it up to simply chime every time the door is opened or you can set the alarm feature.  The alarm has a 30-second delay, which gives you time to type in your code, but, that also means that a potential intruder has 30 seconds to disarm it by pulling it off the door frame and removing the batteries.  (There’s a blinking red light that will draw attention to the device.) This assumes, of course, that the intruder is sophisticated enough to know to do this (and the truth is that truly sophisticated professional burglars can deactivate even professional home security systems.)So I view this more as an “extra” dose of security to be used in addition to whatever else you might have.  That’s why I put mine on my screen porch door where my home security system isn’t set up.  I think it will scare away any “mischievous” types who might just be on the property but not necessarily trying to break in.  I keep mine on the chime feature most of the time.  That’s loud enough to hear through most of my house and, again, I suspect that might scare away someone who’s just prowling.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it works as described and is good for its purpose-- just know the limitations of this type of system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZO3ZPXLF2KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCUW3NU#wasThisHelpful","R1ZO3ZPXLF2KF","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to know where to start in describing this wonderful block set.  It's well-constructed, with smooth solid-wood blocks, labels/stickers that stay put and don't peel off, and even includes a cute picture book.  But what I really love about this set is the imaginative potential it has for a young child.  So much of our children's time is spent ""receiving"" creativity: watching TV shows, videos, or playing games that other people have created.  This block set requires the child to create their own stories and set up their own magical land of knights and castles. (Made me want to watch ""The Princess Bride again!)  Children over 3 could easily entertain themselves with this set, but it is also fun to watch the stories they create and help them build both their motor skills and their language/creativity skills.

"This is a very nice gift set. It's packaged well (it was a little hard to get the eau de toilette out of the box), and would make a very nice gift for any man.  I really like the scent; it's sort of woodsy and also citrus-y, and very fresh and pleasant.  I don't like strong scents, and this one is definitely not overpowering.  There's probably no need to use both products at the same time; if you use the shower get, that's probably enough, which means this set will last for awhile.  The packaging is a heavy-duty cardboard with the famous Lacoste alligator on the box.You will want to shop around a little and compare prices.  Prices vary depending on the store-- the price tag on the box says that the ""retail value"" is $92.00 and the ""suggested retail"" is $68.00, but prices seem to vary so check around.

"I recently purchased a different model of this air purifier and I wasn't very happy with it-- it gave off a plastic smell that actually made the room smell worse rather than better.  So I was a little unsure about whether I would like this particular model.  But no worries.  This model was easy to set up and run, and it did not give off any plastic smell.  I placed it in a room that had some musty odors from camping gear and it did the work-- the air was much better within a day.  It's a fairly quiet machine and can run all night (at least on the lower settings) without disturbing your sleep.As several others have commented, it would be nice to have a filter that could be cleaned and reused, but the filters aren't that expensive and if you don't have a smoker or pets in your house, you can get a fair amount of use out of one filter.

"First of all, the Amazon price for this product is very good.  The manufacturer's website sells this bottle for $33, so you save about half by buying from Amazon.  Doctor's Best products seem to be generally well-made, and, according to their website,  they test their ingredients for pesticides and other unwanted ingredients, as well as maintain high levels of sanitation and quality control. These pills are gluten-free and non-GMO.This product is recommended for individuals who desire an enhanced sense of well-being, a sense of calm and relaxation, better sleep, and possibly weight loss.  Most of these benefits would be a function of the 5-HTP which is a precursor of the neurotransmitter, serotonin, rather than the vitamins. In theory, it should raise your levels of serotonin, which will improve your mood and help you sleep better.  (For that reason, you should not take it with anti-depressant medication.)  I trust Dr. Andrew Weil on supplements, and he is more of a fan of exercise, St. John's Wort, or SAM-e to attain the same benefits rather than 5-HTP. Some websites also warn about not giving this to children without doctor's supervision.I have taken these pills for a week and I have noticed that my sleep is somewhat better, but I'm also experiencing some nausea which is a known side effect of 5-HTP. So I'm rating them as ""OK"" for the moment until I learn if the side effects disappear.

"A few years ago a nutritionist had indicated that methylation issues might be at the root of some autoimmune issues I was having, as did a Ph.D. chemist friend of mine who had dealt with her own methylation issues for her Hashimoto's and Crohn's diseases.  I didn't get much support for this approach from my regular physicians for this, so I didn't think much about it, until I had a flare-up recently and really didn't want to go down the road of the increasingly powerful medications that were being prescribed.I purchased this product after reading a lot of information on the internet about treating methylation processing issues.  Vitamin deficiency can be a factor in auto-immune conditions, and to put it simply, this product is mostly vitamins (B6, B12, D, etc.) in more readily absorbed formulas designed for individuals whose genetic structure prevents them from absorbing the nutritional value of regular off-the-shelf vitamins.It's a cream, so it absorbs through your skin bypassing any gastrointestinal issues.  It's a bright red/coppery shade (which freaked me a little at first-- I guess I expected a white cream from a white bottle), but I'm sure that's a function of the B vitamins in it. You also need to pump it quite a few times at first to get the product out-- for a moment,  I thought I had a defective bottle, but it just takes a lot of pumps.I used it as directed-- a dime-sized spot of cream on my inner arm twice a day.  For the first 24-36 hours I felt great-- more focus, more energy, better mood, and just generally happier and content.  BUT-- the second night I couldn't sleep.  I was absolutely ""up"" and felt very tight inside-- like I was going to explode.  My heart rate was fine (not racing or anything) but it was clear that something was going on with my nervous system.I realized at that moment, that perhaps self-medicating in this area isn't the way to go, but I knew if I went to my regular doctor he would likely just tell me to throw it away.  Given that I had an initial good reaction (placebo effect? I don't know),  I contacted a doctor the next day who is experienced in functional medicine and knows about these issues.  He told me that it might work for me-- and it might be that I just needed to ease into it.  He knows the physician/lab behind its production and said it was an excellent product-- the trick is just to see if it's right for me.  So he ordered some blood tests and a genetic test to see if I have the 5MTHR mutation.So if you think you have the medical issues that might benefit from this type of product, I strongly recommend you seek a physician with functional medicine, environmental medicine, nutritional training, or other related experience/education to guide you with this product.  You need a physician who will listen like mine did.I will update this review when I get the test results back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YWV209TOSKET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDIRNYC#wasThisHelpful","R2YWV209TOSKET","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brow Drama: What a great name for a useful product.  I'm sure the intent was to focus on making one's eyebrows dramatic.  For me, my brow hairs have a mind of their own growing in whatever way they like (aging is so much fun...) and this product stops that drama.  The unruly hairs are now in alignment and look smooth and, well, normal.  My thinning brows also look a little thicker now that they are lined up better.It has a slight chemical smell when you first pull the brush out of the bottle, but there is no lingering smell. It's transparent, so it tames your brows without adding color. If you choose, you can use a brow pencil to add color.  The gel goes on soft, not sticky or glue-like.  I had no sensitivity or reaction to the product.I also think men who would benefit from this product.  I get it that eyebrow grooming isn't necessarily something most men consider, but sometimes a man's unruly eyebrows can distract from his appearance.  I think this product would be a great way to surreptitiously bring some of those hairs under control. No one will know the secret.  Just make sure you buy transparent rather than any shades. I think Maybelline should consider repackaging the product and placing it in the men's grooming aisle of the pharmacy.Great product-- will continue to buy and use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2FJIWZQK932/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCSBVI#wasThisHelpful","R3L2FJIWZQK932","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As advertised, my supply of pens consisted of 5 red, 4 blue, and 3 green markers.  (Technically although advertised as primary colors, green is not a primary color-- that would be yellow, which is not included in this color selection.) They arrive as loose items with no container or carrying case. They have medium size tips, which are smaller than typical whiteboard markers, so they are better for a smaller sized whiteboard or a board where you want to include a lot of information.  The colors are true, although a little light.  The green markers are a sea-green shade, not the teal-like shade that the plastic cover makes them appear to be.

"I usually use more expensive powder eye shadows, so I tried this more on a whim than anything.  And I am so impressed-- it glides on, is a very attractive neutral taupe/brown shade, lasted all day, and is easy to remove.  I'm not sure what else you want in an eye shadow. I was really pleased with how it brightened my eyes (which are blue); the contrasting brown made the blue color stand out. I even took a gamble on trying the glittery right side of the combo-- I had always been told that glitter eye shadows are a no-no after 50, but it looked great.I was a little concerned about possible sensitivity or allergy issues because this makeup is so much less expensive than my usual choice of Clinique, but no worries. (And my skin hates everything.) I will definitely be getting more colors in this line of makeup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OC23FJUA5UVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCSGUO#wasThisHelpful","R2OC23FJUA5UVY","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-made, lightweight cork and magnetic board and is perfect for a home office, kitchen, laundry room, or wherever you like to post notices or leave notes for the family. The overall board measures 23"" wide and 17"" high when viewing it as it is shown in the pictures.  There is a frame around it, so the actual interior measurement of the cork part is 15 1/2"" by 11"" and the glossy side is the same.  The board comes with magnets and a black dry-erase pen which has a little plastic clip to attach it to the board.  You can easily attach it to a wall using the permanent self-stick pads which are included. I like the versatility of having both the magnetic and cork sides.

"I have to admit I thought chia seeds were only good for growing on little clay animal-shaped things-- and a fun joke holiday gift.  Turns out they are actually good and pretty good for you.Healthy Joe’s Chia Seeds come packaged in a sturdy re-closable plastic vacuum-sealed package.  It's a generous amount of seeds-- a typical serving is one tablespoon, and the package contains over 35 servings.I tasted them out of the package, and they have a very mild flavor. They are a little chewy, and even get a little gelatinous after they are in your mouth for a few minutes.  Once I put them in my yogurt or on my oatmeal, I couldn't taste them. The only challenge I had is that they are little seeds, so keep some dental floss or toothpicks nearby.According to the package, a serving of these chia seeds contains as much ALA (Omega3) as walnuts, calcium as mozzarella cheese, fiber as bran flakes, and iron as spinach, although this statement isn’t verified by the FDA.There are a lot of claims on the internet about using chia seeds for dieting, as well as myriad health benefits.  While they do contain (healthy) omega-3 fatty acids, carbohydrates, protein, fiber, antioxidants, and calcium, I couldn’t find any credible studies that make chia seeds better than any other seed or nut.  That said, they are healthy for you and if you are looking for a way to get more nutrients in your diet, chia seeds might be a good source.Just pay attention to the medical warnings-- they do have some effects on blood clotting ability according to the package, and they also shouldn't be taken by anyone who is pregnant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMM7ZVNU27D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJO6BWM#wasThisHelpful","R3EMM7ZVNU27D9","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time using a George Foreman grill so I tried three different items on it: a hamburger, 8 oz boned chicken breast and a 6 oz piece of salmon.  Here's what I learned:1. The grill is very lightweight, but that also means that the lid doesn't really clamp down on the top of the item-- it lays there, so if your item (like chicken) isn't perfectly level, not all the surfaces will get cooked as well.2. The grill comes with simple instructions and no recipes or cooking suggestions other than a few basic times.  While the times were generally accurate (9 minutes for the chicken, 5 minutes for the salmon, etc.) it would have been helpful to have more creative ideas for using the grill.3. The grill steams a lot while cooking so don't place it under a kitchen cabinet or other location where the steam can't easily escape.4. This grill is small-- the 8-oz chicken breast was longer than the surface- I had to angle it, so it could only hold one 8-oz breast at a time.  You'll have to decide if that is two servings or not. Same with the burgers-- I was able to fit two on the grill but they were tight and relatively small.5. Cleanup isn't as easy as you might think.  I know the surface is nonstick, but the fat/liquid from the chicken browned quickly on it and took some scrubbing to remove.  It was not ""wipe away"" nonstick.All-in-all, it's OK--the food I cooked tasted fine.  Just be prepared to spend some time cleaning it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6H9AQYYRPJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXRK#wasThisHelpful","RA6H9AQYYRPJD","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well-written and researched, this biography is a treasure chest for anyone who wants to learn about what it takes to become a great actor-- not a star.  At one point in the book, DeNiro expresses frustration with the publicity machine around movie-making, saying ""Why do people want to know what I eat for breakfast?""  The author, Shawn Levy, has wisely chosen not to tell us what DeNiro had for breakfast or other distracting gossip and superficial information. Personal information is presented in a way that rounds out an understanding of his personality. Mostly we learn about DeNiro, the actor, who treats acting like work-- work which requires study, attention, and diligence.While presenting the circumstances of his solitary, possibly lonely, childhood with parents enmeshed in the artistic and literary worlds, the author doesn't venture personally into armchair psychological analysis-- he presents some opinions of DeNiro's friends and colleagues to provide insight or analysis of DeNiro's actions, but always in a professional manner.I have enjoyed DeNiro's performances over the years, starting with the first film I saw him in, ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" through ""The Godfather"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Once Upon a Time In America"" and many, many others.  If you are a film buff like me, you will enjoy the details this book provides about the tremendous professionalism DeNiro brings to his roles.  The book describes, for example, the weeks DeNiro spent with a minor league baseball team in the South studying and learning from the players-- everything from how to play baseball to how to ""look"" like a baseball player, to how to speak with the correct Southern accent demanded by the role.His work to prepare for ""Godfather II"" is even more impressive with DeNiro studying Sicilian at a Berlitz program, and then traveling to Sicily to further enhance his language skills including learning hand gestures and the pacing of the language.  He then revises much of the script to include what he has learned, even removing his own lines when he determines they aren't necessary.  Finally, he studies Marlon Brando's work so that in addition to speaking Sicilian fluently, he can also sound like and capture the essence of Brando in his role as the young Vito Corleone.I was amused and pleasantly surprised by the almost whimsical way in which major aspects of certain films (or careers) came together-- and could just as easily never happened.  For example, Levy describes a party where DeNiro arrived in an unpleasant mood due to an altercation with his girlfriend, but despite this challenge, his friend Brian DePalma persevered and introduced DeNiro to ""another guy"" at the party-- Martin Scorsese.  Later in the book, Scorsese is working hard to get famous film composer Bernard Herrmann to write the score for ""Taxi Driver.""  Herrmann resists, but Scorsese gets him to at least look at the script.  Herrmann agrees to write the score because ""I like when he poured peach brandy on the cornflakes.""  It would be a monumentally great score, and unfortunately Herrmann's last.  This book is peppered with these types of anecdotes-- accidental meetings, unlikely coincidences which all lead to great film-making.Throughout the book, DeNiro comes across as a three-dimensional figure with good and bad traits, but with a constant theme of a man of few words who studies and observes, learns and absorbs, and then puts it all back on the screen for us to enjoy. And we are the grateful recipients of his talent.Great reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1YODIFKY8I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307716783#wasThisHelpful","R1A1YODIFKY8I4","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these chairs about a year ago and they are terrific.  They have been on a screen porch through all four seasons and haven't suffered at all.  They work just great-- easily fold up and down and are very comfortable.  The fabric and stitching have held well and I've had no issues any of the joints.  Very comfortable.The only challenge I have had is that (I assume due to the exposure to 4 seasons) the little head support cushions have lost their elasticity in the back and they won't stay up, so they are now more lower-back cushions than head cushions.  But this was easily and quickly repaired with some duct tape pulling them tighter.  I like the fact that the cushions do slide up and down so you can use them where you most need them.Excellent value for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6SLA7QHVJ74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032UY0BK#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6SLA7QHVJ74","A37OYVYHR5U4NU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37OYVYHR5U4NU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice carry-on in some respects but it has a couple of significant problems.On the plus side the four wheels are top notch. They pivot well, they go over large obstacles well, they're precise and you'll have no trouble maneuvering on to an escalator in a busy airport. Inside the Tumi there are plenty of zippered compartments that will let you arrange your packing any way that you want. The TSA approved lock is a nice addition with a smooth action that is easy to set. (Note, the instructions to set the lock are not included with the case, you have to to to the Tumi website for that).However, the downsides are fairly significant. The thermoplastic composite material has what appears to be imperfections in it. I was looking down at the material expecting to see a nice crosshatch pattern across the entire surface but that isn't the case. There are places where it looks like the material wasn't set quite right. Also, the fit and finish falls short of what I'd expect in a carry-on in this price range. The details are small but the overall impact is large. For example, the bumper plastic on the edges is poorly done and you can see ridges from the injection molding process. As another example the wheels on the lock are made of plastic instead of steel.I'm frankly hard pressed to see how this carry-on is much better than the one I already had for which I paid 1 tenth the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MO0FQMGLRAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3IY47U#wasThisHelpful","R38MO0FQMGLRAZ","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have a nice thick base that makes them stable without making them too heavy. The glass is nice quality and overall they look amazing.

"Edit: I've found that it doesn't respect the boundary markers very well. I initially thought that was because the boundary was still slightly curved from being rolled up in ball. But now that it lays flat on the floor the Neato still just pushes it out of the way most of the time. I've found that i have to tape the strip to the hardwood to get it to work. That's rather inconvenient.The first thing I want to say up front is that the dust bin for this robot is directly connected to the filter. This means that the filter on the dust bin will clog very quickly. This is quite unlike other ""bagless"" vacuums that have a cyclone bin that removes most of the dirt/dust first. In the case of the Neeto the vacuumed air passes directly through the filter. Due to this fact they recommend a monthly schedule for replacing the filter (note, replace, not clean). I wanted to put that up front because frankly it seems like a design flaw though I suppose they did it that way to keep the unit small and compact.However, if that doesn't bother you how does the unit itself operate? In short it's a bit more clumsy than the company would have you believe. Yes, it does know where it is in the room. However, the laser guide only provides the unit with a rough estimate of what's in front of it. In my very first run of the Neeto it got stuck in two different places where it should not have gotten stuck if the laser was precisely measuring the height of a ledge. Not only that, it also does a lot of bouncing against objects when it's doing edge cleaning. It isn't nearly as precise as the ads when it comes to going around chair legs and other obstacles. It does a lot of bouncing off walls, chair legs, etc. However, having said that it does do a competent job of making it's way around table legs, chair legs, etc.I know that there is probably a fine line between making the robot too sensitive to lips/bumps in the floor and not sensitive enough. Both the Scooba and the Mint will be stopped by even the smallest ridge in the floor. They're too conservative and even a minor crack in the hardwood can confuse them. However, the Neeto is just a bit too aggressive and will jump over even an obstacle that is nearly 1/2 an inch high. This is a problem in the cases where I have chairs that have a sort of flat rounded rail as the base. The neeto will jump up on it and get stuck there. In most cases it manages to free itself but not always (and not without a lot of thrashing). The upside to this is that the Neeto will happily jump up on an area rug and back down to hardwood without missing a beat. The downside is that it will jump up on things that it probably should not attempt to hurdle.Overall for my use case (almost all hardwood that needs light sweeping) the Neeto does a fine job. However, do bear in mind you'll be emptying the dust bin a lot and replacing the filter frequently so make sure to factor that into your cost of ownership. If they could come up with a better dust bin setup this would be an easy 5 stars. As it is I have to take off one star for the dust bin issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNW6QIBEYGPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XELDPL8#wasThisHelpful","RGNW6QIBEYGPS","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wanting a burr coffee grinder for quite some time but I never got around to it. I've done a lot of the coffee creation process myself from roasting green beans to grinding them in a bladed grinder to french press/drip/pour extraction. What I never did try, until now, is burr grinding and now I know how much it matters.The problem with a bladed grinder that has spinning blades is that it will inevitably produce a sort of coffee ""dust"" as part of the process. This coffee dust then gets over-extracted, when submerged in boiling water, and results in bitter flavors from your carefully roasted beans. This might not be much of a problem in french roasts where the roast character pretty much covers a lot of sins but it's much more evident in the lighter roasts.And that is where a burr grinder comes in. A burr grinder is designed to give you one consistent grind size (no coffee dust like bladed designs). The KitchenAid does a wonderful job giving a consistent grind across its 15 different grind settings. It works quickly and can grind an entire 12 oz bag of whole beans in just a couple of minutes. In my testing I've been pleasantly surprised how how much difference there is in the flavor of my roasted beans when ground by the KitchenAid vs. my bladed grinder. The burr grinder, yielding a more consistent grind, had helped me extract my coffee without the bitter overtones I was getting from my bladed grinder.Speaking to the design of the KitchenAid it's very smart. For starters they have used glass for the receptacles and this helps cut down on the ""flying coffee"" problem that plastic has. In fact, I tried using a plastic container under the grinder and I saw this problem first hand, coffee was literally flying out of the cup. Stick with the glass. Also, the top receptacle screws on to the grinder and is sealed with a silicon rim at the top and bottom so you can safely store beans in there between uses, very thoughtful. Lastly it's a solid well-made device that looks amazing on my counter and since most of it is vertical it's footprint is roughly only 9""x6"".A couple of cautions. First, don't make the same mistake I made by unscrewing the top before taking all the beans out. Oops, that was messy. Second, do be prepared to unscrew the cover and clean it out fairly regularly as it will jam up before too long if you're using the more fine grinds. Aside from that it's a lot of fun to use, helps make a great cup of coffee and looks awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAC4LZVAJGNNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPRQXRE#wasThisHelpful","RAC4LZVAJGNNE","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use these filters on a box fan as a sort of makeshift room air filter. I had been using Honeywell FPR 13 filters previously. I just measured the airflow through this filter as compared to the Honeywell. My Dylos air quality monitor indicates that this filter is as effective at removing particles from the air. They both catch about 50% of the particles in the air on the first pass (I don't get full efficiency as it is just a box fan).The difference? I paid almost $20 EACH for the Honeywell filters at a local big box store. Buying 12 of these at a time may seem like a lot but at least for me it has meant getting about a 75% discount over buying them one at a time at the local store.Note, the actual measurement is 19.5 inches, not 20.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FW19P4AQSWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ESOV44#wasThisHelpful","R11FW19P4AQSWT","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Instead of all the sounds being mushed together by my laptop speaker they were separated and clear. i could hear the dialog much more clearly and I felt much more immersed in the movie.In short, having these headphones on sort of recreates the experience of a large expensive surround sound system.

"Like other reviewers I'm not using this on my pet because I don't have one. One of the big problems I have with battery powered clippers is that they tend to be underpowered.

It isn't quite as powerful as a wired clipper and that's to be expected. Unlike the ""human"" versions of this model it doesn't come with a whole bunch of size attachments.

"This is an OK vacuum but it has what I consider a fairly serious design flaw. The part of the dust canister that you open at the bottom has a kind of ""lip"" there that can catch the dust in there into a difficult to remove clump. It's hard to describe well in words...the opening narrows for some reason. I guess if you empty the cup frequently that won't be a big deal but who wants to do that? Also, the beater bar stays on all the time, even when the unit is fully upright, I find that irritating.On the plus side the suction is good, the HEPA media looks substantial (though I recommend looking at what the HEPA media replacements cost) and all the seals appear to be of decent quality. The hose, by my measure, is 8 feet long with the extender attached. There is also a spot on the unit for all the attachments which is appreciated and too often not the case on vacuums. In this price range this isn't a bad choice but bear in mind the issue I mentioned at the top of this review. If you have pets you're going to hate the way the dust cup empties (or doesn't empty).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OP0P1MNLLI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1E34DQ#wasThisHelpful","R12OP0P1MNLLI2","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's slightly less powerful than my plug-in Bosch but that's to be expected.

"I'm a big fan of sensors that extend our ability to evaluate our environment.One thing that I try to avoid is particulate pollution in the air but this is a very hard thing to measure without a tool like this.  For example, I have a $400 HEPA filter but I really have no idea if it actually works.  However, now i at least have some proof that in fact it does work.If you turn on the Dylos and let it run for a few minutes you'll get a good idea of what the baseline of your room is.  Then you can place the Dylos in front of the flow of air from your HEPA filter and see what happens. In my case my counts go from about 300 and 14 to 190 and 6.  This is evidence that my HEPA filter is doing quite a bit to clean the air (removing nearly 1/2 of the small particles on the first pass through the filter and removing more than 1/2 of the large particles).Once you can do this you can also critically evaluate whether one HEPA filter is actually better than another or not.  I'm not suggesting you can get definitive proof with just this one test but you at least get some decent evidence.A caution, this unit is probably affected by how much humidity there is in the air.  So if you're trying to compare apples to apples you may also want to buy a hygrometer so that you know if the humidity has changed significantly (it is a good thing to know the humidity in your living space anyway).  Also, you probably don't want to take any one measurement as the ""truth"".  This type of device is best used to compare two different things to try and find a difference over time.  For example:Maybe you want to test if leaving the windows to you home open increases or decreases ambient dust.You may want to test whether one vacuum is superior to another when it comes to how much dust it kicks up.If there is construction nearby you may want to test how much that has increased the baseline dust level over time.Overall its going to be important to get multiple readings and to make sure you've tried to establish a good baseline level of dust in your environment.  As far as the baseline the dylos makes this pretty easy because you can set it to monitor mode and it will only turn on once for a minute every hour.  If you write down the readings for a few days you'll be able to get a good sense of what your baseline dust level is.  From there you'll be able to test other things and how they impact the amount of ambient dust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VARGZ8PVQKGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AWEG0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3VARGZ8PVQKGC","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Major rewrite revision 4-27-14.When I wrote my initial review I had some concerns that have been addressed.  For starters I bought a Dylos DC1100 Pro air quality monitor and I have confirmed that the air coming from the AP260 is indeed 99.8% purified of particles down to .5 microns.The unit has some pretty cool features, listed in no particular order:1) 4 stage air filtration that includes a pre-filter, anti-bacterial, HEPA and activated carbon.  They are estimated to last 6-8 months even with continuous use.2) The activated carbon filter is very good.  It is much more substantial than what you find in other HEPA filers.  I find that it will clear my apartment of odors very quickly.3) It looks very cool, comes with a remote and is easy to assemble.4) It moves a lot of air for each given level of sound (low, med, high).  And at night it senses that the room is dark and it goes into an extra quiet mode where on low it is barely audible (it also dims the LCD lights which is a nice touch).The main drawback is that the built in air quality monitor simply doesn't work.  I trust my Dylos more than the monitor in the Friedrich and they often disagree (the Friedrich will show red even though the Dylos is showing very good air quality).  What I do is keep my Dylos air quality monitor nearby and adjust the fan speed as needed based on the actual count of particles in the air--this works well.  With my room door shut and the filter on medium I can go from about 600 and 70 on the Dylos (it measures .5 micron and above and 2.5 micron and above in two different numbers) to 50 and 3 by the morning.  That's considerably better than my old HEPA filter which was louder and could barely get the readings to 155 and 30.Will update with decibel readings when my decibel meter arrives.Silent room with the door shut: 34dBUnit on low: 35.2dBUnit on medium: 42.2dBUnit on high: 53.9dbOn low you're paying almost no ""noise price"" at all and it still moves a decent amount of air on low.For those of you that care it emits no EMF field unless you're literally an inch away from it.  Even just 1/2 foot away from the front and the EMF field drops to background.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22J8RC0KFFI55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM34H4Y#wasThisHelpful","R22J8RC0KFFI55","A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even my import from Quicken went without a hitch.  it is a beautiful thing when the import from Quicken matches the statement from my broker to the penny.Printing copies both on paper and to a .pdf file went very well.

"One of the first things I do with any scanner is push it up to its maximum resolution, turn on duplex, and see how long it takes to scan a B/W page.  Even at 1200 DPI, on duplex, B/W this scanner runs through about 40 sheets per minute.  It's impressive.The text recognition is not supported at 1200 DPI which was a little bit disappointing.  The max resolution you can use with text recognition is 600 DPI.  This presents a problem, I think, because the software often gets the text recognition wrong.  It will get the wrong word even on a very clearly printed page.  Took off a star for that.The automatic upload to Google Docs is magical.  If you set it up properly the scanner will save a copy locally and simultaneously to your Google Docs account.  This is a very helpful feature if you need to have a backup of your scanned documents.  When setting this up remember you need to use what google calls an ""Application Specific Password"" if you use two-factor authentication.  It is different from your normal Google password, but you probably already know that if you use two-factor.Overall a nice scanner.

"We ABSOLUTELY LOVE our Amazon Fire TV!!! It has been THE Best streaming player we've owned bar none!The first thing I love about it is being able to ""say"" the name of the movie or TV show we're looking for, stead of typing it in - it's just so incredibly convenient! And there's never been an instance where it hasn't understood what we've said!The 2nd thing we love is ALL the content which is available - we LOVE having Prime! And having the Prime originals is really great - we've enjoyed every Prime original we've watched. We've enjoyed all the Netflix originals too, and can get them on Fire TV as well as our cable channels, games, picture, music, YouTube, etc...Frankly, I'm glad this wasn't around when I was a kid because I might have watched too much TV!

"The new Hoover Air Lift Deluxe has been a great tool in our arsenal of home cleaning items! I’ve been using the Air Lift over the past month, and have really put it through it’s paces. I’ve been vacuuming in every room of our home, and even took it to our daughter’s apartment, and had her do a thorough once over! I have to say, it performed very beautifully - better than any vacuum we’ve had to date!When the Air Lift first arrived there was very little assembly required. Our 12 year old son is very mechanically and technically minded, and asked if he could put it together. Last year he built his own gaming computer - so I knew he was very capable - all he needed was a Phillips head screwdriver, and he easily put the vacuum together in approximately 10 minutes. He laid out all of the pieces/tools on the floor, followed the directions - which were very clear, and put the vacuum together easily. (It wouldn’t have taken him as long as it did, but I questioned the way he put the handle on - which I’ll get to later.)One of the really nice features of the Air Lift is the “lift off” canister - which makes getting to those harder to clean areas so much easier - like stairs and above the head areas. When you want to use the lift off “canister” portion of the vacuum, you simply pull the hose out and attach the tool you want to use. Then you turn the Air Lift “ON”, and grip the handle of the canister - or lift off part of the vacuum, and pull the canister off the main vacuum. At 17 pounds the canister is heavy for me to carry around - that's where my husband comes in. I have to say though, despite it's weight, the canister made cleaning our stairs and tight spaces SO much easier! We have 3 levels in our home, the steps are all carpeted, and the Air Lift did an amazing job cleaning them. I was really impressed - things that our last vacuum missed because it was too heavy to lift and try to vacuum at the sane time, and where the dustbuster otherwise missed dirt or dust, came up quickly, on the first pass. I was also able to get to the tops of all of the ceiling fans, as well as giving all of the draperies a well needed going over without sucking them into the vacuum.The Air Lift also has great attachments - which fit neatly on-board the vacuum. If you have a pet who sheds, the pet hair tool lifts pet fur or hair easily - even from Berber carpeting. There’s also a crevice tool - which great for getting into tight spaces - like the area under the refrigerator and around the washer and dryer - which I normally hate trying to clean because it’s usually difficult to get all the dust bunnies that collect. There’s also a turbo tool, a 3 in 1 pivoting brush, and a wand - for those above the head, hard to reach areas - like ceilings, tops of curtains, and ceiling fans.Normally I have trouble vacuuming because of the weight of vacuums, but the power and steer-ability of the Air Lift make vacuuming pretty easy. Steering around objects is simple because the Air Lift is on a ball mechanism - by just maneuvering the handle the vacuum steers effortlessly around objects. There’s never a loss of suction even when maneuvering around furniture and other objects because of Hoover’s 3 channel “Wind Tunnel” Cyclonic Technology, and also edge cleaning - which pulls in any dirt from the area to the side of the vacuum - so you don’t have to worry about missing areas as you go around objects. This is a corded vac, but you have 30 feet of cord to work with - which was plenty of cord for my needs in all of our rooms.Another nice feature is how the Air lift automatically adjusts to different carpet heights, and with one touch of a button, goes easily from carpet to wood or vice versa. It does an excellent job of cleaning both. I loved the way it cleaned the wood floors in my kitchen - so I can quickly run the vac instead of dust mopping numerous times before wet mopping. I can easily get inside the cabinets and pull off the canister to do the upper cabinets, and above the cabinets as well. I have chronic back pain, so bending down to turn dials, push buttons, and lift vacuums really pains me. The Air Lift has made things much easier on me in that regard.Earlier I mentioned that when our son was putting the vac together it seemed the handle was on backwards. When you look at the vacuum it looks like the handle should be reversed, and this was one of the things I wasn't thrilled with about the vacuum - it just feels like it's on backwards. The only other thing about the vac that takes away from its appeal is its weight - at 25 pounds it's heavy, even though it's auto powered.The Air Lift also has a HEPA filtering system - with a washable filter plus a secondary filtering system - which is a definite improvement over all replaceable filters. The dirt cup is simple to empty, and nothing has to be touched when it needs to be emptied. However to keep things smelling fresh, like all vacs, you have to clean it periodically.This is one of the best vacuums we’ve had and one of the easiest to use. If you’re thinking of getting a new vacuum, and you don't mind a heavier vacuum, this is one you might want to consider!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSID6703KPHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K1XICQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FSID6703KPHD","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this product didn't make any visible difference for my neck after using entire bottle. However, like they said, due to age differences, skin types, and condition of skin it's hard to meet the needs of every person. Since it's marketed specifically for the neck I thought I'd give it a try. Although the problem with my neck started after I lost weight - I got icky skin that I've been working to improve.  This wasn't an expensive cream, and I tried a $65 cream I got from a doctor, and didn't get better results - so I just have to keep working the muscles, moisturizing, and eating right.This company does have a 100% money back guarantee which they honor. I have used many, many products and have NEVER dealt with a company that actually reached out to me to try to RETURN my money!!! For that alone they get kudos!

"I bought this for my husband to use as a bedside table. Obviously it's taller than a bedside table, but prefect for holding lots of different types of things. He had a standard bedside table with three drawers before, but there was too much clutter on the top. The for level Braxton table holds everything without looking ultra cluttered. He can have his clock and phone, his cell and charger, his speakers, and assorted reading, vitamins, snacks, and misc.The colour is dark brown - it's not real wood, but looks handsome and holds up well to all the daily wear and tear that we tend to put our bedroom furniture through with spills and lack of coasters.

"However, unfortunately the Jabra Eclipse failed where it's really important - which is call quality.The pros for this device are many - it's small size means, for someone like me, it's almost unnoticeable because it's mostly covered by my hair. Although Jabra says this is a right ear only device, I didn't find that to be true - it actually fits better in my left ear, and I hear better with it in my left ear. I don't have any hearing problems in either ear, but after trying both the medium and large ear buds, the fit and noise cancellation was best in my left ear.  That being said, I found it disorienting to drive with the Eclipse in my ear - probably affecting my vestibular system in some way. (This might just be me, and didn't affect my scoring.)The set up of the Jabra Eclipse is incredibly easy. This was one of the plusses of the Eclipse! Once you turn on your phone's Bluetooth and NFC, you push the button on the bottom of the Eclipse' s charger (which I'll get to later),Swipe your phone across the bottom of the charger, and with the Eclipse in your ear, you'll be given instructions on how to pair the Eclipse with your phone.Go back into the Bluetooth menu and select device.Pairing will occur, and the Eclipse will give you a clear verbal okay if pairing has occurred.If there's a problem, the Eclipse will further instruct you on what to do.At this point you should be good to go!There were a few things that I found lacking:First and foremost is the lack of support on Jabra' s website. When looking at electronics I like to go to the brand site, and also checkthe user manual. When you go to Jabra's site there's a page where you can select your device by name or type. Oddly the Eclipse isn't availableto choose! I left messages in their feedback and support sections that adding the Eclipse might be a good idea.The manual which comes with the Eclipse lacks much explanation, so for people who aren't tech savvy, or who need written instruction, this was a definite minus. However, if you follow the instructions and add the Jabra app, set up should be a breeze. Except that there are many Jabra apps - stick with the one(s) recommended by Jabra for the Eclipse.Back to the Jabra website ... the manuals and firmware updates are all available online, so you don't have to hang onto papers and packaging.There's a place on the site to register your new device - a good idea, so you can be made aware of firmware updates.The FACS on the site are lacking. They could make use of user friendly links to real user questions, because when you ask a question you're often given irrelevant information.My biggest disappointment with the Jabra Eclipse is the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, and as Jabra's top of the line Bluetooth headset, I was hoping for better results.  I tried the headset from various distances and situations, and 7 out of 10 times I had to call the person back on my Moto X cell phone. I found it odd that the sound quality in calls was so poor because the instructions given by the headset, in your ear are very clear.There didn't seem to be any reason why sound quality was good on one call, and not on the next few calls. I'm hopeful Jabra will work this out and make improvements.The Jabra charger is simply incredible, and one of the best features! Prior to using the headset, the charger is charged for 3 hours. Once that's done a green light indicates you have 60 - 100% battery life, a blue light indicates 30 - 60% battery life, and a red light indicates you have 30% or less. The Eclipse is held in the charger magnetically - which is genius because the charger can be unhooked from the USB cord, and taken with you to maintain its charge. When it needs to be charged, just reattach the micro USB cord and hook up to your computer or other USB charger. The Jabra instructions indicate you're to charge via computer, but that's not necessary, any USB charging outlet will do.All things considered, at this time I wouldn't recommend the Eclipse because of the call quality. All other minuses can be overlooked, but call quality is the primary reason for using a Bluetooth headset.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BY4WZEHTEI33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EUQ492#wasThisHelpful","R3BY4WZEHTEI33","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is VERY thin, and won't provide much protection if the phone is dropped. However, I've found the thicker cases we've tried on our Moto X phones tend to interfere with some of the keys when texting or searching. So it's a matter of what's more important. My phone gets lighter use - so I can use a thinner case.

"My husband and I have been researching PEMF for chronic pain, chronic fatigue, and cancer at a site put out by Dr William Pawluk - probably the foremost leading authority on pulsed electromagnetic frequency therapy. I was thrilled to find this inexpensive little unit through Amazon, Although I was concerned about how long it would take to receive the unit from the UK, I just had to order it, and as it turns out, there was no reason to worry at all! It was delivered very quickly and has been worth each and every penny!!!We have been trying to decide whether or not it would be worth an investment in a whole body unit. I have had chronic pain for over 30 years from two major car accidents, and then 8 yrs ago I fractured my spine wiping out on a patch of wet mud while on my daily bike ride, etc . . .  I've been to SO many doctors, tried different therapies and medications, but I'm allergic to most of the medications, or they leave me worse off than in pain. Not to mention the hoops one has to jump through with our ""new and improved"" healthcare system - it's such a mess!  I want to find and go to battle for anyone who has to deal with chronic pain, or chronic illness - so they won't have to deal with everything I've had to deal with over the years. I've felt the need to explore all the alternatives.This has been the most promising alternative I've found so far, I was SO pleased to find this inexpensive alternative to opioid pain medications. I do wish PEMF were more available in the U.S. - it's pretty standard in Europe, and has been for decades. In the U.S. it has been used very successfully in veterinary care for a long time, so why isn't it a standard in the treatment of humans? Pharmaceutical companies!  You can't have something like PEMF out there which has so many practical applications because it would seriously cut into profits. Incredibly shameful that we live in a time where money takes precedence over human life, comfort, and care.The only downside is that if you have widespread pain, you will have to move this little unit around, OR buy more than one unit. Or, like we did, buy one to see if it works for you, while seeing if it's worth investing in a larger unit, but it DOES work! This unit is about the size of a 50 cent piece.If you have chronic pain,  and want, or need, an alternative, I would VERY much encourage you to give this a try!One word of caution with regard to other units:this unit uses two 2025 lithium batteries - which it comes with, but some of the other units only last as long as the battery with which they come - so just be aware if you look at other units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SVXYXWUO970/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G3QW80#wasThisHelpful","R18SVXYXWUO970","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Clorox Toilet Wand Disinfecting Refills, (30 Ct) is an incredible product! We bought the Clorox Wands several years ago when we wanted to get away from having a toilet brush, harboring who knows what kinds of bacteria, in our bathrooms. At the time we were thinking in terms of our kids and dogs, and health issues. Sure, I used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect, but never liked having a brush that had cleaned our toilets, sitting ... well, anywhere!Shortly after buying the wands/refill kit for one bathroom, we liked it so much we bought one for our 2nd bathroom, and now we have the whole shabang - there's a holder for the refills and the wand, and it really looks much better than the old brush - even though we had a decorative one.Using the wand and refill is SO incredibly simple, and I make it almost a no touch job, and have taught our kids the same - so they know how to clean a bathroom as they grow up and go off to college. The refill has a small protrusion on the top, which snaps into the wand, once it clicks in, it's secure, and you can clean. I start by getting the pad nice and wet by swirling the pad around the bowl, once that's clean, it's up and under the rim until it's clean. To make it a no touch job, press the pad against the part of the bowl that's pretty dry, and clean the underside of the seat, and around the top - above the rim, rinsing as needed in the bowl. Once that's clean, make sure to check the front of the toilet, and around the fasteners and behind the seat - again, rinsing as needed in the bowl, flush if necessary. Then wipe everything down and it will be nice and shiny and clean! Repeat as needed.This has been the best system we've ever used, and I can't see a change anytime in the future - unless they make a self cleaning toilet, or we win the lottery and someone else wants the job!I highly recommend the Clorox Toilet Wand and Disinfecting Refills to anyone who has to clean toilets, but doesn't really want to do the job. This makes it less of a hassle to do a job which must be done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BK31X4I24FJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2T6SQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2BK31X4I24FJJ","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought, from looking at the picture, the LED backlight was blue, but it's not ... it's blue, green, orange, red, purple, and can also be set to cycle through all the colors! It's SO cool! The LED lighting is every bit as bright as what's shown in each of the Fanmis S-Shock pictures - so you can see the various colors. It also has a timer, a stopwatch, an alarm, a calendar, and a compass - what's not to love?!I first ordered one for our son who's going off to college because I wanted him to be on time for classes - thus the alarm. He rides his bike a lot - this the LED backlight - which is more amazing than any watch I've ever seen!Anyway, once I ordered the watch for our older son, our younger son saw the picture, and expressed an interest - well he's the one who got this watch, and he just loves it!

"I LOVED this series! I knew it only had one season, and I didn't look ahead - so I was thrilled that it had 22 episodes!  I was surprised that there was only 1 season actually because this was a really great series, although it did move through the story line quite quickly after a certain point, and didn't end leaving you hanging. The way it ended, there was plenty of room for more seasons though.This was the story of ""The Tomorrow People"" who, at a certain point in their lives ""break out"" to their full potential - with the 3 T's  - Teleportation, Telepathy, and Telekinesis. It seems to happen in their late teens, and if a parent isn't around to let them know what's happening, they're telepathically contacted by either the ""Tomorrow People"" - if they're lucky, or their evil counterparts - who have been turned by this agency to track down the ""break-outs"" and either bring them in to be turned, have their powers removed, or killed.The way I'm describing it doesn't make it sound all that great, but I watched the whole season in 3 days on Netflicks - kind of a binge and it was really good.Now I'm on to a new series - Lost Girl - which thankfully has 4 seasons!

"I LOVE this shredder!  I’ve had 4 shredders since college, and this is my favorite!It’s the largest, with the biggest bin, and a smaller inside bin for discs and credit cards. The bin slides out from the front - so you don’t have to pull the top off, like you do with so many others - which is messy and time consuming. I put a trash bag inside the bin - so when it’s full, I just slide the bin out, pull the bag out, put a new bag in, and I’m ready to go!When I first set this shredder up, I have to admit I had a bit of a problem. Although it’s a no brainer, basically you just plug it in, I’m not big on reading instructions unless I have problems! ;) I kept hitting the power button - which is right on the front, and it wouldn’t turn on! Hmmm… Time to consult the very complete instructions! Oh! There’s a power button on the back! Great safety feature if there are any little ones in the house - or people who don’t read instructions! LOLAnyway, I like the feature that it is always on, ready to go when you need to shred. There’s forward and reverse - in case of a jam - which hasn’t happened to me yet. This shredder is really quiet - which is really nice compared to the ones I’ve used in the past. No shredder is whisper quiet, but this one is the best I’ve had. The manual says it will cut through staples as well as paper clips. I’ll put staples through my shredders, but not paper clips - I don’t want to wear the blades out by doing that, but it’s nice to know that if I forget, it’s not going to ruin the shredder!It’s 23” high by 15” wide by 9.5” deep, and weighs approximately 19 pounds. The bin hold 5 pounds of paper and there’s a full indicator when you need to empty the bin - which is really nice. There’s also an overheat indicator, so you can stop shredding before the shredder stops due to overheating. I also love that this shredder is on castors - it’s so easy to move, and since the top doesn’t come off, I don’t have to worry about pulling it apart every time I need to move it!The shredder opening is 9” wide, and placed in such a way that it would be very difficult for someone to get their fingers caught in the mechanism. There’s an indented area in which the paper is supposed to slide, and then the area goes down at a sharp angle to prevent things from being inserted that shouldn’t be inserted! That’s what makes it unique from any other shredder I’ve seen or used! There’s also a separate credit card slot, but when I used that I didn’t like it because it didn’t shred my credit card well - but when I put it through the regular slot, it shredded it into crosscut micro shreds, just like it did with papers - so that’s no big deal.

"I LOVE the Basil collection of Mrs Meyer’s products! They smell SO refreshing and clean! I grow basil in my own garden because of its aromatic qualities as well as for cooking. From the site: “The basil herb is known for its uncanny ability to ease the nerves and perk up the senses — a handy combination!” It makes you want to clean!Our kids wash their hands more frequently because they like the natural smell.I buy the refills of the Everyday Cleaners as well as the hand soaps. Both container  - the Everyday Cleaner Spray bottle, and the Hand Soap pump bottle hold up for use time and time again!These are very reasonably priced products for the high quality, gentle products which clean really well, and smell OH SO Wonderful!I’ve also used these products outside to clean our patio furniture cushions and glass table top. It also cleans up the baby pool and patio like a breeze, and some of the products seem to have bug repellant qualities! The geranium seems to be especially good at this - real geraniums are bug repellants - so it just makes sense! Our neighbor cleans his bird feeders and bird bath with Mrs Meyer’s products - he says it’s bird safe (I don’t know - I don’t have birds, but he’s never had a problem!)The scent in the Basil Everyday Cleaner comes from basil oil, parsley oil, and black pepper oil. The part of the product that cuts through grease comes from birch bark extract.I haven’t had a chance to try all the various scents because I haven’t found all of them, but I look forward to trying them. I’ve never tried one I didn’t like.I highly recommend Mrs Meyer’s Products!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3KMXOOAEYQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088OW9V8#wasThisHelpful","R1H3KMXOOAEYQC","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Astragalus - called huang qu in traditional Chinese Medicine, has been used in many other TCM formulas that serve as primary defense mechanisms for the body. Besides using the herb in supplements, it’s often used in cooking because it’s nourishing and strengthening - esp. when people are sick. In TCM it tonifies the spleen - when illness causes fatigue.Astragalus is a foundational herb in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The root is an amazing supplement - which our entire family swears by especially during cold and flu season, but during any time of physical or emotional stress. Astragalus supports deep immune function and liver function, it also helps the body adapt to stress. Somewhere I read that if you take Astragalus during a virus, you won’t get that same virus ever again during your lifetime. I don’t know if that’s true, but we take it when we begin to feel sick, and we avoid most of the colds and flus that go around w/o getting flu shots. Our college age kids always take a bottle back to college with them, and call home for more when they run out!It can be purchased as a capsule with dried powder from the root, dried root powder, or the roots can be purchased and you can make a decoction from boiling the root in water - it’s made strong by boiling for an extended length of time.This is one of the herbs that will always be in our cabinet, and that of all of our kids!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8YH5WHK19O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002I25HQ#wasThisHelpful","RS8YH5WHK19O7","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"N-acetyl cysteine is a major detoxifier in the human body. In studies it has demonstrated liver detoxification benefits. It also helps remove environmental toxins including tobacco and other types of carbon-monoxide smoke, alcohol, and environmental pollution.It can be used by those concerned with liver toxicity associated with long term use of OTC anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which can damage the liver. It’s very effective at removing aluminum and other heavy metals from the blood stream, and the organs.Experiments have shown that NAC prevents the buildup of aluminum in the brain, preventing aluminum toxicity. Aluminum has been suspected in Alzheimer’s disease - something I’d like to prevent - so I’m willing to take extra supplements in order to avoid it in my lifetime.NAC is an amino acid which has also been found to have some anti-depressant qualities, but like some other serotonin producing products, doesn’t appear to increase the likelihood of serotonin syndrome.I will continue to take this supplement.

"I’ve read some really interesting and fascinating books about religion over the years. “The Vatican Prophecies”, by John Thavis did not disappoint.Thavis, explores many issues in his book, ""The Vatican Prophecies: Investigating Supernatural Signs, Apparitions and Miracles in the Modern Age."" It’s not at all a long book, and it’s told in an interesting way, which delves into these issues in enough depth that held my interest. It was so readable and well told that I read it straight through without putting it down the first time. Then I found myself reading through the chapters again, often several times to soak it in. Thavis doesn’t try to sway you one way or another, he just presents the various balanced views, and you are left to your own thoughts - which is why I read and reread chapters, and parts of chapters.I found the chapter on miracles most engrossing. The Catholic church doesn’t have a monopoly on miracles - they happen all the time. IMO, the fact that we’re even here is a miracle! As someone not raised Catholic, reading the book reinforced my beliefs about much of what once seemed a bit different. To some it’s even controversial. Most of the topics aren’t synonymous with the Catholic Church, it’s just that the Catholic church is more rigorous before recognizing something as miraculous - it has to be. One of those issues surrounds the visions in various parts of the world.The Catholic Church doesn’t have a lock on visions either, many people have visions of the departed - maybe not of Jesus or Mary, but visions none the less! Some of those people are called religious, some psychic, and unfortunately some are labeled mentally ill (if indeed they aren’t). What is different is the degree to which the Catholic Church goes to authenticate visions, miracles, angelic happenings, the demonic, and other supernatural things.  Most people approach these topics with a sense of cynicism to one degree or another. The Church has  processes that are followed in order to authenticate visions and miracles. Right or wrong, the Catholic Church is mired in processes it must follow in order to avoid fraudulence and people who would take advantage monetarily. Although I don’t know why anyone in their right mind would put themselves out there in that way if it wasn’t authentic - with the throngs of people flocking to the sites of visionaries, miraculous events, and healings, and the upheaval it places on their lives and their communities!The book gives us so much in six chapters, Each chapter gives specific examples regarding each topic. And although it’s not a long book, there is the right amount of detail given to each topic. There’s insight into the inner workings of the Vatican, and how it  responds to, investigates, and makes decisions regarding the supernatural.It’s understandable that so much time is given to authentication because of the size and age of the institution which is the largest religious organization in the world.I recommend this book to anyone who’s interested in learning any more about how the Church goes about verifying (or not) things miraculous, and the inner workings of the Vatican.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3JGN20SNF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426892#wasThisHelpful","RR3JGN20SNF2","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of the many Cobalamin co-factors I've tried, while this one is very reasonable priced, it takes much longer to dissolve than the other bioavailable cobalamins - methylated, adenosyl, and dibencozide forms of B-12.I'm rating it 3 stars because it's a viable option for those who need to take one or both of the co-factors. For those who need to take Methyl B-12, and like the Swanson, it's probably as good as the other 5 mg products.There are more people unable to absorb B-12 through food than are probably aware, making supplementation with one or both of the co-factors better than trying to get the needed amount through food. It's currently estimated that 30% of adults are unable to absorb B-12 through diet, which can lead to fatigue, anemia, and current research at the University of Oxford shows that vitamin B-12 deficiency can even lead to brain shrinkage. Research is also suggesting a link between vitamin B-12 deficiency and Alzheimer's disease.I have a Vitamin B-12 deficiency which led to a form of anemia that causes overwhelming and unrelenting fatigue. Because of the Vitamin B-12 deficiency my red blood cells don't develop as they should, and can't carry oxygen as needed throughout my body. I've used either oral drops or sublingual B-12 that dissolves more readily. Either or both of the B-12 co-factors - Methylcobalamin or Adenosylcobalamin, or the two combined - Dibencozide, are bioavailable and absorbable orally.  Others brands I've tried, which I found dissolve more readily are:  the 5 mg Methylcobalamin from Source Naturals, the 3 mg Dibencozide from Country Life. The other co-factor, Adenosylcobalamin - is the only way Vitamin C is contributed to the Krebs Cycle.  My preference is a  non-GMO/Organic product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LAOSI2DKDLOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00068S9VI#wasThisHelpful","R3LAOSI2DKDLOB","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far so good. I've found the Silk'n Blue to be a really great alternative to both prescription and OTC medications for my skin problems. What I especially like with regard to that is that I don't have to worry about side effects and adverse reactions with medications, as well as allergic reactions - such as contact dermatitis all the way to anaphylactic reactions. I've even had paradoxical reactions and in one case with a pretty common medicine had Stevens Johnson Syndrome - which no one would ever want!I feel very comfortable that I'm not going to have any of these reactions with the Silk'n Blue - I haven't had any problems with it so far, and I'm finding my skin slowly clearing. My husband suggested I treat one area and leave another - so I can visibly compare the difference. This was a great idea, so I decided that was how I would go about comparing how well the Silk'n Blue is working for me. (I will post pictures IF they're not too embarrassing!)I like the warmth of the Silk'n Blue on my skin. It's a very gentle, soothing warmth, I've never felt any burning. The time investment isn't much more than applying medications, and I feel that I'm doing something both safe for my skin, and good for my skin. There's no smell as there often is with medications for the skin.As I said, I'm slowly beginning to see positive results with the Silk'n Blue on my skin.

"I am one of those people who has to take the co-factors of B-12, not Cyanocobalamin, and I have to take the co-factors in pretty high doses for it to be effective for me. I've been taking Source Naturals Methylcobalamin for a long time - a couple of years at least, and I;m really happy with it. I put it under my tongue and it dissolves really well. It tastes good too - so no complaints there! It gives me a bit of a boost in energy and my B12 on my bloodwork has been better since I've been taking the co-factors - which was the whole point of taking the sublinguals - energy, better bloodwork, and avoiding shots - which are usually Cyanocobalamin and didn't improve my bloodwork.I would recommend Source Naturals Methylcobalamin for anyone with a B-12 deficiency or the MTHR genetic problem.*the only one tiny thing I don't care for is the red dye - if I brush my teeth within an hour of taking it, my tongue is red, and when I rinse, I spit red, but I can live with that because it's the only issue I have. ...And NO I DON'T have a problem with the miniscule amount of sugar in this product! ; )","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5I7BXE3BB5R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014GWAKM#wasThisHelpful","R5I7BXE3BB5R9","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm used to taking regular sublingual NADH or ENADA NADH, but it's EXPENSIVE!!!  This is NOT a sublingual, but it seems to work pretty well and it's quite a bit less expensive, so I'll either stick with it, or go without NADH! I had to become really familiar with supplements - I've had some pretty serious health issues for about 30 years, and western medicine has utterly failed at helping.  I've had to find things that would help me the most. I use a combination of Ayurvedic medicine, herbs, amino acids, whey protein, and vitamins.This supplement, for me, has helped me with fatigue. So I will continue to take it because anything that helps the fatigue is a good thing. There's nothing worse than being 50ish, and feeling like you're 80!This formulation of NADH also contains ribose - which I would take anyway, and although the dose is small, and the NADH is not sublingual - which is not the way I would normally prefer to take it. This is affordable, and seems to help somewhat, so it's better than paying way too much and agonizing over sublingual NADH, or taking a lesser dose of NADH and not being satisfied with that.I take supplements for a host of autoimmune disorders where I need  a boost to my mitochondrial energy. I've tried to add them in gradually ... one at a time so I can tell if they help or not. I know some people would prefer to take NADH sublingually - generally I would as well, but I haven't found it it to be an issue with this particular supplement. Since it's a capsule, I open it up and put it in a very small amount of water stir, and drink, and I haven't had any issues what so ever.I would recommend for those who would supplement with these two supplements, or people who need a subtle boost in energy - not a miracle - works over a period of time - approximately 3 months to really tell whether it's helping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D71F5ZVTBODC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030GXSVE#wasThisHelpful","R3D71F5ZVTBODC","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie was SO genius - I would think anyone would end up appreciating it on some level. It was one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen - I had to admire the writer, because of the way he showed you how very fragile the human psyche can be, and how interconnected our experience.The two main characters question their own reality and that of the other, which is made more difficult when they seek to find each other and can't, and yet they know things about the other which is seemingly impossible. It's all very mind boggling!  I'm not sure if this movie is  described as sci-fi, but it's certainly a real mind bender - very different, but one of those movies I know I won't forget, and I don't say that about movies very often!I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but I will give some basics ... there are two primary characters, one male and one female. They seem to be stuck in what I'd say are parallel, but alternate realities. They experience the other without being able to physically being able to reach the other, but at a certain point feel an almost desperate need to find the other.One is sane but is written as crazy and begins to feel crazy and runs from the craziness. The other is good and just but feels bad, and takes on the guilt and shame of a lifetime - that causes them to seem locked in a prison of their own being from which they can't escape. As desperation sets in for both of them, they frantically want to save the other.The devil is in the details.Yes, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of cult movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XY02W2LD2I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDXHTZW#wasThisHelpful","R35XY02W2LD2I6","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earring are pretty and sparkly. When I opened the bubble wrap envelop, I pulled out a nice black box - which held a black flocked earring card that had a little pocket on the back. I make jewelry, and I've never seen a earring card like this - with the little pocket on the back - I suppose it was so you could either put the earrings on the card, or in the pocket on the back, I'm not sure. The box itself was nice - black on the bottom, bright blue on the inside top. It's the type of packaging I'd use for my own jewelry - except for the ""made in China"" sticker on the bottom of the black box.As for the earrings themselves, they are pretty, and I would wear them except for the fact that they were SO incredibly uncomfortable! They're lever back earrings and they were extremely difficult to put in my ears. I've never had any problems with french wires or any other ear wires, but these were SO much thicker, and the wires are flat - it's not what I'm used to, and it's not anything I'd use when making jewelry, or buy.Lever backs are often poorly made and break really easily. I can honestly say these are well made and had a nice spring to them. The two pieces aligned perfectly every time, and there was never any sign they would break.For people who like lever backs I would recommend these.

"This is one of my favorite therapeutic yoga videos. It's very well done in that the asanas, while not held log enough, are well done, and shown accurately. I had seen videos by Kanta Barrios prior to viewing this one, and while some may not be comfortable with both the voiceover as well as the length of each pose, the stretches, poses, and relaxation shown are excellent as a springboard for your own yoga practice. Each part can be done for the length of time desired either by pausing the video, which is what I did initially, or taking each part and extending it on ones own once familiar with each part.Be prepared with relatively standard yoga accessories - block, mat, strap ...This is a good video for those who have minor back problems, but don't expect a quick fix.

"The Moonlight Rocking Sleeper Deluxe gently rocks babies - soothing them when they’re fussy, or helping them drift off to sleep when they’re sleepy. The way the sleeper is made, the baby is cradled almost like they’re being swaddled - it cuddles them in a way putting them down in a crib can’t unless they’re swaddled in a blanket.  Some of the other rocking or vibrating sleepers sit at an angle so it’s a little more difficult to put a newborn down for fear they’ll slid down in the seat, but with this sleeper the baby lies flat, and you strap them in with a 3-point harness, so there are no worries that the baby is going anywhere … but to sleep.The sleeper stands firmly on sturdy legs and yet folds pretty easily for portability. The vibrating unit comes off when you don’t want to use it (It only has one speed - which you might want to use sparingly to preserve batteries - although it does shut off automatically which is really nice. Most units don’t have that feature.)The best feature, when putting baby down at night to go to sleep is the starry light projector with lullabyes. Baby can be put down and learn to drift off to sleep without being bounced or walked by a person which is a better way for baby to go to sleep and better for mom and dad’s backs! The musical unit plays 5 lullabies, but it also plays nature sounds as well. You can set it up a bit if baby goes down fussy, but you can set it on low if you want the music or nature sounds to be very gentle - there are 3 volume settings.During the day, when baby is more alert, but you need some time to help the other children, or get something done quickly, you can fold the unit and bring it to where baby can be in sight and turn on the mobile - which has two floating toys and is easily removable.The fabric comes off for easy washing, but be careful not to dry on hot or they won’t fit back on. Either air dry, or dry on air fluff.This is a great unit especially for new parents, but it’s also great for busy parents and grandparents as well. We highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66RMC27IN6NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3V1BO#wasThisHelpful","R66RMC27IN6NU","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one of my least favorite mascaras unfortunately. Remember Tammy Faye Baker? Imagine the mascara she would've used, and I imagine this would've worked perfectly for her ... although I don't think she was striving for the ""Manga"" look!On first impressions, when pulling the brush out of the tube, the brush is slathered with thick mascara. I really think this mascara could be better if it had a better brush, but the brush that's in the tube has short, stumpy brush that offers no separation. I felt I ended up with a sloppy mess on my lashes, which I didn't like at all. Did you ever put on mascara and feel your vision was darker? I felt that way after the first time I applied this mascara.In order to apply and get any semblance of lash separation, you really have to scrape quite a bit of mascara off of the brush ... if not one's lashes would end up not pleasingly covered with mascara - clumpy, gloppy, no definition. When applied it's just too thick. I realize this is a volumizing mascara, but there has to be some definition to the lash - if not it doesn't enhance anyone's eyes!In order to get any sort of pleasing look, scraping the wand wasn't enough. I had to swipe the brush through a paper towel - which I hate to do because mascara should only be in the tube or on the lashes - anywhere else could increase chances for bacteria. However, because this mascara is so thick it couldn't be applied straight from the tube.I also tried scraping the wand and then using a lash comb vertically to just remove a bit of the excess mascara and give a bit more separation, but all of this was just too much work. More work than I'm used to in a mascara!One other think I didn't like was I found the mascara irritating to my eyes. I wouldn't take away any stars for this because I do have sensitive eyes and I've found thick mascaras tend to be more irritating because tears, even normal tears make the mascara more susceptible to running into my eyes - so take that with a grain of salt.I don't feel I can recommend this mascara because it was just too thick and the brush wasn't one I'd want to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BNKZ46U1QD9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0XPCIG#wasThisHelpful","R3BNKZ46U1QD9P","A30638B9S2GOM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30638B9S2GOM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good, basic intro to puppy/dog training. It's a bit superficial and doesn't go into great depth, but covers all the essential topics for a new puppy owner. I especially like the tips and advice for kids and puppies. Excellent reminders! The instructions for teaching a dog not to jump up are good, but I would add that teaching a dog to sit instead of jumping up is helpful - then you're replacing a bad habit with a good one rather than just teaching the dog not to jump up.For .99 cents, this Kindle purchase is a no brainer. I bought this on audiobook and found the narration pleasant with good emphasis in the right spots. The information is spot on for the basics. For in depth info when you need more help, I like The Puppy Primer by Patricia McConnell and Barron's Dog Training Bible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AT7CRJ5NGNKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZ73WSM#wasThisHelpful","R3AT7CRJ5NGNKD","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My puppy loves this toy! He chews on it and also plays tug-of-war without losing interest. I like that it's made in the USA and the vanilla scent is pleasant. The inside curves are a bit flimsy, so I can see a retriever breed or other enthusiastic chewer might wear this out quickly, but my standard poodle will probably have this toy for years.

"The size Large is plenty big for my fifty pound Standard Poodle. She loves the bees and they're great for fetch and tossing in the air. She's fascinated by the bees hiding in the hive, but she hasn't figured out the hide and seek game. She just gingerly extracts a bee and takes it to her chair to play with it.Our new puppy loves this! He plays fetch with the bees, tug of war with the wings and rests his head on the hive when he's napping. The squeakers conveniently get his attention when he needs to be redirected.Very soft, well stuffed, easy squeakers, everything seems well made. I'll have to put this away when my mom's dog comes for a visit since she ruins stuffed toys, but my dog will enjoy this without tearing it apart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R805VBD39EHZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002I0O5Q#wasThisHelpful","R805VBD39EHZ8","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this Rose Water! I recently tried buying a less expensive brand because I liked the fancy lid with a pump dispenser, but it turned out to be Rose Water Oil and smelled like the Dentist's office. I won't stray again! This product is 100% Pure Rose Distillate and it smells incredible (if you like roses, which I do).I make my own facial toner using 1/2 oz rose water, 1/2 oz witch hazel and a couple drops of NAN Baby Skin essential oil.

"Very well written and I love the layout with lots of pictures and captions. The puppy psychology is helpful, relevant and easy to grasp. The training plan is completely step-by-step and seems fool proof if followed correctly. I was skimming ""Barron's Dog Training Bible"" while reading this and learned from that book that Dr. Yin's training method is called ""capturing"" since you're trying to capture a behavior a puppy will naturally perform (like sitting). I like the theory of this method, though I don't have my new puppy yet so haven't practiced it. I'm more familiar with the training method called ""luring"" where you hold a treat to lure the dog into the desired position (like sitting). It seems to me that a combination of training methods will ultimately be best over the long term (at least for my comfort level), but Yin's book will get any puppy off to a great start!I have a couple small points of disagreement, but these will be a matter of personal preference. I'm currently reading the autobiographical ""A Dog Walks into a Nursing Home"" (which I highly recommend) and when considering training methods for her seven-year-old Labradoodle to become a Therapy Dog, that author, Sue Halpern, came across the suggestion to provide all food in a ""Kong"" feeding toy. Halpern basically pokes fun at the emphatic use of Kong specifically and moves onto another trainer's book, so I had to chuckle when the topic came up in this book. Dr. Yin is also a proponent of NEVER using a dog food bowl and the dog earning ALL food as rewards or getting it out of a food toy or puzzle. Sorry, I just don't agree with this. It seems to me that dogs have a basic right to food and water and shouldn't have to ALWAYS work for it. Sometimes? Yes. Treats? Always should be earned. My two cents, but I'm not a vet or an Animal Behaviorist and Dr. Yin is both.Secondly, I've quickly and successfully housebroken four dogs in over thirty years and NEVER used paper or potty pads in the house, even as a 'just in case.' When I worked, I came home during my lunch hour to let them out and play with them so they were never cooped up for more than four+ hours. I've read other experts say paper training is confusing and dogs need to be clear that outside is the ONLY place to go to the bathroom, and I agree. I'm watching my sister potty train (or not) her year-old Yorkshire Terrier and he consistently pees on his potty pad and then proceeds to poop all over the house. What a disaster! Dr. Yin emphasizes over and over to be vigilant and keep the dog with you while potty training (totally agree - this works!). But she also mentions laying down paper in a playpen area as needed, and I personally wouldn't do this. Again, only my two cents, and that's about what it's worth since I'm not an expert.Other than these two points, I think this book is brilliant! I'm sitting with a stack of a dozen dog/puppy training books and this is one of the only ones to hold my attention from cover to cover. Very practical advice with lots of detailed photographs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ONG9W65BMN65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0964151871#wasThisHelpful","R2ONG9W65BMN65","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't my first rodeo. I've lived with six dogs over the past fourty-plus years and will be shortly getting a new puppy. Since I haven't had a puppy in ten years, and I'd like to enjoy living with a very well-trained dog, I'm reading through a dozen dog/puppy training books I've purchased or borrowed from the library. This one did not impress me, at all. She lost me at 'no one should ever own a pure bred dog because they have terrible health issues.' (I'm paraphrasing.) I'm not a breeder, but I felt like the section on why pure breds have health problems was an insult to responsible breeders, especially those who ship new breeding lines over from other continents just to infuse new blood into their breeding programs. Her argument basically states that since AKC restrictions create such a small breeding pool, there is inherent inbreeding in pure breds. That's like saying people who live on small islands shouldn't have kids. Responsible breeders test for a number of health issues before even breeding their dogs. But she goes on to admit mixed-breed dogs have health issues too.....Then when you get to the section on ""How to Find a Good Breeder"" she writes:""A second source of breeder referrals is word of mouth [the first source being AKC's web page]. This could mean your neighbor who has a nice dog, though nice dogs surprisingly often come from unpromising sources."" What? All my dogs have been nice, even the ones rescued as adults. It's not a crap shoot...well mannered dogs take effort and training. That's why I'm reading books on the subject! Way to shoot down the hopes of a potential pet owner before they've even brought home their new puppy or dog.Maybe the training tips are great. I wouldn't know because I felt like I was reading a book by ""Debbie Downer"" and set it aside for more promising material. I LOVE ""Barron's Dog Training Bible"" and ""Perfect Puppy in 7 Days"" held my attention from cover to cover, though I don't agree with everything. I'll review more books as I get to them. Rating three-stars since I read so little of the book, it hardly seems fair to rate lower since I really can't judge. For those of you still interested in this book, my husband skimmed through it and says it seems geared towards urban dwellers, in case that's helpful to you in your buying decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJI0OBMFP3EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312678223#wasThisHelpful","R3SJI0OBMFP3EU","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a powerful blender that can handle ice crushing as well as smooth blending of ingredients for cooking/baking was important to me. After careful research I bought a Ninja pro blender and have been extremely pleased with its performance.  I was so happy with it that I recently bought the BL660 blender set with Nutri Ninja Cups so that I could also create quick smoothies.  It has been so convenient to be able to make a quick custom blended drink without a lot of mess or clean up needed.  Simply fill the cup with your favorite ingredients (I like strawberries and bananas!), attach the blender lid, snap it into the base and after a few pulses you have a delicious drink! I can drink straight out of the Nutri cup with the lids provided and after I just rinse out the cup and blender lid and drop it into my dishwasher.  Couldn't be easier!The extra large 72 oz blender jar has plenty of power to create the smoothest beverages, purees, and batters. I like that the blade unit comes out easily and can be also placed in the dishwasher. But be sure to watch those edges when handling it as it is really sharp! The lid is easy to use once you notice the small marking in corner to align to the proper spot on the blender jar.  This ensures that the lid is locked on completely and safely while using.  The lid is a very tight fit and seals completely for zero leaks so it can be somewhat difficult to pull off.  A gentle and consistent pull on the handle will get it to release.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this blender set as it meets all of my needs, has plenty of power and is easy to take apart and clean.  Highly recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6XF11ULABXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00939FV8K#wasThisHelpful","RP6XF11ULABXZ","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this book and have read it many times. There are many reviews, so thought it would be most helpful to review the two audiobook versions, since I own both and listened to them recently.Abridged: narrated by the delicious Richard Armitage with his sultry baritone voice. He's a talented actor, so his expression and pacing are excellent. He also creates distinctive voices and accents for each character which always increases the enjoyment of listening to a story. This version is 4+ hours, where the unabridged version is 12+ hours, so that gives you a good idea of how much has been cut. I think the editor did an outstanding job, my quibble is that the Abridged version spends as much time on the prosy Edward Yardley as it does on our hero, Lord Dameral. It cuts a number of scenes and shortens conversations between Venetia and Dameral. It also cuts out quite a bit of Nurse's pontificating and somewhat diminishes the servants' importance in Venetia's household. My other quibble is the music played in between some chapters. The first time through I thought it was charming, but on later listenings I was impatient to get back to the story. Buy this version for the stellar narration and/or if you prefer a shorter book to listen to.Unabridged: narrated by Phyllida Nash, a British stage actor. Her voice bares a striking resemblance to Judi Dench, which made me wonder if they grew up in the same area or attended the same school at some point? As a classically trained actor, her pacing and expression are excellent. She does a good job of making her voice lower for the men, though most women aren't the best at this (other than Rosalyn Landor, whose natural voice is very deep). Nash uses different accents for servants versus upper class characters, though the voices she creates aren't as distinctive as Armitage in the Abridged version. Overall her narration is excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Favorite line in the Unabridged version which isn't included in the Abridged... Venetia says to Edward: ""Your encomium unwomans me!"" Ha!  Buy this version for more of Heyer's wit and humor which is hard to capture when cutting out 2/3 of the book. This version is also available on whispersync, which makes it a bargain!My Top Ten books by Heyer:Venetia (Regency Romances) - best romanceFrederica (Regency Romances) - best all around, best family, best humorFriday's Child (Regency Romances) - best coming of age, most cant expressionsRegency Buck (Regency Romances) - best descriptions of Prinny, Brummel and BrightonCharity Girl (Regency Romances) - best heroThe Grand Sophy (Regency Romances)- best heroineDevil's Cub (Historical Romances) - best scene (between Duke of Avon and heroine), best abductionThese Old Shades (Historical Romances) - best revengeThe Foundling - best travel adventure, duke in disguiseMasqueraders - best swashbuckling","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEJHY3QRVP2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y5AV4M#wasThisHelpful","RHEJHY3QRVP2P","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not one of my favorites by Heyer, but I've listened to it multiple times. The narration by Richard Armitage for this Abridged version is outstanding. His character voices, expression, pacing, and accents are all perfect. And who can resist his deep, sultry baritone?The story is excellent, but I drop it a star because the plot makes me cringe everytime I listen to it. Sylvester, Duke of Salford, and his wicked looking eyebrows inspires Phoebe to write a gothic romance casting him as the villain after he arrogantly cuts her at Almacks. When they discover a social connection through her grandmother and frequently end up in each others' company they form a friendship and possibly more. But when Phoebe's book gets published and her identity is discovered as the author, Sylvester is justifiably hurt and furious. Phoebe has a tough road ahead of her to win back his admiration and achieve a HEA. As always, Heyer includes an excellent cast of supporting characters, humor and beautiful turn of phrase. She's always a pleasure to read!Here are my Top Ten by Heyer:Venetia (Regency Romances) - best romanceFrederica (Regency Romances) - best all around, best family, best humorFriday's Child (Regency Romances) - best coming of ageRegency Buck (Regency Romances) - best descriptions of Prinny, Brummel and BrightonCharity Girl (Regency Romances) - best heroThe Grand Sophy (Regency Romances)- best heroineDevil's Cub (Historical Romances) - best scene (between Duke of Avon and heroine), best abductionThese Old Shades (Historical Romances) - best revengeThe Foundling - best travel adventure, duke in disguiseMasqueraders - best swashbuckling","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9BDIPLOUXYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XGLDI2#wasThisHelpful","R3E9BDIPLOUXYY","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book opens with Lady Katarina being kidnapped and taken to a brothel where she's put on the auction block. Lord Dalbury buys her and is told she's an actress, so he thinks her sob story is part of the ""fantasy"" that was being auctioned. This might have been a five star book for me if Dalbury had acted more honorably during that first meeting. Loretta Chase sets up a similar scenario in ""Viscount Vagabond"" but the hero reluctantly concedes to the heroine's pleas for help and scores big points for acting like a real hero. For me, Dalbury had a steep challenge to overcome his ungentlemanly behavior towards Kat in the brothel. The author does an excellent job of describing both sides of the situation, so the reader can sympathize with both Kat and Dalbury, but still......Kat challenges Dalbury to a sword match to avenge her honor and prevent her brother from dueling.  The result is she ends up marrying him and is determined to make him miserable. She occassionally feels guilty about the hurt expression in his eyes and acknowledges that he's doing everything he can to make it up to her. The author does a good job of balancing Kat's vindictive behavior - just when I was ready to turn against Kat and side with Lord Dalbury, Kat would apologize or throw him a bone. You have to read the book to find out how he finally wins her over - there's plenty of groveling and wooing.Once their marriage gets on track, there's still more to come. The villain (who I predicted right away) isn't finished yet and has one more plan to enact. There's also the mystery of Lord Dalbury's missing sister, which is covered in the second book of this series. All of the strife between Kat and Dalbury could have weighed down the story, but Kat's fiestiness and Dalbury's charm and determination give the book an upbeat feel with plenty of optimism for the HEA we expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARTOJIC88E7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRITN3C#wasThisHelpful","R1ARTOJIC88E7A","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! This book moved along at a brisk pace with no annoying repetitive inner-monologues. There are a few secrets that get slowly revealed and keep the reader guessing about what the characters are up to and what's going to happen next. The ending is predictable since we romance readers expect a HEA, but the ""how"" is well developed. Lots of intelligent dialogue and thoughtful details make this character-driven book a pleasure to read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONKW43QICENJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUTVG02#wasThisHelpful","RONKW43QICENJ","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harriet is a charming, hard-working heroine who's been living a life of drudgery and destitution, trying to keep herself and her Aunt fed with a vegetable garden, eggs from their chickens and shooting game on her dilapidated country property. The Marquess of Arden and his cousin Bertram stumble upon their home after getting lost on their travels. Arden is very kind to Harriet and her Aunt, and Bertram shows an interest in Harriet. After enjoying a very pleasant visit with lively conversation, Arden leaves them a basket of delicious food and fine wines.This makes them realize how badly they have it - they are lonely with no visitors and almost starving - they decide to travel to London to show up on the doorstep of Harriet's rich, selfish sister. The sister, Cordelia, is one of the most heinous type of villains. 1) Harriet and her Aunt are under her roof so they can't get away from her cruel treatment and cutting remarks. 2) Sometimes Cordelia pretends to be nice, so her behavior is erratic and confusing. 3)  Family is supposed to help each other, so Cordelia's cruelty is especially alarming.The Marquess of Arden is an OK hero. He's consistently kind to Harriet, but it takes him a while to get on board with the romance. And he does a lousy job of protecting Harriet from Cordelia and eventually a second villain which I won't spoil by revealing. Overall the plot is very good, with many opportunities for Harriet to prove her worthiness as a heroine, including rescuing a duchess from a fire and other exciting events. Readers who like a lot of action should be entertained! There is not the humor I generally expect in a Chesney/Beaton book, and the villains are pretty dark, but the good characters are the focus of the story and they carry the day in the end. Overall a satisfying read that I'm glad I read once, but probably wouldn't read again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QBIF0TFNU6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMASFU8#wasThisHelpful","R28QBIF0TFNU6Q","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked both Julian and Viola - there's a good amount of character development, especially for a novella. The book takes place at Julian's country estate where Viola shows up out of the blue from America. They have been writing letters for several months and she mistakenly thinks he wants to marry her. After they get this misunderstanding straightened out, he invites her to stay and do some sightseeing before returning home. Of course he falls in love with her over the course of her visit.

"I like ""us against them"" partnership stories where the hero and heroine are working together to solve a problem or a mystery. And since this is a romance, of course they fall in love with each other along the way. This book includes an excellent balance of plot development and character development.We get to see Emma grow from a resourceful but somewhat demure woman to someone courageous and independent. Luke is a victim of child abuse and as his story slowly comes out he's able to overcome many of his demons through Emma's love and support. The mystery of searching for Mortimer is well done. The twist is excellent - I didn't see it coming. This book includes multiple explicit scenes which will be good or bad, depending on the reader. Since I know the mystery I probably wouldn't read this again so rating four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8CJ6NH85MF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAXFJMU#wasThisHelpful","R2S8CJ6NH85MF7","A33Z7O75Z6DE0E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Z7O75Z6DE0E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Bedroom Games: 1"" is the ""get excited while you are spooked"" sort of read. There is Pamela, the protagonist, who likes to play games with her lovers. There is also a serial killer on the loose, who just claimed his fifteen's victim. He too, likes to play ""games.""It's hard to avoid spoilers, so suffice it to say that there is constant tension throughout the story that builds up towards the finale. An observant reader will notice how the authors juxtaposed the serial killer and Pamela, as if hinting that there's really a thin line between ""innocent"" fun and sinister obsession.This is a masterfully written story that suggests, teases, and leads the reader while letting her imagination wide open to the possibilities. Make it a drinking game: Every time you get spooked while reading this story, take a shot of whatever gets you through the night. I bet you'd be flat on your back by the time you turn the last page.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFFP4KZ41RO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAPU0UK#wasThisHelpful","RHFFP4KZ41RO5","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Texas Jack's Famous Sweet Potato Recipes is the third book in the Texas Jack's brand of the bestselling series of recipe books. Texas Jack's Famous Caramels Secret Recipe Book and Texas Jack's Famous Pralines Secret Recipe Book have been selling like hot cakes; this book holds the same promise.This book is all about the sweet potato. We have all seen it in stores--it's that weird-looking thing that looks like an overgrown orange-ish potato with a little sting on one end. Yet, very few of us know what to do with this curiosity, at least here on the West Coast.By the looks of it, Texans have tamed this tuberous root, and are making enough dishes out of it to serve a wedding. This book has recipes for sweet potato pies, casseroles, cupcakes, cornbreads, biscuits, and mashed and hashed sweet potatoes; in other words, you name it, it probably has it.All the recipes are simple to follow and the preparation process is detailed, including the guide on how to select potatoes while you buy them and how to prep them for cooking. My favorite recipe in this book is the Southern Style Hash Brown Sweet Potatoes; and yes, it is the simplest. I am a guy, whatever.One important thing to note here is that the sweet potato is one of those so-called ""super-foods"" that are really good for your health. It has just about the highest level of beta-carotene, that is a precursor to vitamin A, a very important vitamin that many of us lack. Sweet potato also has a very special protein called ""sporamin"" that prevents oxidative damage to our cells. Basically, what I am getting at, is that sweet potatoes are good for us. Just make sure you add a little bit of fat (oil or butter) to it when you are cooking or serving it, just like in these recipes; it will help with the absorption of all this good stuff.As usual, a great Texas Jack's brand recipe book. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18DA2UR5P7E7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM11FJQ#wasThisHelpful","R18DA2UR5P7E7G","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tor, short for Torbrek, or more accurately, Torbraya, since the main protagonist is a girl (no spoilers here,) was raised by her grandfather, Attalor, to become a Knight, one of the Hundred. They lived poor but proud, and Tor held the sword before she learned how to say ""sword"". Fast-forward to her 18th year, and we see her as a member of a rebel ""Loyalist"" army, serving in the cavalry, and hiding her gender.Tor goes on a quest to rescue a princess guarded by a fearsome dragon. Xantilor, the dragon, turns out to be a pretty reasonable chap. This is when Tor's adventures begin in earnest.""Torbrek...and the Dragon Variation"" by Lexi Revellian doesn't present us with caricature characters who are either good or evil. Well, perhaps with a possible exception of the Corfe, king Skardroft's spy master. Instead, we see shades of gray, how one person could be good to some people and terrible towards others. Scardroft and, to some extent, Jervaid, are good examples of this, and as such, are much more memorable characters for it.The book reminds me slightly of ""Alanna"" by Tamora Pierce and has a slight feeling of ""Berserker,"" the anime at the beginning. Nothing as bloody, obviously, ""Torbrek"" is a light read, just something in presenting the main heroine and the circumstances she found herself in. If someone mentions ""Star wars,"" on account of the kingdom taken over by a tyrant and a mysterious order of knights opposing him, I would like to say: this is as common a premise as could be; not like Lucas invented it. It just works.Good, light YA fantasy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGW9D9H2BVPL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N8X3J4#wasThisHelpful","RGW9D9H2BVPL3","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Vampires: Romance to Rippers. An Anthology of Risque Stories"" is, self-explanatory, a collection of ""risque"" vampire stories. A couple of the pieces stand out:""The Making of Marea"" by Scarlette D'Noire is a short story that describes a ""making"" of a vampire. Sounds like we've read this before, right? Well, here's the thing: as long as these stories are freshly told, have unexpected plot twists, and craftfully written, we'll be chasing the high again and again. The story is set in a plantation, where Marea, an ex-slave girl, is an object of desire of both the Master, and Delano, the vampire. Delano turns Marea, hoping to bind her to him. Sounds simple, but it isn't. Marea is not a ""simple"" girl, not a plaything to those who have more power. Read on to find some nice plot twists and get yourself surprised. It's a very neatly constructed story set in the vampire lore.Charity Parkerson's ""Double the Sin"" is a short story that is an interlude for her ""Sinner's"" series of novels. It tells the tale of a love that was almost lost, found again, and the protagonists reunited. In a very steamy action, that should come with a medical warning, I might add. Ms. Parkerson's short stories are usually the pick of the bunch. It seems that it doesn't matter what she writes: erotica, romance, etc., she handles the format extremely well. She could probably write a recipe book and we'll be talking about the story structure and trying to find the hidden allegories in it as we write our reviews. Good stuff, as usual.The rest of the stories are pretty good as well, competently written, and will appeal to the broad vampire-loving audience. Check out ""Hot Dark Comfort"" and ""My Vampire Lover.""The book starts with prefaces that give us a ""behind-the-scenes"" glimpse into the evolution of ""vampire"" in literature, especially in romance.Altogether, a solid anthology. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZBMBVYC7SBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4BGTFE#wasThisHelpful","R2GZBMBVYC7SBY","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The premises of these three short stories are deceptively simple:✔ A masquerade ball, of the ""naughty-nobody-knows-your-name"" sort. All morals, shame, and inhibitions are left at the door. An invitation to an encounter with a stranger.✔ Nightly ""conversations"" with a friend she'd never actually met. Can a friendship made online lead to something more?✔ An unexpected meeting in the park.However, the execution is nothing but. The switching of the scenes brings the switch of the points of view, so the reader can explore feelings and desires from multiple protagonists. The subtle interplay is visible to those who appreciate the craft of the well-written short story; the eroticism it brings is a step above the usual erotica fair that is flooding the bookstores. Through the stories, the protagonists also come to some realization about themselves.To coin a phrase, this is a ""thinking person's erotica.""Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNP71GAYYI7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDLXHYG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNP71GAYYI7H","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A light-hearted science fiction is a rare beast nowadays. Long gone are the days of Harry Harrison and  Keith Laumer. So, when we have a chance to read something that is upbeat, free-flowing, and entertaining, we should take it.""Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy"" is one of such books. The main protagonist and POV character, Hank, is a ""mediator."" When negotiations between various unsavory characters come to the point of pointing guns at each other, the parties involved hire him to arrive to a more ""peaceful"" and less expensive resolution. As Hank says:""There's a reason people hire me. It's not because I'm a genius. Or an expert marksman. Or because of my stunning good looks. No, it's because I actually listen.""Being bulletproof also helps. Hank is a ""level four mutant,"" whose specific ability is an almost impervious exterior and fast regenerative powers. His services are in great demand: he lives on Belvaille, a most remote space station of Colmarian Confederation, where ""overwhelming majority [of its inhabitants] were involved in illegal activities or were wanted as criminals.""Sometimes, there are problems that even Hank cannot solve easily. Like killer robots, Dredel Led, that came for a visit to the station to shoot it up a bit, or a mysterious brother/sister combo, who are on the ran from everyone and think that Hank is their new best friend.Well, Hank is doing the best he can, under the circumstances. As the station's newspaper describes his various adventures: ""Everything had looked grim, no hope of survival, and then I showed up, looking calm as could be, eating a sandwich.""This novel is a light read, with some good one-liners.

"Balloon is a morbidly obese man who looks at the world with a ""look of dim-witted stupidity."" His only ""friends"" are Tom Starley and Russ Gibson, people of normal weight (for Texas,) who keep their acquaintance with Balloon mostly for the entertainment value, him being an easy target for their jokes, sarcastic insults, and ""scientific"" probes into ""the mathematical improbabilities of Balloon's ability to stand upright and walk."" Completes the cast an epically rotund ""dream girl."" Balloon ""loved her with an insatiable desire.  She hated him with an equal passion.  She called herself Victory.""Things are not looking up for Balloon. However, something changes. Balloon acquires an ability to guess anything correctly. Of course, the problem is--he might not know what questions to ask. His ""friends,"" however, are there to help. ""Just guess where we can find a lot of money that doesn't belong to anybody,"" they ask. Obvious, right? However, there's a bigger question that awaits Balloon's answer--how to cure Victory's dad of a mysterious illness that makes his nose bleed and will end in his head exploding.This might require a bit more doing. Like traveling to another galaxy to obtain a ""ball of power"" that has been zealously guarded by the locals for thousands of years.I would like to say: Much respect for making such an unlikely ""hero"" into someone I ended up routing for by the end of the book. While the first part of the book was mostly jokes at Balloon's expense, the second part picks up rather nicely. It becomes a mixture of ""Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)"" and ""Space Balls,"" with some ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" thrown in. I don't want to give any spoilers, you'll see what I am talking about when you get to the Sombrero Galaxy, Zaxmorthia.The dialect Balloon uses might be a bit problematic for the uninitiated. I'd rather see a little more plain-spoken Balloon with a few linguistic quirks thrown in to spice things up than a full blown Southern dialect. I did get used to it soon enough, however.""Balloon Boy and the Porcupine Pals: Antihooliganism"" by Mort Gloss is a rather entertaining,  Sci-Fi/Satirical adventure that affirms that ""size parallels greatness.""

"Note: this is the third book in the series. To avoid possible spoilers, check out Outview (The Inner Movement) and Outin (The Inner Movement) books first.""Outmove"" picks up the story of Nate Ryder and the spiritual ""Awakening"" of the Human race some time after the dramatic ending of the ""Outin."" He is almost nineteen, he is the formal leader of the Movement, that since ""had grown into a worldwide revolution,"" and his life has never been more complicated.Lightyear, the organization that has been hunting Nate and his friends in the previous book, has been defeated, its leader, Luther Storch, dead. The victory came with a price of many deaths and losses, and brought new problems: ""Lightyear had just been a tiny division in an organization old with power, deep with connections and stunning in its coldness and greed--Omnia."" The conspiracy Nate has been fighting against became a full-blown worldwide takeover by this ancient power broker.With its almost limitless resources, Omnia can seemingly counter most anything Nate and his merry band of mystics and awakened can come up with. What is worse, the Movement is split into two factions: the main one, that takes the path of non-violence, and the Inner Force, the violent faction within the Movement, that holds to the idea that ends justify the means.""Outmove"", the third novel in the ""The Inner Movement"" series, is much more action-filled than the two previous books. There are narrow escapes, prison breaks, plane chases, you name it. The battles are fought across times and dimensions, between the multiple incarnations of the same souls; the multiple possibilities of the outcomes become the prize. This is also where it gets pretty trippy. Even if you have been following in amazement the complex weave of metaphysical into the nature of reality in the two previous books, this one beats them all. Death is no longer the thing to fear, it's just a transition. Except for one possible death, Nate's. If he is to die in this incarnation, on this earthly plane the ""Awakening"" will fail. Nate ""was king, bishop, knight and pawn in a multi-dimensional chess game that would decide the fate of humanity.""Some of this book reminds me of the Zelazny's novels. The handling of multiple realities inside a single narrative is a tough thing to do, but Brandt Legg does it pretty darn well. A few parts really stand out: the President Taft bit was brilliant, for example.There is also a tighter integration of the spiritual and such concepts as personal and societal freedoms, population control by the powers to be, public opinion, etc., in this novel. As things come to a boil, and the shadowy forces make their move, we can see that those little parts of our freedoms we give up right now in exchange for security are not so little after all, they are simply a first step that leads to loosing more and more of our freedoms down the road. Our belief that ""If you aren't hiding anything, you don't need privacy. You only need your right to privacy if you have something to hide,"" is a group complacency born out of fear, passivity, and lack of information. ""Outmove"" makes this point rather clearly.""Outmove"" is a fast-moving yet thoughtful read. As always, it will appeal to the New Age crowd; however, with this installment, it will find a much larger audience among those readers who prefer to think for themselves. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NISS3JTSB3DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6Q29KQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NISS3JTSB3DF","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Space Rovers, The Pilot Episode, is a first in what hopefully to be a long series of humorous Sci-Fi novelettes. The author, Philip Gottschalk, mentioned at the end of this book that he wrote 50 episodes altogether, formatted as screenplays. Now he is rewriting them as novelettes and will be publishing them as they are ready.More than a few chuckles in this book and a good number of laughs. The jokes are pretty darn good:◕""Harlow had a scrunch on his dour, English face that made him look like he was sucking on a lemon-flavoured wasp-sting.""◕""You want to shoot the crap out of some aliens, don't you, Harlow."" ""I'm not picky, sir. I'd shoot the crap out of anything at this point.""As you might probably guess, Harlow, the security officer, is one of my more favorite characters here. But the jokes are not limited to him alone:◕""Apparently, Nutt determined, the creature spent most of its day in the gym working out.  The rest of the time it was probably eating the other gym members.""◕""I want the new registration, deluxe model with fancier chairs and elevators that go up as well as down.""While at first the story reads as a Star Trek spoof, the characters do stand on their own after a while, with the only briefest of references to the original, mostly subtle. This way the story can be read on it's own for the jokes alone, or as a funny spoof for hardcore Star Trek fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTLWN0T3JQPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARI79L8#wasThisHelpful","RRTLWN0T3JQPW","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These little guys are lifesavers if you, like me, have a lot of adapters that you are trying to hook up into one power strip. You probably cannot see it in the picture but one pair is a double plug - you can plug one adapter into the cable itself and the other one right on top of it. It stands 1 1/4"" tall so it should clear most regular plugs. These extensions are of different lengths (depending from where you measure):✔ Regular plug variety is between 12-13""✔ The double plug is between 12-13""✔ The right angle plug is the longest at 17-18""So, plan accordingly. I also don't think these are rated for heavy equipment like refrigerators, etc. However, these should be good enough for most TV sets, computers, game and entertainment systems. Unless you have an industrial-rate amp installed for your speakers, these should work.A bit expensive at current price but it does pay for itself in the long run - you'll use up fewer power strips.

"The thoughts of a great (1) wizard, Mulogo, are recorded on these pages by his humble (2) scribe Ludaceous Vaer Mordicanum, Lesser Under Understudy, Apprentice Wizard 3rd Order, etc., ect.While this lowly scribe does, at times, and most inappropriately, attempt to make light of the wiser, more experienced, and obviously superior in every way Mulogo, who is the greatest wizard of his Age (3), the profound truth of the words in this Treatise cannot be denied by a mere common man (4).Some of the passages might prove useful to even the most commonplace and boring of readers that do not posses even an iota of magical prowess. Take, for example, the chapter aptly named ""On Combat (and Sometimes Avoiding It.)"" It is clear that Mulogo, being a mighty wizard (5), would phrase it so - ""avoiding it sometimes."" Yet to readers who are keen to pick up on even smallest of clues, the meaning will be perfectly transparent and the chapter will read more as ""On Combat, and Avoiding Thereof."" A sage advice to us all.The chapter ""When Griffins Attack"" might not seem as containing information that a regular person could use in everyday life but judging it by the name alone does not do it justice. It also covers manticores, wyverns, spectres, and other common pests.To sum up this great work of wisdom so profound yet so accessible even to the most unwashed of masses, allow me to leave you with these two small yet very important gems of an advice that could be glimpsed, among others, from reading this volume:✔ A. If you are currently employed as a disposable henchman (6), you might want to reconsider your career priorities.✔ B. Always check that your boots are in a good working order (7).➨ Notes and Annotations:◕ 1. As is plainly apparent from Mulogo's own self-description.◕ 2. Humble and Ludaceous are not synonymous.◕ 3. See 1.◕ 4. Or a woman, child, an apparition, or any other being, be it corporeal, astral, or in between.◕ 5. See 3.◕ 6. The politically correct term is ""Hench-person"".◕ 7. This is generously assuming that you actually can afford to buy a pair.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this treatise for purposes of a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MUHAU2CAM3SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615749852#wasThisHelpful","R1MUHAU2CAM3SQ","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recipes in ""Texas Jack's Famous Pralines Secret Recipe Book"" range from a traditional Pecan Praline to elegant Amaretto Pecan to exotic Mexican Chili Mocha Pecan. The book also has recipes for Almond, Coconut, Agave, and even Raisin Pralines. Cookies, Fudge, and Brown Candy are covered as well.The book talks about the history of Texas Jack, which gives it a unique flavor for a recipe book. This is Texas Jack Vermillion, by the way, not to be confused with Texas Jack Omohundro, who, while famous in his own right, had little to do with pralines.The recipes are easy to follow, with well outlined ingredient measurements, and have handy advices for amateur chiefs as myself. The book is neatly formatted and has a clickable table of contents. This is my personal quirk when it comes to Kindle recipe books - clickable table of contents is a must for me. I would love to see more pictures included in the book - these pralines look positively mouth-watering.A lovingly-made, history-rich addition to my Kindle recipe book collection.

"In my humble opinion, ""Bully Eater"" is closer to the manga than to comics in its form. When I opened it up the first time, I automatically started reading right to left, mange-style, until I realized that the panels are arranged in Western format, left to right.There are two chapters in this edition that set up the story of Isao Akio, his meeting with Tien Lung, and all the broken teeth, limbs, ribs, you name it, that are to follow.Good, strong lines translate well to Kindle and other ereaders. Well executed backgrounds add to the atmosphere very nicely - this is something that Western mangakas need to learn more from their Japanese counterparts. The character designs are expressive, especially that of Tien Lung. The fight scenes, so far, have been pretty short for a martial arts comic / manga, most likely to get more of the story on the pages. Hopefully, there are going to be more fighting in future installments.The images are formatted for traditional Kindles, meaning that they are slightly smaller than the screens of large Kindles, like HD model, or iPad, for example. I think it should be possible to make two versions of the book, one regular and the other one high-resolution.""Bully Eater"" chapters 1 and 2 is a very impressive debut by mangaka Raymond Brown. It's a nicely told, well drawn beginning of a story that hopefully will get continuation very soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EC44LO4IA7VT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AY4OGN4#wasThisHelpful","R2EC44LO4IA7VT","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These might not be the finest mechanical pencils I've ever used - that distinction goes to great but somewhat expensive Pilot Dr. Grip Limited - but for the price, you are getting a really sturdy and precise drawing machine with Paper Mate Titanium.The grip is wide enough to reduce stress from a prolonged use. You can drop them no problem, they are designed to withstand abuse. The eraser is adequate for most situations for a built-in.

"There is a virtual plethora of ""How To Sell Books on Kindle"" that is available. I've read and reviewed my fair share and I figured out a simple test on how to determine if such a book contains good, up-to-date advice: Simply look at the book's rankings. If it's relatively high, like this book has, you are certain to get at least some useful information from it - the author obviously knows what she/he is talking about. If it's low, like a few books I am not going to mention, skip it.""The Kindle Publishing Bible"" by Tom Corson-Knowles falls into an ""intermediate"" to ""advanced"" range of books that teach you how to succeed selling your book on Amazon. Certain assumptions are made by the author that the reader should already possess at least a cursory knowledge with publishing on Kindle. This is not a problem, in my opinion. Think about it this way - you might go through a few books that will teach you all the basics and then get to this, more advanced material. Or, you could just do a quick Google search to figure out a few things that are mentioned but not explained in depth. Your choice.The book is a bit of a stream of consciousness. In addition to the book-selling strategies, there are also certain productivity tips, like ""Frictionless Writing,"" and general observations on the state of modern book publishing, quote:◕ ""There's a war out there in Kindle publishing. It's ""every author for himself"" (or herself) - at least that's how most of your competitors look at it. But I've found that it just doesn't pay to do things unethically.""This theme of doing things ""ethically"" is present throughout the book. It's a refreshing approach and one of the reasons I am giving this book high marks.Also, kudos to the author for saying the following about Amazon's Top Reviewers:◕ ""Treat them like a professional and they will provide you with an invaluable service.""This is a solid advice and one that many authors, publicists, and book agents nowadays ignore completely - I speak here from the experience.All in all, this is a good book on Kindle publishing, and, despite my minor criticisms, it is worth reading. There are some books that are better organized but few that are written with this level of conviction. Solid 4.5 Stars.

Good ingredients. The pills are not too large to swallow, which is a plus in my book. It's a bit on the expensive side but I am sensitive to B vitamins so I have to be careful which ones I take.The ""Superfoods"" added here are in quantities large enough to help the absorption of B vitamins but if you are into these ""Superfoods"", you might consider taking some other formulation in addition to this.➨ A couple of observations (from my experience) on vitamin B complex in general:✔ The quality of the ingredients, the components, and the amounts, play a big role. Sometimes taking a cheap, grocery store variety B complex might lead to results that are opposite to what we usually expect from taking these vitamins. So, be careful and observe how you react to it, especially if you have some neurological disease - migraine, anxiety, etc.✔ If you take a single vitamin B for whatever reason - B12, B6, whatever, please keep in mind that all the vitamin Bs act in tandem. You might actually develop deficiency of other B vitamins if you concentrate just on one. So, you might consider taking a good B complex instead.✔ Vitamin B complex included in most multivitamins is usually not of sufficient quantity and quality to have as much effect as a dedicated vitamin B complex.As for New Chapter Coenzyme B Food Complex, I've been taking it for a couple of years already. Every time I try to economize and switch to cheaper brands, I can feel the difference.

"Update August 5th 2013:Shenzhen Knives rep. contacted me via email. They have redesigned the knives to include a different handle.They offered to send me a sample for testing. I am really curious to see how the changes in the design will work out in practice.I am provisionally changing my rating to 4-stars, pending the actual review. Any company that goes as far as to actually try and improve a product because their customers asked them to, does deserve some brownie points, in my humble opinion.I will test the knife for an extended period of time and then post an updated review on the new blade, so stay tuned in._____Update April 5th 2013:Shenzhen Knives rep. contacted me in this very thread. That shows that they care. That's a plus for the company. Would be interesting to see how this develops. I'll keep you posted._____The ceramic blade on these paring knives is, in my opinion, is superior even to Kyocera Revolution. And that is saying a lot - Kyoceras are usually my brand of choice. These Shenzhens seem to keep the edge longer, and I like the fact that the blades come to a point, unlike Kyocera's rounded tips. I also haven't managed to seriously chip any of these yet, which is a common problem with most ceramic knives.However! The handle needs to be constructed better. It feels nice in the hand, it's ergonomic, etc., but, look at the place where your index finger would be - that place is too thin and is the reason why I had a blade break out of the handle on two of these knives. I know that I am a large man with big hands and it is difficult for me sometimes to control the amount of force I apply, but seriously, the last time this happened when I was cutting an apple...So, why not a one star rating, you might ask? Because, the blades are excellent. If this company reinforces the handle just a little, this would be the best ceramic paring knife on the market under $20. So, lets hope someone from the company that produces these reads it and perhaps we will see an improved version on the market shortly. If they need a tester, my email is in the profile. Lets try and improve this product, we'll all will benefit from it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8JBSI5WIK31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019774F2#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8JBSI5WIK31","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just about the best knife sharpener I've owned. Easy to use and relatively safe. I have an old paring knife I use for most jobs in the kitchen. It's some cheap Taiwanese-made deal I bought way back in the 90s. One good thing about it is that the steel is softer than on most modern kitchen knives. So, a few swipes on the carbide cutting heads and the knife is good so slice anything.I recently found that the ceramic rods on the other side actually work with my Kyocera ceramic knife. It doesn't make it factory-sharp but good enough for use.Do make sure to rest the sharpener on the table vertically, with the side you want to use facing up. Hold it down firmly by one of the flanges. This method is safer and gives more control over sharpening than holding the knife in one hand and swiping the sharpener down the blade with the other.One last note - this CCKB model seems to be discontinued. No worries. CCKS model is pretty much the same thing. You can either search for ""Smith's CCKS"" or get it as an Add-On item here: Smith's CCKS 2-Step Knife Sharpener","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLXSZ45XWZL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BI4DZO#wasThisHelpful","RTLXSZ45XWZL6","A26YAJDK3Z14US","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26YAJDK3Z14US?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very sensitive skin so I was not sure how I would react to this NuLight Gel. After my first use it felt great on my skin. I have been suffering with dark circles under my eyes for so long but have been unsuccessful to find a product that would be gentle enough to use. My dark circles have now faded quite a bit and my husband even noticed that the circles had diminished.

"Wow! What a great novel. The author Paula Hawkins has really captured the readers interest with this piece of writing. Upon reading I was able to get into the book right away not like others that take so much time for the story to get started.

The book always kept me wondering what was coming next.Overall I really loved reading this book and look forward to reading more by Paula Hawkins in the very near future.

With the hooks coming in 9 different sizes you will have plenty of choice for all pattern needs.

"Katrina, stepdaughter of the Alpha of her pack, is taken hostage by a rival shifter pack. Maddox, the Alpha of the rival pack, may have ulterior motives for kidnapping Katrina. There is a lot more going on than meets the eye.What worked - The writing flows well, with minimal grammatical errors. I liked Katrina and Maddox. I thought both characters showed noticeable growth over the course of the book. Interesting subplots, and a sneak peek at the next couple in the series.What didn't work as well - the villains are a bit one-dimensional, but hey, it's a short book...in the great, big scheme of things, this is a minor nitpick.Bottom line - I really enjoyed Taken by the Alpha. If you like hawt shifters and snarky, strong willed heroines who are all about saving themselves rather than waiting for the rescue, I would recommend this title.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1GIBNZR2KEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKFEE1S#wasThisHelpful","R2F1GIBNZR2KEE","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very Brief Synopsis - George gets dumped and starts a blog about the tribulations of relationships. Her sister begs her to move back to Marsden to help care for George's young niece. George doesn't want to. She does, anyway. Then George runs into her teenage love, Casey, and madcap antics ensue.What worked - Down on Love is well written. The story flows well. There is a ton of snark.What didn't work as well - Firstly, this is not a romance. This is woman's literature (or chick lit, if you prefer). George is a hot mess, and is trying to find herself. She gets input from her harpy of a sister - seriously, Sera (the sister) needs meds. So. Mean. Over-the-top, unbelievably mean. And the entire freaking town, which drives George crazy, and is the reason she never came back to her hometown once she left. Frankly, I can't blame her. So all of these people are up in George's business, and Casey's business. Casey wants to date George, but she can't because she has become a neo-virgin, whatever that means...How do I really feel - Well, a 29 year old woman who acts as flighty and immature as George makes me wonder what the heck Casey sees in her. He keeps saying how smart and how strong she is, her sister keeps saying how strong George is (usually screaming it at her, in the midst of an argument)...I didn't see any of that. She pushes away a perfectly nice, sincere guy who is on board with her crazy, for flimsy reasons. She cuts and runs rather than growing up, or being strong. Not smart.I get the ""Town as a character"" trend. In some cases, this trope works. This is not one of those cases. There are too many townsfolk, most of them not very nice, we get a line here or there about each character...I gave up trying to differentiate.There is no romance. Let me repeat - no romance. George spends most of the book trying to get away from Casey. There is one abortive date attempt. Physically, there is one kiss, maybe two, and a behind closed doors scene.Bottom line - If you want to read a story about a woman who is trying to figure out who she wants to be, this may work for you. If you are looking for a character who actually shows some growth before the last 3 pages of the book, you may not care for this. If you are looking for a hot romance, this may not work for you at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17107OSFGB7WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D98D0H0#wasThisHelpful","R17107OSFGB7WY","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this novella as a freebie. I like PNR, as a rule, and Shadow's Passion sounded interesting.Very Brief Synopsis - Not your typical shifter/vamp/angel trope. In this world, there are Shadows and Wardens. The two groups are working toward the same goal, to eliminate the threat of the Vorati, a demon species that possesses the souls of humans. Seems the Vorati are starting to organize and plan, something that is new to them. One of the Oracles has seen that the Shadows and the Warders need to change things up in order to defeat the demons. (This is not a spoiler - it is in the Prologue)What worked for me - Terrific storyline, great pace, intriguing PNR twist. The writing is superb - humorous, detailed, distinct voices for the characters, terrific flow. Wrapped up as a standalone, but left the over-arcing plot to carry on the series. In other words, yes it is a series, but no stinkin' cliffhanger.What didn't work as well - Not quite the level of world building I would have liked. Yeah, I know the story played out on a mountain in the middle of nowhere, but do humans know about Shadows and Warders? I got the vague impression of no...Then again, this is a novella, albeit a long one, so my questions may be answered in the next book.Gimme Romance - well, I really liked Gabe and Celeste together, even though it happened pretty quickly. Again, novella... I thought they brought out good qualities in each other, and were a good fit. Gabe is ever so alpha,  with a tragic past, and Celeste has been alone for a long time, in exile for an incident beyond her control...both struggle mightily with guilt. I liked them a lot.Bottom line - I am all set to dive back into this world. I have been reading a lot of not so great books lately, it seems, so boy, was I appreciative of the fact that Shadow's Passion was very well done. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a well written novel with an interesting twist on PNR.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3OKEDSFZ7KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KP1U44Q#wasThisHelpful","R2N3OKEDSFZ7KT","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first, and the reason for the lack of a 5th star - The box in which the wipes are stored is a very flimsy quasi-cardboard thing. It is not in the least bit substantial, and I paid the devil trying to get the tab in the slot for closure. I am not necessarily in favor of plastic, but a container with a little more substance would be appreciated.As to the cleaning capability of the Clorox Triple Action Wipes, no complaints at all. Although I do think they are overreaching with the whole ""Clean the whole room with one cloth"". If you dust daily, or maybe every other day, and have a small room, with no pets...okay, maybe then one wipe will clean a whole room. For those of us who are not compulsive dusters, you can probably count on 2 cleaning the room.I was most impressed with how the wipe grabbed up all of the dust on my TV stand, with one pass. The stand is black, and seems to attract all the dust in the immediate available area. I have a real love/hate thing going with that stand...the Clorox Dust Wipe may tilt the balance firmly to the love side.I have tried MANY of the comparable products on the market, and this one is, hands down, the best one I have used. The surface of the wipe is a little sticky, not so it sticks to your hand or to the surface, but it does grab the dust up without spewing the dust particles back out into the air. There is no residual dusty smell, either.Bottom line - I like this product, and will be incorporating it into my cleaning routine. It actually works, with one swipe, no wiping at the same spot over and over. I would absolutely recommend the Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z22LVF6Q7XBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMSX1W0#wasThisHelpful","R2Z22LVF6Q7XBG","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

KA just nails the feelings, with a word, a nuance, a carefully placed action...and this reader felt the pang of heartache, and tasted the joy of the moment.Amelia is trying to make amends to her children after the breakup of her marriage. She's in her late forties, alone in a new town, and figuring out who Amelia is. She's an heiress on both sides of her family. Amelia is the poor little rich girl who only wants someone to love her. Amelia is determined to make something good of herself internally. She's feisty, warm, and she doesn't walk away from a fight. The details of her struggle to adjust to her new reality were spot on. As was the ""attractive"" comment, and the feelings it evoked.Mickey is a newly single dad, working a job he doesn't like, while volunteering at the local fire station, which he really likes. Mickey is all about his kids, all about being the provider, the protector... And our boy is good with his naughty words, too...Swoon! Loved his devotion to his kids. Loved how he took care of Amelia. A KA Hero for the record books, is Mickey.Most of the conflict comes from external sources...the kids, Amelia's ex, Mickey's ex. Some, though, was the internal struggle for Mickey as he tried to process that taking care of someone did not necessarily mean paying for everything. The conflict was, again, realistic, and handled beautifully. There were no insta-fixes here. The story builds in a believable way. The blending of the two families, the money issues, the ex's...maybe a little too easy, but still within the realm of the possible.The writing is warm, evocative and emotionally charged. As usual with a KA book, I laughed, I cried ugly, ugly tears, I cheered...I wanted Amelia and Mickey to get their HEA, and they worked for it. Loved the inclusion of Josie, Alyssa, Jake, Con and Sofie from The Will.It's KA, what can I say? Loved this one, and no doubt will be reading it again. Highly, highly recommend","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB2595T91XP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5B70BS#wasThisHelpful","R2GB2595T91XP3","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Celia Kyle is a master of the short novella. She throws the reader right into the action, making the most of the words on the page. Seriously, 46 pages, and I felt like I knew Jennifer and Brett. Tailing her is funny and hawt. Brett is hugely fun as a good time guy who has just had his world rocked by his strong willed mate - to watch this Beta go crazy when Jenn walks into a room full of his men wearing only a towel...good times. Jenn is an independent girl with a temper of her own. Her reaction to Brett's ex was hilarious!If you are looking for a very quick, sexy, funny read, grab up Tailing Her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZYYFTUURBKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UENRTW0#wasThisHelpful","R34ZYYFTUURBKI","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've liked Porter and Kenzie throughout the series, and love how Porter doesn't let Kenzie get away with her brattiness. Porter knows there is an underlying cause for her behavior and is determined to help her. Kenzie is a complicated girl, with long buried issues. She is frustrated that her usual tactics don't seem to work on Porter, and she isn't interested in sharing her past.This Club Sin novel is really well done, with a lot of depth. The conflict is internal and there is an external component, as well. Kenzie pushes back against being helped with either. Kenzie is not an easy heroine to love, but I admired her strength, and how she struggled to find relief for her depression. Porter was patient and insightful, and his feelings for Kenzie were apparent.One thing that didn't work - At the end of the book, Porter is trying to figure out what exactly Kenzie is looking for from him. He and Aidan set up a test of sorts...I thought it was kind of juvenile and out of character.Bottom line - I have enjoyed the whole series, and really liked Tamed. Some delicate issues are handled well, and I was rooting for Porter and Kenzie to get their HEA. I would recommend this title.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUU3H9IZUEQ5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD6OI#wasThisHelpful","RUU3H9IZUEQ5N","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anti-relationship sports radio host Grayson and on-air relationship psychologist Noelle are directed to combine forces for a hybrid radio show to boost ratings for their station. Given the fact that the two really don't like each other, this is unwelcome news. When they start to spend time together, they realize they have more in common than they thought.Due to his parents having been married a collective 6 times, Gray is not a believer in happily ever after. Noelle's experience is the opposite, as her parents were happy together. The premise is a little simplistic, the story is not anything new. On the other hand, the writing flowed well, and I liked the characters.Bottom line - If you like enemies to lovers stories, Tell Me Something Good is cute and readable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPVGQAOZR3KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZNJRYG#wasThisHelpful","R2RPVGQAOZR3KY","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wonderful office romance between Gabriel, a driven ex-rugby player turned company savior, and Charlotte, a survivor of a terrible attack. Gabriel, or T-Rex, figures out early on that there is a lot more to Charlotte than meets the eye. Throughout the book, Charlotte morphs from a scared mouse who jumps at shadows, to a empowered young woman who sees her own worth.Though it takes a while for Charlotte to open up to Gabriel about her issues, he knows he wants her, and displays admirable patience in pursuing her. His restraint as they navigated their way to a physical relationship showed the depth of his commitment to Charlotte and to their budding relationship.Favorite moments - watching Charlotte take back her power was amazing. It was clear from the beginning that Gabriel was in it for the long haul, and he showed this dedication in a million little ways. This was not an insta-fix...Gabriel and Charlotte worked hard to overcome Charlotte's issues, and the work they did just seemed to cement their bond. Loved how Charlotte mouthed off to Gabriel and didn't allow herself to be bulldozed by his strong personality. And Gabriel loved that, too! Loved how Gabriel kept repeating that smart girls were his catnip.The humor...Although Rock Hard deals with some serious issues, there is wonderful humor throughout. Some snarky comments, some laugh out loud funny moments, some bittersweet smiles...great balance.Bottom line - Well, it's Nalini Singh, so you know going in that the writing is stellar. The story flowed beautifully, and was realistic and thoughtful. The topic of assault was handled with sensitivity and care. I really cared about these two characters. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYSQH1DRZKVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6BPLQM#wasThisHelpful","R2DYSQH1DRZKVQ","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, this is review number 787 or something, so...I am essentially writing this for myself. Mainly as a reminder not to give up. What do I mean? Well, I started The Will not once, not twice, but 3 times before it finally clicked with me. Once I clicked with the book, though, it clicked in a big way.Josie, or Josephine - Having lost her beloved grandmother, she comes to the tiny, coastal town of Magdalene, Maine to settle up the estate. We get hints about Josie's past history of abuse - from her father, from an ex...But even before those hints, we know that Josie is buttoned up tight, all about control and holding herself distant from everyone and everything. Then she meets Jake, and Jake's kids, and finds all that distance melting away.Jake is a classic KA Hero. Yes, that capital ""H"" is on purpose. Jake fully believes in taking complete care of those who are in his life, regardless of the cost to himself. Jake runs a strip club to pay the bills, and a gym to fulfil his passion. He moves slowly with Josie, so slowly that she doesn't even see it. Loved the fact she thought she was dreaming, then realized her dreams had come true.The kids - Awesome. Ethan is adorable, Con is a young Hero in training, and watching Amber grow to recognize her worth was wonderful. Loved The Taylors, too.There is the usual baby mama drama, but Josie sorts that out. There is young love drama, and Josie sorts that out. There is other, more spoilery stuff that I don't want to give away...I can't put my finger on why I love KA's work so much. I think it is realism with just a touch of the fairy tale. And the sexy times are ever so sexy...and real. No props needed (not that there is anything wrong with kink), but yeah, you can put yourself in the middle of the scene and feel like it could, or has, happened to you. And the scenes are heartfelt and delicious.What didn't work quite as well - Josie wasn't really perfect, so I can't pin a Mary Sue on her, but she was fixing everyone, left and right. Her interference was global and non-discriminatory. And in a way, it made sense. Josie was so closed off herself, and unable to fix her issues, so she concentrated on everyone else's issues. She was very honest, let's put it that way. Classic avoidance of interpersonal relationships, she crushes for 20+ years on her boss, yet never acts on her feelings.Bottom line - I freakin' loved every little thing about this story, good and bad. I laughed until I snorted, and I cried ugly tears, sometimes within the same page. No, it isn't perfect. Yeah, you could argue that the MC's share traits with other KA MC's. I do not care. Not even a little bit. I stayed up until 3am to finish The Will. Can't even remember the last time I did that. Probably for a Rock Chick or 'Burg book. No question, I will be reading it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T27513KL35T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYIF9FW#wasThisHelpful","R1T27513KL35T7","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kit is back, in more ways than one. When we join the story Kit is getting ready for a costume party at the Council, at which there will be vampires. That scene sets the tone for the whole book, really. Kit is fighting her way to a new normal. She and Damon are trying to find their way back to each other, too. In addition, Justin enlists Kit's help to locate missing loner NH's (non-humans), and someone from Damon's past re-emerges, hoping to be part of his future.What worked for me - Every. Thing.In the first 3 novels, Kit is held captive by her fears. She braves her way through some excruciating circumstances, but her fear dictates her actions. In Edged Blade, Kit is more accepting of her faults, and she is noticeably more comfortable in her own skin. She has faced the fire, and though she was burned, she is healing. She wants to heal, and acknowledges that there may be some steps backward on the journey, but she seems okay with that. As always, she is tough, and smart mouthed, and she does the right thing rather than take the easy way out. Her open admittance of her feelings for Damon was oh, so awesome. LOVE Kit.Damon has been so careful with Kit that it is making her crazy. Look out once Kit convinces him she neither wants nor needs to be handled with kid gloves. Once our boy gets on board...whew! A book and a quarter of tension will make a kitty go a bit wild! Lol! Damon shows Kit in word, in action and in deed how he feels about her. He marks her as his, and the depth of his commitment to Kit is never in question. LOVE Damon.Because Edged Blade is written by J.C. Daniels, the conflict is not one-dimensional. There is a twist I never saw coming... So well done.We learn a little more about Justin, and his feelings for Kit. And Colleen's feelings for Justin. Chang and Abraham get a lot of face time. We get just a smidgen of Doyle. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but not in such a way as to leave you cursing. The missing NH's are the cliffhanger part of the story. Most of what actually happens in Edged Blade is tied up within the novel.Bottom line - Although UF is not my genre of choice, I am 100% addicted to this series. It is smart, edgy, well drawn with an interesting mythology, and beautifully flawed characters who are trying to do the right thing. J.C. Daniels (aka Shiloh Walker) does emotion better than just about anyone else out there. The story flows beautifully, moving from heart-stopping action to laugh out loud humor to believable drama without missing a beat.If you have not tried the Colbana files yet, you could probably start with Edged Blade, but do yourself a favor and start at the beginning. Excellent series. If you like Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels or Jeaniene Frost's Cat and Bones, try this.

"Awesome little speaker! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.The IBSound IPX7 Waterproof Bluetooth Shower Speaker has a powerful sound for such a little item. It measures about 3 inches diameter, and is about an inch high. The suction cup is also powerful, allowing the user to stick the speaker on the wall, and unstick it when finished.The speaker took about 2 hours to charge up, and runs for about 6 hours total use time. There is a handy light on the unit to let you know it is charging. The speaker's design is sleek and modern, with a cool reflective ring.Engaging the Bluetooth was effortless with my Samsung Note 3.Bottom line, this product is terrific.

"I am a huge Cynthia Eden fan, and I have read most, if not all, of her backlist. It is always a good day when a new title is available, and Confessions has all of the normal Eden goodness.This is a second chance story. Grant and Scarlett were high school sweethearts. Grant joined the Army, became a Ranger, and as such, saw a lot of darkness. Grant didn't want to hold Scarlett back, and let her go. Ten years later, Scarlett is in deep jeopardy, and she calls Grant on his parting promise to always be there if she needed him.Confessions is the set up book for a new series, The Battling McGuire Boys. Ms. Eden seamlessly introduces all 5 of the brothers, and a sister, into the story. Given the number of players, this could have been a confusing mess. Instead, I feel like I have a good handle on the personality of each of the cast members. Good world building and background, setting up not only Confessions, but the books to follow.Grant and Scarlett are both wary, both a little world weary from their experiences. They are still incredibly attracted to each other, but their history is a looming specter. The struggle to put the past behind them and move toward a future together was so well done.  I felt their anxiety and their need for each other clearly. The conflict was believable. I thought Scarlett showed the right amount of doubt and reticence concerning the feasibility of her and Grant reuniting. Though the romance happens kind of quickly, it is believable since we have knowledge of the history of the couple.The suspense was well done, and kept me guessing almost until the end.Bottom line - I would recommend Confessions without reservation, as well as any other Cynthia Eden work. Great plots, hot romance, terrific flow...you can't go wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15KE5AJ0Y2DWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373698127#wasThisHelpful","R15KE5AJ0Y2DWU","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a history of high blood pressure in my family, so I thought that I should begin taking my blood pressure regularly to be sure that I was healthy. I was really excited to see how easy this device is to use and thought it would be the perfect solution.The QardioArm comes in a small package that is easy to throw into your bag or briefcase if you want to transport it. I pulled it out and read the included instruction page that tells you how to download the app and how to turn on the device. One thing that got on my nerves is that the small instruction page didn’t tell me that I had to touch my device to the QardioArm to get it to work. I had to delve into the bigger instruction booklet to find out how to connect the device. I feel like that would have been easy to include on the small page that is supposed to help you set up the QardioArm quickly.Anyway, once I figured it out, using the QardioArm was very simple. You simply unwrap it to turn it on, wrap it around your arm, touch your phone to it, and press the “Start” button on the app. The reading takes about one minute. I like that the device keeps track of each of your readings so that you can easily see if your blood pressure is improving or getting worse (there is also a guest mode included if you want to let someone else use the device without it tracking their results).Overall, I think the QardioArm is a much better way to keep track of your blood pressure than lugging around a huge blood pressure monitor and writing down your results. I like that it connects directly to a device that most people already have (a smartphone) and that it is so easily portable. If you need to keep track of your blood pressure at home or on the go, you will probably enjoy this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TP0K75WDWWSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM6EBHG#wasThisHelpful","R3TP0K75WDWWSL","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First a little background - I am 49, and coffee is a way of life for me. My natural tooth color is not a brilliant white, to begin with, so I have been trying out different products over the last few years. No, not products, really. Toothpastes, including several of the Crest line of whitening toothpastes.I have been using the Crest Pro Health HD Two Step Toothpaste for a week now. After comparing before and after pics, which I am not going to post, because that is just kind of yucky, I would say my teeth are at least 2, possibly 3, shades whiter. Noticeably whiter, as in people have remarked on it.The whitening is the reason I tried this product, no doubt. But honestly, the best thing is how clean my teeth feel, even first thing in the morning. My teeth still have that just brushed feel.I have used the Pro-Health product as per the instructions - one minute with the HD toothpaste to loosen plaque, then one minute with the Step 2, which is the whitener. The Step 2 has a peroxide base, but the taste is very mildly minty. Due to the peroxide content, I was a little concerned. I have sensitive teeth. No worries, though. I have had no problem with pain or sensitivity at all.Bottom line - The Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step Toothpaste appears to do what it advertises. If it can lighten my teeth, I feel confident in recommending the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E4AMLLK3WS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2L69EG#wasThisHelpful","R4E4AMLLK3WS4","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a little background. I have 2 dogs. Both dogs shed. A LOT. So vacuum cleaners are an important part of my cleaning routine. In the interest of full disclosure, I have had a Kirby G5 for many years, and I love it more than I can say. But it is heavy. And it is a pain to switch out the attachments, and empty the not inexpensive bags. So I have been on the lookout for a bagless vacuum for the day-to-day cleaning needs. One with nifty attachments is a serious bonus. When this came up as a Vine offering, I snatched it up.I have been using this pretty much daily for the last 3 weeks, and here is what I have observed. On the first use,  I had actually been out of town for a few days, and my hubby is not as vacuum crazy as am I. So I lugged the Dirt Devil out of the box, snapped it together (this process was very quick and easy, although the set up is detailed in the manual, if you have an issue) and gave it a go. After vacuuming about a quarter of my living room (12x17), I had already emptied the dust cup three times. I had to pull clumps of dog hair down because it had gotten lodged above the cup, even though the cup was not full. I gave up, and ran the Kirby, figuring it wasn't really a fair test.The next day, and every day since, I have been able to run the Dirt Devil, averaging 1-2 dust cup drops per day. (As stated, my dogs shed A LOT. Plus they are in and out of the house all day, dragging in dust.) I feel like that is perfectly reasonable, and the cup is pretty easy to empty. It pops right out,  you carry it to the trash bin, hit the button, and the bottom drops away, allowing the dirt to fall out. I do occasionally have to grab clumps of hair from above the cup, but not often.The unit comes apart so you can carry the canister around as you use the long wand on cobwebs, or curtains, or air vents. You can attach the sweeper attachment for dusting wood-type furniture. The cloth got kind of dirty, quickly. Again, I have dogs, so this may not be an issue for some people without constant mess makers running about the home. The cover is washable, though and I like being able to dust the entertainment center with the vacuum!The upholstery attachment is awesome! Yes, the dogs are allowed on the tan couch. Both dogs are black. Just imagine... It is so easy to just slap the attachment onto the wand, run it over the furniture and watch the hair get sucked up. So much easier and less expensive than using a lint roller.I am very impressed with the suction power on this unit. After using the Kirby, my standards are pretty high in this category. Even when the dirt cup is near the full mark, the Dirt Devil performs very well.There are two things about this vacuum that make me a little crazy, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating. The cord is not in a good position. It is too close to the hose, and hard to wrap. I mean, how-on-earth-am-I-supposed-to-get-my-hand-in-the-right-position-to-complete-this hard. Secondly, the upholstery tool holder is not the right size. It is too small to house the tool properly, so I just leave it on the shelf in my closet until I need it.Bottom line - other than the two smallish complaints, this Dirt Devil is a winner. Great power, good overall design, easy to use and a really nice price point. I would recommend this product with no reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYM2YR1B23V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNKSRYG#wasThisHelpful","R3DYM2YR1B23V4","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ripper takes up some few years after the Thieves series ends. Kelsey Atwood is a self-admitted lazy PI, not really exerting herself to grow her business. When a member of the shifter community approaches her to locate a missing college student, she reluctantly accepts the job. This is the beginning of a whole new world for Kelsey.Oh dear goodness, this was such a most awesome read. Kelsey is head strong, and determined. She has some daddy issues, for good reason, as it turns out. Kelsey has some self-destructive habits that she uses to self-medicate. She has amazing instincts, and a lot of heretofore untapped skills...I feel like I can't say too much without giving it all away, and I absolutely refuse to ruin your discovery of each delicious morsel of this book. A lot of life changing events happen over a narrow window of time, and it leaves Kelsey reeling, not knowing who to trust.Grayson Sloan is an interesting mix of paranormal, that I also don't want to spoil for you. He is head over teakettle for Kelsey, even before he meets her. But there are a LOT of secrets in Gray's world, dark secrets that affect Kelsey in more ways than she can possibly imagine. Gray is very straightforward about his feelings and his intentions toward Kelsey from early on. Gray learns quickly that he can't control Kelsey's actions, and he tries very hard to be as supportive as possible.Kelsey is growing into powers she didn't even realize she had, and as she does so, she learns that she has the attention of a lot of the supernatural community. And that is not a good thing.An interesting take on the Jack the Ripper story.The humor is strong in Ripper, though the book will probably be funnier if you have read the Thieves series. That said, it isn't necessary to read Thieves in order to understand the events in Ripper. Ms. Blake fills in the blanks nicely. For those of you who have read Thieves -  Some of Dev's and Dan's scenes with Kelsey are hilarious. Some are quite serious and frightening. The trio's twins, Lee and Rhys, add a lot of humor, and Neil is his usual hilarious self, especially when he is defending Chad to Kelsey.Bottom line - Ripper is an awesome read, with an incredible world and terrific mythology.  As someone who is not a big fan of UF, I absolutely adored Ripper. The conflicts were believable and the resulting actions made a lot of sense. I am a huge fan of Lexi Blake, and would highly recommend any of her titles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193QCK4UTARZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMBJORC#wasThisHelpful","R193QCK4UTARZE","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this Black and Decker Thermal Coffee maker for a few weeks now. Often, I use it several times a day. I am what can be deemed as a coffee addict. Not so very long ago, I replaced my old coffee maker with one made by the Mister. I hated it, every single cup, every single day. In fact, I had stopped using it and was relying strictly on my Keurig. Not the most economical choice.The thing I hated about the Mister was the taste(always scorched) and temperature of the coffee(always scorching). I know some people prefer to have their coffee so hot as to scorch the tongue, but I am not one of them. The temperature of the B&D coffee is, with the addition of half and half, absolutely perfect. Hot, not burning, with a smooth, rich taste. And thanks to the carafe, the temperature and taste stays perfect for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Any longer than that and some of the heat is lost.The top of the carafe twists on and off easily for cleaning and filling. I love the wide mouth, as you can get a sponge down into the carafe with no problem. I have found it easier to use a measuring cup to fill the reservoir, as I was spilling a good bit onto the counter when using the carafe for that task. I am not the most handy person, so that could be a personal issue. The unit is rather small and sleek, taking up minimal counter space. It wipes off easily. The clock is easy to set, and I love waking to my coffee already made. Another advantage, for those with vaguely OCD tendencies like myself, is once the coffee cycle is complete, the unit cuts off. No more worrying about ""Did I cut off the coffee maker before I left the house?""I have tried all of the brew strengths, and have settled on Strong, although all are good. The Strong is, of course, stronger than regular, but takes less time to brew than Bold. If I am in a hurry, I use regular, because I can get 8 cups in about 8 minutes. The Strong setting takes about 12 minutes for 8 cups, the Bold setting, about 16 minutes.So bottom line - Clean lines, wide mouthed reservoir, perfect temperature, consistently smooth taste...Not a complaint in sight! I LOVE this coffee maker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1Z2IXG8O7EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I3V0#wasThisHelpful","R3J1Z2IXG8O7EG","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not my first encounter with Ms. Ryan's work. I have read several of her books, across genres. I am writing this review as a reminder to myself that her writing style really doesn't work for me. Why, you might ask? Great question, and one I have spent undue time trying to figure out.First, what did work for me - I liked Austin and Sierra. I thought they were a good fit, I liked how they were together, for the most part. I liked the extended family. The family characters are strong and each had their own voice. There was some humor.What didn't work - HERE THERE BE SPOILERS - The dialogue, almost all of it, felt off. Stilted, too formal, like something innately important was missing. This was especially true during the smexy times. Too...porn like, for want of a better term. ""Oh, baby, yeah, that's what I want..."" type of thing. It just left me going ""Ewww"".  Not sexy.Caricature characters - Austin's ex, Sierra's ex's parents, the mean customer...So very one-dimensional.  Not believable.HERE COME THE SPOILERS - BE WARNED-This book is like cliché soup. Hot tattooed alpha - check. Damaged heroine in danger - check. There are crazy ex almost-in-laws, a bat crap crazy ex girlfriend, 2 marriages in trouble, a hidden pregnancy, a died-too-young detour, a cancer scare and a secret baby. I think I missed some, but these are the clichés that immediately come to mind. Oh, oh yeah. And BDSM. I was waiting for the zombies, I swear. And the thing is, Ms Ryan called herself out on this several times in the book. (And btw, the book is only 257 pages. So just imagine....) Any one (ONE) of these many and myriad tropes woulda, shoulda, coulda been the plot. All of them jumbled up together, within the confines of 257 pages became, you guessed it, jumbled. My head hurt trying to keep up.END OF SPOILERSThe other thing, which may be realistic, but who wants too much realism in their romance? I didn't like the push-pull from Austin toward Sierra. Every time he had a crisis (refer back to the spoiler section)he pulled away from her. Sierra didn't deserve that.So why do I keep trying to read this author? I want to like her work. I like her subject matter, there are parts that are funny, I am in awe of all the storylines she tried to juggle here. Sadly, I just don't think we are a good match.Bottom line - If you like a fudge-ton of tropes all rolled into one book, with all the angst that goes with that, this title will most likely work for you. The primary characters are well done, though the secondary characters falter. This is the first of what looks to be a many book, each with its own HEA, series. No cliffhangers here. If you prefer your clichés to be one per book, you may want to pass.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BDB4YQQH4ZVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6MAKY#wasThisHelpful","R3BDB4YQQH4ZVS","AOZ2MGUTFOE8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOZ2MGUTFOE8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this product to make my own body scrubs, body lotions, and chap sticks and it has worked great! It is definitely a LOT of oil! I was super surprised that this much product was priced so low. I like to use this around my house in a few diffusers, especially around Christmas time! I would like to point out when using this product a little definitely goes a really long way! I used this with no problems in my body scrub and chap stick fine, but I noticed even with a small amount, it made my body lotions oily.

"I ordered this to give to my husband for his birthday. He is a deputy sheriff and has to attend court several times a month for cases. When he's not working the day of, he likes to wear a suit. We haven't been able to find a tie clip or bar that he liked that was simple and not distracting, until we found this one. He has worn this a few times and has received a few compliments on how sleek it looks and he's been asked where he got it. My only complaint would be the shipping.

"I was nervous when I ordered this because I was afraid it was going to be too small and too thin. I was completely wrong!! This came in very fast and was exactly what I wanted! It is made of the perfect material and feels great when you're wearing it. I almost feel like I'm wearing sleeping clothes, its so soft! The navy color was exactly as pictured. The sleeves are 3/4 inch and fit exactly like they should even on people like me that are super short. My only advice would be to order a size bigger than you typically wear because it does run a tad small and shrinks a little more the first time washing and drying. I would recommend letting this air dry instead of doing a heated dry.

"I bought this product as a gift for my Mother-in-law. She is a hair stylist and always has little kids coming in for the first few haircuts. They usually scream and cry when she uses her regular capes on them because they are so big. With this, she is able to distract them and they all love the rubber ducky print on it. The opening to put their head through is a bit difficult to line up and close but overall it has worked fabulously for her salon. It folds up and fits into a drawer out of the way when shes not using it. It is easy to wipe off but you cannot wash it in the washer like her other capes because of the wire that helps it keep it's shape.

He said the buttons work smoothly and he really thinks it has improved his game play. Overall I think this mouse has worked exactly as described and it fits all of my husband's gaming needs.

"This little toy sure is a lot of fun. This product shipped fast and was delivered on time. My husband works long shifts and when he works half of the year on night shift, we are on opposite schedules. This definitely makes the nights at home alone more fun. It has a great speed and is very sleek. It is easy to clean and, I'm not sure if they described this product as waterproof, but I have used mine in the shower a few times and I have not had any problems. My only complaint is how loud it is. When you turn it on, it sounds like it is rattling the batteries around and only gets louder as you increase the speed. I just turn up the music and do my thing.

"I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. He watched a show on tv and saw something similar and thought he immediately needed to have one, so when I found this, I had to get it for him! This product was definitely bigger than I thought it was going to be, but I wasn't exactly sure how big a 50 caliber round was. My husband is a gun enthusiast and is a deputy sheriff so when he showed all of his friends, of course they all think they need one now. I would say the gold portion of this bottle opener was a bit dingy, I knew it wouldn't look brand new, so I decided to personalize my husbands by spray painting it black and adding his name in a copper colored vinyl to match the actual bullet portion.

"I ordered this product for my grandfathers rescue cat. He normalyl has a problem scratching up all of my furniture. Since we just bought a new leather couch, I had to get something to stop him, or distract him from my couch, and this worked great! This GoPets cat scratcher shipped fast and was delivered on time. It even came with a small bag of catnip. I noticed our cat did not like the smell of this scratcher when we first opened it, so I would recommend airing it out a few days before trying to get your cat to use it. We didn't wait; instead we put the small bag of catnip in the scratcher. I sprinkled it all over and made sure it got into several of the cracks and even put a good bit in the holes on the sides of it and he took right to it.

"I bought this kit because I’m very insecure about my teeth. I had braces until I was 20 and was about to get married and ever since I’ve had my braces taken off there’s always been this yellow tint to my teeth. It’s not bad but it makes me insecure. With this kit, I’m able to lighten the stain on my teeth all while keeping up the same diet and drinking the same drinks that I like. This kit comes with the mouth guard and a couple tubes of the whitening gel. The instructions to use this are very clear and easy-to-understand so it makes the whole process easy. I use the chart on the back of the package to gauge my progress, and since I started with just this first couple of tubes included, my teeth have already lightened at least 2 shades.

"My sisters and I used this Majestic Pure Dead Sea mud mask last night and treated ourselves to some mani/ pedis. We left this mask on for a bit longer than the package suggested and I think it made the results more better. When putting this mask on it glides onto your skin very smooth. It has a pleasantly clean and refreshing scent. This mask dries easily and quickly, but doesn't flake off when you move your face. When rinsing it off it helps to rub it off with warm water in circular motions. This mask leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. This mask would make a great gift for anyone.I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest, and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJLD1D36VJPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UREAGU8#wasThisHelpful","ROJLD1D36VJPN","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:59 MinsI bought this as a gift for my younger brother. Before he got it, my sister had to test it out for ""quality control."" At first glance of the box, I was thinking maybe it wasn't worth my money, but I was so wrong!!! As soon as we opened the box, I noticed this Caster Board came with a camo carrying case. Along with the board, we received a set of Allen wrenches to tighten the wheels and such if they ever get loose. We tested out the light up wheels by spinning them really fast and we were all thoroughly impressed by the color show! I know my little brother will want to ride this outside at night to show all  his friends how the wheels light up! I like that the top of the board has small dots that are there to increase grip, so when you're riding you feel secure on the board. The only problem I see is the log on the top may start to peel up or wear off as this Junior Caster Board is used more and more, but I am overall, thoroughly impressed with this board and cannot wait to give it to my little brother on his birthday!I received this product at a discounted price for my honest, and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFL5HIFPTQ5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBK8RGI#wasThisHelpful","R2WFL5HIFPTQ5M","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:06 MinsThese Super Blaster Water Guns are so much fun to play with! My Younger brother went nuts when he saw this in the package! He was immediately ready to play with them and see how well they worked. These Water guns have a fairly large tank on the back of them that easily screws off for fast refilling. I like how these guns come in 2 different colors so there's no fighting over the same gun, thinking someone took the theirs. These guns are made out of a decent thickness of plastic so they fell much sturdier than other water guns. I do mention in my video review that you should make sure you take out the plastic trigger guard before trying to use these. The only problem I saw was the logo sticker on the water tank. When we received them part of one was already starting to peel up and I know that when the boys start to play with them and get them wet they will just crumble off, so I would recommend putting the logo somewhere else on the gun.I received this product at a discounted price for my honest, and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7IGONB4HOIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AJ3PRY#wasThisHelpful","R3D7IGONB4HOIL","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this screen protector for my husband's work phone. He is constantly dropping and scratching his phone. I thought this would just be a thicker plastic style screen protector, but I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a nice packaging that also included the directions and tips to put this on correctly, as well as a wet and dry microfiber wipe to clean the screen before installation. This glass screen protector fit his S6 perfectly and has a nice smooth touch to it. It does not affect the touch sensitivity what so ever. It also fits well under an otterbox. I like that this glass screen protector covers all of the glass front of the phone, whereas previous screen protectors we've bought only covered the center part. Overall My husband is pleased that his phone is more protected and he doesn't have to hold his breath any more when he drops it. I'm sure we will be repeat customers when he breaks this one!I received this product for free for my honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E4SPV18E0YL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUXB5LI#wasThisHelpful","R2E4SPV18E0YL3","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this product hoping it would fit on my back door that we use so often during the summer. Unfortunately, it did not fit my door at home, but it fit in my family's beach house! This was the perfect size for the door leading out to the pool and the beach. With my younger brother and his friends constantly running in and out playing tag or whatever new game they've invented for the day, this was the perfect solution for us! It will save us several sets of blinds to go on the door, that always seem to get ruined when the door is opened and slammed closed repeatedly. The magnetic closure works great, and when the sections get close together it snaps back shut. I like that it is also connected to the door frame by velcro so we are able to take it down during the winter and just use the door. Overall the screen and edging are very good quality, so this should last us a very long time.I received this product for free for my honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HOYAVXUSG7ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZNOHTW#wasThisHelpful","R3HOYAVXUSG7ZM","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this ring for my husband. As a police officer he was constantly scraping and chipping his wedding band, even though it was made of tungsten. He also occasionally lost it when it fell off when his hands got wet. He ended up taking it off and putting it in vest pocket while he was at work; well no more!! Now he can wear this ring and no longer worry about it chipping, scratching, or falling off! He normally wears an 11 so I ordered the extra large and it fit perfectly! He loves how light it is and how comfortably it fits. He no longer has to worry about losing an expensive ring. With this one if he loses it, we can afford to replace it. My only negative for this product would be that the steel gray is a little lighter in person than in the pictures, so he would've preferred the black, but I think its a nice color overall. Great product! Even recommended this to other officers' wives for their husbands!I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W53BE2LCIKIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBT4HRS#wasThisHelpful","R1W53BE2LCIKIC","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS! My younger sisters and I were so excited about using this we used it the first night we got it in the mail! We let time get away from us and the mask sat on a bit longer than 15 minutes but I think it improved our results. One of my sisters has very large pores around her nose and after the first mask she noticed a big difference in the size of them- they were much smaller! After we rinsed these masks off we were amazed at how smooth our skin was. Even the next day our skin was still sooo soft! This product came in a nice sturdy jar that seals nicely! I think this could be a perfect gift for anyone, men included! My husband says he is going to try doing it tonight, and I'm sure he will love it! Thank you again for this wonderful product! I can definitely say its well worth the money and I will definitely be getting more of these for stocking stuffers for Christmas!I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOP9PSAVI7LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTAFYKY#wasThisHelpful","R2VOP9PSAVI7LL","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I opened this package expecting another vegetable slicer/Julienne slicer, but was pleasantly surprised! I just finished cooking stir-fry for dinner and I used this to cut the vegetables up for it. I even left some of the zucchini strips long like the noodles to add in that extra little veggie for my picky younger brother. While the free peeler that came in this package is a tad bit hard to use on carrots, I had no problem using it to peel our cucumbers for our salad or the zucchini squash for the stir-fry. It was a bit difficult to get the vegetable started in the slicer, but I think that is just because I don't quite have the hang of it, and once it was started it sliced very smoothly. When Cleaning this product out with the cleaning brush (provided free in the package) I had no problems! It helped get in all of the nook and crannies to make sure this product was completely clean. In each of the e-book cookbooks I have found several new recipes to cook for my family! Overall I am very pleased with this product and can't wait to try all of the recipes and find new ones to use this slicer even more!I received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3SHV4C9XQDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTQW0WG#wasThisHelpful","RF3SHV4C9XQDG","A30SOUQNBVG2XF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30SOUQNBVG2XF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love it. Now, as for fit, it fits good overall, a little loose, but this is not a ""tailored"" suit you know. It's a good costume, with great details, and cool blinking lights. get it just for the lights if not for the skeletal nuances. This is a great costume!

"I bought this looking for a skateboarding segment that I recall from MTV Sports. This didn't have it. However, it did have some cool segments from the long lost MTV Sports world. Only 2 stars because it didn't have the skateboarding segment which was a special. I really loved that original segment because it featured skateboarders in the midwest, skating an old refrigerator in a barn. It also featured music from Pennywise, and MXPX, which was awesome. Either way, this wasn't it.

"For luck, or for pride, this is a great find. It not only looks visually appealing, it has a lot of meaning within Japanese culture. I picked one up for visual design flow on my patio, and it's really cool when the wind picks up. It flows with the wind and really showcases a great overall design appeal. It's well made, easy to hang up, and really comes into life when the wind picks up. I highly recommend this.

"I’ve never seen one of these options before, but after getting hurt skateboarding, someone said I should try this out. It’s like an airplane neck pillow, only it allows for a bit of air and pressure to help with neck. I was impressed with how it can help adjust your neck, and how comfortable it is to have. It helped my neck, but also relieved tension headaches and orbital pain I had in my eyes. It’s a really interesting neck reliever.

"This little book has really helped in the kitchen. It was so good that I bought it twice. The problem that I have is the size and the amount of pictures in the book.

Others you don't need a picture, so the selection is a bit odd to me. However, the recipes are great, the tastes and flavors really remind me of home. I like it.

"I have a nagging knee injury from when playing varsity sports 15 years ago. Doctors said I didn’t need knee surgery, but the ongoing stress of running has really played havoc on my knees. I was recommended this type of adjustable brace and was skeptical at first. This is an easy to apply brace, you simply adjust the fitting and move a bit before you run. I can truly say it’s great, it helps ease the burden on the knee, and it is not bulky or obtrusive. I tried other options that slipped or were too large for my knees. This is a great fitting, adjustable option and really does help with knee support. It’s well made, durable, and has increased my flexibility a bit.

"I've been testing out various training collars, and as I keep testing different things with different dogs, I've found this one to be a great choice. The main thing is the balance between warning and shock. I haven't needed to use the upper levels, but just a gentle reminder works great. I love this option for training over muzzles, as it really reinforces the training commands. I like the adjustable collar, the different levels of control, and build. It's sturdy, easy to use, and doesn't really shock too hard in the early stages. It's just enough to teach. I love it.

"After some time looking this over and trying the recipes, alongside reading the pages, I realized that this was a vegan cookbook. The marketing and gimmick totally got me. But after some time, and tasting the food, I can truly say that this is NOT as great as I originally thought. I've tried a LOT of vegan cookbooks but this one just didn't deliver on the flavors after some time. Some recipes weren't filling, and the use of certain obscure spices killed the pocket book. I adapted some to fit my own needs, but overall, this is a lot of gimmick.If you aren't fully aware, you may get caught up in the ""cool"" factor. If you're a meat eater, you'll be sorely disappointed. Cool way to present vegan cooking aside, this is NOT going to be grand for some more ""traditional"" eaters.

"My office has several terriers running around, and I’m always trying to get them to be quiet. I have used other means in the past, but finally settled on this option. I loved that this was not only humane, but that there were several adjustments. I was able to give my dogs a slight vibration and they have calmed down significantly. Even though they seem active and want to bark, they now know not to do so. It’s a fascinating update with no harm, warning, and vibration that has changed the complexion of my office.The warning tone is really interesting, as it quickly taught my dogs. They learned quickly, and are now quiet whenever I get deliveries at home. It took a little getting used to as there are a few settings to test out. However, if you’re looking to teach your dogs, this collar is great. It’s adjustable, there is a test light, it comes with a manual, and it really is a life saver, if you have a loud dog and want to train them properly.I received this product complimentary and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOW7JOSYKTYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UUBM0C#wasThisHelpful","RTOW7JOSYKTYN","AHXJ8OAVNR90O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHXJ8OAVNR90O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a total analysis of the book with carefully crafted elements from the chapters themselves. Each one is thoughtfully considered, questions are raised, themes are spoken about, and you really get a good guide here. It's not a summary straightway, instead, it's like a class discussion on the central plot devices, the characters, terms, and much more. Miriam Sokolow has done very well to create a companion to the book for those that have read it, or those that want to read it and have a running commentary as to what they are reading. I loved it.

"I have read many a book on treating different ailments, but I haven't seen one quite as good as Jim Johnson's here. The book is set up in clear language, without going into a medical textbook of explanation. There are a lot of images, lots of visual references to the content, and that is what I loved about this book. It not only addresses the issue of pain, it talks about what is actually going on. You may find that there are elements that you are not seeing, from the calf, to the knee, to how you're walking and stepping. You can go through the pages and adjust, and in the end, get a bit of healing. Instead of masking things with a pain reliever, the book focuses on the root issue of inflammation, pain, and more.As far as narrative, this is straight forward, easy to read, and definitely a positive approach to getting relief from tendinitis. I never knew there were so many components to the issue. I always figured it was just isolated to the back of the leg and ankle. That's not the case, as you'll find out in this informative book.

"I was floored by this sidekick to the novel “Follow You Home”.  The detail in which this companion piece comes through with is impressive. You get a quick summary, but more so, you are given insight, questions, ideas, motives, hidden elements, messages, and much more. You are treated to an analysis and thoughtful presentation about the book, and so much more. This is like a “book club” discussion piece, and it’s been carefully written. Elizabeth Halprin has found a way to connect with what a reader must be thinking to themselves. It’s a brilliant idea, and executed well enough.

"These have added a vibrancy to my tank and the tank of my nephew that I had to talk about them. These are live, beautiful little things. Tied correctly, and in a good clean tank, this becomes a nice backdrop for your fish. I was able to get these in place and they really give the tanks a little bit of a “natural” boost. They are free flowing and wave a bit, and showcase a good sense of vegetation. The fish seem to like them too, nibbling here and there or at least tasting, I’m not sure. It’s important that your tank is clean, and these are tied properly to get the best effect. I love them, and my nephew was surprised by how green they stay. They are a different shade of green than I’m used to, but make the tank look so much cooler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOHJYD24C66A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJR1W4G#wasThisHelpful","R3NOHJYD24C66A","AHXJ8OAVNR90O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHXJ8OAVNR90O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently went on a camping trip for a few days in the forest, and this was a life saver. Through a thunder storm no less, this kept me dry, and with minimal blankets, I made it through. This is a good waterproof tent, and it’s easy to set up. If you’re an adventure seeker, this is a great thing to have with you. It’s sturdy, easy to put up, water proof, and definitely a great solution, when set up correctly. I loved it. I’ll be using it soon for another trip moving forward. It comes with everything you need, and fits up to 3 people, I went solo, but it’s a good size.

But I've also used it with epsom salt to help my feet and joints. I love the smell of this oil, and the amazing properties it brings. This is a 100% natural solution, and smells amazing.

"I've never read something quite as fascinating in real life as this one. I say real life, because I know people that have squatted, dumpster dived, and have escaped the tyranny of paying rent. This is a fabulous look into that, and it's an easy to read guide about something that is very interesting. It's a guide, but not a dictionary volume of sorts. The book is written with the beginner in mind, and it flows through various areas of how it might be to squat, in empty homes, apartment complexes, and much more. It's truly something that will make you think about possibly jumping into this world. If I were single, I'd do it. But that's just me. If you're curious about squatting or living under the radar in general, this is a guide to get you started.

"Not since I first read ""Freakanomics"" has a book shined light on so much. This is a book of connections in the modern age, and it's fascinating to see how it all works out. You're going to be enthralled with the connections that Dr. Dov Yanai puts together. Just when you think you know the connections of modern times, you get a new glimpse into the present, and the future. This is a far more cerebral book than a novel, it's very to the point and scientific. It's easy to read, but hard to wrestle with at times as the connections made between the intelligence, science, math, and more are prominent here. I liked it.

"As far as romances are concerned, I am not always up on series that capture the imagination. However, Waves of Desire has been one of those that keep me coming back for more. The breezy nature aside, there is a lot of characterization found throughout the book. It’s a bit of romance, but not so much that you lose the plot points, or narrative. This is a hot book, but it’s part of a larger series that really is compelling to denote. If you’re a fan of romance, here’s another shot in the proverbial arm.

"I’ve been utilizing all sorts of little elements for my fish tank, and that of my nephew’s tank. This is my latest option and it works like a charm. Mind you, it does take time to grow, as ferns don’t just spring up and end up like a garden. This takes time, and even though there’s browning on the leaves when you first get them, in time the spores and fern elements grow. It takes time. I know that some people want immediate results, but that’s not how these little guys grow. It takes time, and as you watch your tank, and continue to work with the right elements, tying these down and keeping them in good water, you’ll see them shift. I was impressed at how these little ferns create lively green through the tank. Done right, these are beautiful, but again, you have to have them tied down, and you need to be patient. They are green, living things, and in the fern family. I love them, and my nephew enjoys seeing the fish pass by these.

I tested them out in outdoor noise, in my office, and throughout my building with my iPhone and was amazed at how light they are, how powerful the sound is, and how this all works out. I can't recommend these higher. They are easy to use, come with an interchangeable ear bud, and fit comfortably without slipping. I'm going to be testing them in the gym, but so far I am impressed with the construction, the connectivity, and price tag. These are a serious audiophile set of headphones and work wonders with Bluetooth connectivity. Sound wise, they are great, the build is solid, and even the box is very unique and simple.

"I have tested and reviewed a few running belts in the last few months and this one is right up there with the best of them. It has a wide, elastic belt and heavy-duty latches, and the material is soft and comfortable. It has a very simple pocket arrangement (there are two zippered pockets) that are lined with a rubberized and I assume waterproof coating. If you wash this belt in the washing machine a lot, there's a chance this coating could start to degrade. I say a chance because it's inside and protected. That's a good thing, I think. My experience with this type of coating is as follows: When it dries out and/or is exposed to the sun, it cracks. When it cracks, it begins to flake. So having it on the inside is way better than having it on the outside. If you buy this running belt -- and I don't think you will be disappointed if you do -- try to not carry chap stick, sun tan oil, or any lotion or creme that might be incompatible with the rubber coating. If you carry your car keys or anything with a semi-sharp edge, maybe insulate them in a baggy first. The more you take steps to protect the inside coating the longer this belt lasts.The only thing I will say negative about this belt (and it's not really a negative) is that it's not particularly manly. It has stitched filagree on the outside with a somewhat feminine touch to it. You can see it in the product photo.For the record, I received this item in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJNAY7AIMGK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013I1BB1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2EJNAY7AIMGK6","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very high quality stainless steel splatter screen. It comes with a removable silicone handle (you can see it in the picture) that you can use or not use as you see fit.What a great idea NOT to have a heat resistant rubber or plastic handle permanently affixed to the splatter screen. Most of the kitchen pots and pans I have end up being thrown out for one of two reasons, either the non-stick coating starts to degrade, or the heat resistant insulated handle goes. The manufacturer could have very easily clamped a plastic handle on this, or glued something on it. Instead, they left it simple and clean. I took this out of the box and immediately wanted a hanger over my stove to hang it on.Screen fits easily into a standard size dishwasher.Put it on top of a pot of boiling water and steam hot dog or dinner rolls.Full disclosure: I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and for the record, I'm very happy with it.

"Nicely packaged. Make a nice gift. Mine arrived fully charged. Includes stereo ear buds, USB cord, headphone/microphone, manual, and a landline phone and stereo mini plug adapter for recording directly from a landline.Controls are completely intuitive. To record, slide the record button to the rec position, to save what you recorded, slide the record button to the off (marked ""save"") position. A single menu button will scroll you through the two categories of saved files, downloaded MP3s and files recorded directly with and onto the recorder.The top three buttons are, Prev, Menu, and Next, left to right, in that order. You use these to navigate through your saved files. In playback mode, you use the bottom two buttons -- Stop/Del and Play/Pause -- as you would on any recorder. You also use these to delete files.To delete, hold the stop button down on a selected file. You'll get a delete menu. Choices are Delete, No, Yes, Delete all. Use the Next button to select and the Menu button to erase. There is no ""Are You Sure"" warning, so if you have a lot of files, I think you're better off doing this on your computer.The recorder connects to the computer like any hard drive. In fact, it connects automatically. You don't even have to turn it on. As soon as you plug in the USB, the recorder comes on and initiates handshaking. The device will show up on screen like any hard drive. Click to open and it will be obvious which files are where.When you plug it into the computer, it auto-connects to the computer. If you hit the menu button on the recorder while the recorder icon is still visible on your screen, you will switch into recorder mode and essentially disconnect from the computer without having ejected the disk first. This could cause you to lose data. Remember, when connected to a computer, you are automatically placed in hard disk mode. Eject first, then disconnect.As a test of the audio quality, I recorder a song being played on my computer. I used the recorder's internal microphone. I thought the recorder did an excellent job reproducing the quality of the audio in terms of separating the various instruments and sounds. I had a heater/fan running in the room at the time, and the recorder picked it up as an ambient background static. At first I didn't even know what it was, just this white noise in the B.G. Turns out it was the heater fan.This is an impressive piece of audio gear for the price. I'm very happy it was offered in exchange for a review. For the record, the seller asked for no special favors, just an honest review. Speaking honestly, it's a very good, solidly built recorder. I plan on using it quite a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KQCWNFZQOB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017868Q0Y#wasThisHelpful","R26KQCWNFZQOB1","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ultra-soft? They're not kidding. I was shocked at how soft these were when I took them out of their bag. Who knew? Bamboo fiber. I would have never guessed you could make cloth this soft from bamboo; actually, it's 70/30 bamboo/cotton. But still. The wife and granddaughter are very fond of these washcloths. We put them through a wash cycle with a load of laundry. A little shedding but not bad, mostly in the yellow one, and a few loose threads poking out from under the edge stitching, easily corrected in two seconds with a pair of scissors.(The photo I took is of three of the four clothes after taking them out of the washing machine. They're still wet.)As you may know, bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet. It has the added value of being regenerative, meaning, you don't have to seed anything. You just got the stalk down (in fact it is a grass) and a new one will sprout. It's a very important global natural resource and a key component in forest restoration and resource management.Go ahead, help save the planet.

"I have several OOSILK products and all of them have been of high quality and have come in attractive packaging suitable for gift giving. This is my second pillowcase OOSILK. The first one I received was silk on one side and 100% cotton on the other. This was to keep the pillow from sliding around on the sheet, which is fine for people who sleep soundly or sleep without shifting or flipping their pillows over. Some people complained about this because when they flipped the pillow over they were suddenly sleeping on the cotton side. This was never a problem for me because I'm not a pillow flipper but more of a pillow bunch'r'upper. What can I say? Everybody has their own technique.Anyway, same fine quality silk is used in this pillow case as is used in all other OOSILK products. For the money, it's a good deal.The only down side for me, is the washing part. They say it can be machine washed with other silk items, but we don't have any other silk items so that means hand washing our pillowcases in the sink. They're not suppose to be squeezed, either, and that means drying them on a rack or shower rod. It's time consuming and tedious.

"This is the third sleep mask I received as a gift or at discount in exchange for an honest review. It's my personal favorite. It's also the hardest and most firm of the three, which is probably one of the reasons I like it and why some others won't. Maybe it's a vanity thing, but I'm a man, and I don't want to wear a sexy, silky smooth eye mask when I sleep. I don't want to wear feet-y pajamas, or a cowboy hat, or a silver kerchief. Anyway, this mask is moulded in such a way it leaves a cavity for each of your eyes. The space gives you room to open and close your eyes without your eyelashes and eyelids rubbing against the material and feeling trapped. The mask also has a small section that sits over the bridge of your nose; this helps keep the mask from sliding. No light leaks under the mask when I wear it.For the record, I'm an older man who normally doesn't wear a sleep mask. I prefer to sleep in pitch, black darkness. I wake up at the drop of a hat, and I toss and turn all night. I have a friend who sleeps with a mask and earplugs every night. He sleeps like a rock. No kidding, he once slept through a hurricane.

"This is my third OOSilk product. The first was their silk pillow case with the cotton back and the second was an all-silk pillow case. One thing you can count on with OOSilk is a quality product and packaging that looks great and is gift-ready right out of the box. They really go above and beyond with packaging, and I don't mean ostentatious or overly wasteful, either.About sleep masks. I don't really use them, but I have three, and each one is different. One has a nosepiece. One has a contoured/moulded shape that provides spaces for your eyes, and one (the OOSilk one) is ultra soft.Here's what you need to decide. For me, the nosepiece really doesn't work. It lets light in, and not all noses are the same (obviously), so the fit isn't perfect. The contoured or moulded design is nice. It fits snugly and comfortably. As a man, I think I prefer the harder, snug fit. But the OOSilk mask...it's really, really, really soft. I mean, it's what you think of when you think of a sleep mask. It's what the actresses wore in all those old movies. I think I remember Kathryn Hepburn wearing one in the movie, Bringing Up Baby.So, if you want to feel like an aristocrat, or a famous celeb from the fifties, this is the mask for you. If you're a man, and you want to add a little something to your love life, get her this for Christmas and see what develops.

"This is a terrific scale. It's so simple, and it comes battery included. I have three digital scales. The others were gifts. One came with a drink maker, the other came as part of a cooking kit. This one is better constructed than the other two.I received this at discount in exchange for a review, but I assure you this has not swayed my opinion in any way. It's a nice scale.As far as value is concerned, I can't say for sure. Prices on Amazon change, and I'm sure you can pay less or more depending on quality. At $18.99, the current price, I think it's a fair deal for a digital scale.Accuracy:Generally speaking, quality instruments are calibrated and judged on accuracy in term of plus or minus some percentage error. You see this all the time. Plus or minus X, where X is the unit of measurement.In the first photo below, you will see the scale turned ON and in STANDBY mode, with three antique measuring weights lined up behind it. The first weight is marked 1/2 OZ, the second 2 OZ, and the third 4OZ. The 1/2 OZ weight measured 0.6 OZ on the scale, while the 2 OZ weight and the 4 OZ weight measured exactly 2.0 and 4.0 Ounces, respectively.If the scale was off and truly measuring the 1/2 OZ weight as 0.6 OZ, then the other two weights would have measured 2.4 OZ and 4.8 OZ respectively.Conclusion: Scale is dead on and the small weight listed as weighing 1/2 OZ really weighs 0.6 OZ.5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU9TTXHAL74OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WU0DX8#wasThisHelpful","RU9TTXHAL74OF","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice, well designed, solidly built ""smart"" 5-Volt wall charger pumping out a maximum of 2.4 Amp per USB port, making it perfect for tablets, IPads and other devices capable of pulling a 2.4 Amp charge. I've been using it for my older Android phone pulling 1.0 Amps in addition to using it for an IPad and a bunch of bluetooth devices. It seems to charge things very quickly.Charger carries the CE mark.My phone has a full charging light that indicates full charge. When I use the charger that came with it, or another 1.0 Amp charger, the full charge indicator will come on telling me the phone has reached full charge. When I use this charger, or anything more than a 1.0 Amp charger, this light will not come on, leading me to believe that the higher amp chargers are shutting off before the phone reaches 100%.It's not a problem using the higher amp chargers, because -- if you don't already know -- the device is pulling the charge and not having it pushed into it by the charger.On the other side of the coin, I do not advise trying to pull a 2.4 Amp charge out of the 1.0 Amp USB port on your old laptop.Note#: I received this as a gift in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MML89J1AXME6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144LFYJM#wasThisHelpful","R2MML89J1AXME6","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:43 Mins So...you'll find lots of super positive and quite a few scorching negative reviews for this toy here on Amazon. I got it at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I just now finished playing with it for about ten minutes. Here's my honest take on it.This thing come packaged quite securely, so take your time getting it out of the box. There's even a backing screw that holds the controller into the box, but not to worry, the toy comes with a mini-screwdriver. It also comes with spare main rotor blades and a spare tail rotor. There's a charging cable in the box that allows you to charge from a USB port. You can also charge from the controller, but I wouldn't advice that as it will just use up your AA batteries. The charging cable has two plugs, one to charge the battery directly, and one to charge the dragonfly via the input port on the bottom.OK, worst thing about this toy -- the instructions. Wow, these instructions take the English language to a whole new level. I can usually figure out what the intent of the sentence is supposed to be but these were a challenge even for me. I did figure them out though, and my effort will save you many minutes of scratching your head, unless you already know what an ""eternal light"" is.First thing you're going to want to do is charge the dragonfly. Best way to do this is to open the battery compartment in the bottom of the bug and take out the battery. (See picture in instructions). Slide the battery and its wires out together. Don't worry. It's pretty ruggedly attached. Now that you have it out of the bug, disconnect the male and female plugs of the battery. Use the USB charging cable, either through your computer or a USB wall charger, to connect the matching plug to the plug wire coming off the battery. If a light comes on in the USB plug on your computer or wall adapter, ignore it. It will go out soon enough. If it doesn't go out in five minutes, then the dragonfly is charged. If it goes out, wait for it to come on again. When it comes on again, the dragonfly is charged.If you use the socket in the bottom of the dragonfly to charge instead of going directly to the battery, it's not as easy to figure out when it's charged or even if it's charging. My ""eternal light"" never came on. In fact I renamed it the infernal light.Now that it's charged, it time to load the batteries into the controller. It takes six double As.As soon as you turn on the power switch on the belly of the dragonfly, the wings will flap (see video), but don't try to fly the thing wih the wings flapping. That's just wild, crazy, hot dog pilot stuff, and you ain't ready for it. No, seriously, I don't think it will fly with the wings flapping. Physics doesn't seem right. So, turn the flapping wings off with the button on the top-right of the controller.Now, to get the thing to fly, you need a lot of throttle (left toggle control) to get airborne. Use the trimmer knob to get the dragonfly to hover without spinning. This is important, because, you won't be able to maneuver if you can't control the spin.In case you're wondering, it doesn't work like a real helicopter or a real dragonfly. You have to spin the chopper and get it to face the direction you want to fly in, front or back. The tail rotor controls the front and back direction of flight. Don't worry if you don't see it spinning. It only spins when you want to go in forward or reverse.According to the directions, you only get 6-8 minutes of flying time on a single charge. That's not that much. If you happen to be airborne when it loses charge, guess what? Yup, you're going to crash.I got this thing flying in about 30 seconds. I crashed it into a ficus, a wall, and a few other things. It didn't break. Came back and flew just fine. (See video for proof.) Some people complained of sharp edges. Mine had no sharp edges. Some people complained of a backwards on/off switch. Mine is not backwards.It's fun, and it's funny looking. Too bad it won't fly for longer on a single charge. By the way, no brainer, but if you turn off the eye lights and the flapping wings, you'll get longer flying times.I'm not sure how easy it is for a kid under twelve to figure out. You'll need to have some supervision there, especially in the set-up and charging phase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0YIXZWFWKZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","R1L0YIXZWFWKZZ","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're looking for a sport backpack, consider this one. It's small, light, well made, and it folds up into its own self-contained storage bag. It's a very cool design. I'm kind of a backpack snob, from my days backpacking the AT, mostly through NH and Maine. I like things simple. Just give me a pack with zippered compartments and NOT a bunch of removable pouches, straps, and buckles that constantly have to be tightened. Anyway, in the old days (60s and 70s), when you wanted to take a long day hike away from base camp, you either used a smaller, relatively heavy and bulky day pack that took up a lot of room in your main pack, or you emptied your main back and used that. A few years ago, my wife bought me a backpacker pack from L.L. Bean. Whoever designed the L.L. Bean pack must have had attention deficit disorder or smoked a lot of weed. It has one big compartment, and all the other compartments are removable pouches added on separately and strapped to the main pack like its a possum or something. It's like a puzzle every time I go camping. The Hopsooken 30L is a mini-version of an old-style backpack. It has multiple internal zippered pockets and two water bottle pouches, one port and one starboard. Simple. The carrying handle is a bit unnecessary for such a small pack, and it could have used a belt strap. Other than that, it's just what I want in a day pack or sport pack. Darn near perfect if you ask me.For the record, I got this pack for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LI0HH0PYH59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017168E6W#wasThisHelpful","R15LI0HH0PYH59","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the animated short based on the book. Just finished watching it with my soon to be 8 year old granddaughter. We both thoroughly enjoyed it - although maybe I did a little more than she, who, I'm guessing, is at the age where she prefers TV or movies with more dialogue and less narration. Anyway, it's a sweet story about a nice witch who accidentally cauldrons-up a dragon. The title has to do with the animal ""hitchhikers"" she can't seem to leave behind. There's a nice, subtle message about friendship and teamwork.Stylistically, it's like The Gruffalo.Scares? Maybe the dragon for the very youngest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U80G5ZD2DYIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISH4WCO#wasThisHelpful","R2U80G5ZD2DYIM","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can tell when the suspense in a show gets my granddaughter (almost 8) on the edge of her seat. She'll want to sit real close. I won't say she was actually scared watching this, but there are definitely action scenes in this movie where the outcome is uncertain. There are also quite a few heavy-handed confrontations between the Evil King and the Swan Princess. In most of these scenes, the king is trying to force his will upon the princess; essentially he's trying to subjugate or enslave her. These kind of scenes can be a bit unnerving for young children. My granddaughter's smart enough to know about happy endings and G-ratings, and going in, she knew there would be no reason to be fearful of the outcome. And yet, there she was, seated close, on the verge of being scared.She still loved the movie and would watch it again. (You know kids, they can watch the same movie twenty times, day after day.}Is this movie appropriate for young children? Should it be rated PG? Beats me. I don't know. But let's look at the story. An evil man asks a woman to marry her. She's in love with another and refuses. The evil man then puts a nasty curse on her and tries through various nefarious means to get her to marry him. When she continues to refuse, and after he locks her in a flooded dungeon, he cooks up a plan to destroy her chance at true love. When this plan fails, he tries to kill her -- and he almost succeeds. The fact is, this is Swan Lake, and Swan Lake was originally penned by Johann Karl August Musäus in the middle of the 18th century, later composed as a ballet by Tchaikovsky. It was never meant for children.In all fairness, I think it's OK. I just wouldn't sit young kids down in front of it and walk away.Meanwhile, Jack Palance, who is almost always terrific, doesn't quite work for me as the voice of the evil king. He plays it straight-up evil, and maybe a little too much so for a G-rated cartoon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CWVOIWQ8V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F1FWVS#wasThisHelpful","R4CWVOIWQ8V4","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great documentary for musicians and music lovers alike. It's more about the music than the characters. There are glimpses into the lives of a few of them. One talks about his ex-wives and losing his millions of dollars -- it's kind of off-subject. Overall, though, the doc is about the music and how it was made and by whom.The producers and/or director spent most of their time with the lesser known members of The Crew, instead of doing the more obvious thing and focusing on the more famous celebrity crew members like Glenn Campbell, Leon Russell, etc. Maybe these guys didn't want the spotlight (Campbell has his own doc), or maybe the producers/director deliberately chose to highlight the lesser known members and give them their due. Either way, these guys (and one gal) deserve the recognition.You'll recognize quite a few names here, and quite a few songs, if, like me, you cut your teeth on rock music of the 60s and 70s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGJC0VEP1UH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMX6WPC#wasThisHelpful","R2OGJC0VEP1UH4","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice capo. It's a little different than the ones the guitarists in my band use (see pics). For one thing, the back is curved to form fit to the back of the neck of the guitar. For another, the clip or locking mechanism is designed opposite to that of the ones my band mates currently use (see pic of two on music stand). Nice solid spring and feel to this capo, with good-quality rubber on the clip. Of the two guitarists in my band, one puts the capo on from the top, the other from the bottom. The one who puts it on from the top preferred this capo to his old standard. The other had no opinion one way or the other but liked the color and the fact that it was less bulky than his old one.

"The positive reviews on Amazon about this product speak volumes and not much can be added to what has already been said. If you're looking for a reasonably priced silk pillow case, this is a good deal. I accepted this when it was offered it at a discount because I planned to give it to my granddaughter on her birthday, which is right around the corner. I'm sure she's going to love it. She loves soft, comfy things, and this pillow is as soft and comfy as it gets.However, if you're like me, and you move around a lot in bed, lying on one side and then the other, bunching up your pillow under your head and neck, using two or more pillows because you have to prop yourself up, or you're the type of person who flips the pillow over a lot, I'm not sure you'll benefit from this fine pillow case. For one thing, it's designed with one silk side and one cotton side. They say this right in the ad. They do this so the pillow doesn't surf around under your head, which is great, but probably not the best for someone who flips his or her pillow over a lot, or bunches it up like I do.The pillow case also has a zipper, which is what a lot of good pillow cases have. Zipper and zipper pull tab are made of good quality materials and the actual zipper part is completely covered by cloth when the zipper is closed, with only the pull tab slightly exposed. You see where I'm going with this? If you bounce around in your sleep, or are a fidgety sleeper, you're going to find yourself with that pull tab in your ear every so often, or maybe with the zipper part of the pillow under your cheek.Bottom line: This is a great pillow case for someone who sleeps like a rock.My granddaughter sleeps like a rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L38RR29FM7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116XKNFQ#wasThisHelpful","R7L38RR29FM7Z","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I connected this to an Insteon 2441TH thermostat in a two wire heat only system that uses the Venstar add a wire relay. Thermostat works fine but no sensor readings show up for the remote sensor. Trying to find any troubleshooting info on this is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The instructions in the 2441TH pdf manual amount to this: ""Connect the sensor to the thermostat."" They don't even bother to tell you where. I assumed it was the only two terminals not designated for heat, a/c, fan, com, return. Frustrating lack of instruction and advice. The instructions for the sensor are equally vague and show a four point terminal block, not the block you'll find in a wireless control thermostat like the 2441TH. My advice to you is not to waste your time or money on this unless you know someone who has made this work.UPDATE: Did eventually find a Smarthome forum with the answer to my problem: The Insteon 2433A3 will not work with the 2441TH. It will only work with the 2441ZTH, which is the wireless version. Don't be confused, both the wired version and the wireless version are wifi capable. (I know, confusing, right?) I love this company, but they obviously have some major issues understanding their own products. The 2241TH and the 2441ZTH look exactly the same, and the manual for the 2441TH says right in it the unit will display readouts from a remote sensor. Only it won't, apparently. Btw, the 2441ZTH does not send remote sensor data to the 2441 unless the remote sensor temperature is triggered as the master. It's like a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

"Full disclosure: I received these from the seller at a discount in exchange for an honest review.They're quite well made, and secure solidly behind your ears, as opposed to the buds that have the inner ear rubber loops. Compared to the latter, these are much more secure. Setting up your bluetooth is a breeze, although the indicator lights are small and hard to see. I was paired with my phone in a matter of seconds.Audio quality is such a personal thing. It's hard for me to say, exactly, what you'll hear based on what I hear. All I can say is, compared to another set I use, these have a different sound, more live feeling than studio feeling. This could be because the rubber buds don't fit that tight into my ear. There's a little bit of a gap there because the hooks that go behind the ear keep the buds from being pushed in too far. Some people will like this, and I have to say, for driving in the car and listening to music and being able to hear traffic and communicate over my phone, I'm one of those people. I'm guessing they'll be good for jogging or running for the same reason. For sitting at home and working on my laptop and listening to music, I sort of want a tighter fit. I want to be immersed in the music more and have less outside noise. There are different rubber ear pieces that come in the package, and I really haven't tried them. Nor have I worn the buds for more than an hour. Could be, with a different ear piece, and with the ear hooks worn in a little with more use, I'll have a tighter fit. Right now, I'm happy the way they are.One of the things I like with these is the design and the high-tech feel of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBCEJOEK83O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F5VE3M#wasThisHelpful","R2IBCEJOEK83O3","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well made, sturdy leash good for medium size to large dogs. Keep an eye on the swivel snap hook if you have a big dog. I'm not sure what it's made out of. Looks like zinc plated steel or brass. Should last for years but if you have a dog that pulls a lot -- well, all I'm saying is, these types of swivel hooks are just not indestructible. You have two major wear points, at the swivel and at the snap hook. Good thing is, leash is guaranteed for life according to the company.

"I plugged this into a Roku box and a brand new Element TV last night. No complaints. It's a high quality cable and certainly long enough. It is a little stiffer than my other cables and had been coiled when shipped, so it had its own loop ""memorized"" into it. As it was, I decided not to try and straighten it out forcibly. I figure it will straighten out over time on its own. Like I said, even with the stiff loop in it, there's plenty of cable length here for all but the most extreme applications. NIce quality, gold plated connectors have a protective cover on them when they arrive, which indicates some extra care being taken on the part of the manufacturer. Arrived new in a plastic bag.I can't honestly say this cable works better than any of my other high quality cables, but I can say it works equally well and is being sold for less than I paid for my two other HDMI cables with gold-plated connectors.[I received this cable free in return for testing and for writing a review.

" 0:13 MinsFantastic gloves. I just pulled a bunch of hard boiled eggs out of a pot of boiling water. The fit is perfect for me. So often, when I buy gloves these days, the fingers are just a strange length for my hand. Obviously, these aren't a one size fits all type of glove. I'm just saying that I'm pleased -- and surprised -- they fit me so well. However, being silicone rubber, you do have a little flexibility in that you can pull them on tight. Anyway, it's a fabulous product, well constructed and heavy duty. Clearly, not to be used over an open flame. They're heat ""resistant"" not flame retardant. Keep that in mind. That said, wearing these gloves, I would not hesitate to pick up a whole roasted chicken, duck, or rack of ribs off a grille, as long as the burners are turned off. I use the drip pan/water pan method to slow roast meats on the grille. three to six hours of cooking at about 200 to 220 degrees F., depending on the size of the meat. [Take a roasting pan and put that under the grate where the bird or ribs will be set, place your hot coals around the drip pan. Place another roasting pan full of water (or beer) on the gate next the the meat, to keep the temp down.] When you cook this way, the meat just falls off the bone. If you're not careful lifting your roast or ribs off the grille you can have them fall apart before serving. These types of gloves are the perfect answer to that problem. You can cradle your dinner and place it gently on a serving tray or plate, and then wash them later in the sink. I love these gloves. Use them for steamed lobster or crab.By way of a comparison, I bought a single, heavy duty, heat resistant silicone rubber glove a year or two ago from another manufacturer. I paid more for the single glove than these two cost. Anyway, the glove I bought last year was shaped like a claw, with no actual finger slots. You had to put your hand in the glove like you were giving the Vulcan ""Live Long and Prosper"" salute. I hate that old glove. You can't grip a thing with it.Full Disclosure: I received these at a discount from the seller for test and review purposes.

"I was provided these ear buds by the seller at discount for test and review purposes. Nothing was suggested or implied with respect to the review. All they asked for was an honest review.I probably have ten or twelve sets of ear buds, starting with the pair I got with my very first iPod. Generally speaking, until I got these, I really didn't like ear buds. My others are intrusive, literally, and uncomfortable in my ears. I can never seem to situate them so I get the audio the way it was meant to be delivered, and they never quite stay in place. Up until now, I preferred a pair of headphones.But these QY8 mini bluetooth buds are pretty nice. They're very light, sit well in my ears, and provide me a very pleasing hi fidelity audio experience.Setup was a piece of cake thanks to a very simple and smartly engineered combination of lights, red and blue. First step, charge the device. My device charged in about 45 minutes. Now try pairing. Hold the devices power button down for 6 seconds until you see the red and blue lights flashing alternately. Use your phone, laptop, or whatever to scan bluetooth devices (you have 3 minutes, which is a lot more than other devices give you), pair your transmit device to the QY8, and wait for the red light to go off and the blue light to come on. Once paired the blue light will flash every 8 seconds. Having two different colored lights in a device this small is a real plus. A lot of devices this small don't even let you know they're on, or it's a real puzzle to determine if you're in pairing mode or not.The QY8 has the added feature of being able to pair with 2 devices at the same time. In other words, you can pair with your laptop and phone so you can privately work or watch videos on your computer and still be able to answer the phone. [FYI: These would not pair with my iMac running OS 10.6.8.]Anyway, I give them 4-stars. (I downgraded slightly when I found out they would not pair with my Mac.) Great audio. Simple set-up. Comfortable for ear buds. Terrific features. Two different colored indicator lights for 3 way status: on, off, and pairing. Great price as of the writing of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LY0QMYGKA6NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HYM0KE#wasThisHelpful","R1LY0QMYGKA6NE","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My next door friend and neighbor is an avid mountain biker. In fact, he was a fully-sponsored, internationally-ranked mountain bike racer in his younger days. He has 14 mountain bikes, if that means anything. I got this for him - it was offered at a discount in exchange for a review - thinking it might be something he could use with his Samsung Galaxy.I have seen many different types of these phone holders for cars but this is the first I have seen made specifically for a bike handlebar. Obviously, a mountain biker is going to want something sturdy and robust. My first thought right out of the box was that this holder didn't have as solid a feel as some of the car phone holders I've seen. The handlebar clamp is pretty hefty, but I questioned the clamp and elastic harness set-up that holds the phone. Anyway, I gave this to my friend last week and we put it together and tested it in the house. Turns out the elastic strap and clamp hold's the phone in place just fine.The elastic strap is an integral part of this system and without it the phone holder is rendered useless. You cant trust the phone clamp to hold the phone in place on its own. Meanwhile, you only get one strap with your purchase. Break it or lose it, and you need to get another one if you want to use the phone holder.One last thing, in terms of safety and confidence and keeping your phone secure, my feeling is the elastic strap is better than any kind of clamping method. With the screw or ratched type clamps, you really have no way of knowing if things are getting loose, until they do and your phone falls out. The strap is a an on/off, fail/no-fail kind of thing. It's either going to work or not work. Anybody who has suffered through the eventual loosening of a screw clamp knows what I'm talking about. And yes, there is a screw clamp that holds the device to the handlebars, and, eventually, that clamp will probably fail.My friend was quite pleased with the phone holder and was looking forward to using it on a mountain trail. I haven't heard back from him yet but as soon as I do I'll add his report to this review.Addendum: Here's what my friend had to say:Phone holder is easy to mount on either a bike handle bars or stem.Could also be use on snow machines, ATVs and motor cycles.Holds all sizes of phones securely with spring loaded clamp and stretchy silicon(?) butterfly which secures each corner of the phone. This silicon allow to position the phone in various positions to allow access to the power and volume controls.Able to locate the phone either landscape or portrait.One con is that if you wanted to use the camera app on the phone you might miss the opportunity to get photo of fleeing wild life, but that a cost of have your phone held securely.Stem mounting may not be best if you due a lot of out of the saddle riding as your knees might come in contact with the phone. What a nice functional design. 5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96H37CFYV7T6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OZ6J5C#wasThisHelpful","R96H37CFYV7T6","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Windsor Harries emailed me about reading and reviewing this book and he graciously offered me a copy. I've been inundated with requests for reviews and have been passing on them because I really have my own reading list and most people who send me requests haven't even taken the time to figure out what I like. Well, for the record, I like to read hard science fiction and hard boiled detective stories. I read adventure, non-fiction, and just about anything, but when I want pure unadulterated reading entertainment I stick to hard scifi and hard boiled mysteries, which is why, after reading the blurb about Moon, I said OK.Moon has something else going for it for a scifi enthusuast such as yours truly, namely, it's a collection of novella length shorts, and I like short stories, especially scifi shorts. You can read them in one or two nights.Moon isn't quite in the hard scifi genre. And I won't call it particularly awe-inspiring. It doesn't break new ground in terms of opening your mind to new ideas or concepts, as great scifi is supposed to do. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and looked forward to coming back to it every night. Harries is a skillful writer who knows how to keep the story moving and the drama and action compelling.There are five novellas contained within. All of them share a common theme that can be summed up in one word - Unique. In fact, the actual word ""unique"" pops up in almost all of the stories at least once. I'm not being critical. It's just an observation. The subjects of the stories are classic scifi. Alien encounter/First encounter. Armageddon/Apocalypse. Genetics. Transmutation. Isolation. Alien Invasion.The alien genetics story (Prime) was my least favorite. My favorites were Moon and the first, Chosen. The second, the Armageddon story, Rumble, had some fuzzy science going on and it bounced around a lot as it was told anthologically, i.e. from the point of view of multiple characters and voices as they struggled to survive the same apocolyptic experience. I enjoyed it for it's international flavor and rich atmosphere. Voltage is about an electrician who, after taking an AC jolt to the head, temporarily enters a fraternity of anti-government superachievers and revolutionaries. It seemed to me this story had some subliminal or allegorical aspect to it.All these stories have their roots in classic scifi, and I'm sure scifi snobs will say classic writers of the 70s and 80s have done it before and better. Maybe so. I still feel comfortable giving it 4.49 stars for providing me several nights of entertaining reading.(If I gave it 4.5 stars, I'd have to round-up to 5-stars above and that wouldn't be quite right.)Well done, Mr. Harries. I'll be checking on your next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZE7TI00NLRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131RH128#wasThisHelpful","RUZE7TI00NLRW","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I downloaded this app for my granddaughter's iPad. I spent two hours looking for children's books she could read because she loves to read. She's 8 years old. The app lets you add the books to your wish list, which you can then buy on-line later. The content gets added to your library and you can then send it to your device using the Manage Devices and Content Page. So far so good. New content shows up. Reader works great. Problem is...app has a toggle button at the bottom -- Cloud/Device -- and when you switch it to Cloud, all your content shows up, your zombie stories, mysteries about mass murderers, whatever else you happen to be reading that you absolutely don't want your 8 year old granddaughter to see the graphic cover of let alone download and read. So you look for parental controls in the app. There are none. OK, so you figure you've already download her books, why not just unregister the device? Nope. That won't work...a warning comes up telling you all content will be deleted when you unregister. Wait, you think, I'll use Amazon's new Household Family feature to create a kid-safe library and then only allow the iPad to access the safe library. So you go to your Manage Device and Content page and go through all your books ten at a time (you can't click on more than ten and at a time) and you create a new library just for your granddaughter. You put her new books in the new library and make sure the adult content books are not in there. But then you discover, there is no way to set the new device (iPad) to choose the new kid-safe library. At this point, you have about 3 hours into this project. So you go back to the Manage Device and Content page and you go through every book (ten at a time) and take all the adult content books out of the main shared library leaving only the kid-safe books available for viewing in the cloud, which also takes all these books off your other adult-only devices. But what the hey, it's about your kid, right? She loves to read! Ok, another thirty minutes down the tube. But holy moly it's totally worth it, right? She loves to read dagnabbit!!!!! Molding young minds and all that. So you go back to the iPad with a big satisfied grin on your face and click on the Cloud button and even though you went through all this hoopla and wasted half a day, all your adult content books are still right there!!!!! But wait, you can't give up yet. There's always tech support. You haven't shaved or left the house, but the sun still has about an hour to set. You call Amazon. You get someone in Cloud support who sounds very nice and somehow is already in your account navigating through your digital content. She says everything looks right and transfers you to a Kindle guru sitting in a haze of incense somewhere in Pakistan with his legs folded like a pretzel. He sounds like he's in an all fired hurry to cook a goat or catch a train but nevertheless listens to your conundrum. He puts you on hold for 15 minutes and when he comes back he says. ""I'm sorry, but the Kindle app on the iPad will not function with the Household and Family Library. Have I solved your problem today? Is there anything else I can help you with?""[For the record, I love Pakastani food cooked with goat and have nothing but respect for gurus.]","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IMSE2EJSRH7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB769KC#wasThisHelpful","R2IMSE2EJSRH7T","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like the design as seen in the picture, and you're looking for a hand-sized, low cost walkway or garden light, this might be just the thing for you. It's not the most rugged product you'll find at Amazon, but it's also being sold for under $6. You kind of get what you pay for, and in this case, I think you get a pretty good deal. I have my doubts about it's water-reistance and I have yet to test it that way. Tonight, maybe, as we're expecting 4"" of rain. Check back and I'll let you know what happens.The light has a footprint about the size of a man's hand, and it is designed to be mounted with the solar panel in an upright position. If you mount it exposed to the elements, I think it's safe to say you will lower its life expectancy, because the panel is meant to pop out of the top of the lens housing and the seal there is not watertight. Underneath the solar panel is the battery compartment. A little silicone around the edge of this will go a long way in keeping this section dry.Here's an easy way to mount it without having to measure anything:1. Remove the battery compartment.2. Remove the inner lens sleeve.3. Mark your screw holes with a pencil going through the open sections of the outer housing.4. Install screws.5. Slide inner lens sleeve back into position.6. Pop the battery compartment back using a bead of clear silicone as a waterproof seal.7. Mount light.The light casts a nice, mellow hue that's very pleasing and not to hard on the eyes. (See photo: I took this inside, in the dark.

"This is a nice wallet, and I think it's worth the selling price. Even if it did not block thieves from electronically stealing your credit card and I.D. information, it would still be a nice wallet.

A wallet is a very personal, utilitarian thing, and everybody has different needs. I want easy access to my credit cards, licenses, and I.D.s, and I have nine of these. My driver's license I place in the flip-out holder with the clear window and the eight others I put in the facing sleeves. Behind the sleeves are two hidden compartments. I use these for registrations, fishing licenses and other things I don't take out very often.I was offered this item as a gift for purposes of testing and reviewing, and I can honsetly say I would have passed had the wallet not been made with the exact number of sleeves and pockets I require. Functionally, this wallet is a duplicate to the one I've been using for twenty years, and until now, I've been unable to find a one to replace it.

Required reading for every mountaineer, armchair or actual.I read this book in about three days and I would have read it straight through if time had permitted. I haven't had a book do this to me for a long while. Last book I had I couldn't put down was Andy Weil's novel, The Martian.Denali's Howl is unique in that the author's perspective is both personal and journalistic. He was there as a young boy, curious, mystified, awed by his surrounding and the work of his father, who was the Park Superintendant at the time.

It's free of writer ego, of unsubstantiated opinion, of heavy-handed commentary, of speculative writing. if you read Junger's The Perfect Storm, and you, as I, were jolted by Junger's ego-centric narrative, you know what I mean.I highly recommend this book.

"I used to be an Estes rocketeer when I was a kid and so it was natural for me to want to get my granddaughter into it. I bought this classic model for the same reason everyone else did, because it reminded them of the very first model they built and brought back great memories. All I can say is, I'm disappointed in the Estes brand. Instructions are minimal and in multiple languages. (I'm not an English snob but I didn't find the instructions in English very detailed.) The rocket seems less than it was back when I first got mine many years ago. My first Big Bertha had a payload section. This one does not. Rocket came bagged in a clear plastic bag and not a box. I still don't know what rocket engine to get because it wasn't obvious right off the bat in the instructions. I also think it's kind of  cheap not to sell the model and the engine and recovery wadding all together. When you buy a model, all the needed parts should be included.

"There's not much you complain about here with this camp light. Solidly made. Works as advertised. Decent price. Plenty of illumination for what it is. For the record, I got this at a discount in return for an honest review. The company asked for no special favors.On the plus side, it's lightweight, robust, clicks on and off with a solid connection, and is made of mostly impact resistant plastic. The battery compartment is in the bottom under a screw cap that is not weather sealed with an O-ring. By the looks of it, I would call it weather resistant but not waterproof.The light cast is your typical automotice LED hue. I would call it, not indoor warm and fuzzy. Instead, it has that alien moonlight look to it, not comfortably atmospheric but very easy to work under. The light also sort of has a hypnotic effect when you stare right at it because it has all these lenses in it; it's not so bright that it hurts your eyes when you look directly at it. What I'm trying to describe is a lantern that has been designed to throw enough light into camp to be useful but not so much light that staring at the source temporarily ruins your night vision. It's a balancing act, really.I plugged in the three fresh AA batteries and turned the light on. I left it on outside in 48 degree F. weather for 12 hours. The light looked just as strong at hour twelve as when I turned it on.The handles are ferromagnetic. Does this mean they are not stainless? No. Not necessarily. Does this mean they will rust more quickly? No, not neccessarily. Sorry I can't be more specific. Some stainless will rust over time.Bottom line. Nice camp light.

"My granddaughter will love these. We have not yet tried them on the road but they seem to fit snugly on the frame and handlebars. Anyway, they came with two sets of batteries, very nicely packaged. It makes a nice gift item because of the packaging. Typical bicycle type of light with three settings: fast flash, slow flash, and continuous. Just click the lens once for each setting and once for the off position. There is a rubber O-ring that seals the battery compartment and the threaded cap seals tightly. Based on this, I would suspect it's pretty resitant to water intrusion. It's hard to tell what kind of seal there is between the outside of the lens and the battery compartment. The lights are held in place with an adjustable rubber strap. Included with the purchase are two replacement straps.Seems like a pretty good deal to me at the current price. ($5.95 at the time of writing this review.) In fact, it seems like an amazing deal.Some people have noted that the straps are not universal to all handlebars and bike frames and don't fit tight enough aganst the frame or handlebars. I didn't have this problem but if I did I don;t think it would be that hard to jury rig a solution.Note: I received these at a discount in return for an honest product review. No conditions were suggested or implied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYA6D9AG4NB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTNE9QW#wasThisHelpful","RJYA6D9AG4NB3","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not the belly pack kind of guy but this is a nice, simple, well made and comfortable carryall for a phone, keys, I.D, and cash. Zippered pouch for phone and cash. Pouch with velcro flap for keys. Another smaller pouch without a flap for, well, I don't know what, something you wouldn't care too much about if it fell out, or something that would fit snuggly, lipstick, lip balm, that sort of thing. The material is soft and durable and the elastic strap and clip are heavy duty. It has a sport feel to it and I think joggers and bicyclists will love it. It also seems to be priced right. I used to run and hated carrying anything in the pockets of sweat pants or running shorts. A belly back sure solves this problem.Full Disclosure: I was given a discount on this product in return for a product test and a review.

"I received one of these as a gift to test and review. As far as comparisons go, the only other ones I have ever used are the ones you used to get for free from the airlines when you traveled overseas. They don't give anything away for free on airlines anymore, unless you're in first class. Anyway, compared to the ones from the airlines, this is a lot softer and a lot bigger. It also has a sewn in nose piece for added comfort. You get a little light bleeding though around the nose but after awhile of wear I figure the mask will mold itself to your face. It's very soft.

"I received one of these grinders at reduced price in exchange for an honest review and some honest feedback regarding the product's value and functionality. Turns out, it's a very nice spice and/or coffee grinder with an all stainless steel housing and grinding arm and a set of ceramic grinding discs or burrs. Perfect size. Not too small. Not too big. Solid feel. For the money as advertised ($15), it's an incredible bargain. I've considered buying much more expensive grinders at the local coffee emporium but never wanted to pay so much for a manual hand grinder. Some of them were $60, and I can't imagine them being any more functional than this one. Then again, I love stainless in the kitchen.You can adjust the grinder to whatever size grind you want, although, as someone else mentioned, trying to get too powdery or fine a grind might cause damage to the ceramic parts inside. Also, when I took the grinder out of the box, took it apart, and sniffed the inside, it had a distinct manufacturing smell to it, like a new car smell. My advice is to wash the thing in the dishwasher, or thoroughly in the sink, before using. I'm probably stating the obvious here so I apologize if I'm insulting anyone's intelligence.Botttom line, in my opinion, this is an awesome coffee or spice grinder for the money.It's also the very first ceramic burr grinder I've ever used, and so I have to wonder how practical it is to use for different spices AND coffee. Will the ceramic cutting components take on the flavors of the grounds over time? Isn't ceramic somewhat porous? Not knowing the answer to this, and not wanting to risk mixing flavors of crushed red pepper and Kona coffee beans in my shiny new grinder, I plan to use it for coffee and spices that can go with coffee, spices like mint, cardamom, cinnemon, vanilla. Even if the flavors don't completely wash out of the ceramic, I'm sure whatever flavors remain will add depth to any cup of coffe made from the grounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXLX630D0PLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IJZ3M6#wasThisHelpful","RVXLX630D0PLV","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wife loved this. She had bought one from another company a while back and last night compared the two. See photo below.This spiral slicer did a much better job creating spiral slices, and it came with a little brush for cleaning. As we all know, cleaning these types of kitchen devices can be a chore. The little brush is a nice touch.In the photo: The spiral cucumber slices on the right (from the other brand) are less solid and formless than the ones cut with the The Very Healthy Spiral Slicer Spiralizer (on the left). The ones cut with this spiral slicer are larger and actually have the desired shape. Both slices were cut from the same cucumber.The slicer on the right in the photo (the other brand) has a cap that locks in place while The Very Healthy Spiralizer does not. You would think it would be better for the cap to lock into place. Actually, no. This slicer held the product and spun it better than the slicer with the locking cap did.For the record, I received this as a gift to test and review.

"This is the second one of these I've installed on my truck. First one lasted about five years. It's a seamless fit with the OEM version. I have to figure they're identical although I can't say for sure. The lock lever on both the one's I've purchased would not work the door lock properly. I don't know if it's because the throw isn't long enough or because something inside is hanging up. I don't know if it's the Dorman door handle mechanism or the door itself. I've given up trying to figure it out. In fact, this truck has been nothing but trouble for 15 years. 2000 Chevy c/k2500 crew cab with 99,000 miles. Ten to fourteen mpg if I'm lucky. Crappy brakes.

"I'm going to compare the iGearPro 8GB Digital Audio Recorder to the Sony-ICDP620-Digital-Recorder, which I bought four or five years ago for about $75 and is now (at the time of writing this review) available here at Amazon for about $164.Right out of the box, you'll like the solid feel to this little iGearPro recorder. It's all metallic, and it's small. It has as solid a feel to it as my Sony recorder, maybe even more solid.It's more compatible with Windows and Mac than my Sony.It has 16x more memory than my Sony.It has a USB rechargeable battery while the Sony requires two AAA batteries.The controls, while minimal, are so much easier to use than the controls on the Sony. (I have, for the most part, retired my Sony to the trash bin.)Neither device accommodates an external microphone.My iGearpro played my recorded voice back in mono on only one ear bud. I don't know id this is a problem with the ear bud, or if the device only records in mono. The device does have two microphones. (I'll test this later and get back to you.)Both the Sony and the iGearPro could pick up voices from 15' away. I thought the sound quality of the iGearPro was indistinguishable from the playback quality of my Sony.Sony has more additional controls for dictating than the iGearPro, but they're so hard to use they're basically wasted.Neither one is really a look-free device. In other words, you have to see the buttons to know what you're pushing. That said, the Sony being larger, it's probably a little easier to use when moving between different recordings or sessions.In terms of just starting and stopping a recording, the iGearPro is much easier to use, one push on the record button to start, two pushes to stop.Neither device is very good for recording music a distance.Sony ICD620 - $164.00iGearPro 8GB AVR - $25.50Full disclosure: I received one of these free to test and review. The company asked for nothing other than an honest review.[Update:] My earbuds came damaged or with one side not working. I tested them in an ipod and I had only one ear bud working. But given that the ear buds have a stereo 1/8"" mini-plug, it's assumable that the device plays back in stereo. Also, because it has two microphones, one on each side of the device, I think it may actually record in a kind of virtual or simulated stereo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8CRPJ4D4YBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW0VG2E#wasThisHelpful","R3P8CRPJ4D4YBF","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of these free to test and review. It's like the 5th power bank I've received or ordered, and it was one of my favorites until I lost it. It's around here somewhere, but dang if I know where, which is something to consider if you're thinking about buying one of these. I'll explain in a minute.As all other reviewers have noted, this is a sleek, ultra-thin, battery bank charger for your mini-USB connectible device. Because it's so thin, it can't accommodate a full USB connector. Instead, it uses a mini- to mini- cable for power bank to device charging and a standard USB to mini-USB cable for charging itself. A single cable with two mini-USB plugs and a standard USB plug is included with the battery bank.This thing was just a tad too long to fold into one side of my wallet, nor did I really want to carry it there because I worried about bending it, crushing it, or getting it wet. If you saw my wallet or followed me around for a day you'd understand my concern.I carried it in my breast pocket, which is where it was when it disappeared. Trust me, this thing is thin, light, sleek -- and slippery. I was replacing the inside door handle in my truck, going in and out of my garage and basement, bending over tool boxes, cursing General Motors under my breath while wrestling with the inside door panel and it's power plugs; one minute the power bank was there, the next it was gone.

"I got this toy organizer for free from the company in order to test and review it for Amazon. They asked for no special consideration other than an honest review.My first reaction when I took it out of the bag was that it didn't look like much. The bag is made from a sturdy material but it seems kind of small, and the quality of the suction cups don't appear to be as rugged or functional as, say, the ones you'd find on a mobile device mount for your car. I then read some of the reviews on Amazon and there were complaints about the suction cups not holding. I didn't have this problem. With an empty bag, the suction cups held fine for me on my fiberglass shower wall. I then gave the organizer to my wife's coworker, who has two little kids and two other shower organizers -- my granddaughter is a little too old for toys in the tub.My friend's coworker likes this organizer and says it's better than her others. She says the suction cups hold fine for her and continue to hold. She likes the hooks for washcloths, which her other organizers don't have.

"I really like this briefcase/bag. It's masculine and well made. It has a great vintage look to it. The buckles you see in the photo are attached to magnetized button snaps, so you have the quick-snap open/close option and also the adjustability of the buckles. You have another two magnetized button snaps holding the flap itself in place. All the leather is thick and of a very nice quality and the brass rings are heavy duty. There is one zippered pouch on the back of the outside of the briefcase. This would be a good place for a map, phone, airplane tickets, anything you might want quick access to. Flip up the leather flap and you'll find a heavy duty zipper. Open the zipper and you have an inner area divided in half by another zippered pouch that can just fit a stack of 8-1/2"" by 11"" paper. A Mead 10-1/2"" x 8"" college Neatbook-Notebook slides right in and zippers up easily. The main inner sections of the briefcase are long enough and wide enough for legal-size 8-1/2"" x14"" papers. A FedEx Priority or Express Mailing envelope is too big to fit. On one side of the middle zippered main pouch is an open section with small organizer pouches for pens and small pads; on the other side is another open section and another small, zippered pouch area. The latter would be good for phone, small tablet, power bank charger, recorder, etc.Full Disclosure: I received one of these as a gift for test and review purposes.

"For the record, I received this as a gift for testing and review purposes. The company asked for no special favors in return.As others have mentioned, this is a nice, little backpack, with a ""cute"" color scheme. I know it's cute because wife says it is. Coincidentally, she had been looking for a little backpack to use when we go hiking or on long walks. She had been looking for an alternative to her purse, which she carries everywhere, and which was something I had been giving her a hard time about. Why? Because she's always telling me to watch it while she goes to the bathroom, or ""Don't forget to lock the doors of the truck, because her purse is in there."" And I'm like: ""Why did you bring your purse? We're eighty miles from the nearest store."" Or she'll ask me to keep an eye on her purse when it's sitting on our restaurant table six inches away from my right hand. How can I not keep an eye on the purse when it's right in front of my face? But I digress...She likes this backpack. The pack is light, but made from quality materials, and it has padded straps. There is plenty of room for books, papers, a laptop, and it has a nice zippered pouch on the inside and two side pockets for water bottles. It's perfect for my wife because she can dump the essential contents of her purse into the zippered pouch and carry a sweater and/or windbreaker and water. I wouldn't put keys or anything metallic and sharp into the zippered pouch area. Phone, wallet, money, makeup, divorce lawyers contact information, stuff like that.Because the backpack doesn't have a belt attached to it, I would not recommend it for someone who is doing serious mountain climbing. For the same reason, if you work as a bicycle or motorcycle delivery person on busy metropolitan streets, you'll probably want a pack you can secure to your torso at multiple points. All of its cuteness won't do you much good if the pack slides sideways while you're trying to avoid a bus or a rock slide.Anyway, my wife likes it, and that's all that matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VOGWZJJ4IUEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFX58T6#wasThisHelpful","R3VOGWZJJ4IUEA","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took one star off because I think these glasses (at $5 apiece) are a little expensive, and I took a half star away because I think they could be a little thicker, particularly around the rims. That means I""m giving them 3.5 stars and rounding up to 4-stars using the clickable header above.You want the truth, these are a ton better for wine or cocktails than using the real cheap plastic throwaway cups you buy at the dollar store. We use those, too, and we wash them by hand in the sink so we're not completely wasteful. But you only get a few wash cycles out of the cheap plastic cups, and even after two wash cycles, you're starting to get suspicious about cleanliness.These cups have some major attributes for the beach, pool, camping, boat, etc.:1. They're manufactured in the USA (YAY!)2. They're perfectly clear, so you can tell if they're dirty.3. They're dishwasher safe (top rack) so you don't have to worry about them melting or deforming. I don't have a pool and don't usually bring a dishwasher camping, but this is still an attribute.4. Impact resistant and BPA-free plastic.5. Ergonomic. As others have said, nice thumb hold.6. Wine does look good in them.7. Way more classy than the red plastic cup.Lastly, Govino advertises these glasses as ""Wine glasses,"" and this implies that they're not for children. Just to be on the safe side, and as a word of caution, I do think the rims are on the thin side for children.

"I have three other mop and broom holders so it's not hard for me to make some comparisons between this one and the others.First off, all three work by the same basic principle. You slide the handle into the notch with an upward motion and the broom or mop handle is held in place by gravity and friction. That's about it for similarities because each holder has its own design for doing this. Of the ones that I have, this one is the best. It's the only one that  has rubber on the movable lever arms that hold the handle in place. It's the only one with hooks in addition to the lever arms. It's the only one with a reinforced aluminum mounting bar (the others are all plastic). And it's the only one with good spring action.The holder comes with two stainless screws and two sheet rock anchors. Personally, I would not mount anything like this in sheet rock. Eventually, you will put more weight on this rack than you should, and the anchors will pull out of the wall. My advice, for what it's worth: if you're not mounting it directly into solid wood, use a backing board that will span the framing studs behind the sheet rock. I know, I""m probably stating the obvious.It's not the sexiest or most exciting item you'll buy this year, but it will get the job done.I can't comment on value except to say/repeat that it is the best of the four that I own. It's nice when a company tries hard to make something better.For the record, the seller gifted me one of these mop and broom holders to test and review.

"This is a powerful, precision engineered battery pack for USB charging of mobile devices that require four different types of plugs. I won't rehash what the manufacturer states on the product page except to say you can trust Foxnovo. The battery charger comes nicely packaged and includes a very sleek cloth carrying case for battery pack and accompanying charging harness and cables. I have charged my Android cell phone once from a nearly complete discharge and just plugged it in again. Battery pack still shows a 100% charge, four blue lights.It takes a while to get this battery to full charge because it holds so much. Don't rush it. When you get it in the mail, put it on charge right away. It may take a few hours.With the aluminum alloy housing, the high quality construction, and the company's guarantees of overcharge and overheat protection, the device has an Apple products look and feel to it. It matches my iMac and my wife's Macbook in color and styling. It fits right in on the desk. However, it's not really a desktop device. I use it as such because all my USB ports are taken with drives and other accessories, and I like to be able to grab my phone and battery pack and go when I need to go and not have to worry about leaving with a half-charged phone.I have another power pack/USB charger, but it does not have anywhere near this capacity. My other one has some interesting features, like a recorder and a flashlight. However, it's more of an emergency, one time charge only kind of device. This thing will charge two devices simultaneously, and it will be able to charge multiple devices on one charge. How many? I'm not sure. But I started charging my phone when I started this review. Phone was down to 10% and it is now at 85%. The Foxnovo FP10 is still giving me four blue lights.I got one of these devices for test and review purposes but I have no problem recommending it to people who want on-the-go device charging from a small battery pack.

The carrying case is a very nice bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQWTAOHZ9XTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV8ZEJK#wasThisHelpful","RDQWTAOHZ9XTW","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Would I have bought one of these things on Amazon if I hadn't been offered one to test and review? Probably not, because I didn't quite know what it was until I had it in my hand. I thought it was a water bottle that floated and had a light in it. On the product page, the seller calls it a Solar Camping LED Lights Lantern. On the box, it's called a Drifting Bottle Light, a Universal Solar Multi-Bottle, and a Drift Bottle. What this is, in fact, is a waterproof, floating, storage bottle, with a light and a solar and USB rechargeable battery.Now if you're a camper or a kayaker, or, perfect, a kayak camper or canoeist, you know the value of waterproof storage. You also know the value of having light on the picnic table or near the campfire when you don't make camp as early as you originally planned and end up having to fix dinner after dark. And, most important, you know the value of packing light. Here you have a collapsible waterproof storage container that floats, has a light on it that can be recharged by a USB connector or the sun, and a handle for hanging on a tree limb, tent pole, or snap line.It's made out of silicone, so it's soft, and it comes in a variety of bright colors, although the pink that I got isn't the most vibrant. The screw-top lid houses the battery, charging port, solar panel, and on/off switch, which controls two levels of brightness or a flashing light for emergency use. Care should be taken with the silicone material as silicone is susceptible to certain chemicals and excessive heat.This is a great gift for an avid camper, kayaker, backpacker, or small boat enthusiast. It's a terrific, multi-function waterproof storage container for your cell phone, emergency supplies, first aid stuff, or all of the above. When not in use, it can be compressed to a fifth of its normal size. What you don't want to use it for is carrying liquid.As I said, I received this item for test and review purposes; there were no expectations for a positive review requested or implied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTGZVP895IBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y82IKDA#wasThisHelpful","R3TTGZVP895IBX","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:18 Mins When I first got mine in the mail I thought it was broken because the ball joint wasn't already in the socket. The instructions showed it pre-mounted in the socket. The instructions also stated that the fist step in the assembly was to mount the base, ball, and socket part of the mount into the actual phone cradle part of the mount. On my unit, this part was already attached. Anyway, I contacted the company by email and they immediately answered and told me to just push the ball into the threaded socket. I was dubious because of the size of the ball but it went in just fine. Here's the thing, though: If you get yours in the same state of assembly as mine, follow these steps:1. Slide the nut, threaded side down, over the ball so the threads are facing the threaded socket in the base. The nut will only thread onto the socket while facing in this one direction. Look at the nut closely. On one side, the threads go all the way to the edge, on the other side they don't. The side with the threads all the way to the edge is the side you want facing the socket.2. While the nut is over the ball, and while the base is firmly situated on a solid table, push the ball into the socket. You might want to keep the protective plastic on the suction cup while you do this. Wallah! You're in business. (See Video.)Anyway, I love the way the ratchet drive holds the phone in place, It's solid, and variable, so you can uses it with all size phones.This is a nice car mount for a phone. I have no problem giving it 5-stars.For the record, I was sent one of these to test and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5AV3IZI0LJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJE2YHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2A5AV3IZI0LJF","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chalktastik Liquid chalk markers. What's to complain about here? The markers arrived on time. I followed the directions for priming, tried them on my glass sliding door, and wallah! Super vibrant colors. Then the big test. Do they wipe off cleanly? Yes they do. Do they create airborne chalk dust? No they don't. So far so good. Do the kids like them? Yes, kids LOVE them.So, regarding the manufacturer's claims on the product page, we're batting at least .500 right out of the box. The only things I can't confirm are the two claims about longevity and non-toxicity. I haven't been using them for very long to be able to determine the first, and now way, no how am I going to taste these things or let my dog chew one up. For that matter, I don't care what anybody says about something being non-toxic, don't let your kids lick these chalk markers, and don't let them use the markers on their skin or bodies. IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE PACKAGE THEY ARE NOT TO BE USED ON POROUS SURFACES. What does that tell you? It should tell you that if your kids use them on your white, $2000 couch, you may have a hell of a time getting out the bright. vivid, vibrant colors. (Btw, if you do get them on hands and fingers, the liquid chalk washes right off with soap and water. On a wooden deck or porch, no. The porous wood will absorb the liquid chalk.)That caveat aside, these are great colors, and they are a lot of fun to play with on a glass slider or other hard, non-porous surface, even a chalk board. I gave hen 5-stars because I really do love them for the colors and the easy clean-up.For the record, I was sent a package of these to test and review for Amazon. No favors were asked for or expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACU88P4JCJNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3OBU3C#wasThisHelpful","RACU88P4JCJNY","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, when I got this thing in the mail to test and review I didn't know what it was. I took it out of the box and thought it looked well made. It came with a short USB charging cable and a multi-function USB to device charging cable, and it had an 8gb micro drive in it. A quick scan of the box told me it was a voice recorder, multi-device charger, and flashlight. I tried to turn it on and it was dead. No biggie. I plugged it into my laptop for a charge and it quickly registered power. It has indicator lights that tell you its charge state in percentages at 25% increments. Getting it to full charge took some time but I liked seeing the progress of charge on its indicator lights. I mean, my kindle doesn't even tell me what the charge state is, only when its fully charged.The directions for this thing are kind of weak. Obviously, English is not the first language of the person who wrote them. Fortunately, the device is easy to figure out. As soon as it was charged, I tried the flash light. It's a pretty decent light in a pinch. Don't try to scare off Cujo with it. Next test...charging. I charged my Samsung Android, a Kindle, and my i-Pod, but not without recharging the device in between the latter two. It actually charged my i-Pod and still showed 100% charge afterwards. But when I plugged in my phone it immediately went to a blinking 75% charge, which probably means it took somewhere between 25% and 37% of the device's power to charge my completely dead i-Pod. I charged both my phone and the i_Pod on one charge and still had power left in the device. Phone had about 25% charge in it at the time. Given that bit of info, I'd say you can charge two, maybe three i-Pods on a single charge. Maybe two mobile phones if they don't have huge batteries in them. For the record, the device kept turning off before my phone actually indicated it was fully charged. [Update I've been using this for a week now and I have to correct the above. It will only charge one maybe two i-pods. And, sitting all by itself unplugged in a room of 65-70 degrees F., it does self-discharge some. I had it fully charged and left it for a week on my nightstand and it lost 25-50% of it's charge. When I plugged it into my nearly-dead android phone, it would not fully charge it, only bring it to about 50%.The two outlets are power in and power out. Near as I can tell, using one disables the other. You can't have the thing charging a device and have it be charging at the same time. I say this because I just plugged it into my iMac and when I did the phone stopped charging. It's one or the otherThe voice recorder is pretty good. Recordings are in WAV format. On a Mac, open with Quicktime, not iTunes. Simply plug in the device, wait for it to show up on your desktop, open the drive, and you'll find two folders. Open the Recordings folder and right click the WAV file, then choose Open With Quicktime. The second folder is a utilities/preferences folder and it contains an .exe file. Eject the drive before disconnecting. I haven't tried it on my PC but I'm sure it's a simple process with Windows Media Player given they're WAV files.[Update: The recorder is very sensitive and it does not have a limiter in it. If you are recording loud noises, like a concert, it will come out distorted unless you are very far away. To figure out how best to record those higher decibels you'll have to do some experimenting.]I'm not sure I would have purchased this device had I not had a chance to use it. And at first, I thought, why? But I spend a lot of time off the grid in far off woodsy places. Granted, you don't have unlimited charging capacity, but if you're only going to be off the grid for a couple or three days, this device gives you a lot of options. I can see it being really useful to a backpacker or a sailor in a small boat. Too bad it's so fragile. According to the directions, you don't want to get it wet, don't want to drop it or treat it too harshly; don't get it too cold or too hot, either. If you plan on taking into a hostile environment, you should get a waterproof case or bag for it.In fairness, I'm taking off a star because the instructions are so limited, and also because of all the caveats about taking care of it.All in all, I really like it, and I plan on keeping it with me. I can't wait for a friend with an iPhone to tell me his phone's almost dead. I'll whip this thing out and say: ""I'll charge it for you.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXV50E6EGD4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ19YW6#wasThisHelpful","R3OXV50E6EGD4B","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product in the mail in exchange for an honest review, so here goes.It's a solid, well made, selfie stick with a handle-mounted bluetooth button and your typical phone holder attachment at the other end. It folds up conveniently and I would highly advise storing it and transporting it in the fully collapsed position. Like all sticks, it has a telescoping pole. Once this section of the stick is bent, your selfie stick is pretty much done for. With this stick in the collapsed position, the phone mount and the telescoping portion of the stick are completely protected.The instructions are minimal but the device doesn't require much in the way of setup. Hit the button on the stick to turn it on. Wait for the flashing blue light. Make your phone discoverable in bluetooth mode. Choose the device's handle (mine was something like winnona) and you're done. Put the phone in camera mode, aim, hit the button, and wallah! You're a Twitter star.Bear in mind, this bluetooth device is a recently manufactured item, which means it may not work right with older, smart-challenged phones. I have a Samsung SCH-S720C. My phone - compared to an iPhone or a Galaxy - is like comparing a Willys Jeep to a Cadillac Escalade. The phone linked up great, but when I hit the bluetooth shutter button on the stick, my phone went into settings mode. The bluetooth button would not trigger the shutter. My wife's phone is a ZTE and slighter newer than mine. It also linked up fine, but when you hit the bluetooth button, the first thing the phone did was zoom in one notch. Second time you hit the button it snapped the shutter. This may or may not be something you can change inside the phone. I tried to find a settings or preferences window for the camera in my phone and failed, and there's nothing in the instructions for the stick to get you through this problem. Bottom line, the stick may not be backwards compatible with older smart phones. Doesn't mean it's not a great product. Just means that if you have an older phone running an older, outdated OS, you'll want to do some research before you buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70VJGD6TOGH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5DY758#wasThisHelpful","R70VJGD6TOGH6","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice looking charger. Solidly built, made out of high quality, impact resistant plastic. It looks good on a desk because it has a modern design and a stand-up base. The power cord is also solid and although not particularly long should get you to where you need to go, which, for most of us, is a power strip/surge protector under the desk. The manufacturer put the converter in the minitower instead of having it as part of the power cord. I really don't like it when you need two sockets worth of space in order to plug in a bulky converter/power cord. Not the case here. Thank you GRDE.You will notice this thing has a tendency to charge your device quickly. This is because it's pumping out a maximum of 2.4A per port using imbedded communication protocols that intelligently determine optimum charging criteria. It's kind of a detection/feedback thing, and it means you're suppose to be getting the optimum charge for whatever device your using. Not all devices like the same charge. Samsung and Apple use their own protocols and like a 2.4A charge at some specified voltage. This device detects these things and adjusts accordingly. Supposedly. All I can say is I've charged two Android phones, a Kindle, and an Ipod without problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SPK5U1XXJAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN57ZU2#wasThisHelpful","R21SPK5U1XXJAA","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice light. Well constructed and attractively priced. I was sent one of these for testing and review purposes but I assure you that getting it for free had nothing to do with me giving it 5-stars. I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. It's a great camp light for the money. Would be great for boating, backpacking (it's very light), in a truck camper, tag-along, on or over a picnic bench (suspend it from a branch or tent pole). Use it while working under a hood, in the bilge, or around a campfire, you name it. The device in the closed/collapsed position is for traveling or storage. When you slide open the top part it clicks the light on, which has a warm, easy-on-the-eyes hue. There are plenty of other LED camp lanterns out there, some with dimmer switches. I have not tried them all. In fact, I have not tried anything other than the old, noisy, white gas Coleman lanterns and the problem prone 6V battery lanterns. This, for the money, puts all those to shame. Anyway, if you need a light like this, go ahead and buy with confidence. You can return it, because the company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against fault or defect. One final note, there's a compass built into the top. It's a nice touch, and maybe, just maybe, if you're lost in the woods, and the light and compass are your last resort, they just might help you get home. But if you head into the woods with a couple of Snickers bars and only this lantern and its built-in compass to guide you, I feel sorry for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDQ2DGFMH24B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V97YCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QDQ2DGFMH24B","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered one of these lights for test and review purposes and jumped at the chance. Company asked for no special favors in return, just a fair review, so here goes.It's not very rugged. You'll notice this right out of the box. It's contained in a thin, hard plastic housing. But the design is cool. It uses a pressure or friction fit between the actual light and the light's mounting bracket. It's effective, although I have to wonder if it will be tight enough to hold all its positions under all conditions, e.g., outdoors in the cold winter months, when things tend to shrink.It would have been nice if they had put an o-ring or gasket in the battery compartment. However, the seal between the two plastic halves that comprise the battery compartment is very tight. I mean, it's tight enough to keep out rain water.As I said, the light itself pressure fits into it's plastic mounting bracket. The bracket has one screw hole for mounting against a wall. I mounted it on the column holding up my porch roof. As soon as I approach the bottom of the stairs, the light comes on. As soon as I open the front door from inside, the light comes on. It's bright enough to light my porch stairs and front door area, but not so bright that it blinds you when you look directly at the lenses. It casts what I would call a warm bluish light.There's a 3-position switch inside the battery compartment. Off-On-Auto. I've been using auto. Given where the switch is located, and given the somewhat flimsy plastic housing and its tight fit, it's not something you want to change frequently. It just seems to me the more you open and close the housing, the greater the chance of breaking it.I know I have been critical about its construction, but I like this light and plan to buy at least two more. Once you put one up, you'll think of a bunch of other places to use them. Like inside the garage or in a closet that isn't wired for a light. Mount it high on the wall and you won't even know it's there until it comes on.Another cool thing about the pressure fit, you can just reach up and pull out the actual light part and take it with you as a spot or flash light.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3DXZ7WOMRZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6C4P46#wasThisHelpful","R1H3DXZ7WOMRZW","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second IBSound product I've been given to test and review. The first was a waterproof, bluetooth shower speaker, and I'm happy to report the speaker continues to function without issues. I have no doubts I will get plenty of use out of this charger as well.This is a plug-in-and-use device. It's solidly built. Nothing rattles when you shake it. There's a pistil-grip finish to the outlet end of it, which is a nice touch. Unobtrusive and clean-looking. It's a dual USB port device -- charging cable(s) not included -- that is advertised as a dual 2.1A @5V charging device. For the record, my device is stamped 5V 2.1 A, but the face of it where the two ports are has one port stamped 2.1A and the other port stamped 1.0A. See the photos. (Sorry for the quality but I'm taking these pics with my phone.)Obviously, the 1.0A charging port is going to take longer to charge whatever it is your charging. Probably about twice as long. On the other hand, if you have an older phone, etc., with an older battery, and the battery doesn't reach full charge at 2.1A, you might see if you can get it to fully charge at 1.0A. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't .Meanwhile, it's possible that the IBSound sample I received is an outdated model, because if you look at a close up of the charging device shown on the product page you will not see the 2.1A/1.0A stamps that I have on mine.I took a star off for this even though I'm happy with the two ""different"" charging ports. You may want to check this when you take yours out of the box. If you have modern devices, phones, laptops, Kindles, tablets, you may want the two 2.1A charging ports, and you should get it, because that's what the company says you're buying.Here's a little tip. The device doesn't have a protective cap on it -- and neither do the ports on your laptop, phone or tablet -- but if you tend to throw this in a dirty glovebox like I do, and you want to keep dirt from getting into the ports, just use a plastic bottle cap. It's an almost perfect fit.

"I'm giving this item 3.7 stars. It probably deserves 5-stars, but what do I know about these sort of things? I'm a guy who works outside and isn't big on cremes, lotions, or for that matter, grooming. My hands look more like canned hams. My wife uses lotions, but she doesn't really like oily or greasy things. This lotion is oily. I mean, it says ""OIL"" right in the title, so one would expect it to be, you know, oily.My pump nozzle didn't work. I primed the living daylights out of it and all I got for my trouble was a sore palm, which I then treated with the Rosehip oil. Did I mention it's oily?Seriously, I have rough hands and this oil softened them up immediately. I don't particularly think about having soft hands but if I did I would use this more often. In fact, I plan on adding this stuff to my tackle box when I go fishing, see how it works in terms of making my hands more leathery and useful, like when I'm paddling the canoe around, or chopping wood. If it doesn't attract blackflies or mosquitos, I think I'm going to like it. I wish the dispenser nozzle worked.The Lavender Oil, well, that's just not a very macho thing to admit to using, so I'm not going to mention it, except to say, that I just took a strong whiff of the bottle and it helped clear my sinuses. It comes with an eye dropper and I'm guessing you use this stuff in the bath. I haven't taken a bath since 1956.Given my review, you're probably wondering why I ordered this product.

Would I drink from it? Hell, no. It's made in China and the paint is brightly colored. It probably has uranium or polonium in it. I'm kidding, sort of. I mean, it doesn't glow in the dark or pick up transmission from outer space, but it would have been nice for the company to have included a written guarantee stating that the product is free of lead and other harmful materials.

"The manufacturer sent me a pair off these gloves for review purposes, and when they arrived, my wife immediately latched onto them. She works in an office and her hands and fingers get cold and achy when she's using her computer, especially in winter. These are absolutely perfect for that type of work. Just look at the picture and you can tell what to expect in terms of coverage. Good coverage over the wrist and palms but with open ends at the fingertips. As far as the material and stitching are concerned, don't think of it as opera attire. However, the material feels durable and functional. I think they'll hold up well. There is an elastic quality to these, and when I have them on my hand, tight as they are in mediums, they tend to hold my hand into a naturally relaxed position, in other words, hand curved naturally as if it were holding a small ball.I seriously doubt a pair of gloves is going to cure any one of arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis. I'm over 60, and my fingers are gnarled and misshapen from years of outdoor work on the ocean and martial arts training, but they don't hurt. If your hands hurt, I don't think you should expect anymore than modest relief from these gloves. But keeping your hands warm and relaxed and making sure you have good blood flow is always important. I think a pair of these gloves, fitting snugly but not so tight that they restrict blood flow, can be very beneficial. I plan on buying another pair for myself now that my wife has confiscated these for herself.For reference, I usually wear large gloves and have room to spare. I can fit into a medium rubber dish washing glove with some difficulty. My wife has very small hands and she thought the mediums were a good fit for her. You may want to choose your size accordingly.Although I have never tried any other glove like this for comparison (other than those I have made by myself by cutting of the fingertips of wool gloves), this is a completely honest review and no effort was made by the company to sway me one way or the other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCN8NUEO11RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTR6MNW#wasThisHelpful","R1JCN8NUEO11RI","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I was offered one of these devices for review purposes and have been using it in a small house in the north woods of Maine for over four weeks. The seller asked for no special favors in return, only an honest review. So, here goes...These types of devices aren't easy to review. I mean, how can you tell it's really working? It's not like rodents are going to leave you a hospitality card on their way out the door. ""Loved the instant oatmeal in the cupboard, the half PB&J your kid left behind the couch, and the boxes of tissue paper, but that annoying ringing in my ears the whole time I was here really irritated the hell out of me and my family. We'll never come back to your establishment."" Signed, Red. S.I have a small vacation home in the woods of Northern Maine and that's where I decided to test the Hoont Electronic Rodent and Bug Repellent. I drove up after being away for about 5 weeks, just after a big snowstorm, when there was about 4' of the white stuff already on the ground. The house was completely covered in snow and I had to shovel and snowblow my way in. When I backed into the driveway I was greeted by two chipmunks who thought they owned the place. Remember the squirrel that terrorized Chevy Chase and his family in the movie, Christmas Vacation? Yeah, like that. Only these were outside. They hadn't been inside. But that did not stop them from running around my house, under my deck and porch and attached shed and charging me as if I were the intruder. One of them climbed a snow bank and for a second I thought he was going to launch himself into my face.When I got in the house, I was greeted by a few spiders. We typically get a lot of spiders and ants, big and small. Fish eating spiders can get pretty big and fearsome looking. It was still a little early for the big fish spiders and carpenter ants.I plugged in the device and got to work on the house. The next day, my two ""chip punks"" were running from tree to tree about ten feet away from the house. The following week they were gone. I have no idea if the device had anything to do with their departure, or if they just didn't like me.The following week I still had spiders. The weeks after, still spiders. Week four, I detected a noticeable difference in the number of spiders. No spiders in the tub, whereas, the three weeks prior, I was greeted by two or three in the tub every weekend.The big test will be ants. I haven't had any indoor issues with mice or chipmunks, so, other than the anecdote above, it's hard to say what, if any, rodents the device is actually repelling, but every year we have major ant problems. I'll post back here when I have something further to report.Structurally, mechanically, the thing appears flawless. It has been running solid for over four weeks.

"Bought two of these switches in a single year. Won't last through a winter. If there is any risk whatsoever of this float switch being frozen, take it out of the boat or you're just going to be buying another one. If the issue isn't ice, it's oil, or diesel fuel, or bilge cleaner, or whatever is in your bilge that's not water. Another problem I noticed: If the bilge switch is inactive for a long time, FAIL! If you have a boat that's running frequently, and the switch is cycling on and off a lot, that's good for this switch. Keep it moving, keep it free of contaminants, and it will do well. I had an oil line burst in my boat at the dock. Shut the pump off, cleaned the bilge, tried the pump switch: FAIL! I had the switch ice up this winter. Brand new switch.

"... is not what you might think.HERE BE SPOILERS, I promise you. Consider yourself forewarned....I mean it...OK, don't say I didn't tell you...According to Interstellar - the movie, the single most powerful force in the universe is not found in the atom. It's not subatomic, not even in the minutest building blocks of nature yet to be discovered. It's not described by gravity, electromagnetism, or relativity. It's not the force that binds nuclei together in the atom. Nope. The strongest force in the universe is love. Who knew? I mean, Einstein wasted a lot of time trying to unify relativity and electromagnetism. He would have been better served watching reruns of Friends, or Make Room for Daddy, which was probably more his style because he died in 1955. Or did he? Maybe he traveled into a black hole like Matthew McConaughey, and now he's in some timeless void in space just waiting to be rescued.There's a point in the film when the cliches start to poke you in the eye: the unforgiving daughter mad at her father for leaving her and not coming back like he had promised; the reckless son angry at the world; the benevolent mentor-doctor character; the mysterious ghost that's not all that mysterious; the ridiculous choice to land in the shallows of a giant ocean on a planet orbiting a black hole; the insubordinate crewman without the good sense to run in the face of danger; the obligatory third act fatality; and the crazy-ass last act wild card that arrives just in time to really screw things up. For me, it's like The Planet of the Stupids in the third act. Suddenly, sense and logic take a back seat the classic b-movie operatives, where everybody in the film makes really bad decisions. You would think, on a mission of this magnitude, where the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, certain well-established procedures and standards of protocol would take precedence. Nope. It's pretty much a ""what do we do now?"" guessing game that culminates with Ann Hathaway's character convincing the captain that the only rational choice left is to follow the power of love, a truly Interstellar revelation that comes at us without much foreshadowing. Btw, shout out to Huey Lewis.OK, so I didn't hate the movie. I'd probably see it again for all the things it got right. It's beautiful, the actors do a respectable job, I liked the idea of the end if not the actual mechanics of it, and I liked the visual stuff with the wormhole and singularity.One thing that I truly did not like was the score, and the fact that I had to keep my finger on the remote control's volume button for the whole movie. This thing is just not mixed that well, and if you're like me, and have trouble hearing dialogue in movies, you'll be better off with closed captioning on. The score intrudes on dialogue, as does some of the audio effects. I read somewhere that Nolan did this deliberately because he wanted to provide a more realistic experience. Say what? Hey, Chris, if this is true, please don't do it again. It's scifi, not 60 minutes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P89AKRDRFS3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7GCJK#wasThisHelpful","R1P89AKRDRFS3K","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Island of the Lost is a fascinating shipwreck survival story written by a knowledgable author who can turn a proper phrase for a sea story. Unfortunately, I found myself bogged down by the narrative structure. For example, on page 106, without any foreshadowing or any warning whatsoever, the author begins to tell the story of a second set of shipwrecked sailors. Instead of tying the two stories together from the start, or finding some common thread, she simply adds the second shipwreck in the ongoing timeline. It's really jarring. For over 100 pages you're following the travails of the crew of The Grafton, and then you turn the page and suddenly, in the very next chapter, you're being introduced to The Invercauld and her crew. I also found the character descriptions and character studies on the antiseptic side, which made it hard for me to find something, anything, to which I could anchor some sympathy. Frankly, it was hard for me to root for any of these guys. Another thing that irritated me was the author's choice for chapter headings e.g., ""Eleven: Jaws of Hell."" Kind of hackneyed. if you ask me.In my opinion, the book would have been better with a strong intro/forward (providing the glue or thread to merge the two narratives) and chapters designating the ship's names and dates to which the events of the chapter corresponded. She could have alternated between the two this way, or written two different books, or one book with two separate sections. Any of the above would have been an improvement to tacking on a second narrative 106 pages into the book, but I think I would have preferred alternating the two narratives chapter by chapter, a structure that might have given us something more to root for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEWWDC9OBUN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565124081#wasThisHelpful","R1FEWWDC9OBUN4","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review of the James Dickey 112 Gaming Mouse ((http://amzn.to/1Fof8w7))I typically use a trackball or trackpad on my iMac desktop, my Lenovo laptop, and my Macbook laptop, but I was offered one of these devices for review and thought I would give it a try. It's now my preference for the Mac desktop and the Lenovo laptop, which, btw, is running Windows 7 Pro. I would use it on the Macbook, but it's too hard for me to break the trackpad habit on the Mac laptop. No matter what, I always go back to it.This thing is billed as a gaming mouse. While I am not an avid gamer, I know a little about the variety of devices out there, and they can get pretty expensive. For the money, this thing has a very nice mouse feel under the hand. It's light to the touch, lights up nicely (there's an on/off switch for the light if you need to run in low voltage mode), and it moves freely across a pad. It's plug and play in all computers and therefore needs no special drivers.There are six buttons: left click, right click, middle click (on the scroll wheel for up and down),  forward and back (buttons 4 an 5), and a dpi switch (3 settings: 1000, 1600, 2000). The buttons are all set to a factory default when you take the mouse out of the box, and these defaults will work differently on different platforms and in different games. Some games don't use buttons 4&5 so you'll have to map these buttons, or so I'm told. I don't know much about mapping keys to mouse buttons.On my computers, out of the box and for browsing and working, the left. right, and scroll defaults work exactly the way you'd expect, but the middle default works differently in different browsers, and the forward and back button don't do anything. I downloaded X-Mouse Button Control software from CNET and used it to program the forward-back buttons (4 & 5) and the middle button. The forward back buttons now control my volume and the middle button turns the cursor/pointer into a hold and drag so I can move the window around on the screen with the mouse.There is no disc or instruction manual included but if you're a gamer you probably already know what to do and how to do it. The X Mouse Button Control software is free and easy to use. As far as mapping keys to buttons goes, you're on your own with that one.As others have said, the mouse has a very long USB cord, which is great for me because I use it with my laptop in my recording studio, and the way I have things set up the mouse can't be too close to the laptop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLP2KBFAZ8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHN6E6E#wasThisHelpful","R2QLP2KBFAZ8A","A1V74MGUYUUFAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V74MGUYUUFAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice shower head. Well made of solid, non-corrosive materials. The acrylic base is quite thick. Ideally, it should be mounted in a shower stall so that the shower head itself is parallel to the floor. This way you get the full raindrop effect from directly overhead. In order to do this most people will have to use a different shower arm than the one that comes standard for most showers. You want a shower arm that comes straight out from the wall. Or you can just buy a shower arm adapter designed for a rain shower shower head. The latter will just thread onto the end of the standard shower arm and have a coupe of hinged joints. I have one of the latter but decided to try it in a different shower. It worked just fine set up on a regular shower arm, but I don't think it looks as good as it does when it is parallel to the floor. As such, I plan on moving it to the master bedroom shower and retiring my old all metal rain shower head. It's really quite a nice looking shower head, the type of thing that could win a design award, and it adds a classy touch to any shower. 4-3/4 Stars (Full disclosure: I received one of these shower heads for free for review purposes. It really is a nice shower head.

"You can tell just by looking at the picture on the product page this money belt or belly pouch can hold quite a bit of stuff. It's very well made, too, out of lightweight nylon. It seems sturdy and durable. Good thing to take on a jog or...if you work as a mule for a drug cartel -- no, no, just kidding. In fact, don't even think of it as a secure carryall. If you wear it on the outside of your clothes, some scoundrel will know right away where you're carrying your valuables and it will be no problem for him or her to sneak up to you and rip all your valuables off your waist. If you wear it under your shirt or jacket, and keep it completely hidden, that's a different story. I tried it against my skin and while you know it's there it's not uncomfortable. However, I'm a former security consultant and I can tell you it's OK to carry something hidden under your clothes, unless you make it obvious by the way you walk or adjust yourself that you're carrying something under your clothes. You do the latter and suddenly you mark yourself as a candidate for theft, because now you've told the world you have something worth hiding.

"I have to wonder if there weren't some issues with a production run that a few people have experienced.My wife and I have been using Tidy Cats' clumping litter (3 or 4 different formulas) for probably 20 years with zero issues.We foster and rescue cats and currently have 15 full-time residents, half of which are indoor only. We learned a long time ago that cheaping out on the litter is a mistake.We have found Tidy Cats to be the most dust-free of the bunch, with excellent clumping.However, we do not use the standard litter pans most people have. We make our own covered pans out of large plastic storage bins with lids. I cut a round hole, slightly larger than our fattest fur-child, in the side or end - about 6 inches up the side. A full 27-lb. pail of Tidy Cats goes in each of the six containers we have in 3 different locations and they are all scooped twice a day.After that, we add a couple of measuring cups of fresh litter to each one every day or so and it keeps them working great.This is critical, as the clumping agent Bentonite is used up and must be replenished with fresh scoops. I wish I could buy a big pail of pure bentonite to add instead.We also sanitize the boxes and completely replace the litter periodically, but we only use an average of about three large pails a month total.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJ8IKAMMZ0MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TTJMYA#wasThisHelpful","R2JJ8IKAMMZ0MT","A2CRUUI6AQMYY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CRUUI6AQMYY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"More terrific prose from Hugh. I was going to wait until he finished and released Pt. 5 and buy them all, then I found out I could borrow the first installment for free. Great idea. Very enjoyable and quick read, with a storyline that promises to yield some great action. The things I particularly like about Howey's work are usually not very mainstream points. In this one for instance, I got a real kick out of the fact that the research about the lighthouse picture was assumed to be ""binged"" and not (as 99% of the world might say) ""googled."" I don't know why that specifically resonated with me.The other thing that keeps bringing me back to Howey's books is the writing and editing. I can't remember the last time I saw a typo or grammatical/usage/tense/syntax mistake in one of his stories - if ever. Contrarily, I can't remember when I last downloaded a Kindle book from ANYONE ELSE that did NOT suffer from ... let's just call it what it is - crappy writing/editing/publishing. Having to mentally correct an author's  use of the English language while reading a supposedly ""finished"" work really offends me and colors my opinion of that author. I give beginning writers a bit of a break, but let's be honest - if you are publishing something for public consumption, it ought to damn well be ready.

"Having almost 5 acres of land, with a good bit planted in flowering shrubs, fruits and seasonal potted plants, we do a fair amount of watering. Due to that, we go through sprayers. Most of the bargain-priced sprayers last a year or two, but inevitably the low price is explainable in the low quality of manufacture and the inevitable failure of the piece.This sprayer feels like it will last a while. Quality materials and a solid, reliable feel. The water control works flawlessly, with no sloppiness between settings. I also really like the front trigger design. It is less fatiguing to my arthritic hands and just feels better than the standard spray nozzle. I expect to get quite a bit of use out of it.The hose hanger was not a deciding point in my purchase, but was a nice extra as I had just bought a number of high-end expandable hoses to use at various locations. It holds 100 feet of expandable hose with no problem. Forget the thermometer though, it is not as accurate as my wild-assed guess about how hot it is outside. It reads about 20 degrees off from actual, and so is pretty much worthless. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if they are all that bad, but it doesn't really matter as I didn't buy the nozzle for that.The extra rubber washer was nice to have thrown in too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UF1WKUZXBPWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH2LGJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3UF1WKUZXBPWB","A2CRUUI6AQMYY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CRUUI6AQMYY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Giving you 5 stars even though the writer/journalist in me wants to gig you for typos and usage errors.First off, #5 of your 10 reasons needed a real editor's help. If you are going to use archaic terms, it is only effective if you are accurate. There is no such thing as ""daring-do,"" the term you are looking for is ""derring-do"" and the term usually implies a wanton carelessness in addition to the primary meaning of adventurous or bold.Also, the glaring error a previous reviewer mentioned, ""your own organ tree"" in the Orange Jelly recipe should be corrected.I have not read through all the recipes yet, but I am sure there are others however, I am not here to be a pain.That being said, this is a terrific guide to the title subject. Small-batch preserves are the only way to go in my opinion and Joe has put together some truly idiot-proof recipes that promise to yield good, consistent results. There is a nice variety and he discusses more than just the recipes to round it out.As a former chef and lifelong maker of homemade jams and jellies, liqueurs, sausages, jerky and other goodies for gifting, I can vouch for this: Joe knows what he is talking about. Several of his recipes are identical to my tried-and-true, reliable ""go-to"" recipes that I have used for decades so I can tell you they are good ones! I especially like the marmalades.I highly recommend this to anyone who is experienced in home preserving and beginners alike.

"My literary life anyway, for sure. But also many facets of my personal life and indeed, my personality. This was a ""turning point"" read for me and changed my literary tastes for the next 30 years easily. I cut my (fiction) teeth on Robert Heinlein's ""juvenile"" books, starting with ""Have Space Suit, Will Travel"" and including pretty much everything he ever wrote without exception and leaned toward authors of Heinlein's calibre - Asimov, Clarke, Bradbury, etc. - for all my recreational reading.But when I was about 13 or 14, I found an old copy of ""Sirens of Titan"" in a used bookstore for a quarter and got just because of the (original) cover. The story though, caught me up and drew me in. I am not going to try to synopsize the story, many here already have very nicely. Suffice it to say, I devoured it. My favorite line from the book is Constant's answer: “I was a victim of a series of accidents. As are we all.”  The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent was also a favorite premise for me.After ""Sirens"" I read everything I could find of Vonnegut (which was again, pretty much everything he ever wrote. ""Cat's Cradle,"" ""Slaughterhouse Five"" and the amazingly good short story collection ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" were all also fantastic, but ""Sirens"" remains to this day the one I re-read at least once a year. And I enjoy it just as much every single time.Do yourself a favor, read it in one weekend ... or one sitting if you are wired that way.If you have a good sense of humor and an appreciation for a well-told story, you will not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GYEO5UG8Y02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XREM5G#wasThisHelpful","R6GYEO5UG8Y02","A2CRUUI6AQMYY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CRUUI6AQMYY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I also received this free in exchange for a review. But my takeaway was slightly better than the previous reviewer.I actually enjoyed the story, despite the weaknesses. Bob was right in that the story seemed to change focus without warning and additionally, some of the main characters were so formulaic as to be slightly detrimental to the story.However, it was an interesting premise at its root. I think with some great editing and a bit of rewriting, it could be a 4-star or better. Taking the Christ-like behavior of the President out would be a big start. Additionally, the cloak-and-dagger behavior of the feds and the inherent implied goodness of the disabled vet are a bit over the top, in my opinion.

"At the current price ($22.04), we're paying roughly 52 cents per bar. These are good for a quick snack, but the 90-100 calories won't leave you feeling like you ate a full meal. I'll describe the taste of each one for you.-------------------------Pastry Crisps, Blueberry:Each package has 2 crisps inside. The outer pastry has a crunchy and slightly doughy texture, like a light Pop-Tart. The pastry is coated in white frosting and the blueberry filling has a consistency like jam. You'll taste more of the pastry than the blueberry filling.-------------------------Pastry Crisps, Strawberry:This also contains 2 crisps per package. The strawberry filling is the same kind of sweet jam texture, but again, you'll taste more of the pastry while eating this.-------------------------Cereal Bars, Red Berries:Each package contains one bar with a chewy granola bar consistency. The top is covered in white frosting, and there are sweet red berry chunks throughout the bar. The bar itself is somewhat sticky, and if there is a lack of icing, it can fall apart pretty quickly after removing it from the package.-------------------------Cereal Bars, Chocolatey Pretzel:This time around, the chocolate coats the bottom of the bar which holds it together better. The chocolate is very tasty, but I found the pretzel had an almost soggy texture which took some getting used to.-----------All in all, if you're looking for breakfast bars which can double as an afternoon snack to buy in bulk, these are a good choice. Out of all of them, the only one I didn't care for was the chocolate pretzel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KHQ01292C8VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SNINH4#wasThisHelpful","R2KHQ01292C8VW","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't used a blender in quite some time, but Black & Decker made it absolutely simple to start blending my own smoothies.This comes with two 20 ounce jars, 2 lids and a ""FusionBlade"".It couldn't be any easier - just load up the jar, screw on the FusionBlade, turn it clockwise in the base unit until you hear a click, press the power button in, and let the blade do the work. The unit has a wide base, and I found it very stable: there was no shaking, no rattling, no base unit moving around on the counter.  Once everything is finished, just unscrew the blade and put on a travel lid, and you're done!Cleanup is simple too. The jars and blade are dishwasher safe. If you put a small amount of dishwashing liquid and some warm water in the jar, you can clean two birds with one stone.One recommendation I would give? Keep the liquids near the ""top"" of the blender when preparing your smoothies. I found the blades need some help when trying to chop frozen foods first.For example: I mixed a cup of ice, 1/2 cup of yogurt, honey, a banana and several frozen strawberries for my smoothie. At first, the blades pureed the strawberries but it formed a layer of frozen goop and the rest of the ingredients couldn't get through. Once I added a small amount of milk, this broke up the layer and the rest slid down into the whirling blade.It comes with a 2 year warranty and the instructions give a basic smoothie recipe.If you're looking for a smoothie / milkshake maker and you don't want to spend the money on a multi-function blender, this is a great alternative.Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJI1J5WOZ5ZVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXTI#wasThisHelpful","RJI1J5WOZ5ZVO","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ Simple setup+ Excellent sound quality+ Long charge lifeCONS:- Not 'truly' wireless for the PS4.-----------------------------------The main things I look for with gaming headsets is ease of setup, headset quality, and clarity of chats during game sessions. I'm glad to report that Turtle Beach's PX4 headset surpassed my expectations in each of these areas.EASE OF SETUP: - I'm the guy who can't plug in a toaster the right way unless I have detailed instructions. Turtle Beach must have known I would be reviewing this headset, because the directions couldn't have been any simpler to follow. They provided screenshots of the setup screens for the PS3, PS4, and multiple versions of the Xbox 360. If I can connect this, anyone can.HEADSET QUALITY:The earpieces were very comfortable, and the mesh kept my ears from feeling sweaty during late night Destiny raids or Netflix marathons. I thought the detachable boom microphone was a great idea, it doesn't get in the way if I don't want to chat.The charging cord for the headset is 13 feet long, which makes it easy to charge the headset whether you're playing a game or watching movies.Speaking of movies, I was recently watching 'Radio Free Albemuth', and there was a segment with low-level music which I didn't hear during a previous viewing without these headphones. And of course, I tested the headphones with movies such as 'Tombstone', 'The Matrix', and 'Watchmen' - all of them sounded excellent with no audio popping or dips in sound quality.The 15 hour headset charge claim held up - I was able to watch 11 episodes of The Blacklist on Netflix and the sound didn't cut out at all.CLARITY OF CHATS:From the get-go, this headset provided me extremely clear chats for all my gaming sessions. I could hear other players without any problems, and they could hear me just fine. No crackling, no cutting out, it was clear as crystal. I could increase or decrease the game volume as well as the microphone volume with a turn of the dials on the right earpiece, or the Talkback cable for my PS4, and it couldn't be simpler. The voice commands for the PS4 come through loud and clear through the microphone.CONS?The only drawback I see to this headset is the need for the PS4 Talkback cable. If you're looking to use chat features or Playstation voice commands, the cable has to be connected to the controller, so this headset isn't completely 'wireless'...but this is a minor point.FINAL THOUGHTS:I feel this is definitely worth the price. It's easy to set up, the sound quality for games and music and movies is superb, and the long charge provides uninterrupted entertainment sessions.If it's within your price range, I highly recommend this headset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OWK33OPI45KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHV0XV0#wasThisHelpful","R1OWK33OPI45KT","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always thought of Robert De Niro as an amazing actor, but after reading this book, I also see him as a smart investor, a thorough researcher, a restaurant buff, and so much more.I was thoroughly excited to read this book - I've watched Goodfellas and Taxi Driver and Casino more times than I could ever possibly count! I wanted to learn more about the man, and read about the movies I've missed over the years. Over the course of 500+ pages, I got to follow along and watch the only child of Robert De Niro (Sr) and Virginia Admiral grow up to become an example of true excellence in American cinema.Shawn Levy's book takes us on a journey with each role for Robert De Niro, on stage or screen, lead role or bit part. Once he agreed to a role, it was completely fascinating to see how much work he put into understanding his character. Robert would learn to speak different languages, conduct interviews, learn how to drive different vehicles, research illnesses to see how they would affect him, he would extensively mark his scripts with copious notes regarding character motivations and emotions, and so on.We've seen Robert willing to change his body structure to fit certain roles - most people think of his body shaping for Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, but if there was only one role I'd pick to prove how serious he took his craft? His choice of Max Cady in Cape Fear: Robert spent $5,000 to make his teeth look unhealthy, and then spent another $20,000 to have them fixed after shooting was completed!From this, it's plain to see Robert didn't just play a role...he BECAME his role. He was also able to keep his ego in check - it was quite common for Robert to suggest removing lines from his roles, rather than requesting to add more. Robert De Niro may be many things, but he is not egotistical.However, he is very, very private. Robert declined to be interviewed for this book (hence making it an unauthorized biography), but the information packed in these pages was gleaned from various archives and correspondence with over 4 dozen people. I applaud the efforts of Shawn Levy - this could not have been an easy task, since Robert De Niro wants to keep his life his life (as his mother would say). We were quite lucky to get a few glimpses into Robert's personal life, his past and present relationships, and his children.Robert De Niro has managed to give the world several decades worth of entertainment through acting, directing, and he's also improved New York and other areas with his real estate deals.There's a long list of movies which Robert De Niro rejected over the years, and they could be debated as either smart box office bomb dodging, or missed opportunities. For example, I can't quite see Robert De Niro eating tiny corn in 'Big'...but I could absolutely see him screaming at Tom Cruise about him not being able to handle the truth in 'A Few Good Men'.If you've ever wondered how method actors do what they do, give this book a read. There's a lot to enjoy, right down to the footnotes.Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H470YWIO6SKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307716783#wasThisHelpful","R3H470YWIO6SKB","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Bausch's novel ""Far As The Eye Can See"" takes us on a journey from 1869 to 1876, following the adventures of a young man by the name of Bobby Hale. He spent a few years as an enlisted man, but he's not looking for war anymore...he's looking to find his destiny out in the Big West.In the beginning of the novel, Bobby Hale was a simple man who made snap decisions - he'd shoot first and not even get around to asking questions later. His lack of understanding the language of American Indians got him into trouble many times, and he'd have to scramble to keep himself from getting killed, by both the Indians and the Army as well. Bobby spent time living in the wilderness learning how to hunt & trap, but he still knew the value of a good night's sleep in a regular bed after a fresh shave and a haircut. His descriptions of food were so detailed, I could practically taste the sowbelly crisping over the fire and smell the black coffee being prepared. He didn't care much for King Lear, though.This novel seemed to perfectly capture the mindset of a simple man from this time period. Death seemed to lurk around every corner, whether it was from the barrel of a gun or the tip of an arrow. The biggest struggle seemed to be maintaining any kind of humanity with the events Bobby witnessed, or took part in.Bobby wasn't portrayed as being completely noble - far from it. His moral compass took a few sharp turns here and there, but on the whole, he would do the necessaries to protect the people he cared about. I grew to like him because of his moments of reflection after some particularly gruesome events - and I enjoyed watching his attitudes change as the book progressed up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn.There's a lot to enjoy in Robert Bausch's tale of Bobby Hale, and if you like stories about the Big West or this time period, I hope you'll give it a look-see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGIRRFIKGMS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620402599#wasThisHelpful","R1BGIRRFIKGMS6","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been chasing this fool all the way to The Loop! I might have let him go, if he didn't threaten my sister. Looks like he's approaching a traffic intersection...let's just use my phone to switch the lights aaaaaaaaand...[collision]...PERFECT. He won't be driving anywhere now.Wait...what? He's trying to escape on foot?!? Not over THAT bridge, he isn't. [Hacks bridge control]. Two hits with my baton ought to send him to dreamland...*thwack* *thwack* Let's see what his cell phone has to say. [hacks it, eyes grow wide with horror]--------------------------------------This it what it feels like to be inside the mind of Aiden Pearce, the protagonist in Watch Dogs. He's got a marvelous little device that can see the digital footprints of everyone's life in the great city of Chicago. Aiden's got vengeance on his mind, and he's got the tools to carry it out.PLOT:The game starts off simply enough, Aiden Pierce has to escape from Wrigley field and avoid getting captured by the police. Once he does, he's on a mission to find the people responsible for killing his niece 11 months ago. After catching his breath in a safe house, Aiden starts following the bread crumb trails throughout the city of Chicago and neighboring Pawnee. No one can hide from him.GAMEPLAY:Watch Dogs is a free-roam game in a 3rd person perspective set in Chicago, which has recently been outfitted with a supercomputer called The ctOS. It's connected to everyone and everything, and hence, so is Aiden Pierce.Using his cell phone called The Profiler, Aiden can change traffic lights, burst steam pipes, hack into vehicles, stop violent crimes from happening, and much, much more. He's able to jump over fences and cars and obstacles using parkour, similar to our friend Ezio from Assassin's Creed. His weapons are numerous, including IED's, grenades, pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, etc.However, Aiden's actions aren't without consequences - if he steals a car, chances are someone will call 911. If he commits too many crimes, He'll be recognized on the street and people will report him, making the game more difficult.Aiden can earn money by hacking unsuspecting people or completing certain tasks. This money can be used to buy outfits, weapons, order vehicles, etc. There's an online component which allows the player to race against other people or even invade someone's game (similar to Demon's Souls), but watch out - the prey can become the predator if they discover what you're doing!If you're the type of person that doesn't like jumping right into the main missions, you can opt to explore Chicago and get swept up in a tidal wave of minigames and side missions.Want to play poker? You can do that.Want to burn rubber in a street race? You can do that.Want to swipe a rocking tune from someone's cell phone on the street? You can do that.Want to track down a serial killer? You can do that.Want to do checkins, similar to FourSquare? You can do that.Want to spy on the darkest secrets of unsuspecting citizens? You can do that.Want to fly around Chicago on bouncy flowers? Yes...you can even do that.I never found myself struggling to find things to do in Watch Dogs, because Ubisoft gave me a game overflowing with secondary activities. I could have spent a solid month without touching the main missions.The game won't let you unlock certain skills until you get far enough in the main missions, and that's the PERFECT bait to get us playing through them.SO WHAT DOES WATCH DOGS MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT?While the game centers mostly on hacking and accumulating wealth to unlock weapons and outfits and side missions, the overall theme (to me, anyway) is about privacy, and its confusing nature. People want privacy, yet they freely give information to social networks and GPS tracking systems. With the press of a button, Aiden Pierce can learn your worst habit. He'll know if you do searches for the word ""bondage"". He'll know if you purchased used underwear online. He'll know if you're making 80,000 per year, or living off your disability checks. He'll know if you're recovering from cancer, or collecting comic books.It's Setec Astronomy all over again, but the little black box is now called The Profiler.There's also an exploration of the dark side of voyeurism. This was covered in the movie Sliver, but Watch Dogs takes it out of the apartment building and gives it a citywide scale. We can watch anyone we want, and some of those things are very unsettling.TROPHIES:There are 40 trophies to earn in Watch Dogs. The largest chunk of them are dedicated to the Collectibles missions, such as finding all the Songsneak tunes, hacking all the ctOS towers, checking in to all 100 City Hotspots, and so on.The rest are split between the Main missions, Side missions, Investigations, Minigames, and Online contracts.Some of the more frustrating missions are the QR Codes - these are similar to the Riddler challenges in Batman: Arkham City, where you have to line up the picture just right.However, I feel the ""Social Lubricant"" trophy is the hardest one to earn. If you're a trophy junkie, this one is best saved until you've completed everything else in the game.GLITCH REPORT:Playing with Version 1.02 -The glitches I came across during my month of gameplay were very few and far between:The first was my first jump off a building on Spider Tank, I landed but somehow couldn't move. After I was killed, the glitch never happened again.The second was during an attempted hack. I was on foot, and my target was in a boat speeding away. The game gave me the option to fast travel. I chose to do this, and I appeared in the middle of the city...in a speedboat...hovering over the concrete.The third one happened on my way to a mission - I jumped over a fence and the game froze, I had to reboot the game. It didn't happen again after that.The last glitch happened after losing a drinking game with a character. The whole screen went black so I had to reboot. This glitch hasn't happened again.Four glitches in a month's worth of gameplay? That's not bad at all.WHAT WOULD I HAVE IMPROVED?There is so much already in Watch Dogs, it's hard to think of things to add. Since I'm a sucker for multiple endings, I wish Ubisoft could have added a couple which depended on Aiden's reputation status, because this would increase the replay value of the game.However, I could think of one item to remove...the ""Focus"" ability, which was nearly useless. I only used it once, because it was automatically triggered during a mission. Watch Dogs didn't need ""Bullet Time"" - it already has its place in the Max Payne series.Oh, and I hated the drinking games. Quick Time Events are annoying enough, but playing them with sluggish controls to simulate being drunk is an exercise in frustration.FINAL VERDICT?I would have happily spent the standard new game price ($60) to purchase Watch Dogs. It's extremely rich in content, allowing players to get lost in side missions for days at a time. Once players dive into the main story, it's engaging enough so it doesn't feel tacked on. Even the ancillary characters are likeable, and that's rare to pull off in a video game. Lots of detail went into this game, right down to the hotspot checkins - you can discover facts about Chicago's past you might never have known before.If you're looking for a sandbox game and you feel Grand Theft Auto might be a little too overwhelming, give Watch Dogs a try. It's by the same company that gave us Splinter Cell and the Assassin's Creed series, so they know how to write a solid story and give us a protagonist to cheer for.Just don't be surprised if you look suspiciously at people on their cell phones after a few weeks of playing. ;-)Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQF8D4ELFWX8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGHUS58#wasThisHelpful","RQF8D4ELFWX8W","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As several others have mentioned, I had difficulty getting this drive to work. This device ships without the charging cable, and according to other reviewers, the charging cable is required to get the Firmware update to work.I've had to contact customer service twice, so far.The first time: I called on Thursday, July 24th and the person I spoke with, Jacob, was very helpful. I didn't have the serial number with me, so he gave me his personal email address to send him my information. I did this after I got home, and he replied within one minute with a UPS tracking code. The adapter arrived by Monday.--------The second time: I called on Monday, July 28th. The person I spoke with was named Joseph. I advised I was still having problems getting the unit working. He took my phone # and advised me I would receive a callback within 5 minutes for a technician familiar with this issue. After waiting 35 minutes, I called back and hit their after hours message, which states they are only available from 7am to 5pm Pacific Standard Time.The techs seem friendly and they want to help, I'm hoping to get further assistance soon...updates to follow.--------The third time: As of July 29th, I'm happy to report that my review has been upgraded to a solid 4 out of 5.I got an email from Bill Rathbone, the senior product line manager. He set up a time to talk with me after work and walked me through updating the drive and linking it to my HTC One phone. His knowledge was vast, and he was able to help this old man through resetting the drive, updating the firmware, and even advised me to check out the forums on the Corsair website.Clearly, this product is a labor of love for him...and it shows.After successfully linking up, I was able to download my iTunes library onto the drive and I have plans to back up my video and photo files as well. Dragging and dropping the files into the drive? Easy as pie.If I was grading this product on customer service _alone_, it would get a solid 5 out of 5 because the representatives were always helpful, professional and pleasant.As it stands, the drive is great but the lack of the charging cable and the initial stumbling I had with the app setup dropped it down one star.Don't give up if you can't get it to work on your own...call 888-222-4346 and go directly to tech support, they're consummate professionals!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95P45A3H6MCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKKOAAG#wasThisHelpful","R95P45A3H6MCP","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read several books by Philip K. Dick, I was looking for another one to sink my teeth into. I asked one of my coworkers which one I should try next, and this was his response:""I really like his work, but all his robots and futuristic tech terminology can get overwhelming after a while. I think you'd like 'Confessions of a Crap Artist' because it's based in contemporary time [1958]. It's regular fiction, not science fiction - but it's just as dark and disturbing as one of his apocalyptic future stories. Check it out.""With that, I ordered a copy and dug into it during a recent vacation.We start off meeting Jack Isidore - He's the primary source of information for the events we're about to witness. Throughout his life, Jack has collected various items relating to science and science fiction. He's the square peg that doesn't fit into a round hole. He's been called many things: A nut. A screw-up. And most recently, a Crap Artist.Fay Hume is Jack's sister. When she sets her sights on something, nothing can change her mind. She has a unique gift/curse of having long term plans but makes most of her decisions in the present for her immediate enjoyment. She's overly concerned with her societal image, and knows how to manipulate people into getting what she wants, whether it's a new car or a nice house in the suburbs.Charley Hume - He runs the local iron works, and is married to Fay. He built an expensive house in the suburbs for them to live in. He's prone to fits of rage when asked to do anything he feels is beneath his dignity. He medicates his anger with trips to the local tavern.Fay and Charley decide to take Jack into their home - and for a time, it seemed to work. Jack takes the housework responsibilities that Fay doesn't want to do, and Charley thinks are beneath him. Jack cares for their children [Elsie and Bonnie] and convinces himself that he's providing valuable services to the family in exchange for well-cooked steaks, and a roof over his head.However, Jack begins to notice that his sister's idyllic family life is anything but. He starts to document everything and watches their lives spiral out of control while he cares for the children, tends to the animals and makes breakfast for everyone.This is a fascinating story which is told to us through the viewpoints of Jack, Fay, Charley and Fay's lover, Nathan Anteil. The format is easy to get used to, each chapter is dedicated to one person's viewpoint and we learn more about each person through their interactions. I ended up finishing this book in two days, and enjoyed it thoroughly. In a strange way, it felt like I took a break from reading PKD because this was such a departure from his usual writing style. I wish he had written more novels like this.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18118UG41ML1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572492#wasThisHelpful","R18118UG41ML1K","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit, I reacted like many people when I first heard about this game: ""Minecraft? Isn't that the game where you build things with blocks? Where's the fun in that?""When I decided to play it and review it, I was amazed at the reactions I received - not from my friends, but from their children! They couldn't WAIT to tell me their stories about fishing and building minecart tracks and fighting Creepers with diamond swords and battling the Enderdragon...I hadn't even played Minecraft yet, but they were all excited for me to start!GAMEPLAY:Minecraft is an open world game where you create your own gameplay experience. Initially, it looks very simple - you play as an adventurer in a block-style format, and you need to gather items and mine for rare ores to craft items for your adventurer to survive. There isn't much of a story to speak of, and while there is a ""boss battle"", you don't have to fight it if you don't want to. During the day, you can see animals and interact with them - horses, sheep, cows, pigs, wolves, and many more. You can dig and uncover rare ores to fashion new weapons, armor, tools and construction materials.However, when nighttime rolls in, you need to beware: there are several creatures which hunt you down - spiders, zombies, skeletons which shoot arrows, and even the dreaded Creeper - a monster which explodes if you linger too closely!You can play in a peaceful style where no monsters chase you and you aren't in any danger, but this limits your gameplay experience. I decided to play in survival mode, to get the full effect of the game.WHAT WAS IT LIKE, PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME?I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed, but the tutorial mode was extremely easy to follow. It showed me step by step how to get wood from a nearby tree and do some basic crafting. Once this was done, I gathered more materials and put a crafting table together. I fashioned a crude pickaxe for mining and made a wooden sword to protect myself from invaders. With my confidence raised, I created a new world and found a nice stretch of land where I decided to make camp.I thought I was so smart, building a fence to keep out intruders, only to discover I forgot to make a fence gate! I couldn't jump over the fence, so I had to dig under it like Charles Bronson in The Great Escape...which brought a lot of laughs to my child. While I played, she told me about all the dangers I would be facing. I asked how she knew all of this (since she'd never played before), and she answered with a chuckle: ""Come on dad, EVERYONE knows about Minecraft!""TROPHIES:There are 29 trophies to earn in Minecraft, most of which are creation based. You'll get a few right off the bat by creating various tools and weapons, but some of them (such as killing the Enderdragon or riding for 500 meters in a minecart) will take considerable time and effort to earn.In all honesty, this is probably the first time I've played a PS3 game where I haven't been concerned about earning all the trophies as quickly as possible - and I'm one of the biggest PS3 trophy junkies you will ever meet. My enjoyment of Minecraft comes from creating the best game experience for me...whether it's building a house, fighting a skeleton, crafting new armor, cultivating crops, or finding some of those rare jukebox records!SO...HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?Well, I've come a long way since my first Minecraft session. I've made a well-fortified house with stone walls (zombie proof), a crafting table in one corner and a furnace in the other. On the opposite side I've put three large storage chests, stocked to the brim with various items in case I meet an untimely death from any monsters that roam the wilderness. I have torches which hang on the opposite wall from my bed, so I can drift off to sleep peacefully.While I play, I have the choice of listening to the Minecraft music (which is quite soothing), or I can play any music I've saved to my PS3. I can fish while listening to ""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay"", tend my crops while playing Pink Floyd's ""Learning to Fly"", dig for rare ores to the tune of ""Canary in a Coal Mine""...the options are pretty much limitless.Even when I'm not playing Minecraft, I'm thinking about Minecraft. I think about mining for rare ores and creating new structures. I think about finding a new area and setting up a house before the night sets in. Even now, while writing this review, I'm thinking about finding the next secret Minecraft has waiting for me.But most of all? I'm thinking about my nephew's face lighting up like a Christmas tree when I tell him about my first steps into this world of limitless creation. He's quite the fan, having made a Pinewood Derby race car modeled after a Creeper, and his last birthday party was Minecraft themed.I've become ""The uncle who plays Minecraft"" - this allows my nephew and I to have fun discussions which weren't possible before I jumped into this game.FINAL THOUGHTS?If you like your video games with scripted starts and finishes, plenty of action or lots of shooting, Minecraft might not be for you. However, if you're looking for a fun game to play by yourself or with family members which encourages creativity and imagination, Minecraft is definitely the way to go.Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LQC6M9AVXAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQHU9RC#wasThisHelpful","R4LQC6M9AVXAY","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very few books pique my interest with just a dust jacket description. However, the one for The Frozen Dead pulled me right in. It promised a tale of revenge and madness, and it delivered on both these points, and many more.In the beginning, the story felt a little disjointed. The brutal murder of a horse? A new job at an institute for the criminally insane? What could this mean, and how would it all be connected? When one question was answered, five more sprang up in its place. The good thing is, the story was able to develop at a steady place and it was able to hold my interest for hours at a time. I couldn't put this book down because I wanted to reach the next revelation, the next clue, the next piece of evidence...I'll give my impressions of the two main characters:Martin Servaz was a captivating character for me because he wasn't a supercop. He had fears as well as flaws, he'd quote Latin in one moment and forget his gun the next. He'd scour over a crime scene, then he'd think things through and come back when he got a fresh idea. As he figured out what was happening and how all the pieces connected, it became clear to us (the readers) without feeling contrived or forced.It was a treat to watch Diane Berg grow as a character during her brief time in the Institute. She was eager to impress at her new job, working with dangerous patients in Unit A, interviewing a brilliant but deranged sociopath...this drew parallels to the relationship we saw between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. I felt Diane's character didn't get as much growth as Martin Servaz's did, and I wish she could have shared the limelight a little more.I can't remember a time when I ate up a murder mystery novel as voraciously as this one. I read over 325 pages in one day. The characters were likeable, the story was intense, I could almost see the sweat dripping off people's foreheads as they faced their most terrifying fears. Bernard Minier has a gift (curse?) for unsettling descriptions - there were more than a few scenes which made me cringe after I read them.There's a lot to love in this story - secrets, betrayal, murder, revenge, and more. If you like your murder mysteries to keep you guessing with lots of plot twists, you'll be happy with The Frozen Dead.I wouldn't be surprised if this book gets optioned into a movie within a few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N61EI1XEFLLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250045533#wasThisHelpful","R1N61EI1XEFLLU","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:- Interesting premise- Wide range of powerupsCONS:- No checkpoints (except boss battles)- Awful password system- Low replay valueAs of 2014, this game is officially old enough to drink, and you'll probably want to after playing it for a while.The first 20 pages of the instruction book tells a very convoluted tale set in a futuristic world. The game starts with you being miniaturized and injected into Tiron Korsby, the president of Cybertech Corporation. Microscopic invaders have been injected into his body from a rival corporation known as Axiom - your goal is to reach Korsby's brain and destroy the Axiom invaders you encounter along the way.There are 5 levels to travel through - according to the instruction book, they are The Cephalic Vein, the Left Lung, The Superior Vena Cava, The Carotid Artery and The Brain. Strangely, when playing, one of the levels is renamed to ""The Femur""...???From the onset, you'll learn how aggravating this game can be. Your ship has an infinite number of standard shots, and if you kill certain enemies, you gain powerups such as double shots, triple shots, flamethrower shots, etc. However, these powerups don't last very long. When you shoot, your weapons fly directly in front of your ship - the sound of your gun firing is louder than the noise of you hitting an enemy, so it's difficult to know if you're doing any damage at all. If you die before reaching a boss battle, you have to start the level from the beginning.All enemies move in a predictable pattern - as you play levels over and over (which you will, since you'll die a lot before reaching the bosses), it eventually becomes easier to predict their movements and avoid their fire.The most frustrating level is the 3rd, where you have to destroy a ship heading for Korsby's heart on a suicide mission. If you fail to destroy the craft before a certain point, it flies into his heart and kills him, ending the game. The ship flies all around the screen and rarely stays still for very long. The only way to defeat this enemy is to predict the ship's movements by playing this level over and over again.The password feature is infuriating. If you lose all your lives, you are taken to a password screen which presents 4 rotating symbols. The screen with those symbols lasts for roughly 30 seconds and then the code vanishes.**Thankfully, if you start the game again and select the ""Password"" option, the most recent code will be input for you.**While the graphics/music and boss battles for this game were impressive on the Amiga, a lot was lost in translation to the Sega CD. The grainy FMV footage is hard to see, the music has clearly been downgraded, and the boss battles are slow and predictable. Once you defeat the final boss, you'll be treated to one of the most boring endings to a video game since ""Total Recall"" for the NES. There's little to no replay value with this one.This game appealed to me because it took a lot of memorization to defeat and it's fairly rare - but for some gamers, rare doesn't always mean good.If you're an old-school gamer looking for an enjoyable shoot-em-up for the Sega CD, I'd personally recommend Sol-Feace - it's similar to the R-Type games and it'll provide a lot more enjoyment than Microcosm.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQ0D2MPBVDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KJDE9A#wasThisHelpful","RFQ0D2MPBVDF","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a Gatorade fan since my youth (which is a Pepsi product), but recently our family has been bringing home Powerade drinks from its competitor, Coke. I decided to give this Mountain Berry Blast a try through Amazon's Vine program.I found this drink was slightly sweet and the berry taste was pleasant - it didn't taste overly sugary, and it didn't leave a bitter aftertaste. It tastes ok at room temperature, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes better when chilled.I was a little put off by the amount of calories (130) and sodium (250 mg) in a single 8 oz bottle. If you're watching your salt intake, try Powerade Zero because it comes in a 12 oz bottle and only has 150mg of sodium, with zero calories.FINAL VERDICT?I enjoyed this drink after a run or a long walk, it hits the spot and tastes very refreshing.

"Being a video gamer for over 3 decades, I knew I had to have this ice tray the second I saw it.It's simple to use, and the silicone keeps the pieces from cracking when you remove them. I've chilled many a drink with these, and plan to use it many more times. I recommend removing the square cube first, it makes removal of the other cubes much simpler.**I've uploaded some pictures in the ""Customer Images"" section for you to look at.**My only complaint? It's too small. This tray is about the size of a CD case and it only makes 9 ice cubes, which disappear pretty quickly if you have more than 4 people over for your retro gaming parties.If another variation came out which could yield 15-20 cubes, I would happily shell out more $ for that.Don't be surprised if you find yourself arranging the cubes in your drink. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369LA7SNYYN5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NZHFPM#wasThisHelpful","R369LA7SNYYN5C","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a 24-pack of GURU through Amazon's Vine program, and I wanted to see how this ""Natural Energy"" drink worked on me.The smell and the taste of this drink is completely unique. The best description of the smell I can provide is...it smells like ""watermelon tea"". As far as the taste goes, it's harder to describe. It has a slightly sweet tang, which disappears rather quickly. There's a nice little carbonated kick which tricks my brain into thinking I'm having a soda, but without the usual overload on sodium.Keep an eye on the carbs, though - you get 25g per drink and 25g of sugars. This contributes to the 100 calories per can.I like the slim can design - 3.6 less ounces than a standard soda, and I never found the need to gulp down my drink.I had these over the course of a month and drank one in the afternoon around 3pm. It gave me just enough energy to keep my eyes open at the office, and they didn't make my heart trip-hammer or disturb my sleep schedule hours later.If you're looking for a powerful burst of energy, there are plenty of drinks out there which will give you what you need, such as 5 Hour Energy Bottles - but if you just need a push to start your morning or finish out your workday, GURU will get the job done for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHM4XLJS7XPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CFT76G#wasThisHelpful","R3MHM4XLJS7XPG","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had to eat a strawberry (or 3) to cleanse the taste from my mouth.There are several health benefits to eating dark chocolate (such as decreased blood pressure, lower risk of cardiovascular disease, etc), but for me, this came down to a matter of taste.While the initial taste of the chocolate is slightly bitter and very rich, the waxy aftertaste will keep me from coming back.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YX1REQLAIKY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPGL6S4#wasThisHelpful","R1YX1REQLAIKY7","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Changing light bulbs is one of those home maintenance tasks I can do without. We've been replacing our fixtures with longer lasting bulbs, and I decided to review this through Amazon's Vine program.There was a noticeable difference in brightness in our kitchen hallway when I replaced this bulb - the frosted cover gives the light a warm glow without being overpowering.Our previous one was a Satco S3870 130V 60 Watt A15 Medium Base Light Bulb, Clear which lasted about 5 years.

"+ PROS:+ An enjoyable 'gritty reboot' of the Tomb Raider series+ Borrows gameplay elements from Batman: Arkham Asylum and the Uncharted games+ Upgradable skills and weapons for the main game and multiplayer mode- CONS:- Tomb puzzles are almost too easy- Several missable trophies which can require another playthrough- Multiplayer mode is unbalancedPLOT:Our introduction to Lara Croft isn't the battle-hardened Lara we've come to accept over the years - this is an origin story. It's her first journey, on the ship Endurance. Ignoring the advice of her companions, The Endurance heads into the Dragon's Triangle. The ship is pulled apart by a violent storm leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated from the others and wakes up in a room filled with human remains, but manages to escape while a cave collapses around her. As Lara emerges on the side of a cliff, she sees the skeletal remains of ships on the shore below.She's wounded, tired, and alone...and her adventure is just beginning.GAMEPLAY:As with other games in the old series, Tomb Raider is presented as a 3rd person adventure game, with some stealth elements. When we first start out, we have no weapons, no special skills, and no tutorial level to practice jumping in Lara's mansion, as we had in the 1996 version. No, we're put right into the action here. We have to learn how to hunt, find weapons, and scavenge for upgrades.Lara can upgrade 9 different survival skills, 8 hunter skills, and 7 brawler skills. Throughout the island, there are hidden tombs which hold treasure maps, and other goodies.Some areas are inaccessible until we unlock certain upgrades (such as the shotgun for blasting through obstacle blockades, or the rope arrow to access certain areas).In combat, we can either use long range weapons such as a bow or a shotgun, or we can get up close and personal with a pickaxe or a well-placed arrow to the knee. There are some Quick Time Events during battles which allow Lara to perform finishing moves, or special attacks to weaken her opponents.The Quick Time Events also happen during cutscene transitions - so Lara might have to dodge a tree limb, avoid falling over a cliff, or punch someone with a well-timed press of a button.  No rest for the weary.Lara also has an ability called Survival Instinct - with the push of the L2 button, Lara can perceive nearby animals, hostiles, and even collectible items.This is the first game in the Tomb Raider universe which offers a multiplayer mode. There are three campaigns:(1) Team Deathmatch, a player-versus-player combat mode which lasts up to three separate matches.(2) Private Rescue, where the survivors have to take medical supplies to a specific area, and the scavengers need to reach a certain number of kills, all within 10 minutes.(3) Cry for Help, where the survivors search around and retrieve batteries for defended radio beacons while being hunted by the scavengers.TROPHIES:There are 51 trophies to earn in this game. Most of them revolve around collecting items like GPS caches, upgrading all your skills & weapons, finding all the hidden tombs, hunting certain animals and using specific weapons to rack up kills.**NOTE: If you're a trophy collector, 3 of them are missable in this game, so be sure to look up the requirements before you start playing!**15 of the trophies can only be earned in multiplayer mode. They run the spectrum from killing two people with one explosion, to reviving a teammate, to buying all upgrades & character models.PROS:I wasn't sure what to expect with a 'gritty reboot' of the Tomb Raider series, but I was very pleased with the result. I was able to identify with this character much easier than her 1996 counterpart. In that game, Lara was shooting bats and bears with her two-handed pistols (and their infinite ammunition) before 10 minutes had passed. Here, I didn't even start with a knife!This game uses the same dynamic as Batman: Arkham Asylum. When you first start out, you're not the battle-hardened Lara - she's scared, and she's inexperienced. I got killed more times than I care to admit. But while the game progressed and Lara became more accustomed to using her skills, I found myself becoming a more skilled combatant, which lead to me enjoying the story all the more.In the Uncharted series, we've been able to see all our collectible treasures in a separate window, and Tomb Raider also lets us do this. We can rotate the items or reread documents at our leisure, just like Drake. The folks at Crystal Dynamics clearly saw what worked for the games by Rocksteady Studios and Naughty Dog, Inc., and brought those elements together for an enjoyable Tomb Raider experience.I liked the upgrade system here. You have to gather experience by either hunting, exploring or combat. You can also use salvageable materials to fashion better weapons. I upgraded my survivor skills first to live off the land and gain experience faster, but there are excellent benefits to becoming a more efficient hunter or brawler.CONS:Firstly, I didn't find the tomb puzzles very complicated. Many of them require the player to pay attention to elements like timing or weight-distribution. A seasoned Tomb-Raider player from the 90s might find them overly simple, but for a person that's never played any of the previous games, these puzzles will present a few challenges. However, once you solve one, the others are very similar.Next, the trophies. A few of the trophies can only be earned during the single-player story. Because this game auto-saves, if you complete the game and miss your opportunity, you'll have to start the game all over again. There are three confirmed missable trophies, but thankfully, there's more than enough guides online to walk you through getting them. If you're not a trophy hunter, this isn't too big of a problem.Finally, the multiplayer mode. In my experience, this mode was horribly unbalanced. The first few times I played, I was matched up with opponents anywhere from level 31 to level 60, while I was a lowly level 1. My enemies had perfected their skills of jump-shotting around corners and under bridges, and could take out enemies on a rope slide with one arrow.But me? I was having trouble figuring out basic elements like swapping between my rifle and my grenades!As I slowly improved, I found that 95% of my quick joins to multiplayer put me into Team Deathmatch, which seems to get the most traffic. It's hard to get a bead on someone when they're jumping around like Peter Cottontail, and when you're a low-level player, this means your weapons will have a slow reload time...so you'll be used as target practice for the more experienced players.THE GLITCH REPORT:Thankfully, my game experience had very few glitches.In one sequence, Lara had to fix an elevator. When I fixed it, I couldn't get inside the elevator without instantly dying for no apparent reason.My next glitch came in the Summit Forest, Lara's Survival Instinct stopped working and I had to reboot the game to fix it...going back to the main menu didn't correct the issue.The last glitch was at Shipwreck Beach...everything was in slow-motion when I arrived. I had to reboot the game and thankfully this didn't happen again.FINAL VERDICT:I thoroughly enjoyed this gritty reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. The main story was pretty linear, but there was more than enough backtracking to pick up missing objects and optional challenges to give it an open-ended feel. The combat was easy to adapt to, the music was epic, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking.I didn't care for the multiplayer modes, but I would highly recommend this to adventure gamers, especially folks who like the Uncharted series.Rated M for blood & gore, intense violence and strong language. Several of the death scenes are very graphic in nature - parental discretion is definitely advised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MLKVP11DNAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FS8LYK#wasThisHelpful","R37MLKVP11DNAE","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can remember seeing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre at a friend's house on VHS when I was 22. I didn't remember much, but I remembered it scared the [redacted] out of me, and then some. I've seen many horror movies since then, but none of them tapped into pure fear the way this one did, and I wasn't sure why.When Gunnar Hansen's book became available to review through Amazon's Vine Voice program, I jumped at the chance to read and review it.Why? Because I wanted to know how this movie was made, from start to finish. I wanted to read stories of what happened behind the scenes. Most of all, I wanted to know what it was like for Gunnar Hansen to be a part of a movie that continues to entertain horror fans and draw crowds at conventions, decades after its release.The novel starts out with Gunnar Hansen dispelling a lot of the rumors right off the bat. He then proceeds to go through each scene in the film, from start to finish. He talks about his audition, getting his boots fitted with 3-inch heels, and how he could barely see out of his Leatherface mask. This led to a few mishaps on set, such as slamming his head into a door jamb and knocking himself silly, falling in the woods with his chainsaw still running, being driven to near insanity while filming scenes in 100+ degree Texas weather, and much more.Gunnar's writing style was very easy to follow. While he writes his memories of a scene, he intersperses stories about what happened before, during, and after those scenes. I got more than a few chuckles as he recalled the acres of marijuana growing behind the house, I was terrified as he described cutting into a table near an actor's head with a real chain saw, and I felt my skin crawl as I read about the scene with Sally's blood at the dinner table.As I read on, I started to remember why this movie scared me so much...it felt a little too real. When I watched it, I felt like it was a documentary or a snuff film, as if the wall between fiction and reality had been shattered. The way Gunnar tells it, this is what happened to the actors while the film was being made!Since TCSM was a non-union film with a low production budget, some stunts were improvised (like the gunpowder in the truck), most of the actors did their own stunts, and Gunnar had no stand-in as Leatherface. These facts make the movie all the more horrifying. It's truly amazing that no one was hurt or killed during the making of Chain Saw - In Gunnar's words, ""It was pure luck-dumb, idiotic, inbred-toothless-country-boy-banjo-twangin' beginner's luck.""So after roughly 164 pages (16 of which were excellent photographs), Gunnar wraps up his recollections on set. He then proceeds to go into post production stories, the new opening graveyard scene, waiting for his first check (which was a FAR CRY from his expectations), the reception of the film, the lawsuits that followed, and he even got to flex his literary muscles by talking about horror vs. terror, Gothic tales, and more.All in all, Chain Saw Confidental was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I kid you not, the night I finished reading Gunnar's book, this was my next Amazon purchase: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre [Blu-ray].And yes, it still scares the [redacted] out of me.Texas Chain Saw Massacre fans, rejoice! This is the book you've been waiting for. The rumors are squashed, the realism exposed, and the W.E.

"PROS:+ Only takes 3 hours to charge, as opposed to Sony's 6 hours+ A great low-cost alternative to the Sony PS3 headset+ Clear sound receiving and sending+ Comfortable fit, adjustable  ear hook and microphone placementCONS:- It's only fitted for the right ear- You have to use the charge cable with this product, PS3 cords won't work- Mute does not show on the PlayStation 3 screen------------------------------------------------Gioteck seems to have done their homework and improved on their previous EX-01 and EX-02 headsets. When I game online, I want to make sure that other players can hear me, I can hear them, and I can mute without too much hassle. The EX-03 meets each of my requirements.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I was irritated by the small font in the instruction book, but that's a minor gripe.Pairing was a little cumbersome, I had to scan my headset to register it as a Bluetooth device, whereas my Sony PS3 headset was recognized by connecting it with a USB cable.PROS:I was happy to see it only took 3 hours to get a full charge on the EX-03 headset, my old Sony PS3 headset took 6 hours to fully charge.There were 3 earbuds included, and I used the smallest one. The earbud focused the sound inside my ear and was very soft, which was a vast improvement over my Sony PS3 earpiece.When I played Little Big Planet 1 and 2 and Splinter Cell: Blacklist, all the other players could hear me without any problems, and I could hear them loud and clear.The ear hook and microphone extension were easy to adjust to my comfort level, and even after a 2 hour stretch of gaming, this headset didn't cut into my ear or feel heavy with prolonged use. The volume up and down buttons were easy to use.CONS:The Gioteck EX-03 headset is only fitted for the right ear, so the lefties are out of luck on this one. It even says in the instruction manual ""Unfortunately this is not possible."" Truth be told, I rarely use my left ear for headset usage, but The Sony PS3 headset gave me the option to switch if I wanted to.Don't throw away the box thinking you can use your Sony cables to charge this headset - you have to use the charging cable that comes with it, nothing else works.When I put my headset on mute, there wasn't any visual indication on my PS3 screen (which does show up for the Sony PS3 headset) - instead, I would hear two descending tones about 4 seconds apart. If I wanted to turn my mic back on, I had to press the power button and I'd hear two ascending tones to indicate it was back on.MY VERDICT:On the whole, this is a very crisp and clear headset and does exactly what I want...allows me to hear and be heard without any discomfort. If that's what you want from a gaming headset (and you don't want to spend the extra $ for a Sony PS3 headset), then this one will get the job done.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZU8SS96D00O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LN5UOC#wasThisHelpful","R3GZU8SS96D00O","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a simple guy when it comes to popcorn - I want it to taste buttery and not too salty, and I don't want kernel shards sticking to the roof of my mouth.

"+ PROS:+ Colorful levels jam packed with platforming gameplay and humor+ Hilarious fun for one or more players+ Unlockable levels, heroes, creatures and challenges- CONS:- Some levels/gameplay can be frustrating for younger gamersPLOT:Rayman (our cute little hero with no arms, legs or neck!) has been asleep for 100 years, along with his friend Globox and the Teensies. While they were sleeping, the Bubble Dreamer's nightmares got more powerful, and so did the magician (from Rayman Origins). Rayman and friends are woken up by Murfy who tells them about the Teensies and the 10 princesses getting captured by the nightmares and the 5 dark Teensies.  From here, Rayman and friends set out to defeat their foes and rescue their friends.GAMEPLAY:Rayman Legends combines elements of platform gaming and ""endless running"" platform gaming. Rayman can jump, use his ears as a helicopter to slow his falls, wind up and deliver a big punch/kick to his enemies, and even throw fireballs on some levels. There are several checkpoints within each level, so if you perish before reaching the end, you keep all the Lums and Teensies you collected...a sigh of relief to all the old-school platforming gamers.The goal of each level is for Rayman to rescue as many Teensies as possible, while also collecting Lums. Some of the Teensies are in plain sight, but you'll have to search around to find them all. At the end of each level, you receive a reward based on how many Lums you collected, and how many Teensies you saved. You can also earn scratch tickets, which give you a random reward such as 1000 extra Lums, a Teensie, a creature for your collection, or new Rayman Origins levels.The levels are either standard platforms, where you have to search around for the King and Queen Teensies and their 8 children, or there are shorter levels where you only have to gather 3 Teensies. Some of the levels allow you to take a relaxed pace, while others have a creeping wall of fire or rapidly sinking quicksand which require you to run as fast as you can to reach your goal. You'll also have Murfy show up from time to time to lend a hand with cutting ropes, moving objects, and even tickling enemies!Eventually you can unlock ""Invaded"" levels, where you have to rescue 3 Teensies as fast as you can, trying to reach the goal in under 40 seconds.There's a growing trend in Ubisoft games to have daily/weekly goal rewards for playing their games. We saw this in Splinter Cell: Blacklist (a decidedly different game), and it's also present in Rayman Legends. You can participate in daily and weekly game challenges. Instead of earning money to purchase weapon upgrades, we earn Lums to unlock new levels, new heroes, new creatures, and more.It's a fun little dynamic that keeps me playing each day to get my daily reward of Lums...after all, the last hero costs 1 million Lums to unlock, and every little bit helps!My descriptions may sound a little daunting, but I feel anyone who picks up a controller will fall in love with this quirky little character. Old school platform gamers (like me) and new school gamers will find challenges throughout each level.TROPHIES:It's an interesting mix of trophies for Rayman. If you just want to finish the game and defeat each boss, you'll end up earning about 15 to 20 trophies. However, there are roughly 30 more trophies to earn which will push your gaming skills to the limit. There's a trophy for collecting all 700 Teensies, collecting 1 million Lums, unlocking all 10 princesses, earning all the bronze/silver/gold cups, and even a few that require defeating your friends in some online challenges.PROS:I love the vibrancy of each and every single level in this game. Even if I'm getting killed by monsters, I find myself saying ""Aww, they're so darn CUTE!"" As soon as I picked one level to become my favorite, it wasn't long before another one took its place. I found myself laughing out loud at the pop culture references in Rayman Legends, such as:- The ""goodbye"" scene from Terminator 2- The ""laser field dance"" from Ocean's 12In all honesty, every boss level was hilarious. Each one is set to a musical number. If you know the song, it'll be that much simpler. From a castle onslaught to the tune of ""Black Betty"", to a Mariachi version of ""Eye of the Tiger"", to an underwater excursion to the tunes of ""Woo-Hoo"", I found myself dropping the controller during these levels because I was laughing so hard!My child loved going through the levels in two-player mode because if one of us screwed up, the other one just had to ""pop the bubble"" and we'd be back in the game. It really showed the benefits of teamwork.Collectibles? There are SO MANY in this game. Teensies, Lums, Scratch Tickets, Heroes, levels of Rayman Origins, Creatures...everything I find seems to unlock something else. It's the game that keeps on giving!CONS:I'll preface my ""con"" by saying this: Rayman Legends does a fantastic job introducing players to the gameplay. It's relatively simple to learn how to make Rayman jump and use his helicopter ears, and any good platform game requires its players to be able to judge distance and speed. You'll spend most of the game getting used to this, and might be lulled into a sense of the game being too easy.With that being said...By the time you reach the Olympus Maximus levels, you'll be hit with a few frustrating old-school platforming tricks, such as the infamous ""Up is down, right is left"" sections. You'll have to navigate screens with flipped screens, which are mercifully short, but take a while to navigate.The really fun/frustrating ones are the bonus ""Living Dead Party"" levels. These are the previous boss levels with the music converted to an 8-bit format, and so is the gameplay. This means the screen will fade in and out, pixilation will swell and shrink, and there are no checkpoints...you have to do the entire level in one perfect run.Old school gamers are used to ""flawless run"" requirements, but younger gamers might get frustrated after playing through most of the previous levels with checkpoints.WHAT WOULD I HAVE IMPROVED?The designers did such a great job with this game, I can't think of anything else I would have added. It's all here: personal accomplishments in single-player mode, help from family & friends with 1-4 player mode, online challenges, world rankings, it's all designed to strengthen our bond with Rayman, and I wouldn't change a thing.FINAL VERDICT:There's so much to enjoy here. Saving Teensies is especially fun, and the Lums accumulate as you get better and better and unlock more levels to explore and more heroes to battle evil with. There's a certain kind of joy that comes with hearing all the saved Teensies talking and laughing as you pass them by.I would definitely recommend this game for old school platform fans of games like Super Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog, and I also feel it's a great way to introduce younger gamers to the platform genre.

"It's clear that a lot of time and effort went into making ""World War II in Numbers"". Almost every type of graph imaginable can be found within its pages about troop numbers, casualties, Gross Domestic Products of Axis/Allied countries, Top 10 costliest battles, and so on.The book is split into 6 chapters, some getting more attention than others:(1) Preparation for War(2) Land Campaigns(3) Weapons and Innovations(4) In The Air(5) At Sea(6) CostsIs there a lot of information? Yes. Does this book grab my attention on military history? Yes. However, there were some inaccuracies which kept me from enjoying it to the fullest.For example, on page 50 about Dunkirk: Operation Dynamo - there were no evacuation statistics for May 31st; the entire day was absent.Another item that bothered me was page 60 for Operation Barbarossa - this book states the Army Group Center had 52 divisions, but according to a few other sources I checked, it was 49 divisions. A small difference, but still significant.As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the most glaring error was found on page 197, the section on Hunting the Bismark. It read ""With the 22,000-strong Kriegsmarine crew in the water"" - but the compliment of the Bismark was only 2,200.A few errors are expected here and there in books, but when it comes to military history, I expect high levels of proofreading.All in all, I liked the graph layout, since they made the numbers leap off the page in greater detail. However, because of the errors throughout the book, I found myself doubting the numbers which were presented.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GV4P9B5CIMAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=177085195X#wasThisHelpful","R3GV4P9B5CIMAH","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a pretty simple guy when it comes to Bluetooth headsets. I rate them on the following:(1) Ease of setup(2) Comfort on my ear(3) Length of charge(4) Ease of phone appI'll give you my impressions how this headset measures up, I used this on my HTC One X.SETUP:On my smartphone, I went to the Bluetooth menu, and it recognized the headset and paired right away. No code entry was required, but depending on your phone, you might need to enter a pairing code (which is provided in the instructions). I then downloaded the ""My MotoSpeak"" app, which was very easy.When you flip the mouthpiece down, a voice will announce: ""Phone one connected. More than [x] hours of talk time.""COMFORT ON MY EAR:This is a very, VERY comfortable headset. The headset can be adjusted to fit either the left or the right ear with easy adjustment, There is no need to remove and reattach the hook.I've uploaded a few pictures to ""Customer Images"" for you to look at.It can pivot up or down to your comfort level, and it didn't feel heavy on my ear.LENGTH OF CHARGE:A full charge gives you 8 hours of talk time. I typically this headset for about 45 minutes to and from work,  and I have over 6 hours of my charge left.EASE OF PHONE APP:This is the big selling point for this headset, My MotoSpeak (Current version is 3.0.57).The app allows you to do hands-free sending and receiving of text messages. If you don't have the headset in, you can still have your phone read messages aloud, but sending messages is harder without the earpiece, unless you speak loudly. You can add an optional signature line to your messages, but I disabled this.If you get a text while driving, there's a blip on the earpiece and you'll hear:""Text from [person's name], Listen now?""You can say ""Yes"" or ""No"".If you say yes, the message will be read by a female voice. Once it ends, the voice will say ""Reply?"" And you can say the following: ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Repeat"" to repeat the message.After speaking your message, it will read your reply back and then say ""Send the message?"" and you can say ""Yes"" or ""No"". If everything's fine, I pick ""Yes"" and the message is sent. If it didn't recognize what I was saying, I'll pick ""No"". It will then say ""Try Again?"" and you can either choose ""Yes"" (which allows you to rerecord your reply) or ""No"" (which closes the message).When you press the button on the headset, it will say ""Say a Command"". If you say ""Text [name]"", the phone will repeat the name you spoke and then say ""Opening Text message. Say your message"". At this point, you're ready to go.No voice recognition software is perfect, but this one is very accurate for me. Heck, it recognized the word ""gobbledygook"" - and any headset which can do that is top notch in my book.ANY DRAWBACKS?Well, it's mainly the app I have issues with. If I get a call and someone text messages me, the message will not be read to me when the call is over. It would be nice if a future version of this app has a menu option to listen to the most recent message.I also found this is not compatible with Google Voice on my phone, so I have to turn off the headset if I want to do updates for Twitter or Facebook.FINAL VERDICT?Overall, this is a very comfortable Bluetooth headset. It is easy to set up, comfortable, and holds its charge. The app needs some work, but 3 out of 4 isn't bad.Definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38NE7WAQQ010I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006C248BC#wasThisHelpful","R38NE7WAQQ010I","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been pretty happy with the Scotch-Brite products I've used. This product is very similar to the Scotch-Brite Stainless Steel Cleaner, but it came with a hard plastic tool instead of a spongy tool.Our stove is 5 years old and it's taken a lot of abuse with various sauce stains and general wear & tear. Since I had fairly good luck with the other product, I decided to give this one a try.First off, the Frustration-Free packaging is exactly that. Opening the box couldn't be any simpler.The self-adhesive pads are very easy to apply - just put them on the bottom of the applicator and you're ready to go.There was a LOT of cleaner on the pads, and I used a paper towel to clean away the excess once I finished the job. I used both sides of one pad and a LOT of elbow grease, and my spouse said she hadn't seen the stove top this clean since the day we moved in. There are still a few deeply-cooked in stains that will probably need a bit of razor-assistance to remove, but on the whole, this cleaner took care of all our recent stains around the burners.I liked the hard plastic cleaning tool that was supplied, it made it easier to apply pressure while scrubbing. I didn't see a single scratch mark on the stove top once I finished. Having resealable bags for the scrubbing pads was a nice bonus.Overall, I'm quite happy with this product, and it did very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294PBUAEPDC8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0GT9Z6#wasThisHelpful","R294PBUAEPDC8X","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To make sure this item gets a proper review, I've enlisted the help of my child to describe how she likes this doll...Me: Was it hard getting this doll out of the packaging?My child: Not really, once you open the bottom of the box, the inside part comes right out. There were tabs on the back of the box, the kind you fold in. There were about 5 rubber bands on the head, arms and legs. It took me about 5 minutes to get it out of the box. I was really happy they didn't have a bunch of string and wires holding her in, like some other dolls.Me: What do you like about this Barbie doll?My child: Well, the necklace goes a little over the shoulders, so it's different from my other dolls. The crown has a rubber band on it, but if you take that off, it still stays on her head. I can open the wings with my thumb, and the dress works like it's supposed to. There's a lot of glitter on her dress and her top, and I like that. Her hair is poofier than my other dolls. I like her belly button (hey, belly BUTTON!) that opens up the dress, it looks like a jewel.Me: This doll doesn't come with a brush and it can't stand up on its own, and there isn't a stand to hold her up. Does any of that bother you?My child: No, I have a lot of brushes from my Bratzillaz dolls and my Monster High dolls, so that's okay. Most of the time I have the doll in my hands and I don't need a stand for it. I really like this doll.MY IMPRESSIONS:Every Barbie doll has some little hook or gimmick to grab a child's attention, and this one has fairy wings and the 2-sided dress for that. The necklace and crown can slip around, but that shouldn't be much of an issue.I've uploaded some pictures in the ""Customer Images"" section for you to take a look at.The main concern I have with this doll? The glitter...it has a tendency to get everywhere. Don't be surprised if your child plays with this doll and ends up with glitter on both hands.All in all, it's a cute doll. I have a feeling we'll be picking up the DVD before too long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDOUVCOQC38O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6PYQAM#wasThisHelpful","RWDOUVCOQC38O","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were a huge hit in our household. The sea salt isn't overpowering, and they taste very light and airy.

"Horror films have developed many different flavors over the years. There's supernatural horror, psychological horror, found footage, and so many more.Dark Skies falls into the category of science-fiction horror, which is familiar ground for people who've watched TV shows like Fringe (or the X-Files, depending on your generation). This kind of horror isn't for everyone, as evidenced by the mixed reviews Dark Skies has gotten. However, it made back its production budget at the box office several times over, so clearly there's an audience for this particular flavor of horror movie.Some might be turned off at the idea of a horror movie being PG-13, but if the story is done well, horror movies don't need buckets of blood or rampant cursing.PLOT:Our tale takes place in the suburbs, with husband and wife Daniel & Lacy (played by Josh Hamilton and Keri Russell), and their two boys Jessie and Sammy (played by Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett). There's some existing strain on the family since Daniel has been out of work for about three months, and Lacy is struggling to hold on to her realty job. Jessie is going through the awkwardness of his early teens, but still makes the time to tell bedtime stories to his little brother Sammy through their walkie-talkies.Strange, unexplained things start happening to this family - stacks of cans appear in their kitchen for no reason, every sensor of the house alarm is tripped at the same time but no one is found in the house, and in one particularly unsettling sequence, every single picture is removed from their frames on the first floor of the house. After a while, each family member finds themselves personally affected by things they can't explain.It's clear that someone or something is targeting this family, and over the course of the film, we see everyone's horror and panic grow as their safety slips away.WHAT DID I THINK?I thought Dark Skies took a slow-build approach to its horror, and it didn't take the cheap way out with jump scares or shaky-camera footage. The horror took its time, building very slowly over the course of the movie with unsettling imagery. As a parent, the greatest fear I have is being helpless to protect my children...and the director tapped into this fear with unsettling horrific events that couldn't be explained or protected against, such as the time-loss/possession moments or the children being covered with bruises and brandings.In horror films, you either care about the characters, or you want them to meet a well-deserved death. I found myself caring about every main character in Dark Skies, which is not easy for a horror film to pull off. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Kadan Rockett as Sammy...he was able to adapt to whatever the scenes required, and I felt he reacted just as an actual six-year old child would act - whether it was screaming, silence, or happiness over the family getting a new dog.The character of Edwin Pollard (played by J.K. Simmons) was a real treat. This type of movie requires an ""expert"" on what's happening, and he played the role perfectly...no overacting, no underplay, just right. I was starting to lost interest in the film partway through, but his character brought me back and got me refocused...he wanted to do what he could to help, and he was very honest with Daniel & Lacy about their fears.The ending, I'll admit, wasn't what I expected, and I won't lie, I was disappointed. Everyone has a different reaction to an ending like this one, so I'll let you make your own decisions on that.BONUS FEATURES:There's one audio commentary track with the following people -(1) Scott Stewart (writer/director)(2) Jason Blum (producer)(3) Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (executive producer)(4) Peter Gvodas (picture editor)The commentary track is quite good. Several topics are discussed, such as their decision to not make this a ""found footage"" film, their schedule of 6 months from shooting to release in theaters, giving creative control to the actors, explaining how to shoot ""night shots"" in the daytime, and much more. Overall, a good track, but I wish we could have had a 2nd track with the actors to hear their thoughts, character motivations, etc.There's also 9 deleted/alternate scenes with optional commentary. Lots of these sequences were cut because they disrupted the pacing of the movie and the overall tone. There's also an alternate ending...it'll be up to you to decide which one is better.MY FINAL VERDICT?All in all, Dark Skies did what it set out to do, to unsettle its audience. However, it's a one-time viewing for folks like me.Initially I was going to give this movie 3 stars, but the solid performances by the actors and the extra features rounded it up to 4 stars.If you like your horror movies with Pinheads or found footage or buckets of blood and gore, this definitely isn't your movie. However, if you're looking to try a different flavor of horror, I'd recommend Dark Skies for a rental. Who knows, you might like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183TG8WLVLDAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYG98#wasThisHelpful","R183TG8WLVLDAX","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the ""Brownie Crunch"" flavor of thinkThin bars.My spouse and I both tried out this protein bar, here were her thoughts:""I can taste the outer coating of chocolate but the inside of this bar tastes hollow. It's dry and flavorless.""For the most part, I agreed with her conclusions. This bar has soy crisps in it, so I found it occasionally tasted like a Rice Krispy treat...but that was only the texture. Without standard sugar, this bar just didn't taste very good.I've uploaded a picture into the ""Customer Images"" section so you can see what the bar looks like on the inside.There's a lot of sodium in this bar (170mg), and 7% of the bar is made up of sugar alcohols, which can't be completely digested.The package advises that this bar is made in a plant which also processes eggs, peanuts and tree nuts, so be careful if you have any allergies to those.I'm sure there are people out there who love the taste of these bars, but for me, a brownie without sugar isn't a brownie...it's an imitation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSXJ601BGAIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDINRC#wasThisHelpful","R2YSXJ601BGAIG","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, I didn't think this applicator would work. I thought the edges would curl up and it wouldn't be able to handle the jobs I put in front of it. I'm happy to report that I was wrong on all counts.Setup couldn't be any simpler - just attach the refill pad to the applicator on the bottom of the sponge, and you're ready to clean.The sponge foam is a huge plus. It was able to mold itself into different angles while I cleaned out a frying pan, and when I finished, it went right back to its original shape. There's a faint lemony smell while cleaning.Removing the pad is a little tricky since it clings like velcro to the applicator, but once it's off, you can attach a new pad when you're ready to clean again.I used this on one of our frying pans - it took about 15 minutes of scrubbing, and the pan got squeaky clean. I also used this on our refrigerator doors (as per the cover of the refills) and it gave them a really nice shine.All in all, this is a very good product. It cuts through grease like a hot knife through butter, and if that's what you need, this will do the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OI7VW71U7O7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0GTA3C#wasThisHelpful","R3OI7VW71U7O7T","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"+ PROS:+ Improved weaponry, armor, etc.+ Even more ways to kill Necromorphs+ Extra difficulty modes of Zealot and Hard Core+ Extra game ""Dead Space: Extraction"" included- CONS:- Has a ""been there, done that"" feeling- Scare factor is diminished with repeated play-throughs- Multiplayer can be very frustratingPLOT:Dead Space 2 takes place three years after the conclusion of the previous game. Isaac Clarke, our hero, has been reduced to an asylum patient in The Sprawl. Before long, he escapes his confinement and discovers yet another plot by the Unitologists to use him and his Marker-infected mind.Using his wits, his trusty plasma cutter and some strategic dismemberment, Isaac starts on another journey to eliminate as many Necromorphs as he can.GAMEPLAY:As before, we take control of Isaac in a 3rd person, over-the-right-shoulder view. As the game progresses, various weapons and schematics can be found. We can also find power nodes for weapon upgrades, armor upgrades, and more.We're not confined to the Ishimura anymore, and Isaac has different objectives to complete each level. There isn't as much emphasis on puzzle-solving as we had in the first game...this was dialed back, and the amount of firefights with Necromorphs has clearly increased.Though it's been 3 years since the last game, Isaac remembers that shots to the body only stun, and even decapitations are ineffective...and in some cases, make Necromorphs more dangerous. He's ready to strategically dismember each enemy until there's nothing left but a bullet-riddled mess.A power-up called STASIS can be used to freeze Necromorphs while Isaac uses them for target practice/dissection, and another power-up called KINESIS can bring objects to Isaac or hurtle them away with lethal velocity. I LOVED the tweak in gameplay where Isaac can use kinesis to rip a bladed arm off a dead Necromorph, and impale another enemy against the wall with it. This is also a great way to save ammunition.Players still have the in-game store to buy and sell items; and the upgrade Benches are back to maximize effectiveness for weapons and armor. There's been an additional tweak: if you spend 5000 credits, you can remove all the power nodes from one weapon and assign them to another.Mercifully, the game still spoon-feeds us objective locations, store locations and save points by using the R3 button.Dead Space 2 also increased the number of zero-gravity areas, where Isaac can jump off the floor and use suit thrusters to propel him towards his objective.When you play through this game on the easier settings, you might think you've got it made. However, when you try playing on Zealot mode, that's where you have to carefully plan out each attack so you don't run out of ammunition. Hard Core mode cranks the difficulty level up for seasoned players...you can only save 3 times across the 15 levels of gameplay, and there are no checkpoints. If you die, you go back to your last save point.MULTIPLAYER:This is a new addition to Dead Space. These are team-based matches, which last 2 rounds. You can play a Necromorph trying to keep a team of humans from reaching their tactical goals, or you could be a human trying to cleanse a path through a vicious pack of Necromorphs.HOW ABOUT THAT EXTRA GAME, DEAD SPACE: EXTRACTION?This was a VERY pleasant surprise. A port from the Nintendo Wii, Extraction takes place prior to the events of the first Dead Space game, and it's played in a first person rail-shooter view. If you don't have a Playstation Move controller, the game can still be played with a DualShock controller. However, since there's virtually no lag while shooting with the Move, that's what I prefer using.There are 10 levels to play, and there's a large replay value because of all the extra powerups and trophies you can earn. If you're on the fence about buying Dead Space 2, I think this additional game will tip your scales to the ""purchase"" side. You're basically getting 2 full games for the price of one.TROPHIES:Trophy lovers, now is the time to REJOICE. Dead Space 2 has 51 trophies to earn (8 more if you purchase the DLC pack), and Dead Space Extraction offers 48 additional trophies.Many of the trophies are earned for completing chapters of the game, using certain weapons to kill Necromorphs, and so forth.Without a doubt, the hardest trophy to earn is to complete the game on the ""Hard Core"" difficulty setting. You can only save 3 times throughout the course of the entire game. Your skills will be pushed to the ultimate limits, as well as your patience. If you manage to complete this task, you are rewarded with a ridiculously overpowered weapon that will make all subsequent playthroughs as easy as falling off a log.CONS:The first Dead Space game had a very, VERY claustrophobic feel to it. The creaking of the ship's deck plates, the sound of Isaac's breathing, the sharp music changes when a Necromorph appeared, it was all designed to scare us to our core.Even though I enjoyed Dead Space 2, I didn't get the same sense of all-encompassing fear as I did when I played the first game. There weren't many new monsters, and most of the fetch-questing was toned down in favor of more face-to-face combat. To me, it simply felt less scary and more predictable. I found the scare factor diminished with each New Game+.The weakest part of Dead Space 2, by far, was the Multiplayer mode. In a nutshell, you play as either a Necromorph or a human. Humans will regenerate at one central spawn point, but if playing as a Necromorph, you can choose where you want to emerge from.The problem is, the spawning is so slow that it paints a bulls-eye on your face while your online opponents turn you into hamburger.Powerups can be earned as you accumulate experience points, which in turn increases your attack damage, but the matching of players is completely random and unbalanced. I played with a couple of other people that were levels 3 to 10, but a few of my opponents were upwards of level 20-30...This was the same problem with Multiplayer matches in TRON: Evolution. I found the Necromorphs were very slow and clunky to control - instead of performing a slashing attack, I usually ended up jumping up and down in front of my opponents.FINAL VERDICT?While I enjoyed the harder difficulty settings and the addition of Dead Space: Extraction in this package, I didn't find myself as scared. Killing Necromorphs and upgrading my weapons and armor was fun, but the fear factor and the puzzle gameplay definitely felt like they were dialed back. I didn't get much enjoyment out of the multiplayer mode, but to each their own. However, if you like killing Necromorphs, you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of Dead Space 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXNI2XMMNNWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043M64FQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MXNI2XMMNNWB","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently, while watching an episode of Family Feud, the question was asked: ""What animal does your significant other sound like when they snore?"" and my wife replied: ""An ELEPHANT!""Soon after, I decided to look into an anti-snoring aid.I've uploaded a picture of this clip into the ""Customer Images"" section. It's a pretty simple design, the two nubs have magnets in them to hold the clip on your nose. The product description tells us that the clip will open nose passages to promote air flow, and it ""applies gentle pressure to your septum trigeminal nerve"". Not sure what that last part means, but if it makes me snore less, I'll take it. The clip stays on all night, and the little nubs seem to tickle my nose while I wear it.It's impossible for me to tell if this item worked or not, so I'll share my wife's thoughts:""Before you used this thing, you snored pretty much all night. I had to leave the room every night because your snoring was so loud and obnoxious.After you started using the clip, you would not snore ALL night long, it worked for about half the night, but you start snoring between 1am and 4am. When you snore now, it isn't as loud and obnoxious, I only leave the room a couple of times a week rather than every single night. It only works for about 4 hours.""So there you have it. This device didn't stop my snoring completely, but it's downgraded my snoring level from ""elephant"" to ""bulldog"" levels [citation needed].","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R202CJHXP7D6X6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIA8ASQ#wasThisHelpful","R202CJHXP7D6X6","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the harder movies I've chosen to review. Not because I didn't like it, quite the opposite - I liked it _so_ much, my hope is that you would choose to watch this movie the same way I did, without any prior information.However, since you're already reading my review, I'll do my best to tell you why I liked it and try to keep spoiler material to a bare minimum. My best advice is: DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE! I cannot stress this enough. It reveals way, way too much of the plot twists.THE PLAYERS:There's a wide range of talent attached to this movie...Michael Chiklis (who also serves as a producer of this film), Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Nikki Reed from the ""Twilight"" films, Stephen Lang from ""Avatar"", Sean Faris, and many more.THE PLOT:The best way to describe this film is that it's a 3-man-heist-gone-wrong at a small diner, but with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at. In all honesty, offering any more information threatens to reveal too much, so I'll move on.DVD FEATURES:English or Spanish subtitles, no other options.EXTRAS:This is one bare-bones DVD. There's no trailers, no commentary tracks, just a 23 minute ""Behind the Scenes"" feature from most of the players, but it's missing input from Ray Liotta and Michael Chiklis.WHAT DID I LIKE?I loved the non-linear style of telling the story. This movie had several flashbacks, and sometimes the same scenes were shown but from different character points of view, which offered more information than in the first viewing. Anyone who's seen a Quentin Tarantino film knows his movies should be watched more than once, and Pawn invites you to do the same.I liked seeing Michael Chiklis and Forest Whitaker on screen, which brought back memories of their days together on ""The Shield"". Ray Liotta was quite a pleasant surprise, delivering one of the most chilling monologues I've ever heard in his career to date. I had to do a complete double-take when I saw Stephen Lang, who played a frail older man with a bad hip...a stark contrast to his role as Colonel Miles Quaritch in ""Avatar"". Sean Faris did extremely well with these veteran actors - he was able to play a roller coaster of emotions without hamming up his role.Most of all, I liked finding out that the director, David A. Armstrong, was the cinematographer of the ""SAW"" franchise. Just like the first ""SAW"" movie, Pawn was shot in one main location and very few other locations, and the director was able to hold my interest all the way through to the end.WHAT DID I NOT LIKE?Common's depiction of Jeff Porter, the hostage negotiator. Out of all the characters in this film, I felt this one was portrayed the weakest with his soft voice and flat affect. I wish he had studied Kevin Spacey's character from ""The Negotiator"". Thankfully, his weak characterization didn't ruin the rest of the film for me.I also didn't like the lack of features on this disc. I would have loved to hear the director's thoughts on an audio track.FINAL VERDICT?All in all, I liked Pawn. I was pleased to discover a film shot over the course of 15 days on a low budget which was able to entertain me and keep me guessing about different plot points. Some were obvious, while others were not.If you like crime dramas, I would definitely recommend seeing this at least twice to catch all the little subtleties.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WKSAY0YQ4FR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6OEB18#wasThisHelpful","R1WKSAY0YQ4FR5","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In order to give this doll a proper review, I enlisted the help of my child, our resident expert on dolls!Me: So what's the doll look like?My child: ""This looks similar to my Liv Sophie doll, it's about the same height and the hands on Jade J'Adore look exactly the same.""Me: How hard is it to get the doll out of the package?My child: ""You will probably need scissors to get the head out of the back of the box, it has those little plastic ties that clamp on the head. There's lots of little rubber bands on everything, too.""Me: Do you like the way she looks?My child: ""I like that these Bratzillaz are different than regular witches. Regular witches have a black dress, a black hat, and a broom. These witches have better fashion, and they're good witches.""Me: What do you like about this doll?My child: ""I like that this doll can fix broken hearts, I think that's the most helpful power out of all the other Bratzillaz dolls. I like her more than regular dolls, and the Liv dolls, and the Monster High dolls, most dolls don't come with this much extra stuff. The box gives her story and that's good for people who have never heard of her.""Me: Is there anything you didn't like about this doll?My child: ""I'm a little sad that Kissifuss wasn't included, the box has a picture of Kissifus but in real small lettering it says 'Pet Sold Separately' on the picture.""---------------------------MY IMPRESSIONS:This is a pretty nice doll.

"Our family loves a good tasting pasta sauce, and this 4-pack provides more than enough for us!I'll admit, by itself, the sauce is somewhat bland, similar to plain tomato soup...but this is also a strong point, since extra ingredients can be added to this sauce and make it taste better. This depends on the flair of the cook, and the tastes of their audience.Since we have a small family, there is a lot of leftover sauce, we use roughly half of a 45 ounce bottle for a pasta meal.

It's got a standard peanut butter taste but with the added kick of white chocolate, dark chocolate and raspberries. This peanut butter spreads very thick, so with all the extra ingredients, it threatens to rip apart the bread. It's very sweet, and very tasty.By toasting the bread first, it will make this peanut butter a little easier to spread, and the warmth melts the chocolate to make a good treat taste even better.

"+ PROS:+ Frank West and his camera return to Dead Rising!+ New weapons to create+ New plot twists, new psychopaths and new challenges+ 2 Multiplayer modes: Game campaign and Sandbox Mode+ New area: The Uranus Zone- CONS:- Still has long load times- No more ""Terror Is Reality"" 4-player mode- Extra save slots and improved survivor AI make the game too easy for veterans of Dead Rising 1PLOT:It's been 5 years since the Willamette disaster, and in this game, we play Frank West, a photojournalist who's covered wars. He's had his 15 minutes of fame, and now he's slumming around the game show Terror Is Reality to pay the bills. A zombie outbreak occurs, and Frank needs to keep himself alive for 3 days until the military arrives to clean up the mess.In a nutshell, The game starts as Dead Rising 2 did, but the story is told with Frank West in the spotlight.GAMEPLAY:From the beginning, Frank starts off with his hands and feet as his weapons. As you wander around the mall, you can use pretty much anything as a weapon, whether it's a can of whipped cream, a bottle of whiskey, or a pitchfork. Zombies are EVERYWHERE, and when 7pm rolls around, those zombies take an extra dose of the crazy and get super-violent.Killing zombies earns character Prestige Points, which in turn levels up inventory slots, strength, hit points, offensive and defensive capabilities. Frank West is also able to earn PP by taking pictures of people in various poses such as brutality, horror, outtake, drama, erotica and more.Frank has a series of case files to complete over the course of 3 days and during this time he can choose to try and save random survivors throughout the city, attempt to defeat psychopaths who have lost their minds due to the zombie outbreak, and try to find the life-giving Zombrex medicine that he needs every day to survive. Or, he can choose to do nothing more than wander around trying on clothes, eating various foods, or gambling in the casinos.There are additional weapons to create that weren't in Dead Rising 2, and the Uranus Zone is a new kids-theme park area which allows the use of carnival rides to kill zombies.IS IT BETTER THAN DEAD RISING 2 WITH CHUCK GREENE?Well, I liked the alternate Frank West storyline. I assumed I knew everything that would happen and where to find everything, but the game developers counted on this and made several changes to the plot and item locations which made it harder for folks who played through Dead Rising 2 several times (like me).I love the return of Frank West's camera, because that's what made Dead Rising so memorable...taking pictures of zombies is a very fun activity, though it's pretty hard to get a picture of a psychopath when they're trying to cleave me from neck to navel.There are times when this feels like a complete clone of Dead Rising 2, but then I find new enemies, new plot points or new attack moves which remind me that I'm playing a different game.MULTIPLAYER:A player can choose to complete the storyline with an online partner. This makes defeating psychopaths a lot easier than standard 1:1 fighting, and some of the trophies can't be unlocked unless you have a co-op partner with you.The second online gameplay mode is Sandbox mode. This is what I was dreaming about...I can run around and slice up zombies with no time limit, no need to find Zombrex, no missions, just plain old fashioned FUN. There are several challenges to complete for single player mode, such as trying to drink 30 alcoholic drinks within a time limit, and these challenges have increased difficulty if you decide to play with an online partner.Your character needs $50,000 to complete a game mission? No problem! Just do an online session and save that game file. Then when you go back to story mode, the money's all there.TROPHIES:There's a LOT of busy work in getting all the trophies for Dead Rising 2: Off the Record. There are easy ones such as getting 69 zombie kills or making a zombie slip in a puddle of vomit. For the more dedicated players, there are some time consuming trophies such as finding all the combo cards, photographing all the PP stickers, or abstaining from consuming meat, dairy or alcohol until the military arrives.Some trophies are missable during playthroughs unless you use a strategy guide.CONS:I've said it before, I'll say it again..these load times are RIDICULOUS. Going through a door or moving from one part of the mall to another can take up to 20 seconds with each load. When you fight a psychopath, there's a cutscene...then a loading screen...then you fight...then there's a closing cutscene...and yet ANOTHER loading screen. These load times kill the pacing of the game.I must admit, I miss ""Terror Is Reality"". It was fun to run around and put blenders on zombie's heads, tear through a crowd of zombies with a slicicle, or use a zamboni to grind them up on the ice rink. However, Sandbox mode was a fair tradeoff because in the end, it's all about killing as many zombies as possible in the most satisfying ways.Finally, the save slots. One of the things that made the first Dead Rising so hard and so challenging was having only one save slot. This left no margin of error and would require another run-through if something was missed. The survivors in Dead Rising 1 had a nasty habit of walking into packs of zombies, making trips back to the safehouse very difficult as the game progressed.In this game, the characters are much better at avoiding zombies and can even use weapons, if they accept them from you. With 3 save slots and the improved AI, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is more forgiving...but some folks do miss that challenge.FINAL VERDICT:On the whole, I really enjoyed Dead Rising 2: Off the Record. This gets 4 stars from me because I'm SO masochistic.My main goals are hacking up zombies like I've got a hunting license, collecting difficult trophies and playing some short, goofy and blood-soaked online gaming sessions. If you like the same things, then I think you'll get a kick out of this game.Now if you get frustrated with weapons that break (and all of them eventually do), long load times and time-limit missions, you might want to give this game a pass. I'd recommend at least a rental...Once you combine a 2x4 with a lawnmower and see the damage you can wreak, you might like this game enough to buy it.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRQC3SHEE20R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0K7H6#wasThisHelpful","R1SRQC3SHEE20R","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I decided to dress as Agent 47 (from the Hitman video game series) for a local gaming convention, and I knew I had to find a set of pistols that looked similar to the Silverballers.The pistols in the game are clones of the .45 ACP Colt M1911, and since these Airsoft pistols are extremely similar in look and feel, I picked them up.While checking in at the security office, the workers there said these pistols felt like the real thing. They were impressed with the workmanship on the slide as well as the clips. They had to zip-strip the triggers since these looked so real.I can't speak of the shooting accuracy of these pistols, because I only used them for costume purposes...but if you want to get some prop weapons that look like the real thing, you can't do much better than these.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IIH6VTF7H6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TUSJIY#wasThisHelpful","R19IIH6VTF7H6B","A1C139F5C7Y38P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C139F5C7Y38P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I returned these immediately! When I received these in-person, the color was waaay different than from the picture here on Amazon. These were more like a neon salmon color and not really a ""coral fusion"" like the description. The rise on these is also pretty low, so if you practice any type of yoga, these are just about guaranteed to come down from the waist. The fit is also a bit ""odd"", not long at all unless you are under 5'6 and I'm 5'10, so these won't work at all!

"Normally I don't bother to buy tanks with the built in bra, but, I figured since it was Soybu and I usually like their stuff, that I would give this a go. I really should have gone with my first thought and passed on this. The fit is weird; like it's kind of short length wise and the built in bra seems more like for a young teenage girl and not for women. I mean I'm not a larger busted woman by any means, but this top is just funky! NO stretch in this at all. It clings everywhere, so if you're looking for a top with a lose fit, don't get this OR if you have a body like the model wearing the shirt, then by all means, this shirt is for you!

"Oh my gosh, where has this been all of my yoga life?! I was originally going to buy a yoga mat towel until I saw this product. After reading the reviews, I figured I would hold off on buying the mat towel and buy this rosin bag instead. I am so happy I did because this really works! I practice Ashtanga yoga everyday and sweat quite a bit which of course causes my hands and feet to slip on my mat. I dab a bit of this rosin on my hands and feet, and it works! No need to reapply as it does absorb excess oils from my hands and feet along with sweat. It doesn't leave any ""powder"" on your mat either so no worries on hand or footprint being left behind. Just keep this in the little plastic bag it comes in and it will keep fresh for a while. I am huge fan of this and will certainly continue to buy it!

I'm a small frame gal (36B, 5'10) and I think anyone larger may not like this fit to well.

"This fan is a really good fan if you want one to help cool a decent size room. For the size of the fan it pushes out a lot of power.

"I  love this 3 cup food processor! I use this for my everyday family meal cooking. Very helpful in chopping carrots in small bits.  This chopper does a good job in chopping carrots, onions, celery, etc. To get better results, I chop the carrots first into cubes and then toss them in this chopper and I do shake the chopper to get better results because it does not do a good job when you don't shake them. For the price of this chopper, I don't have complains and don't mind at all prepping the carrots and shaking the chopper because I hate manually chopping hard raw carrots into tiny bits, it is very tedious.

"Actually this tube bra was my first time trying them, and to me the fit was okay. I'm a 36A/B, so the ""support"" was okay for me, but I would imagine that if you're any larger then this may not be for you at all.

Great to wear under say a sheer top, but not for much else. The quality seems pretty decent and they did hold-up in a gentle wash cycle on cold.

"When you hear the namer Otterbox, thoughts usually go immediately to the well-known Defender case.  The Symmetry cases are thinner and sleeker than their bulkier Defender series siblings. It is designed for those who want Otterbox protection without the bulk.The case is constructed of a rigid plastic with firm buttons and a criss-cross styled raised pattern on the interior made of rubber or TPU.  The back of the phone rests on this pattern which is described on the packaging as ""shock absorbing"".  My assumption, based on that statement, is that the interior is designed to absorb and disperse the force of impact from a drop. The edges and front of the cased are raised and constructed of TPU.  It provides good screen protection.The case easily installs on the Note 5 and the button covers work well despite their initial stiffness. It doesn't add much extra bulk and maintains a reasonably sleek appearance.  So far, I'm very happy with the Symmetry.  It offers a very good balance between protection and looks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285P93KAOW5RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7S933A#wasThisHelpful","R285P93KAOW5RU","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third shredder I've tried this year.  First I tried a Royal, then a Fellowes.  Both had the same problem, they overheated way too quickly. I was able to get three full baskets and roughly fifteen minutes of shredding 5 sheets at a time before this shredder shut off due to heat.  I have yet to find a shredder live up to 12 sheets of all but the thinnest paper.  After a roughly 15-minute cool down, aided by unplugging and sitting outside on the patio in the cool night air, it was ready to go again.  I can do a full grocery bag of documents in one sitting with this shredder.  Like most shredders, it's noisy but not overly loud.  This cross cuts but doesn't do the tiny cube cut.  If you're looking for the tiny confetti top security pieces, this doesn't cut that small but it cuts small enough for my needs.  The shredder has forward, reverse, stop and auto-run settings.  the top latches onto the basket which allows for easy transport via the top handle as opposed to the side handles found on many shredders.  The only minor con is that paper tends to build up in the teeth and require occasional manual cleaning.  Once cleaned, I put a few drops of oil on the blades and it's ready to go on the next batch.  Overall, it does a decent job.

"The MySymmetry is a clear back version of the Symmetry case.  For that reason and the available decorative inserts, it’s little more stylish than the regular Symmetry case, not to mention nearly twice the price.  If you have a gold or rose gold iPhone, it will really pop in this case without inserts.  In fact, the inserts, which themselves cost $10 a pop for a 2-pack, seem to defeat the purpose of a case like this because none compare with the natural beauty of the iPhone itself.Like the regular Symmetry, the case fits the phone nicely and the port cutouts line up perfectly.  It offers adequate protection if normal caution is exercised by non-klutz types who don’t regularly drop their phone.  It also doesn’t add much bulk.

"I originally used Apple's OEM silicon case for my iPhone 6 Plus.  It kept the phone slim and sleek and provided a much grippier surface than the naked phone.  However, the bottom was exposed, it provided very little screen protection and with moderate handling it started to peel.  So it was time for a new case and I decided to try the OtterBox.  This is the polar opposite in terms of form factor.  It's huge.  It turns an already large phone into a tank. It makes carrying the phone a chore in anything other than baggy clothing.  However, it's a little sleeker and less boxy than previous OtterBox Defender cases.  The primary phone case can be used with or without the holster.  It has a built in screen protector that works fine with my 6 Plus.  If you have a 6S model, I strongly suggest you confirm compatibility with the new 6S 3D touch feature before buying.  I've already purchased  a couple ""6S"" advertised cases and screen protectors only to receive items originally designed for the iPhone 6.  The word 6S was nowhere on the packaging despite the products being advertised as specifically made for the 6S on the website (not Amazon).  The home button is also covered and protected by a thin silicone type material so the fingerprint scanner works.The case comes with a holster with a rotating belt clip.  It allows for easier carrying on a belt but I refuse to walk around with a big goofy phone case clipped to my belt looking like Captain Kirk with my phaser set to stun.  With or without the case, I pocket the phone.  I just wish the belt clip were removable because I like the additional front/screen protection that the holster offers and removing the clip would eliminate some of the bulk when the phone is pocketed.  On the bright side, like the case, OtterBox designed the clip to be slimmer than past models.  The case does not add much in terms of weight, at least to me, and protects the phone very well.  If you need max protection over max aesthetics, this is the way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APL6NLYZ41GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","R2APL6NLYZ41GT","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sound quality of this set is pretty decent.  I recently purchased another set of bluetooth earphones primarily used for workouts and they didn't sound too hot.  These rival a decent pair of normal buds but don't come close to a top quality set of buds. Quality is decent regardless with good even tonal frequencies and little distortion, although there is an occasional popping sound or two that seems like it's related to the wireless connection but I'm not sure.  I had no problems pairing the set with both my iPhone 6 and my 4th gen iPod touch running iOS 6.  These are good hands-free music while you work play but they fall out a little easier than my other buds with wings. For that reason, I'm reluctant to recommend them for very active activities. I think they'd be okay for a power walk or light jog but not much more.  Bluetooth distance is pretty good, easily 20-30 feet.  My only problem with the buds is that I think they sound too quiet for me.  On the other hand, my wife finds them loud.  So, satisfaction with the max volume will likely be a subjective matter. Either that or I spent one too many days blasting super loud music through my headphones and earbuds.  The usable water bottle that they ship the buds in is a nice touch. Cute little set that would make a great gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZCQU5M46RJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNG06FW#wasThisHelpful","R3PZCQU5M46RJ9","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I didn’t have high expectations when offered this watch for review.  I’ve both purchased and reviewed numerous sub-$100 as well as moderately expensive watches over the years. My watch collection ranges from a $19 Timex up to an Omega Speedmaster Chronograph.  I’m not a watch collector or connoisseur but I like wearing nice reliable watches for both fashion and function, much like any other articles of clothing or accessories.  The common theme that I notice is that I usually get what I pay for.  Despite absurdly high supposed MSRP’s of hundreds of dollars, most $50-100 dollar watches that I've owned didn’t even feel like they were worth $25.This watch breaks that mold by having some pretty decent quality components for the money.  The leather band is thick and luxurious with quality stitching and the brand name engraved on the inside.  The case is large with a mechanical see-through front and rear.  The dial, arms and second-hand are all black with white and red accents. The chronograph sub-dials indicate day of week, 24-hour clock and day of month.  The date sub-dials are set using the buttons.  The primary 12-hour time and the 24-hour sub-dial time are both in sync and set with the crown.  Setting this type chronograph is not in the instructions.  Also missing from the instructions is a guide or explanation of how to use the not so intuitively fastened clasp.  None of the watches that I've owned have ever come with that funky clasp.  It took me quite a while to figure it out.  The watch has a Chinese automatic movement that mimics the Swiss mechanical movement found on high end watches.  That means the arm appears to sweep rather than tick like a quartz movement.  For that reason, it’s also the movement found on most knock-offs and counterfeits.  I don't mind because although it’s not quite as smooth as the Swiss automatic movement on my Omega, it’s a welcome relief from the ubiquitous Quartz movement found on most watches.  Also, this watch makes no claims of being a Rolex or Patek, so the movement is justified.  My only concern would be the accuracy of the Chinese mechanical movement. This would be the first one I've owned, at least to my knowledge.  Time will tell how accurate it is, pun fully intended.Overall, I like this watch.  It’s classy and flashy without appearing pretentious.  It has a decent size case but not one I'd consider oversized unless you have tiny wrists.  Neither the strap nor the case scream “look at me” yet is attractive enough to earn compliments.  In fact, if not for the see-through body, it would be fairly conservative.  You can wear this watch with confidence that you won't come off as a poser or attention seeker.  Yes, It’s an automatic, so it doesn’t require winding but you do have to keep it moving to keep it running. That's where the differences between this watch and the much more expensive automatics show.  I can go a couple days without wearing my Omega and it will still be running when I put it on.  This watch seems to stop running much quicker.  If you plan to wear it regularly, I suggest investing in an inexpensive automatic watch winder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J50WBB45KMJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXMPB6#wasThisHelpful","R1J50WBB45KMJG","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case offers decent protection without the added bulk of cases like the Otterbox Defender.  It fits the S6 nicely without being overly loose or snug.  It does not include a screen protector of any type but the front of the case protrudes enough to protect the screen if the phone is laid face down on a flat surface.  There is enough substance to insulate the body from drop-related damage but given the size of the phone and the amount of exposed screen, screen protection looks to be minimal against drops. This is not a case for the clumsy. It’s a case for those who take pretty good care of their phone and are generally cautious.  It’s built to offer a decent amount of protection with little added bulk.  Anyone skewing toward the klutz side should definitely look at the Defender or Commuter cases rather than this. This case leans more toward the aesthetics end of the spectrum rather than max protection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4NB9YFSTRBFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53T4A6#wasThisHelpful","R4NB9YFSTRBFB","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a Black & Decker D2030 iron and absolutely love it.  It has great size, weight and produces perfect steam and heats nice and evenly.  I just tried this D3040 and although it does a decent job of ironing, I prefer my D2030.One of the biggest pros of the D3040 is that it gets hot; hot enough to iron anything.  It also shoots out a nice amount of steam. The weight and ergonomics are both decent.  I can iron comfortably for long periods.  It has a nice wide fill spout and the digital push-button temperature control is easy to use.  Just push the button until the blue LED indicates desired temperature setting.I don't necessarily know if I'd label if a con, but if you're not careful the iron can easily get too hot.  The very first item I attempted to iron was a cotton/polyester blend work shirt.  I typically iron this fabric on the highest setting or just below it with most irons, including the D2030.  The D3040's highest setting (linen) is way too hot for that fabric. It nearly burned the shirt on first contact.  Thankfully, I felt that it was too hot immediately and lifted the iron before any damage occurred.  I turned the heat down two settings to polyester but then it wasn’t hot enough to heat the water and started leaking.  I turned it up one setting to 100% cotton and it was hot enough to steam but didn’t seem quite hot enough to efficiently iron the shirt without numerous passes.  I later learned that anything other than the hottest linen setting requires the steam to be set at mid instead of high steam.  That's why it leaked.  The digital temperature control is easy to use but doesn’t offer the flexibility or versatility of a regular heat control knob.  With a knob, I can adjust heat incrementally if it’s too hot or too cool.  With digital controls, it’s all or nothing for a particular heat setting.  My D2030 is also digital but doesn’t have as wide of a heat variance between the highest heat settings.  If a really hot iron is needed for stubborn linens, the D3040 is definitely the hotter of the two.The steam burst is nice during ironing.  It puts out a nice amount of steam but when you sit the iron upright, it spits out one last strong burst of steam each time.  Make sure the iron isn't facing toward any exposed body parts when you turn it upright.The last con I'll list is the reservoir.  It’s a very dark grey color which makes it hard to see the water inside.  Further complicating matters is the fact that the max water level line is designed to be read with the iron sitting horizontal, not vertical.  I have to tip the iron horizontal at least once while filling if I want to ensure I fill it to the max without overfilling.I like the performance of both irons but for my everyday ironing needs, the nod goes to the D2030.  As I said, if you need an iron that gets really hot or frequently iron a lot of linens that can withstand the heat, the D3040 gets the nod.  Just make sure you use caution with the higher heat and steam settings and watch out for bursts of steam whenever you raise it vertically while ironing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB801PBSD0RUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","RB801PBSD0RUX","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, I gave our Yorkie half a stick immediately after a bath as a peace offering.  He sniffed it for a bit, maybe thinking poisoning was next on the list after being duped into a bath.  Once he realized it was legit, he gobbled it up quickly.  Actually, it';s more like he inhaled it.  I gave him the second half, same result.  He then followed me around the house, hopping on his hind legs to beg  for more.  So, yes, I reached the conclusion that he loves them.  Based on the texture, aroma and appearance, they seem like doggy a version of of Slim Jim.  The ingredients seem safe: beef, salt, citric acid, cultured dextrose, paprika, black pepper and garlic powder.  It claims to contain no corn, wheat, or soy.

"The PX24 comes with an in-line amp that boosts sound and offers features primarily geared toward gaming such as surround sound and superhuman hearing which reduces overall noise and amplifies quieter sounds such as footsteps, rustling leaves, etc.  Gaming sound quality is very good.  The virtual surround sound delivers in both primary and ambient gaming sounds.  The remote is battery powered via non-removable rechargeable battery.  A micro-USB charging cable is included.  The amp has a toggle switch to choose between preset console and PC/mobile sound profiles.  The headset sounds very good on gaming consoles and PC’s during gaming.  Use of the amp is optional but it noticeably enhances the sound.  It’s not just a gimmick and I can’t see using the headset without it.The headset is comfortable despite slightly firm foam cups. I don’t feel the inner panels making contact with the ear which is good. There is no excessive pressure nor discomfort during long periods of use.  A four-hour Little Big Planet session confirmed this fact. They also easily adjust to fit heads of all sizes.  The flexible boom mic can easily adjust to any position and sounds pretty good.  The very flexible mic design allows the most adjustment options for positioning the mic just right. Mic sensitivity and overall voice quality are both very good as well.Although the headset works well for gaming, I found them a bit lacking for listening to music on my PC and my iPod.  These are engineered primarily for gaming and it shows.  During music playback, highs are semi-flat at best and bass is non-existent and the sound sometimes suffers distorttion or briefly drops out altogether for a split second on lower frequency sounds when using the amp.  Without the amp, music is just too flat and dull sounding compared to other headsets or even a set of earbuds.  I would recommend these exclusively for gaming rather than dual purpose use for gaming and music.  Otherwise, a very good quality gaming headset that won’t break the bank, especially considering the features that are included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300GWFWH2W8TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5V3U#wasThisHelpful","R300GWFWH2W8TX","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This headset fits comfortable for long periods.  The ear cushions are made of firmer material than the pads on some of our other headsets.  Pressure is decent on ears and top of head.  Despite being a little on the firm side, there is never any discomfort, even during marathon gaming sessions.  I’ve owned headphones with softer pads but tighter or awkwardly fitting frames that felt much worse than these, even after short periods.They sound really good with a nice even balance.  No tone ever overpowers another.  I listened to several songs through them and even from a music source in another room, they sound quite well playing music.  There is no excessive vibrating bass, nor piercing highs nor flat mids.  Gaming sounds are great too.  Whether its an action game like Bloodborne or a music based game like Osu, these phones do a good job of bringing the game to life and creating a truly immersive experience.  They also do a good job of blocking unwanted outside noise.  Besides having great sound quality, the mic is nice and loud. It’s far better than the mic on the PDP afterglow that this replaced.The wireless range is decent as well.  I can easily walk from room to room while listening to music on the same floor without any noticeable loss of signal strength.  Battery life so far has been impressive.  We can easily get a few days filled with several hours of gaming out of a single charge.The Corsair logos on the sides stylishly glow multi-colors and the safety manual is hilarious. Really, it is.  Make sure you read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGR7LVJ89NAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GMX9HE#wasThisHelpful","RQGR7LVJ89NAB","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nest cam is small and sleek yet heavier than its deceptively lightweight appearance.  The bundled insert promised that after installing either the iOS or Android app, setup “should only take a minute. Literally.”  My setup was closer to thirty minutes primarily due to bluetooth issues, app crashes, account creation and the camera failing to show up in the app after setup.Once finally up and running, I found performance to be a mixed bag.  Video quality is quite good, even in night vision mode.  Streamed footage is crisp and sharp, especially on high resolution mobile devices.  You can pinch-zoom live video.  Streaming is generally good but is sometimes laggy, even with strong network connectivity on both ends. Sound is so-so.  The sound being picked up by the camera is very quiet regardless of how high I set the volume on my device.  On the other end, anyone in close proximity to the camera can hear me clearly when I activate the two-way talk feature.  The Nest app, while generally good, can be buggy at times, either crashing randomly or not detecting active cameras.  The camera does tend to get very warm during use as I discovered when I attempted to relocate it right after shutdown.The Nest Cam does not record video to a local source. Video is streamed, stored and accessed remotely on the company’s servers.  I would prefer a local recording option like a micro-SD card or NAS recording at the very least.  Nest offers paid subscriptions to access recorded video.  The prices vary depending on length of subscription and desired number of days for retention of footage.  Currently, 10 and 30 day retrievals are the only options offered. The subscriptions start out relatively cheap (e.g. $10 for 10 days, 1 camera).  However, prices could easily and quickly skyrocket depending on the number of cameras used and desired retrieval duration.  Make sure you research the prices thoroughly before investing in multiple cameras.I hope Nest considers offering an onboard or local recording option.  Without it, the Nest is practically worthless as a true security device, even with a subscription. I know you can download video for your own offline archiving but in all honesty, who is going to do that every one, ten or thirty days?  This is a nice quick and dirty solution for live streaming whenever you want to do a spot check on your residence.  Beyond that, unless you ante up for a subscription, I don't see much more benefit.  I currently own a Logitech Alert camera system.  It's over five years old and still works like a charm.  Each camera has its own 16gb micro-SD card capable of storing several months worth of data. Logitech offers a subscription service too.  However, with local recording capability, unlimited motion sensor alerts, IR night vision, a robust desktop app that automatically archives footage from the cards wirelessly over the LAN and a pretty reliable mobile app, I've never needed to subscribe to it.  I could pull recorded footage from 2010 if I wanted to do so.  That's what I consider a good security solution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDCTB1YOFUHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJGUA2#wasThisHelpful","R2DDCTB1YOFUHC","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This powder smells delicious, like the boxed cake mix.  That's about it for the pros. I really tried to give this powder a chance despite the high sodium amount. However, the longer I used it, the more I began to dislike it. The consistency of the powder is softer and more powdery than typical protein powders.  It has a similar feel to flour. Once mixed, the shake is very thick.  Many times, even with adequate fluid, it wouldn't mix fully. I typically find myself swallowing chunks of unmixed powder despite vigorous shaking. The first time I used it, I initially mixed it with 8 ounces of almond milk.  That is normally enough for my other protein powders but not this powder.  The shake was so thick, it was undrinkable.  I was away from home and out of milk, so I added 4 ounces of water to the shake to thin it out enough to be drinkable. Make sure you mix it with at least 16 ounces of fluid and shake for a long time. Initially, I didn't think the taste was too bad. It wasn't good by any stretch but tolerable. However, the longer I used it, the more I began to really see how bad it truly tastes.  It's now to the point where I force myself to chug it down because I find the taste disgusting. It's too salty, too clunky and tastes like salt and flour mixed with water.  For vegan protein, I'll stick to my Vega Sport. I figured I'd finish this off rather than having it go to waste but I don't know if I can tolerate it much longer to be honest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNZXPIW64JD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ1C7VQ#wasThisHelpful","RXNZXPIW64JD1","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter just entered her sophomore year.  The new version of the SAT will be live by the time she’s ready to take the test, so I want her to begin preparing for the new SAT as soon as possible.  We have used Kaplan guides in the past for the (still current as of this review) SAT and found them very helpful.  My oldest two children were accepted into very good schools using Kaplan SAT prep guides as part of their study and preparation tools. This version addresses all of the relevant sections in the new test: math, reading, writing and language.  It also includes a section for the soon to be optional essay.  There is one practice test in the book and two additional online tests are available after you register the book at Kaplan’s web site. Answers to the practice test questions are provided along with explanations.I like the essay section not only for the prep tools and the guidance offered.  Students may be inclined to skip the essay once it becomes optional on the new SAT.  Many students may not know for certain if any schools they ultimately apply to will require an essay.  I agree with the book that it’s better to have the essay completed and in hand.  It doesn’t hurt to write the essay.  The essay section is just as comprehensive and helpful as the other sections.  The book doesn’t merely gloss over it.  There is also a writing section where you can practice forming and writing the essay.The guide comes with a money-back satisfaction guarantee but it’s rather weak.  If you don’t like the book, you must mail it to Simon and Schuster within 90 days of purchase.  You also must include your original receipt and a fifty word or less explanation of why you are unsatisfied.  The book is pretty large, so factoring in return postage along with everything else, I doubt many people would go through the trouble even if unsatisfied.  On the bright side, we’ve been satisfied with Kaplan study guides, so the guarantee is mere eye candy as far as we’re concerned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U3AFK70XHN0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231547#wasThisHelpful","R1U3AFK70XHN0C","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for my daughter during Amazon's ""Prime Day"".  She loved it initially but one of the crystals inside popped loose and got stuck in the date window.  I read other reviews about jewels popping off but figured ""not us"".  WRONG.  Not only is it unattractive and annoying, but it's also not covered by the warranty.  Movement and mechanical malfunctions only, nothing cosmetic.  So this will be my last Relic watch.  I plan to wait until Black Friday and get her a better quality watch.

"I’ve always felt that a true pure entrepreneur is the person who dreams, conceives, hustles, builds, fails, rebuilds, learns, succeeds and grows or sell to start all over again.  Most if not all of the successful business owners that I know personally learned by doing, failing, trying again, failing, learning from their mistakes as well as mentors and/or role models, trying again and finally succeeding.  I remember talking with one of my more technically challenged friends who owns a pretty successful brick and mortar business.  He mentioned how he was working on a completely unrelated service oriented website.  Here’s a guy who doesn’t even know how to install Windows on his own PC talking about launching a web startup despite already owning a successful business.  That’s entrepreneurial thinking.  Technically Most of us are what the author refers to as “wantrepreneurs”.  We read the same books, watch the same TED talks, listen to the same podcasts and utilize the same tactics for startups, funding and  business culture.  As the author shares, many feed into the concept of broad entrepreneurship being a new concept ushered in by the Millennials.  The current startup craze became all the rage with the advent of web 2.0 and, social media and mobile devices.  This has resulted in a mindset of likeness, entitlement and lack of individuality.  In a nutshell, this book is about breaking away from what the plugged in world would have you believe to be the norm and think differently.Besides telling his own personal story of success, offering numerous real world examples as well as mentioning the aforementioned millennials, Tabok mentions how we are pretty much dumbing down by repeating the same patterns that enable the few to get rich and continue to widen the wealth gap.  We waste our time on social sites that simultaneously drain our earning ability while enriching the site’s owners.  This is a reason why I have myself abandoned Facebook (and chose there title for my review).  His seven rules for accomplishing goals may seem pretty obvious or even as if you’ve read them before (you have), but people just don’t take them seriously.  In all, he spends the bulk of the book basically explaining how if you’re ever to get anywhere, stop thinking like those around you, stop conforming to norms, be willing to take risks, be disciplined and trust yourself. Establish the proper balance between life and work and always remember to take care of yourself.  The car can’t run at top efficiency if you fail to properly fuel and service it. Most of all, be an effective leader and blaze your own trail.I found this to be a good read and was specifically intrigued with his views about the role that the Internet can play in the life of a modern day entrepreneur. However, as I say about every business book I review, there is no magic formula for success.  Use this advice as a guide or map but ultimately, your success or lack thereof will depend on you and whether or not you take action.  These books share the mindset of successful people.  It’s your job to cherry pick the valuable traits that you can assimilate into your life as long ass they work with your personality, energy level and abilities.  We’re capable of much more than we think when armed with proper knowledge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7U2EW5UKHLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159918575X#wasThisHelpful","RW7U2EW5UKHLD","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent quality ball for the price.  It's easy to dribble and shoot with large or small hands.  It has good bounce and handling ability on a wide range of outdoor surfaces.

"This unit replaced my Sony BDV-E770W home theater system.  That system uses 5.1 channel speakers with proprietary plug-in connectors, so I had to invest in a new set of speakers.  After relegating the older system to my bedroom television, I connected this to the family room TV and  splurged on a new set of 7.1 speakers. Sound quality is top notch.  Besides home theater, this is definitely the new way to play music.  The first half of my life was spent listening to vinyl records, cassette tapes, an 8-track cassette for a short time (man, was that awful..)  and then compact disks.  The second half is the era of digital music and streaming.  So as someone from a bygone era, I can appreciate how everything is consolidated into one device and gone are the days of multiple piece “stereo systems”  (receiver, turntable, tape deck, CD player, equalizer, etc).  Obviously, sound quality is going to depend on the type and the quality of your speakers as well as the speaker wire.  You don’t have to spend a ton of money on overpriced items. You can get equal or better quality at the right vendors and avoiding certain designer brand names.  I invested in 7.1 but you can use 5.1 as well.It may seem minor but my fave benefit of this receiver is the five in, single out HDMI ports.  One problem I had with the BDV-E770W was the lack of HDMI out.  I didn’t know the importance of this at the time until using up all four HDMI ports on my TV.  As our system grew to include in addition to the BDV-E770W, a cable DVR, a PS4, a Wii-U, and an Apple TV, we found ourselves one port short.  I thought of purchasing an HDMI switch but good luck finding one with even a scant hint of reliability based upon reviews.  Then this beauty of a receiver came along for review and solved my problem.  The HDMI ports are labeled to enable different systems, game, Blu-ray, cable, etc.  I currently run a PS4, Apple TV, Wii-U, Cable DVR and even added a Roku to the mix.  Apple TV and Roku seem redundant but they’re not.  Rook gets many channels Apple TV does not.  Speaking of Apple TV, we usually use that instead of Airplay because it interacts flawlessly with our iOS devices and Macs.  We don’t use Android devices, so Googlecast streaming is no big deal to us.  However, we have several close family members who are Android devotees, so it’s a good feature to have when those relatives visit and want to stream from their devices.

"8/27/15 update: Well, I've been taking this product regularly for over a month. After decades of discomfort, zero relief from numerous GI docs and pretty much giving up any hope of having a normal digestive system, I feel great! All of my digestive issues have disappeared. That's not hyperbole, it's fact. You name it, I've tried it. Zantac, Prilosec, Compazine.... Nothing worked. I've been scoped so many times, I should have a wing of the endoscopy clinic named after me. GI docs were little to no help. ""Stop eating leafy foods"", ""stop consuming dairy"", ""it's just something you unfortunately have to deal with"".  One GI doctor actually told me it was perfectly normal that I was taking up to eight pills of Immodium daily to prevent the production of gastrin. After a month on mastic gum, my stomach feels as normal and healthy as it did nearly 25 years ago. That's the last time it felt normal.  I can now eat pretty much whatever I want without disastrous consequences afterward. No more taking Immodium before each day trip as a safeguard. The best part is I haven't experienced any side-effects whatsoever. If you have stomach issues, do yourself a favor and try mastic gum.  Even if it's not Jarrows, just try it. I do plan to stick with Jarrow. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  I never heard of imastic gum before it was offered to me through Vine but I plan to continue using it regularly.  I'm about to order a new bottle after I finish this update. That's what prompted me to update and add that fifth and well deserved star.I am the perfect candidate to try this product.  I have suffered with stomach issues for decades.  At times, my stomach pains were painful enough to end up in ER.  I wasted valuable years being misdiagnosed with the generic condition ""I.B.S"" (irritable bowel syndrome).  I got so tired of that diagnosis that the acronym took on an entirely different meaning in my mind. Every time I'd hear another doctor say ""IBS"", I'd think to myself ""yep, you sure do.""  I finally received a proper diagnosis a few years ago.  The problem is that by then, the damage was already done.  As a result, one of the conditions I now suffer from is low stomach acid.  This results in an overproduction of gastrin which causes tons of discomfort.  I have been taking care of myself and eating a diet suited to my condition.  However, I still have occasional days where overproduction of gastrin makes for a miserable experience.  I was offered the opportunity to try this mastic gum and decided to try it out. I'm not looking for short-term or immediate relief of temporary discomfort.  I'm looking for an all natural method to help with long-term maintenance and symptom prevention.I have been taking the mastic gum for nearly two weeks now.  After decades of suffering, I'm not going to immediately crown anything as the miracle cure.  However, so far, the mastic gum tablets have been doing pretty good.  I haven't had any bad stomach discomfort (intense pains and cramps) since I started taking it, so that's a definite plus.  I also noticed, and I'll put this delicately, a difference in the bathroom.  I won't get into all the explicit details but let's just say things run more smoothly from start to finish.  I have no sudden urgency to go, no inability to go nor do I go too frequently as I routinely experienced before starting the gum.  I'd like to continue to see improvement for at least an entire month before I accept mastic gum as a long term tool for relief.  I really like the improvement in my digestive comfort that I've experienced so far and have every intention to continue taking it for the foreseeable future.  With that being said, it's not a cure-all.  I still eat a diet appropriate for my condition and make sure I get adequate water and fiber daily.  IF not, even the mastic gum can't prevent certain discomforts.  I've already found this out firsthand when I didn't get enough fluids or fiber one day in particular.The pills are rather large and the bottle instructs to take two at a time on an empty stomach (1000mg).  I started with one until I was certain there were no reactions, side-effects or intolerance.  I can personally swallow both pills relatively easily but they are pretty large. There is a slight plant-like smell but no taste through the capsules containing the powder. The bottle has a two month supply (120 500mg pills).  It contains no gluten or dairy and is vegan safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMXD5BF386JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFORC02#wasThisHelpful","R1QMXD5BF386JP","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These buds are pretty decent sounding for the price.  Although they don’t sound as good as the $120 buds I bought my wife this past winter, they easily beat out my iPhone bundled OEM buds.  The bass, while noticeable, isn’t deep or heavy.  It sounds fairly decent for a set of inexpensive buds and balances nicely with the treble and midrange.  However, I have to clarify that the bass doesn't always sound good.  The higher the volume, the better the bass sounds.  At lower volumes, it tends to sound flat or disappear altogether.  Overall sound seems pretty crisp although the gel caps can occasionally cause friction noise while moving.The buds fit nicely in my ear and stay put with little or no movement even when I’m active.  I’ve exercised with them while constantly moving my head and body without any issues with the buds popping out.  Besides a perfect fit in my ear canal, the cord is just the right length to reach from my iPod in my pocket to my ears without the buds popping out due to the cord being to short or he buds being ripped out due to the cord being too long.  I’ve purchased numerous bargain buds from Amazon, from as little as $7 to roughly the same price as these.  These buds are among the better sounding of the bunch.  They’re pretty decent sounding for budget priced buds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNSGCZ5WFCCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3A0G50#wasThisHelpful","R3HNSGCZ5WFCCQ","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this set for under thirty bucks on sale.  For the money, it's a hard to beat value.  Sound is good, not great but definitely not bad.  There is no static or interference and voices are loud and clear.  The sound quality isn't absolute top notch crystal clear like it was on the > $100 phones I typically bought in the past.  However, given that I spend very little time talking on landlines anymore, it is more than adequate.  The speakerphone is also nice and clear and not muffled like it is on some other inexpensive phones.  The batteries last several days between charges, even with moderate use. Most of the ringer tones are nice and loud.  That means you don't have to choose a ringer tone that you may like a little less than another simply because it's the only loud tone.  The illuminated keys make the phone easier to use not only in dim lighting but even in regular lighting.  Lastly, it has built in voicemail autodialing and message waiting indicator that work nicely if you subscribe to home voicemail through your telecom carrier. Of course, nothing is perfect, so there are a few cons, nothing major.  I wish the LCD backlight were just a tad brighter or even adjustable.  I can't even tell if it's illuminated in moderate light.  The LCD also doesn't have much contrast.  My old Panasonic handsets were much more contrasty by comparison.  I could see the data on the LCD from across the room on those handsets whereas this phone has to be within 3 feet for me to read the LCD while illuminated and closer than a foot to adequately read it when not illuminated.  Adding to this issue is the fact that the phone does not have any flashing LED lights to indicate when you have voicemail messages awaiting retrieval. Then again, neither does my iPhone, so I'm already used to that inconvenience.  The menu system can be a little confusing to navigate at times.  When I use the directional pad to check caller ID or access the directory, it's hard to tell one form the other.  You have to push up to access the phone book and down to access caller ID.  The natural inclination is to continue pushing the up button to cycle through the phone book.  However, the correct method is to push up and then push down to cycle through.  You can still cycle through by pushing up twice, but the phone beeps indicating an error before proceeding.  It just feels a bit clumsy.  Speaking of funky buttons, if you are on speakerphone and push ""Talk"" to attempt to switch to the handset, it disconnects.  You have to push the ""Speakerphone"" button.  This has resulted in more than one episode of phone rage after spending (or more like wasting) up to an hour on hold only to inadvertently disconnect the other party when they finally answered.So far, I am very happy with this phone, especially for the price.  The only thing I miss from my old Panasonic is the audible caller ID.  It was very convenient to know who was calling without looking at the handset.  It almost made telemarketers and other annoying callers somewhat tolerable.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied with this phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DMSVLUC8VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N22M0XS#wasThisHelpful","R26DMSVLUC8VW","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Hoover SteamVac user for many years, I'm hard pressed to find anything particularly different about this machine compared to the consumer-grade version. The design of my last purchased consumer-grade Hoover, the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914900, is fairlly similar, except the consumer model has an accessory hose included.  Suction and cleaning ability are about the same.  Operation and water tanks are the same right down to the fragile plastic side latches on the water return tank that I really dislike.  The extraction motor has the same amp rating. Other than a 35-foot orange heavy gauge power cord, I am honestly hard pressed to find anything that truly sets this apart as a commercial steamer.Having said that, I've always loved the performance of my Hoover SteamVacs.  They are super easy to assemble. Two screws w/nuts, a philips head screwdriver and two minutes of time is all it usually takes to assemble.  Hoover SteamVacs have also been very good and reliable cleaners for me over the past two decades.  They helped me clean after several kids and a few dogs over the years.  This commercial cleaner so far seems just as effective at loosening and removing soil from carpet as the aforementioned consumer grade SteamVac.  I also own a Bissell ProHeat.  The biggest difference between Hoover and Bissell is primarily the tanks.  Bissell uses a single tank system with an interior bladder inside the tank for the clean water and the remainder of the tank used for the dirty water return.  Some are completely turned off by the design but I didn't find it that bad.  From a convenience and efficiency standpoint, the two tank system is better, especially when you need to dump any unused cleaning solution/water.  It's easier emptying tanks on the Hoover than the Bissell.  The biggest complaint I've encountered over the years on the Hoover vac has always been sudden loss of suction.  More often than not, it's caused by a poor seal on the water return tank or other opening. The one upside of the commercial version lacking the extension/accessory hose of the consumer version is the fact that it results in fewer potential leaks which could lead to dramatically decreased or complete loss of suction.I guess the only thing left to compare is durability.  As much as I  loved my Hoovers of the mid/late 90's and early 2000's, my last Hoover, the above mentioned consumer Steamvac was purchased in 2013 and broke within a year.  One of the plastic retaining clips on the side of the bottom tank snapped off.  It wasn't worth the attempt to repair, so I tossed it and began using a Bissell I had lying around.  I'm happy to be back to using a Hoover and curious to see if the commercial version is more durable.  Seeing the same plastic retaining clip on the commercial steamer doesn't exactly fill me with confidence but we'll see how it goes.  Honestly, if you are truly looking for a bonafide commercial steamer, I'd suggest looking for just that.  There just isn't enough about this commercial Hoover to justify recommending it over the much cheaper consumer-grade SteamVac.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16W9UPLIK0HF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I9X4#wasThisHelpful","R16W9UPLIK0HF6","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used numerous vacuums over the years, both commercial and consumer.  Of the few commercial vacuums I've used the past 16 years, I never purchased any that included attachments.  For my particular needs, I never needed them on my commercial uprights.  I wanted models built like tanks with strong reliable motors, headlights and magnetic bumpers on the front for picking up paper clips, staples and other hazards before they got sucked up and potentially damaged the vacuum.  The consumer grade vacuums I use at home have all the fancy attachments and other bells and whistles.  My work vacuums were alway workhorses.  I prefer the basic but powerful and reliable vacuums at the office.  I'm vacuuming around desks and chairs, not inside sofa or love seat cushions like I do at home. I need something that can take a little abuse and withstand daily use in a commercial environment.This vacuum is extremely lightweight.  The body is primarily built of plastic.  Despite the lightweight feel, it is capable of handling occasional accidental bumps and knocks against furniture.  It does lack some of the commercial vac features that I prefer, like the aforementioned light and magnetic bumpers but it does have a thick industrial grade interchangeable power cord.  In fact, the cord feels like the heaviest part of the vacuum.  Although the included 35' cord is already long enough for most uses, I swapped it out with my own 50' cord.  Less plugging/unplugging.  The bag housing is a sturdy mesh fabric and unzips for very easy bag monitoring and changing.  The power button is illuminated was well as the high/low suction button.  The wheels are nice, large and grippy on hard surfaces.  I could honest push this thing all day long.  In addition to being light, the motor is so powerful, at times it almost feels like a self-propelled because you can feel the suction pulling the vacuum a bit.The star of the show is the motor.  I use commercial vacuums in large open areas that see a lot of traffic.  Suction is my number one concern.  I want to clean several rooms with wide open spaces as quickly and in as  few passes as possible.  In many small businesses, the employees or the owners do the cleaning rather than outside cleaners.  The last thing I, or anyone else, wants after a hard day of work is to be forced push a heavy ineffective vacuum four or five times over an area just to pick up all the debris.  The suction on this thing is insane. One pass is usually all it takes to get a nice clean carpet with no noticeable traces of debris.  I definitely didn't expect such performance out of something so light but the heavy duty cord suggests the motor drains some serious amps, and the suction power confirms it.  In that regard, the light weight is very misleading compared to the suction. Despite the effectiveness and power of the motor, it is also very quiet. The vacuum has a check bag light in the event the bag fills up or the nozzle clogs.  It also has a failsafe where the brush stops spinning to protect the belt in the event of a clogged nozzle. Bag, belt and brush roll are all user serviceable and replacements are easy, requiring nothing more than a philips head screwdriver at most.For the price/performance ratio, I really can't see a downside to this vacuum.  Obviously, if you require attachments or other bells and whistles, this probably isn't your vacuum.  The motor is also probably overkill for home use and doesn't include the attachments typically needed for home cleaning.  However, if you're a small business owner who doesn't contract out for office cleaning, this is an effective and powerful cleaner at a decent price point.  It's basic in design and function but for many businesses, that's all we need, as long as it cleans well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26L5PTMHSHMO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R26L5PTMHSHMO8","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This headset is very comfortable with soft cups that cushion the ear with virtually no pressure.  It’s  corded and plugs into an adapter that plugs into the port on the bottom of the Xbox One controller.  The adapter is similar to the factory bundled Xbox headset adapter.  Both have buttons that allow you to adjust volume and mute the mic.  This headset also allows you to mute sound through the cups.  The headset also comes with another cord that has an adapter that can split the single consolidated mic/sound cord into separate mic/headphone cords.  This makes the headset compatible with dedicated mic/sound ports, such as those found on computers. The microphone retracts in/out of the left cup and is flexible to be bent to a preferred angle.  There is another mic mute button on the left ear cup  The headphones adjust but they don’t open as wide as some others that I’ve owned.  If you have a large head or a substantial amount of hair, these may fit tight if at all, even at the widest opening.I’ve tried and owned numerous gaming headphones, from cheap sub-$40 models to high end models costing $300 or more.  I’ve learned that price isn’t always a true indicator of quality or sound.  These headphones are moderately priced, so although I wasn’t expecting the absolute best sound experience, I figured they’d sound a little decent.  Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed the first time I connected it to my Xbox One.  I kept hearing popping and crackling noises through the headset.  I heard the distortion while navigating the main Xbox One menu as well as in-game.  I tried the headset in a computer as well as an iPod and did not hear the sounds.  The sound quality of the headset while playing music is very good.  Not only did the popping and crackling disappear but the sound was clear and distortion-free with nice tight bass.  They also did a decent job of blocking outside noises.  I tried the headphones again with my Xbox, even after the latest system update and I still get the crackling and popping sounds.So, that leaves me in a little bit of a dilemma trying to rate the headset.  I’d give comfort, build and sound on iPod and PC a solid four.  However, if this headset were purchased exclusively for use on my Xbox, I’d likely give it a two or even one star because I am unable to eliminate the popping/crackling sound.  I can’t definitively fault the headphones because they work well in other devices. However, I also can’t definitively blame my Xbox or the controller because the cheap OEM bundled headset works just fine.  Taking everything into consideration, the fairest rating I could give was a three-star.  I read other reviews to see if anyone else experienced the distortion and apparently it doesn’t appear to be common.  Maybe I got a dud set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WR7AXKAUR964/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3OK0A#wasThisHelpful","R1WR7AXKAUR964","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s no nice way to say this.  Lightning cables are junk.  They fall apart, constantly.  It doesn’t matter who manufactures the cable, they are inherently flawed in their design.  For whatever reason, the rubber sleeve is extremely fragile at the portion leading up to the lightning connector.  It frequently rips and falls apart.  The cords damage very easily.  You don’t have to abuse the sleeve to make it rip.  Simply moving the phone around or attempting to use it while it’s plugged in can cause the cable to rip apart eventually.  Anything other than extremely careful use will usually result in a ripped cable eventually.  Apple users are some of the most devoted and forgiving in the business and even they almost universally slam lightning cables, primarily due to poor durability.  I have lost count of the number of cables I’ve replaced due to this problem.  I'm one of those extremely careful users and even I have had several opportunities where my cable could have ripped, usually by accidentally and slightly tugging on the cord while my phone was charging.  Normally, such a minor ""abuse"" wouldn't hurt most phones,, but these protecting these cables is like protecting a carton of eggs.  My wife and kids constantly use their phones, so they go through these cables like crazy.  None of us experienced these poor durability issues with the old 30-pin connector cables.  We had one or two fail due to bad connector pins but the cables themselves were very durable.I gave up on Apple's OEM Lightning cables long ago because ironically, they seemed to be the most unreliable brand of all.  They're also not exactly cheap.  Among the aftermarket brands, I have generally had good luck with Belkin Lightning cables.  They're usually thicker and more durable than Apple's cables. However, I’ve recently had two relatively thick Belkin cable sleeves rip apart along the rubber sleeve right before the lightning connector.  That's the same exact spot where all of the other cables ripped and failed.  I was offered the chance to try out this 90-degree angle Belkin cord and figured it was worth a shot to see if it makes a difference.  The cord is about the same thickness as Apple's OEM cable but feels more firm than the Apple cable.  I haven’t had it long enough to speak about long-term durability but so far, I like the design because it helps prevent pulling on the cord to remove from the phone. Almost every cord that I’ve lost has come apart near the lightning connector.  In redesigning the connector on a right angle, I'm hopeful that Belkin has found a way to reduce stress on the cord and finally offer a solution for the cord ripping issue. Believe me, I will be back to report if I have yet another cable fail prematurely.  Based on the fact that this cable pretty much forces you to pull the lightning adapter out by the connector and not the plug (unless you're completely reckless), I admittedly have some optimism that it might just last.  I've given the cable to one of the busiest iPhone users in our household.  The cord will be used regularly in multiple environments both at work and home as well as frequently swapped between wall and vehicle chargers.  I actually want it to be abused as much as possible so I can determine relatively quickly if it can withstand the rigors of what I consider reasonable normal use.  I hope it does.  It's a shame that I still have four fully functional 30-PIN connectors from older iPods and iPads.  One 30-pin cable is over seven years old and outlasted the iOS device itself.  However, out of ten Lightning enabled iOS devices, only two still have functioning original OEM Lightning cables.  The others have all had the cables replaced at least once, some multiple times.  I really hope Apple finds a new format or improves the design ASAP.  Until then, I hope this Belkin can prove to be more reliable.  The cord is manufactured in China (for those who may be curious to know) and is MFi certified.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFC7XJR652P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW0WS8C#wasThisHelpful","R1AFC7XJR652P9","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just gave this bag to my high-schooler to use. The bag it replaced, a High Sierra, was starting to show signs of age, wear and tear.  The Dell Bag is a little smaller than the High Sierra but does have some nice features.  For one, it seems to be built more for travel or active use.  It has a sizable pocket in the rear that should accommodate most laptops up to 17” and the middle compartment has a pocket sized perfectly for a standard 10” tablet.  The tablet will rely on whatever surrounds it for protection, so pack wisely.  The cushioning surrounding the laptop compartment is adequate and the rear of the bag is more dense and rigid than the rest but lacks a firm insert like many other bags have.  The Dell bag is also a tad smaller than the High Sierra bag.  The exterior is 100% polyester and has a glossy appearance compared to the more fabric-type appearance of the other bag.  The upside is that it also seems to be more water-resistant than the prior bag.  The bag has several compartments, clasps and other features to help accommodate active lifestyles.

"Well, I was a little apprehensive about this book prior to reading.  I currently enjoy the whacky humor of Cracked and have followed it for decades, since the days when it was in magazine form and competing against the likes of Mad and National Lampoon.  Although I was a little unsure what to expect and admittedly had moderate expectations, Brockway actually wrote a very entertaining book.  The action gets started immediately on the very first page and from there, it alternates between calm and mayhem as we time hop between 1977 New York and 2013 Los Angeles following the actions of our two protagonists, Carey and Kaitlyn.  The detailed synopsis in the book description does a good job of outlining the plot, so I won’t rehash what you already know about the story.I’ll share my feelings about the book instead.  The pacing and character development are pretty decent although they can seemingly appear to be a little fast at times.  For instance, at one point, it instantly jumped from one character wondering what’s going on and fleeing from the strange events and beings to that character suddenly becoming a karate roundhouse kicking version of Buffy the Unnoticeable Slayer.  Once you understand Brockway’s time-hopping flow, things make more sense.  Brockway does a nice job of connecting the dots into a cohesive story and the end result is a fun, interesting and ultimately enjoyable book.  The Unnoticeables does have plenty of gore and sexual references (some of which are pretty strong).  Anyone who has ever watched and enjoyed an R-rated slasher flick will find nothing shocking, alarming or offensive within the pages.  In fact, some of Stephen King’s earlier works contained more gore and even more shocking sexual content.  I don’t think I’ll meet much opposition when saying King is also considered to be arguably the greatest horror writer of modern times.  So, unless you’re really faint of heart  (as in pass out at the slightest sight of blood), you needn't worry about being offended.  As for the book itself, I enjoyed it immensely.  It's been a while since I enjoyed reading horror.  After the aforementioned King decided to start moving out of the paranormal horror realm and into the thriller/horror, there was a void that actually went unfilled until reading this book.  I tried reading Koontz but just could't get into his style.  The Unnoticeables was genuinely fun to read and captivating.  It says it all when you sit a book down to take a break and immediately pick it back up and continue reading.I liked this book enough to check out some of Brockway’s other books.  I’m currently reading Everything is Going to Kill Everybody.  That one has more of a Cracked feel to it and more reminiscent of the crazy lists that Cracked frequently posts.  It's a fun book but the Unnoticeables is definitely in a class of it’s own as a true horror/fantasy/science fiction type novel.  At 286 pages, including acknowledgements and other beginning non-story content, it can easily be completed in a day and is a worthy read for science-fiction and horror fans.  I like Brockway’s carefree humorous writing style.  You also gotta love a guy who starts his book off by dedicating it to everyone who basically predicted his failure.  On one final note, I am reviewing an advance preview copy.  Therefore, it’s possible that some of the content or formatting may have changed in the final published version. I seriously doubt anything changed drastically enough to sway my opinion of the book but it’s still worth mentioning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JMJO5N0YRTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076537966X#wasThisHelpful","R8JMJO5N0YRTM","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The short list of features on this lightweight no-frills iron include an ample sized water reservoir, non-stick soleplate, auto-shutoff, self-cleaning, 8.5 foot swivel power cord and variable steam.  The weight and ergonomics of the iron are a great for those looking for a lighter iron.  I personally prefer a heavier iron but that’s purely a matter of different taste.  This iron will satisfy most day to day ironing chores and is perfect for a limited living space such as a dorm room.  The heat and steam are suitable for any material, even more wrinkle-prone materials like denim and 100% cotton.  The light weight enables it to be more easily used on a variety of surfaces such as a mattress, for those without an ironing board.  It is also easy to store away thanks to a very manageable size and weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEH7QGOM7ZB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV70M2U#wasThisHelpful","R3NEH7QGOM7ZB3","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This soft and very comfortable mattress topper is a significant improvement over the primarily protective topper that was already on our bed.  I washed the original topper and now keep both toppers installed because the other has a more substantial liquid barrier.  I’m a bit of a klutz, so I like having a strong spill-proof barrier.  Both fit my mattress perfectly and work well together.  This topper remains cool and doesn’t absorb or reflect body heat while laying on it.  Although warmth is a good thing during the cooler months, I prefer warmth from the covers above me, not below.  You can always toss aside a comforter if it gets too warm. I’ve had many plush toppers and this one is among the softest and thickest of the bunch.  It doesn’t match the plush feeling of a memory foam topper but it will improve the comfort of most mattresses, especially those without a  pillow-top.  I don’t know hoe well it protects against fluid spills but the liner doesn’t appear to be as leak-proof as the topper beneath it, at least not when visually comparing the protective barriers.  Actual effectiveness could be different, so take that visual observation with a grain of salt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GXM2HR80NXDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5LSHLI#wasThisHelpful","R2GXM2HR80NXDL","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones are very cheaply made. They're basically constructed with a cheap plastic head band, low quality foam and thin paper. Everything is glued together.  They fell apart as soon as I took them out of the shipping bag.  The foam and paper separated and peeled away from the headband.  This happened on one side first and then the other.  I bought them for my daughter and she hadn't even had an opportunity to see them before they fell apart.  I began a return with Amazon but for eight bucks, it just wasn't worth it.  I'd considered building a pair myself but realized I'd spend at least eight bucks on supplies.  So I canceled the return and plan to glue everything back with stronger glue and hope it can withstand a couple days at max of cosplay.  I certainly don't expect anything more than that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVX9363TA5PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXIV6DW#wasThisHelpful","ROVX9363TA5PD","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this base coat for my wife to try.  The first thing she had me do was feel the difference between an untreated nail and a treated nail.  I could tell the treated nail was slightly harder and less flexible.  She said she was satisfied with the strength and ability to help her prevent chipping another nail like she had recently done.  She also mentioned that it works fine with her nail polish.  She assured me that strength, appearance and performance with nail polish were the most important attributes.  The first day she wore it to work, she purposely didn't wear gloves so she could test how well it protected her nails.  She has a very hands-on intensive job and frequently chips her nails.  After that first day, she had no chips and her polish still looked freshly applied at the end of the day.  She's happy with the protection it offers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWFMD0UL62V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FZDPW0#wasThisHelpful","R1BWFMD0UL62V7","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This umbrella is a compact size.  It’s good more for portability rather than maximum protection from the elements.  I previously carried the long umbrellas because they open wide and provide adequate protection for tall guys like me.  I tend to have fewer problems with water draining down the sides of larger umbrellas and onto my legs and back like I do with smaller umbrellas.  Larger umbrellas also tend to be stronger and more solidly built.  The downside to larger umbrellas is that they are a pain to stow away both in the vehicle and while out and about.  Given my current limited need for an umbrella, a smaller model is now sufficient.  If you normally require a large umbrella and plan to use it extensively, this umbrella may not be wide enough.The vents seem like a good idea and, most importantly, don’t leak.  I haven’t had any severe storms to test them and I am seldom outdoors long enough to do so anyhow.  I usually go straight from garage to indoor parking on work days.  I primarily use umbrellas for the pit stops along the way.  However, there are days where I make longer outdoor runs or just hang outdoors for events.  I've encountered some spring rain but thankfully, nothing serious yet this season.  The most I’ve encountered so far was light to moderate rain, no severe storms.  If I do get a chance to use this in windy conditions and it fails to live up to the billing, you'll be the first to know.The construction seems 50/50.  The canopy material and ergonomic rubber grip both feel nice and sound.  The push-button to open works well.  The ribs seem to bunch up and get stuck during the opening and closing.  I had problems with the ribs on the very first use.  I have to be very careful to avoid bending or snapping them.  The clumsy action and fragile appearance of the ribs doesn’t particularly fill me with confidence and makes me wonder how long they will last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Z51FCQ3KAL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053GFAJC#wasThisHelpful","R29Z51FCQ3KAL8","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After removing the Sculpt from the box, I noticed there were no detailed instructions included.  I found a “Getting Started” insert that had some very basic tips and a URL that guided me to a web page where I was able to view and download the manual in PDF form.The first thing I did was replace the included 3 foot mini-USB charging cable with a 5 watt AC smartphone charger.  It gave me a little more length to work with so the devoice wouldn’t have to sit on the floor while charging.  After ensuring the adapter worked and the unit was charging, I allowed it to charge for several hours.  There really isn’t any observable indication of charging status while it’s in the cradle.  The edges glow red and the screen displays a charging icon when you first sit it in the cradle but both turn off after a few seconds.  You simply take it out of the cradle when you believe it’s fully charged.After allowing the Aim to charge, I decided to get to work measuring muscle mass and body fat.  First, I filled the little included spray bottle with distilled water (not a requirement but advisable from my past experience mixing water and electronics or appliances).  Then I downloaded and installed the iOS Skulpt app on my iPhone.  The companion app is attractive and very well designed.  It’s one of the better quality apps that I’ve seen a while.  Upon launching the app, I was instructed to create an account and enter some basic body info (weight, height, gender, age, and right or left handed).  After completing the initial setup, it prompted me for an initial measurement.  I then powered on the Aim.  The display is bright and clear.  It’s not high-res but not blocky low-res either.  It fits nicely in the middle and is vivid and clear.  It took me a second or two to get the hang of measuring, mainly due to ensuring the skin has good contact with the wet sensors.  I found that adjusting the position of the meter and/or pressure against my skin helped if it had a hard time establishing a reading. Nevertheless, taking measurements is fairly simple and the companion app does a splendid job of demonstrating exactly how to take a measurement and alerting you when to continue.  I spray the contacts with water, press the Aim against the indicated muscle(s) in the manner shown in the animated example and wait for the solid green light.  From there, I click the “Got It” button on the smartphone (it appears when a measurement is correctly taken)  and move to the next measurement.  After all measurements are taken, the app and device both inform me I’m done and display my MQ (muscle quality) and body fat percentage on both devices.  That’s it. Nothing complicated.The results are pretty accurate and consistent with prior body fat measurements that I had performed  as well as my body fat caliper.  This device is a great motivational tool for workouts.  If you’re working out effectively,  the MQ should gradually increase and body fat percentage should decrease even if the mirror or scale don’t necessarily show a dramatic or immediate transformation.  My entire family measured themselves with the meter.  One note, results don’t sync in guest mode.  My wife and teens only wanted the one reading out of curiosity.  If they decide to measure regularly, I will set up extra users. The Aim device can accommodate multiple users but the app can only accommodate one user at a time.  Each additional user needs their own app. I use it every day to keep myself motivated and pushing for better results from my workouts.  The only thing that I’m not particularly thrilled about is the water requirement.  The Aim tends to get soaked with water running along the sides and coming in contact with all metal contacts, including the charging contacts.  On one occasion, I was about to place the Aim into the charging cradle when I noticed a tiny drop of water seep from one of the sensors.  I thought I had thoroughly dried the device and ensured that no remaining water was present but I was obviously wrong.  I think it seeped from the side of a sensor.  I now allow the Aim to sit and dry for an entire day before charging, especially since I’m using an AC wall adapter instead of a USB port.  It may be overkill but I don’t necessarily need daily readings, so it’s no inconvenience to me to play it extra safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNV6Z87XBO0DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2SWMUI#wasThisHelpful","RNV6Z87XBO0DB","A2WB7LZ595CR50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WB7LZ595CR50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So I own a 3 season cabin in Wisconsin. It's starting to get quite cold at night, and when it gets cold, the bed gets really cold. I put this heated mattress pad on the bed. It was very easy to put on and fit my extra think mattress with no problems. The cords were easy to snap in place and there was plenty of cord to place the two control units where I wanted them. I turned one of the controls on to 4 (out of 10) and then read on the couch for a while. When I crawled into bed about an hour later it was all toasty and nice. The zone I left turn off was very chilly. It was so nice to get into a warm bed. There is also a timer that you can set to turn the unit off after a number of set hours. The control unit lights up, but the light goes out after a minute or so which was good thinking on the designers part. I love this thing. It's going to allow me you use my cabin well into the winter and not freeze at night!Notes:- I could not feel the wires through the sheet.- Fits extra think mattresses- Easy to put on and set up- Nice long cords to allow for any placement you want- Timer on control unit will turn the pad off after a set number of hours- Light on control unit turns itself off after a minute or less- Well built.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJAJNAFSDTU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHI9NU#wasThisHelpful","R2LJAJNAFSDTU3","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit is sweet. It lets me enjoy music instead of counting my laps and continually calculating how many more laps until I can quit. This is designed for swimming laps or distances and listening to music when doing so. It is not for playing in the water at the beach, running in the rain, or taking a shower. If you understand why you need goggles when swimming, then you are not a swimmer.It was very easy to get music onto it. The magnetic dock was a nice touch and snaps the player in place by itself. There is plenty of space for your music. I put the straps of my goggles through the slots in the player and adjusted it until it felt right. It doesn't have to be in any one perfect place to work. It's very forgiving. I also wore earplugs to keep the water out of my ears and this enhanced the sound even more. When my head was under water it sounded it's best. It was very pleasant swimming being able to listen to my music.Other people here at the office swim as well and are very excited to try this player out so I will be passing it around.I can't recommend this unit enough for anyone who swims distances and missed their music. It is very well made, easy to use and sounds great.Notes:- Made for serious swimmers. If you are not wearing goggles when you swim then this isn't for you.- Excellent sound quality- Does not need to be perfectly placed on your head to sound good- Works even better with ear plugs- Very easy to put music on- Magnetic dock works great and is an excellent idea- Easy to use controls- Very well made and solid- Plug the dock directly into your PC like other devices it might draw too much power from your USB hub.- Charges quickly and has a long battery life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NDBEIQBL5YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169RSNGK#wasThisHelpful","R19NDBEIQBL5YW","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This remote is AWESOME! I set aside a block of time to get this setup and working and didn't need most of it. So then I got to sit and play with it. I also have the Harmony One and 700. They are both great, but setup one these older models was nowhere near as easy as it was on the Elite. The new setup software works very well. The hardware allows for many different home theater setups. You can even select various combinations for what device sends the IR signal. The remote feel great in your hand and is fun to use. I’m not going to want kids to touch it and I’m going make sure my hands are clean as well!Bottom Line:  This is the best universal remote I have ever tried. It’s easy to use, flexible and high quality. The setup is easy to do and allows for flexibility in how you set it up. I recommend this remote. I will be changing over my home automation to a format that is compatible with the harmony.Setup:- I used the PC software to setup my remote since my phone battery was almost dead. It took me about twenty minutes to set it up. It went so fast I was almost disappointed since I love playing around with these types of devices.- First it downloads a system update. Then walks you through the setup.- The software allows you to import settings from an older remote, but mine was too old and I wanted to start clean.- Once the hub is connected to your network, the setup program will scan your network for connected devices and let you add them.- Entering model numbers is easy. If you get close it suggests the correct one. It knew when I entered the remote model number and told me!- Activities were painless to set up. I knew my Source and Input numbers from the old software so everything went smoothly.- I put the hub in the back of my room to see if it would work from there. It did. It was unable to hit my Xbox, so I used advanced setting to change the Xbox- There are also to IR blasters for use in different types of setups.- IR only, RF is not supported (so DirecTV boxes need to be in IR mode)Usage:- I love the look and feel of this remote. It has heft.- I love the favorite channel feature. You can add up to 50 channels to the screen. They have their logos and look great.- Charging cradle looks nice and is easy to get remote in and out of- Very easy to change between menus.- On remote help works very wellNotes:- Feel great, looks great, works great.- Can be set up to use a combination of the hub and remote to send IR signals- Touch screen is top notch.- If you have multiple Harmony remotes you might need multiple versions of the software and multiple accounts.- My lighting home automation isn’t compatible with the Harmony so I will be switching to a format that is so I can use the Harmony to turn them off and on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKQ4YH6N2UOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDFP9S#wasThisHelpful","R2TKQ4YH6N2UOC","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the most part, I think most people choose a protein bar because of taste.  I had the chocolate peanut butter which tasted great, soft and chewy like a brownie, with a little bit of nut taste and crunchiness.  As far as macros are concerned, mid-level amount of protein, fat, and carbs (20g/6g/16g respectively) versus other bars, but it is smaller than the others and will not make you full.  The price is not bad, when you buy the box it works out to less than $1.50 per bar.  I think it’s a great bar to throw in your gym bag before your workout so you’re not bloated or for after to get you through until you can get a real meal.

"This garden is really cool. It was super easy to set up. My 11 year old daughter was very excited to do it. She read the instructions and did everything herself. The instructions are very well done. It comes with 6 pods all ready to grow 6 herbs. The unit will tell you when to add water and plant food. A pump runs to move the water but we never hear it. The light is very bright. It's like the sun is coming through the window. We have an open floor plan and I can see the light from my upstairs bedroom. I adjust the light cycle time so it doesn't stay on so long.

"This set came packaged 3 boxes deep. First the shipping box, then another brown box, then the box with the printing. It was in perfect condition. The two boards Velcro together and have handle to allow you to carry it. The boards are slick and the bags slide some but it seems to be the same as most of the other commercial sets I've played on. They are not indestructible. You need to treat them well so they will last. The bags seem to have a plastic bag of sand inside them. I like the feel and thought they flew well. I think this is a decent starter set and a nice choice to all along to the game.Notes:- Came shipped 3 boxes deep. Arrived in perfect condition.- Boards Velcro together with handle for carrying.

Feels like sand inside.- Seems about medium quality.- We had a lot of fun with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Y3UDUSX0G0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EAU9Z0#wasThisHelpful","R25Y3UDUSX0G0Y","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice watch. It is big, but not too big. It is very solid and has good weight to it. It has front and back windows into the inner workings of the watch. You can see the gears moving. I find myself taking it off to show people.  It is very well done and looks great. The band is a very nice leather. Not the kind you should be getting we even though the watch is water resistant to 99 feet. This just protects it from getting caught in the rain or spills. I would treat this as a business casual and dress up watch. I won't be working in the yard with it on, it's too nice. I feel extra dressed up when I'm wearing this.So I have to admit I couldn't figure out how the band worked. I had to come look at the pictures on Amazon where I saw that the main clasp unfolds to extend the band and allow you to put it on and slide the leather band into the buckle with the pin. It works well once you know how. I didn't want to force anything and break it.Bottom Line: This is a great looking and feeling watch. It would make a great gift for yourself or someone else. I speak to how it will hold up over time but in no way does it feel cheap.Notes:- Manual wind. Didn't quite make it 2 days on a wind.- Clasp unfolds to allow sliding it over your wrist- Comes in a very nice box- Windows on the front and back of the watch show the inner workings- Is an excellent conversation piece- Would make a kick butt gift- Very solid feeling and heavy- Looks very classy on my wrist- Water resistant to 99 feet but leather band isn't the kind you would want to get wet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYV7CP9YEIV2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXMWZK#wasThisHelpful","RYV7CP9YEIV2P","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SKLZ heavy ball is a great item for training, especially if you start practicing with the heavy ball then go to the regular ball, which ends up feeling like a toy.  There is no weight listed on the ball but I’m guessing it’s about 3 lbs. which is enough to feel a difference but not heavy enough to make you seem like you’re weightlifting.  The ball is made of rubber that has good grip, it won’t slip out of your hands and sticks to your fingertips.  Another great thing is that it’s an indoor/outdoor ball because using it in the house will not make people in the home very happy.  We’ve used it in the driveway, garage, and basement so far the ball hasn’t lost any grip.The three people to use it are dad, a 14 year old daughter, and a 9 year old daughter.  Both kids have been playing basketball for their schools (the older one being her 5th year with the school and club and the younger one is in her first year at school).  We were able to use it for dribbling and passing drills, where they noticed a difference when using it for 5 minutes then switching to the regulation ball.  For the chest passes though the younger one would drop it more because she was a little afraid of the weight coming in too fast.We have a portable hoop (filled with sand) that has a poly-carbonate backboard.  Shooting at it is not recommended because the backboard flexes and the whole hoop shakes.  For  me and the older one layups were ok and with more repetitions I could see this as helping with bringing the ball up quicker , but too heavy for the younger one.  If you have access to a real basketball gym then maybe shooting at the glass backboard would be ok, but I imagine when it comes down on the hardwood it would be pretty loud.  We did use it to just shoot in place and you can feel the muscles working to get the ball to go up in the air and have some backspin.Overall it’s a great training tool and I hope to see some improvements in my kids games over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMWSSN0XX43Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MSX7QS#wasThisHelpful","RAMWSSN0XX43Z","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned and reviews a lot of shavers. This one ranks near the top. I really like it. It is solid, feels good in my hand, and most importantly gives a great shave. It shaves close with no irritation. The comb works surprisingly well on my beard. It has plenty of power. The trimmer is easy to use as well. This unit is Wet/Dry which makes it very versatile. It also means it is easy to clean. It does come with a large automatic cleaner/charger. BUT you can also just use soap and water and run the shaver. Then rinse. That is my preferred method. No buying detergent and no big unit sitting on my sink.I was a little disappointed that the battery indicator light doesn't show battery level. All 3 lights just blink at once when the battery is close to needing a charge. Not a big deal I guess. It does not come with a carrying case, but a hard plastic cover that protects the foils and power button. Not sure how will this will work in a cosmetic bag when traveling.Overall I love this shaver and recommend it.Notes:- Great shave. No irritation. Easy to hold and use.- Comb works great on my beard- Trimmer is powerful- Not very loud- Wet/Dry which is awesome- Charges fast- You can use the included washing/charging station or just wash it yourself with soap- Comes with only enough detergent for one wash you will need to buy more- No carry case but there is a hard plastic shell that keeps it from turning on- Battery light looks like it's 3 segments but they all just blink when battery is low. It is not a level indicator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCR4YSTO95SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R2DCR4YSTO95SA","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tried at least 10 different preworkout supplements over the last 5 years. Here is my personal experience with them in general:- I would build up a tolerance to them. So I needed to cycle on and off and between brands.- If it sucked the first couple of times I tried it, it never got any better- Some tasted like crap some were ok- Some mixed well and some did not- Some screwed up my sleep- Some cut my appetite- Some made me all tingly or itchy from the Beta Alanine- 5 Days a week is too much for me to use one=======> 360 PRE First Workout <=======- Mixed well, and tasted really good. I was really impressed by the taste. I actually liked it.- Walk to gym is about 8 minutes from my office. I was sweating by the time I got there and it was cool outside.- No tingling or itchy feeling- Started to feel good and happy. Ready to hit the weights.- Warmed up with cardio. Sweated a lot more than normal. Went at a higher pace than normal.- Bench - was able to do more reps. Kept going even when it got hard.- When it got hard I found that I would laugh during the last couple of reps and push on.- I did more sets than normal and did not quit as early.- When I quit my shirt was completely soaked with sweat. Not normal.- Felt slightly aggressiveI have to admit that I am a sand bagger. I stop a few reps before I should. I let that little voice in my head control me when it says quit you are tired. Stop running and walk. That's enough reps, that's enough sets. Today using 360PRE I found that I didn't listen to that voice at all. I couldn't really even hear it. I kept going and did a lot more than I have in a quite a while. I ended my workout ehausted and it felt great! So far I have had no adverse side effects. I plan to use 360PRE 2 to 3 times a week. I will update this review as I use it more. As of now I think it is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IBMRSAQR9U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FE6FJ7O#wasThisHelpful","R20IBMRSAQR9U9","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Headboard came extremely well packaged. Not only was it in a normal shipping box, but it also had two 2 inch pieces of cardboard on it, one taped to each side of the box. It does take two people to carry it up stairs. It's not extremely heavy, just big.Assembly: Once unpacked, you lay the two large pieces side by side. There is one dowel that goes between the pieces and then you push them together. Next you put a stabilizer board on the top and the bottom using four screws on each one. Make sure you have all the holes on both lining up before you tighten them. Then comes the big billowy cover. It fits snugly so take your time and work it on each side inch by inch. Finally the slip cover goes over the first cover. It slides over pretty smoothly. Then you attach it to your queen or double size frame using the 4 included nuts and bolts.The headboard transformed the room and does look really classy. I am impressed by the look and feel of it. The only downside is the price. It seems quite steep for just a headboard. Other than that, it is really nice.Notes:- Very well packaged- Had no Major issues with assembly- Looks very luxurious- Expensive","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JK2RC6KD7RMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN9USL8#wasThisHelpful","R3JK2RC6KD7RMS","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed was how heavy the box was when I picked it up off the front porch. I knew it was cast iron but was still surprised. It comes very well packaged to prevent damage during shipping. The casserole is very beautiful and well made. It can be used on the stove top and in the oven. It doesn't come with any ""instructions"", so I checked the company website. It said that this model does not need to be seasoned. It also recommends 300 degrees for best in oven cooking results since cast iron transfers heat so well. For best results skip the dishwasher and hand wash. Wood and plastic utensils are recommended as well.I tested it out on the stove-top frying sweet potatoes in olive oil. It worked great. Only minimal sticking to the pan and heat transfer was excellent. Be careful since the handles can get hot since they are cast iron as well. Clean up was very easy. I used a plastic brush with soap and did not have to scrub. Be sure to dry well after washing. This is the nicest best quality dish I have ever owned. It looks and performs impressively. Take good care of it, and it will last a lifetime.Notes:- 300 degrees is the recommended oven temperature- No seasoning needed for cream enamel surface version- Skip the dishwasher and hand wash.

"I've been testing a lot of blue tooth portable speakers. The main things I look for are USB Charging (no external wall wart type charger needed), decent battery life, good base and volume. The TDK life checks all these boxes. In addition it has nice 360 degree sound, shock resistance for accidental drops, and water resistant for rain and spills. This unit is well built so you can throw it in your backpack and not have to worry about it getting damaged. There is also a master power switch you can turn off for storage and to prevent accidentally turning it on when it is packed.I was impressed with the sound from this small and light of a unit. I found the base to be decent, and I am ok with the volume level. There are louder speakers, but not at this size and price. I really like how tough it is and the sound field. No matter which way you point it, it sounds great. This will be the speaker I use outside now due to its toughness and water resistance.Notes:- 360 degree sound was impressive for this small unit- Base is very good- Top volume is decent for a speaker this big- USB Charging- Up to 8 hour battery life- Splash resistant so you don't have to worry about a light rain- Shock resistant and well built OK to throw in your backpack- Easy to pair blue tooth devices, even easier with NFC- Press and hold Power button for 3 seconds and the volume level leds will show battery level- Has Aux in jack","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABQKV0R9SWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9KG9GG#wasThisHelpful","R1ABQKV0R9SWJ","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:23 Mins I found this knife to be useful, fun, and cool. I carry it in my backback. I do agree that it is too big for everyday pocket carry, but it has a clip so you can put it on your belt. The flshlight is very decent something I've come to expect from coast. I was disspointed at first with the polycarbonate handle. It seemed wrong for a knife at this price level. But the more I use it, the more I like it. I'm okay with it now. There is a thumb hole on the blade for one handed open. Once I oiled the junction where the blade meets the handle, I was able to snap it open with one hand. Pretty sweet. See the video.Bottom line: I really like this knife and so far with the experience I've had with it, I reccomend it highly.Notes:- I thought the handle was weird as well, but I've come around to liking it.- It is a bit bulky for a pocket knife, so I use the belt clip instead.- I really like the flashlight knife combo. I find it useful and cool.- After a bit of oil, one handed open is prettly slick.- Nice and Sharp- I am a big fan of Coast Flashlights this one is no exception- Light has two brightness settings- Standard interior spring to unlock blade once it is opened.- Excellent Coast packaging as usual.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P60EAC4N3YL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP3TOD6#wasThisHelpful","R1P60EAC4N3YL4","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wondered how well a battery operated trimmer could do compared to the corded model I have. After testing it all over the yard, I was very impressed at how it performed. I trimmed the same bushes I did a year ago using my corded hedge trimmer. The Oregon model kicked butt. It was smooth, quiet, and easy to use. It cut through all the branches I threw at it including ones over one half inch thick. I was able to hold it for a long time without getting tired from the weight. I could use it in all positions (vertical, horizontal, upside down) very nicely which allowed me to sculpt the bushes the way I wanted. The battery has a 4 segment lighted charge level indicator right on it. You push a button and it shows you how much batter you have left. This is awesome. It comes with a heavy duty plastic sheath for the blade as well as the batter charger. The batter goes in and out of the unit very nicely. It snaps in when you push it, and pops out when you push the release button.My unit was delivered in perfect condition and doesn't have any issues with the unit turning on. This is perfect for my size yard. I don't have to pull a cord behind me anymore, or deal with another loud messy gas engine. The run time of up to 60 minutes is also enough for me so that I won't have to get a second battery which is a bit pricey.Notes:- Excellent power for a battery operated device- Had no problems with shrub branches up to 1/2 inch- Very quiet when running- 4 LED Battery level indicator directly on the battery itself- Heavy duty plastic sheath for the blade- Decent weight. Not too heavy- No issues with turning the unit on- No cord or gas engine to deal with- Battery can hold it's charge for months- Up to one hour of run time on a full charge","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XC8R9EHE0N84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD02N7O#wasThisHelpful","R1XC8R9EHE0N84","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first hammer stapler and I really wish I had had it before for installing the roof on my cabin and shed as well as the plastic vapor barrier. This unit lets you pound the staples well into the wood. The squeeze type gun I used failed to put the staples deep enough a good part of the time and all the squeezing can cramp your hand. This tacker is easy to load and easy to handle. It feels really good in my hand and has good weight to it so you can bang out those staples like mad. Note that you do need space to swing this tacker in order to use it. In confined spaces like between rafters, you may have to use the old gun type stapler. You also have to be sure not to swing to hard and dent the surface you are stapling into.Overall I would not do a roofing type job without this type of tacker and this model works very well.Notes:- Easy to load- Solid with a good heft to it.- Comes with 5000 staples which is nice- Packaged in a larger box so the staples spilled out of their box- Staples go into the wood very well better than squeeze type guns- Ideal for roofing/tar paper installation","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL93BTT23I9NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM3Y1GO#wasThisHelpful","RL93BTT23I9NL","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:11 Mins I installed this on the door to our garage as a replacement handle. The garage door is always closed, so we never lock that door anyway. The handle installed in about 30 minutes. The instructions were very well done. I measured the thickness of the door and it was 1 3/4 inches, so I had to adjust the handle for use with that width. It comes preset for 1 3/8. This was easy. Then I measured the backset (distance from center of hole to edge of door) this distance tells you which of the 2 included latches to use. I needed the longer one. Things when together quickly after that. This door always had a bit of a rattle when it was closed, so I bent out the tab on the included strike plate until the door was snug when closed.The Push Pull Rotate:The PPR is a really cool idea. This makes opening the door with your hands full of grocery bags very easy. I was impressed with how smoothly this worked. Note that this is an interior door handle. It has a push pin lock like bedroom and bathroom doors have. In an emergency, you can use a paperclip or the included ""key"" to unlock it. I did the Pull and Rotate in my attached video. I'm very happy with this handle set.Notes:- Fits standard 1 3/8 and 1 3/4 width doors.- Fits both 2 3/8 and 2 3/4 backsets- Installs in about a half hour- Detailed instructions help a lot- Has interior/bathroom door type lock with pin hole on other side to open- Nice quality feels solid and well built.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXNRRG1IP53F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR6U2#wasThisHelpful","R1EXNRRG1IP53F","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel is set in a London where the Germans won world war two. We follow the main character, Rossett, who has become for all intents and purposes one of the enemy he fought in the war. He now works for the Nazis. He does his job without thinking at all about what he is doing or why. He is just existing. Until something different happens one day....I really had fun reading this novel. I liked the characters and the action. I can still see some of the scenes in my mind. They were well done. Rossett is an awesome character. At times though it seems that Rossett survives and continues on when his injuries should slow him down at least. This bothered me a little but I was able to let it go and still enjoy the book. There is a big build up that Rossett is trying to make up for the bad things he has done. Searching for redemption if you will. I felt this got a little lost in the action. I also had trouble with the ending. I felt a bit cheated. Maybe it was a setup for some sort of sequel.In the end I enjoyed it very much right up to the end.Notes:- The alternate reality worked for me- I was able to follow the plot and the various characters and groups- The main characters seemed real to me and I cared about them- The main character does seem a bit superhuman carrying on with wounds that would stop anyone else- I really enjoyed it, but had trouble with the ending- Reads fast and was hard to put down","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DL58M0J6L5TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062339362#wasThisHelpful","R1DL58M0J6L5TF","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent projector and I am impressed with its image quality. The first thing I did after opening the box was to go to the website Epson suggested in a flyer inside the box that explained Color Brightness. I only really knew about overall brightness expressed in Lumens. This projector is 3000 which is a lot brighter than my last one which was only 2200. The EX7230 also has a color brightness of 3000. It makes a huge difference. The colors look amazing. Other projectors can have a similar White Light output, but less color brightness, and they will not look as good. The next thing I was excited about was the fact that the projector comes with its own padded carrying bag. How nice is that!One of the sources we used was an iPod touch and the Netflix app. You need the adapter cable for video out from the iPod. This used the composite inputs on the projector. The projector automatically found the active input and selected it. We projected it up onto the wall. I noticed that the image was square even though we were projecting at an angle. I found out that this projector has automatic vertical keystone adjustment. Very nice. It also has 8 different color modes. We were projecting onto a wall that wasn't white. The Blackboard color mode adjusted for this and it looked really good. The sound wasn't too bad either coming from the projectors internal speaker. You would need something else for larger rooms and places with background noise.We then hooked up a Blu-ray player and played some true HD content. The movies looked awesome. I am very impressed. PC content looks amazing as well.Browsing through the menu structure, I found a lot of new and improved settings compared to the projector I bought 8 years ago. I suggest reading through the manual so you know all the different things you can do. For example some of the color modes support Auto Iris which will optimize the image based on the brightness of the current scene. Another feature is the PC Free Presentation. You can plug in a USB thumb drive (or any supported USB storage device) and the projector can project the supported picture and video formats.Specs:- Resolution: 1280 x 800 (WXGA)- White Light Output 3000 Lumens- Color Light Output 3000 Lumens- Projection Distance 32 to 320 inches- Focus and Zoom Adjustments are Manual- Lamp Life 5000 hours- Supports wireless LAN Adapter sold separatelyNotes:- The Color Brightness is amazing. Blue Ray Discs look amazing- Comes with padded carrying case!- Full HD- Easy to use Remote Control- Focus and Zoom are manual slides on the projector and easy to use.- Projector is quiet when running.- Speaker is ok for close quarters. Not enough for large rooms.- Supports USB drives for slide shows.

"Both my daughters love Adventure Time and went nuts when this BMO came. They loved how cute and well made he was. The attention to detail is very impressive. The packaging has wonderful artwork on it and it is a shame to throw it out. I am told by my two experts that this BMO is ACTUAL SIZE.

"This was my first Sigma Force novel. It sounded so good that I got it to read even though it's well into the series. I didn't seem to miss anything by starting at this point in the series. I probably didn't know the characters as well, but there was nothing confusing, the novel was pretty much self contained. There is a lot of action in this book. The characters are easy to like or dislike. I felt like I knew the characters by the end of the story. I could picture the action and the settings very well. I enjoyed that. According to the author, the science in the book is based on fact and not too far out of the realm of possibility. That is cool and scary at the same time. This seemed a lot like the novel adaption of a great action movie. It was never boring and a lot of fun. I recommend this book for anyone that likes action thrillers.Notes:- Lots of Actions- Science Fiction / Science soon to be fact- Appendix in book describes the actual science- Reminded me of James Bond Stories- Characters are very likable- Very Easy to read. Time flew while I was reading.- Multiple plot lines added to the excitement- Seemed like a book adaption of a good action movie","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSCLC2I29YM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061784818#wasThisHelpful","RKSCLC2I29YM6","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cute little popper. My 10 year old daughter was very excited when it arrived. She opened the box and put it together. There are just 3 parts. The measuring cup that is also the top of the unit/butter warmer, the main shoot, and the read hot air popper. We measured the max amount of popcorn and dumped it in. The we put some coconut oil into the melter. We turned the unit on and the corn started popping in less than a minute. It was all popped in under 3 minutes. When I picked up the melter to pour on the coconut oil, the cup was a bit hot. Didn't burn me, but enough to surprise you. Before any of the corn started popping, 5 or 6 unpopped kernels blew into the bowl. Just a side effect of all that air blowing around. Then the corn started popping and it was fun to watch it all blow into the bowl. Use a big bowl to catch the corn. It makes more than you would think, and the bigger bowl will minimize any corn that wants to make a run for it.We had a lot of fun with this popper and it works well for us. We think its a pretty good deal.Notes:- Popcorn was done in less than 3 minutes after turning the unit on- Cup with butter was pretty warm, be careful when pouring melted butter on the corn- Use a big bowl to catch the popcorn to keep them from getting away- Cord stores inside the popper.- Fun looking unit- Kids love it- Doesn't need oil so it's healthy- 5 or 6 unpopped kernels blew out as it popped no big deal","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AV6U5KKOX10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL8SMBU#wasThisHelpful","R5AV6U5KKOX10","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a two serving size George Foreman grill. It comes with one small drip tray. The drip tray just sits on the counter so it can move around on accident. We made two chicken breasts at a time. The first two were a little thick. I didn't get them unfolded like I should have. So they took a couple minutes more than the 9 minutes the manual said. The second set cooked in the 9 minutes. The chicken was excellent. Brown on the outside and very juicy on the inside. Very tender. The grill did get pretty dirty and the grease cooked on. The manual says not to use nonstick cooking spray so I didn't. It was pretty tough to clean then. I had to scrub. Next time I'm going to brush on oil.Meal 2: Raw, not frozen turkey burgers. Unit heated up and green light went out in about 2 minutes. Sprayed unit with olive oil spray from Trader Joes. Cooked burger for 5 minutes. Then put cheese on and held the top cooking plate close to cheese but not touching. Cheese melted nicely and fast. Burger was excellent. Grill cleaned up a lot easier with the spray. Still had to scrub a little, but a lot less than without the spray.Overall, I was impressed with how good the food was it cooked. The nonstick wasn't the best but I'm going to use oil next time. It just took me 4 minutes of cleaning to get it clean. I also like the two serving size. It is an attractive unit as well.Notes:- Small 2 serving Size- Heats up quickly. Mine was faster than 4 minutes.- Cooked our chicken in the 9 minutes like manual said- Didn't use nonstick spray (like manual said) and it took some scrubbing to clean- I like the size- Chicken was brown on outside and juicy on the inside very tasty!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2UR5SR61CK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXRK#wasThisHelpful","RY2UR5SR61CK8","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was thoroughly entertained by this novel. I lost track of time on multiple occasions and almost missed my stop on the train. I was completely pulled into the story. An hour would go by and I wouldn't notice. I haven't been this entertained by a book in some time. It was so much fun to be completely taken away for awhile. I was sad when it was over, but I have a feeling there will be more... For me this rates five stars.I liked the short chapters that alternated between two linked story lines, one in the past, and one in the present. When one chapter ended I wanted more of that plot line. Then two paragraphs into the next chapter, I was excited to be back on that story line. I felt the writing was well done and the descriptions full. I came to really like the characters and feel that they had personalities. I even became attached to the dog!This book is excellent entertainment and I recommend it as such. It contains magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. It takes place now and in the late 1500s. I thought the two story lines were well woven together. I will be waiting for the next book by Rebecca Alexander. I think she did an excellent job with this novel.Notes:- I was thoroughly entertained and lost track of time on multiple occasions while reading this- I loved the characters both past a present and even the dog!- Short chapters that skipped between two story lines worked well- This was an extremely fun read- Well written with a lot of detail- The magic was well handled and believable- Very hard to put down- Not every novel needs to be classical fiction","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXPX1S14LZX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140685#wasThisHelpful","R2RXPX1S14LZX0","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, I'm going to review these based on the price point of the set. You get this set basically for the price on one ""good"" frying pan. I got the entire 14 piece set. The one egg wonder pan is tucked into the dutch oven. The pans look cool with the bright white ceramic nonstick coating on them. They are light but not to the point of being flimsy. The handles are pretty sturdy plastic. I would not put them in the dishwasher or in the oven. It says you can, but I am pretty sure this will greatly reduce their lifespans.I used the large frying pan and scrambled eggs with cut up steak. The first thing I noticed was that the pan heated up faster and hotter them my thicker frying pan. This let me reduce the heat and start cooking faster. It was also funny how hard it was to see the egg whites against the white pan. The pan is extremely non stick. The eggs didn't stick anywhere. I could have cleaned the pan with just a paper towel. It basically just rinsed clean. When I cooked chicken breasts I was able to turn down the heat. The lid handle stays very cool. The chicken cooked very well. Cleanup was again very easy.I am impressed with how these pans perform. I cannot as yet comment on the long term durability. If they don't last very long, then I would lower my star rating. They seem to be an excellent value. I would recommend them for a first set, as a gift, college kids, divorced guy starting over, . . .Notes:- Heated up very fast and got very hot. I use gas and did not notice any hot spots.- Eggs and chicken both cooked faster than in my heavier pans. Reduce the heat to cook at the same rate.- VERY non stick. Eggs came out very easily. Could wipe clean with a paper towel.- Light weight. Not a heavy duty set.- White ceramic coating looks great.- Plastic handles stay cool but I would not use them in the over or dishwasher.- Found all 14 pieces including One Egg Wonder hidden in dutch oven.- Can't comment on long term durability yet.- The included utensils are fairly sturdy and work fine","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABWWQKLOWCBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWSQQIW#wasThisHelpful","RABWWQKLOWCBU","A2RN2AO4BE6F4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RN2AO4BE6F4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The TV has a great picture and the smart TV features work really well--super well-designed.Why 3 stars?  Because it's freaking delicate and can't be repaired.  My-three-year-old hit it with a plastic toy and the LCD broke instantly (the plastic screen is still intact, only the picture doesn't work).  This was a couple of weeks after buying it.  Not covered under warranty and it can't be repaired for less than the TV costs.  I purchased a replacement of the same model but I'm having a piece of acrylic hung in front of it.  That was expensive enough that it really traumatized me.If you don't have kids or any moving objects in your home, this may not apply to you.  In all other respects it's a really great and functional TV at a low price.Few other things I don't like:1. The sound is really bad.  Like, really bad.  Plan to get a soundbar immediately.2. There is only one button on this TV and it does everything.  You have to hold it down for 2 seconds to turn it off.  Unfortunately it rocks to the side so you often end up cycling through inputs rather than turning it off.  The button is also wholly inadequate for controlling the various smart TV functions.  Heaven help you if you lose the remote.3. I don't care for the motion interpolation.  These days all the TV's have it, but it makes action look terrible and unrealistic.  Actually other TV's do it more aggressively, so maybe I should count this as a plus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLXW8FI0EQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMBG0S0#wasThisHelpful","RLLXW8FI0EQJ","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this device.  We get a lot of brown-outs here and they have caused damage to some of my equipment, so I wanted a device to power my home fileserver, which runs linux.  It doesn't consume many watts but those hard drives are pretty expensive to replace, to say nothing of the costs of digging files out of backups when data is lost.Anyway, this device is a nice size and price to protect one important computer.  And it features automatic voltage regulation (i.e., it protects against brown-outs, not just black-outs).The cyberpower software works perfectly with linux.  Installs really easily and then you just run a command and you can monitor and control the UPS, see when the last power event is, and even see how many watts your computer is drawing.

"Unfortunately they dropped the ball on this one.  Good concept, good actors, good budget.  The writing, though.  The writing.  Very inconsistent in mood and quality.  This needed to go through a few more rewrites.An example writing element that is crap: stories have to have reasonable bad guys.  Like, guys you can imagine doing what they are doing.  You can totally see a nerdy tech dude stealing some embryos and accidentally breaking the park, as was done in the first movie.  How about a random security guard that thinks velociraptors have significant military value and unleashes some that are clearly not fully trained on a situation that clearly does not call for small predators?

"I use LED lights all over my house, all of them daylight balanced (not ""warm"").  These are the only LED bulbs I have run across that put out poor quality light.  The brightness is correct, but the colors are just awful.  Much bluer than typical daylight balanced bulbs, and very monochromatic.  The room looks like it's in black and white.  After just a minute or two you will start to feel unwell when subjected to these. These are kind of like the way LED lights used to be back when they were a brand new technology and hadn't been improved to the point that they were feasible to put in a home.  Simply put, they are not white--they lack enough colors of the spectrum to fool the eye.These are so bad i am going to have to return them.  It's sad, because I really like the size and brightness of these (most LED lights seem to be much brighter than the incandescents they supposedly replace and the directionality makes them seem even brighter) but at the end of the day, this is the light I have to live in.

"I'm very happy with this outlet.  I bought it to replace a gfci outlet in my bathroom that had paint all over it that I couldn't get off.  As I went to get it I thought it might make sense to have a nightlight as well--I have small children that pull nightlights out so it has to be built in.  This is a great solution.The nightlight runs only when it's dark.  Now, that's kind of all the time because bathrooms are almost always dark (no windows).  Anyway, this has an LED light built in and it's reasonably bright.  You can definitely use the bathroom at night to this light without turning on the actual light.  The light is bluish white.The outlet works fine too and was easy to install.  Pretty much like any GFCI outlet.  It has the holes in the back where you insert the wires and then you turn these screws to get it in place.  I like this better than the holes that automatically grab wires and the outlets that require you to wrap the wire around a screw.Anyway, good item, if a bit pricey for what it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UL1DR30SD2XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001H1GQRC#wasThisHelpful","R3UL1DR30SD2XR","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two of these and they work pretty well.  They put out a pure white (on the blue-ish side) light and turn off if a bright light is shined on them.However, I also have a cooper industries one (which is $5 more) and it is a better product.  It has a brighter but adjustable light--so you can make it as bright as you want--at its highest setting it is very bright indeed.  More importantly, the cooper one is never on during the day or at any time when I don't want/need it.  It only turns on when it is dark enough that a night light makes sense.  The levitron ones turn on when things are a little dim--in the shadows, in the early evening, etc.  The levitron ones are just on a lot more than I would prefer.  They were cheaper, but it wasn't really worth it.Small bone here: the levitron one also has the ground and hot attachments pretty close together.

"By giving it three stars you might think I'm saying I'm really unhappy with this product.  I guess I am, but not because it doesn't work or there are manufacturing or material problems.  The problem is the concept.  I really like the concept of not having to get just the right number of outlet, GFCI, and light bulb gaskets, but in practice I think it's better to get the product that's actually made for your application.Punching out the part you need out without disturbing the rest is a little bit of a pain.  You can do it, but sometimes you end up with little bits of foam hanging off and it's definitely not as airtight as a regular gasket would be.  I was thinking it would be good to use this for other boxes, like ethernet, phone, cable, or empty plates (over access boxes).  Yeah, it kind of works, but not great.  The holes are not in the right places for the screws in those cases and the punch-outs aren't the right size/shape.  This really is just for outlets, GFCI, and switches.Someone mentioned that these are thicker than some other gaskets.  That is true, by just a little bit.  However, that's not a good thing.  You'd think thicker means more insulation or a better seal, but the opposite happens, I think.  They don't allow you to screw the plate in as close as you want and then the edges of the plate don't come down and seal all that well.  This is especially a problem for outlets, which have only one screw in the middle rather than one on top and one on bottom.  I actually think thinner and maybe a little larger would work better.If you want to be really anal about insulating outlets, in particular, you can take the punch out part and stick it onto a babyproofing plastic insert and plug those in.  Well, you can do that with the regular brands.  This one, the punch out sections have a piece that tends to fall out (where you would have punched out for a switch).  Again, you can make it work, but it's not as nice as the ones you get with a dedicated outlet gasket.These work, I guess (I have now done my whole house with gaskets like this and the duck brand ones and I'm not 100% sure it makes any difference), but if I had it to do over again I would just buy the outlet ones, the switch ones, and the GFCI ones and have a few extras around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0E45HNFZ6CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY3QNE4#wasThisHelpful","R2T0E45HNFZ6CW","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bulbs works well.  It's a pretty pure white.  Not so white that it's daylight balanced, but not as yellow as an incandescent.  I use it for the stovetop light under my microwave.  It fits and works in that application.  Notice that this is an E17 base, which is smaller than a regular base, but bigger than candelabra.  Basically you only see them in appliances, it seems like.The part that you'd think is glass is actually rubber or rubberized plastic.  That was a bit odd.  Also, my microwave has a setting for turning them on dimly and they work (not all LED bulbs are actually dimmable).Why only 4 stars?  It's not as bright as you'd expect.  I have 7 watt LED bulbs (which actually consume more like 8 when I test them) all over my house and they are at least 10 times this bright.  I have an LED nightlight that consumes like 1 watt that seems brighter too.

"I'm pretty happy with this nightlight outlet.  I got it because I have small children who like to pull out and otherwise mess with night lights.  That's dangerous and also always results in my nightlights getting lost.I previously purchased the levitron one of these...looks the same but it's $5 cheaper and it is noticeably dimmer.  The levitron would be good for a smaller room but I wanted something with more light, for a big room.  I moved the levitron around the corner and am now happy to see this flooding the room with light.It's adjustable, which is nice.  You should be able to make it work in whatever configuration you want.  The light is on the yellow side of white while the levitron is on the blue side.  Both are LED.The initial setup of this guy was a bit of a hassle.  Hold the button down for 15 seconds (or more) and it flashes, which changes it from always on or always off mode to the mode where it sense darkness.  Hold it down while the light is on to adjust the brightness.  Sounds simple but it's confusing because it's not responsive.  Pressing the button turns it on and off.  It communicates back by blinking.  Overall, I would have preferred some mechanical switches on the back to set the mode.Anyway, once you have it set up, it works well.  It doesn't turn on and off instantly like the levitron.  There's a delay.  Also this unit requires a much darker room before it turns on.  All the lights have to really be off and it has to really be dark outside.  Anyway it works well for my use and I recommend it.I'll probably keep this one in the great room and get a couple more levitrons for places I want to light up but that don't require as many lumens.  This is adjustable, but why pay more for a product that puts out more light if you don't need the extra light?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3US3BXO77HP68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UNHHKG#wasThisHelpful","R3US3BXO77HP68","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty nice door closer.  It closes the door firmly but doesn't allow it to slam.  I have mine set up with the bulky part on the door and the little arm above it (which, I think, is the standard configuration) but it can be set up on either side and even under the door jamb.  Good quality materials and workmanship and the little adjustment screws make a big difference in how fast or slow the door shuts.  Should be configurable for almost any taste.The main thing about this closer that was unexpected and possibly a negative for some is that it puts a lot of pressure on the door.  After installing it, I tried the door and thought it was fine but my wife came over and couldn't comfortably open it with one hand.  The kids (ages 2-6) can't seem to open it at all so far.  This item puts a lot more closing pressure than most door closers.  If you have kids or wimpy people going through the door, I'd suggest going with one with a smaller spring.  The internet says spring size 3 corresponds to 5 pounds of closing force.  Either this is a bit higher than that or five pounds is more than we think it is.  I'd suggest spring size 2 or even 1 for most people based on my experience with this product.The arm also rubs across the top of the door, but that would be the fault of the installer (me).  I was so worried about the two connections being too far apart that I put them too close together.  I'll have to adjust my installation.By the way installation was fine.  My only issue was that it turns out my door is metal stuffed with styrofoam.  I could have sworn it was wood.  Anyway, the instructions are all snooty and say you have to tap metal doors for machine screws.  I have never even seen a tool to do that.  I used the regular screws and it works, but some day it will probably fall on my head or something.  Maybe they could figure out a better way to attach to metal doors--one that doesn't require fancy tools.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GF5G6PO56FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXFRC0W#wasThisHelpful","R30GF5G6PO56FH","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very happy with this deadbolt.  I use it for the door between my house and garage (which is the one we end up always using).  I put it up high so my little kids can't get out during the day.  I had to do everything, including drilling all the holes.  It wasn't too hard and turned out great.  A few things to note:1. You don't need a circular hole cutter for this.  Usually when you do a door, you use those 2 1/8 hole cutters to make a spot for their doorknobs and deadbolts but the template here actually wants a square hole and recommends cutting it with four cuts through with a smaller bit, like 7/8 inch.  I purchased a hole cutter for this project and didn't use it.  guess I'll take it back.  Though to be fair, maybe the hole cutter would have worked...making the third drill hole was a pain.  I ended up using a smaller bit to cut out some parts to make it fit right.2. Setting the combination is extremely easy and foolproof.  I think I have read of people having trouble, but the design must have changed.  To change the combination, they have turning switches on the back.  You use a little screwdriver (included) to turn them so the ones you want in the combination face out.  That's it.  Nothing to mess up, really.3. In order to switch this from a left handed door to right handed, there's a pin you have to pull with needle nosed pliers.  It required a surprisingly hard tug to get out and it was hard to get a grip on.  It worked, though.  That was the only adjustment.4. As some people may have mentioned, the order of the numbers/letters you press doesn't matter.  That dramatically cuts down the number of unique combinations.  Still too many for a normal crook to get through by trial and error (5811 possibilities, by my calculation), but if you are interested in high security, you should look elsewhere.So how is the operation?  Pretty great.  From the inside, there's a little handle you turn one way to lock it and the other way to unlock it.  Unfortunately there's no indication of whether it is locked or unlocked when you just walk up to it (with a normal deadbolt, horizontal means locked and vertical means unlocked.).  That would have been a nice feature.  But anyway, locking and unlocking from the inside is super easy.From the outside, you turn a little knob one way to lock and enter the combination and turn the other way to unlock.  This door doesn't automatically lock when the door is shut.  You always have to lock it if you want the door locked.  Just like a regular deadbolt.Fit and finish are great.  It's pretty sturdy and functions well.  I'm sure an attack with a crowbar or something would take it down fast, but anyone with that kind of determination could get through any of my doors or windows pretty easily.  Regardless of how strong it actually is, it looks very strong and unbreakable.  Reasonably good deterrent.I think I'm going to swap out the door handle for one that doesn't lock at all and rely exclusively on this for security through that door.  That way I will never be locked out.  I may buy another one of these for the back door.  My kids are always sneaking out of that one as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OP8XLXVRJNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KG6A0I#wasThisHelpful","R27OP8XLXVRJNN","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, it's a piece of plastic and four screws.  My car doesn't have holes for a front plate and I just moved to a state that requires front plates.  I was inclined to drill a few holes and screw the plate straight on.  My wife insisted that instead we get a mounting kit.This kit is basically a piece of plastic and four screws.  Not really much of a point, actually.  I ended up using the four holes as a guide and drilling through the bumper, then screwing through the license plate, mounting kit, and bumper.  That's basically what it's intended for.As far as I can tell, this doesn't serve any functional purpose except maybe to prevent the license from rattling around or scratching your paint.  A bit of shelf liiner would have done the same thing.Still, it works.  Attaching a license to a car (even if there are no pre-drilled holes) isn't rocket science.The kit recommends that you get a frame (sold separately) and a clear plate cover (sold separately).

"This is a great tool.  First, if you don't have a cordless drill/screwdriver, get one right away.  They are so great.  I regret the years I used my hands for screwdriver stuff and a drill with an extension cord for drilling.  I guess I was scared of batteries being lame like they were some years ago.  This and other cordless drills are the first and most important power tools in your arsenal.  Leave the extension cord in the garage.I labored hard to decide whether to purchase this or the matrix drill.  Their matrix drill looks more or less like this but it costs less and the tip can be removed and replaced with an impact drill, reciprocating saw, and a bunch of other tools that are pretty inexpensive.  Neat idea.  I finally decided to get this instead because it's a better drill and screwdriver.  I'll buy those other tools separately.Why is this better than the matrix drill and other drills in B&D's lineup?  This drill has significantly greater torque and speed.  It also has two speeds.  Remember, a cordless drill is part drill and part screwdriver.  For the screwdriver, the (relatively) slow speed is imperative.  For a drill you want it to be able to go super fast if needed.  That's what you get here.  This model is more powerful, faster, and slower than the matrix or other B&D models.  It's their best drill.Couple of other nice features:  It has an LED light on it.  The light comes on when you lightly press the trigger, before the drill starts.  So you can use it to position the drill or screwdriver.  Very nice.  And it's nice that it has a little holder for the most common tools you use, a flathead and Phillips screwdriver.The drill is surprisingly small overall.  Much smaller than my old corded drill (which was itself a rather small model).  Nevertheless it has a lot of power and speed.  It's also pretty noisy.  I guess all drills are, but this one has a higher pitched whine than I'm used to and the overall motor noise is greater. Bit surprising.  The handle is also quite small around.  It works well with medium and even small hands.  Much more ergonomic than older models.  The handle and everything else around is rubberized and feels durable.20 V Max is the new Black and Decker standard for lots of their tools.  They have a ton of power tools that use this type of battery, and they also have a bunch of yard tools that use it.  All interchangeable, so there's a good chance you will have a good use for the second battery.  This battery last a long time so unless you use your drill a LOT it's not going to run out while you are working.  Anyway, the batteries don't look like in the picture.  They are black with orange lettering to match the drill.  They are 1.5 Amp-Hour batteries.  This was actually a surprise because my Black and Decker weed whacker and leaf blower came with a 20 V max battery but it is a bigger, 4 amp hour model.  They are interchangeable, but somehow I thought there was only one size.  Not so.  Of course, those yard tools need a lot more power than this.  But if you really need a long lasting battery, I guess you could get yourself a fat 4 amp hour battery and drill like crazy.  My week whacker can work for a surprisingly long time on a charge.As I mentioned above, this drill can go very fast and slow.  It does seem to have a little more inertia than my old drill.  That is, when you stop drilling abruptly, it jolts your hand more than I'm used to.  Definitely plenty of torque for even very intense jobs.  If this has problems, you have a very special need and should get an impact drill or something.The keyless chuck is great.  No more having to dig around for the key in order to change bits or screwdrivers.  I haven't had any problems with it slipping or anything.  It's quick and easy to use.  This drill also can take a half inch bit...larger than the 3/8 bit limit most drills around have.There's a switch on top that takes you from setting 1, with lots of torque but slow speed (for screwing) to setting 2 with lots of speed (for drilling).  The drill sounds the same regardless of which setting you use, so it may not be obvious that one setting is going around way faster.This drill also has a clutch, so it can work like a torque wrench.  It has 22 settings for how hard you want the drill to work before it will stop (cheaper drills have fewer or none).  You can also set it to not slip.  That's 23 total by my count.  I don't see where the  24 comes from.  Anyway, it's way more than is needed, but just another way to know this is their serious drill.The switch to change spin direction is a little harder to flip than I'm used to, but it works.  There are arrows on the side indicating which way is selected, but they aren't all that obvious.  Anyway I always give it a little test spin before doing my thing just to make sure I have it going the desired direction...always have.What else can I say? This is a great drill and a great screwdriver.  It's better than the others from Black and Decker and highly functional overall.  I would have liked the matrix functionality (to change the tip to impact drill or other tools) but it's better to have tools that are good at a few things than ok at a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356TNKJ3ZMAH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRMSMWY#wasThisHelpful","R356TNKJ3ZMAH3","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to love this scanner, but at best I like it.  If I was buying again, I would probably get the same one but I wouldn't be as elated the second time.Here's the thing: when you have this plugged into a windows computer through USB, it's a super scanner.  Fast, accurate, can do a lot of stuff. Excellent results every time.  But that's not why I bought it.  There are scanners all over the place that can do that stuff.  I wanted one that could connect to my wireless network and scan directly to a shared network drive, save to a USB stick, send to my email, and work with my linux computer.  Very few scanners can do all of that and they are typically large and expensive.  So in a sense this is a very special scanner: just what I was looking for.Unfortunately, when you scan to a network drive, you can't do all the things you can do from the windows interface. For example, you can scan to color or black and white, but not greyscale.  The black and white for this scanner doesn't look all that great, so I would really prefer greyscale.  Only works with windows.  But that's not how I use the scanner!  There are lots of other stuff it can do when connected to your computer that it won't do in standalone mode.  The speed when you use it with a windows computer is extreme.  It can pound through paper.  But when you use it in standalone mode, it's not nearly as fast.  At least in standalone mode, if you move up to 600dpi you lose the following: auto-detect paper size, blank page removal, deskew.  The scanner can do all sorts of good things, just not at the same time.These things bothered me a lot when I first got it and was eating through the mountain of documents I had sitting around waiting to be scanned.  Now that I only scan new things coming in it's no big deal.  Still, it wouldn't have taken much for them to have given the standalone scanner the same functionality as the scanner when it's connected to the computer, minus OCR, I guess.  This scanner is special because of its standalone capability and for no other reason.Ok, so how about the typical complaints about this scanner? Well, there's only one roller and it's short and in the middle.  If you load the paper crooked or it doesn't grab right, it can easily go in crooked.  That's happened several times.  Only with single sheets. If you do a stack, the papers on top hold the one being scanned down and it works fine.The other complaint people have is that it pulls multiple pages in at a time and jams or skips a page.  This has happened to me twice in many hundreds of pages, so I don't think it's much of a problem.  Really, the key is to prep the paper the way the manual tells you to.  Make sure the pages are not stuck together, then set them up so that the earlier pages stick out slightly more than the later pages.  It's not hard and results in a good scan.Last complaint is usability.  You have to set up these shortcuts to do anything.  You can't just walk up and press buttons to get the scan you want.  That's pretty annoying.  The purpose of shortcuts is to save time, not to allow functionality that can't be had otherwise.  Well, anyway, you set them up and it works ok.  But again, there are certain things you can't set in the shortcuts.  For example, you can't set a shortcut to do a single-sided scan.  Only double, with detection.  If you want a single sided scan you have to use the shortcut and then go to options and change it.  Every time. That's a pretty basic usability problem.  I mean, you can get it done, but they haven't really set things up so it's easy.This is no professional level scanner.  It's a compact, light duty scanner.  As such it doesn't pull paper as reliably as a professional office scanner.  But no one expects it to.  Personally I think the hardware is great for what it is, and the software is workable, even if not perfectly convenient.I've actually complained a lot in this review.  It's not because I don't like the scanner.  It's a good scanner and gets everything I want done.  It's just so close to perfect without being there.  They could probably make this a fantastic scanner with a firmware update.  The roller issue couldn't be fixed so easily, but as I said, it's not a big problem.  If I wanted/needed a super-reliable and efficient scanner for high volume, I would have shelled out the money and space for one.========== Edit a month later ===============When this scanner is run in standalone mode, it's just too hobbled.  When I first got it it would do scans at 600 dpi if you specified the paper size instead of using auto and if you did color.  But I did a network refresh because it wasn't connected to the network and it deleted some settings.  Now it won't scan at above 300 dpi regardless of other settings.  I change change this here or in the web interface.  600dpi is always greyed out.The hardware for this scanner is ok, but the software is just so heinous and it is purposely limited in really annoying ways.  I regret purchasing it.  Wish I had returned it right away.  Already threw away the box but thinking of trying some kind of return anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1MM1YI5ZPKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKW6JZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1MM1YI5ZPKI","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting little key ring.  I'm very pleased with it (I previously used regular string as a keychain but I ended up cutting it whenever I needed to lend the keys to someone.Couple of things I notice about it:1. Yes, it's flexible, but not very.  It's actually quite a stiff and thick metal cable.  It works fine as a keychain and is flexible enough to be comfortable in the pocket, but if you bent it hard I'm sure you would kink it.  Not sure why such a thick cable is needed, but I'm not an engineer.2. I like this clasp.  You have to twist and pull.  And when I say twist, I mean you have to twist a long ways.  That's why people say you have to make this thing into a figure 8.  It's more of a hassle than some key rings, but once you do it a few times it's easy enough.  If I were the type of person who took keys off multiple times a day I wouldn't want these.  However, I only remove keys very periodically.3. I do wish the clasp was a bit shorter.  That portion of the ring doesn't bend.  On the other hand, if it were shorter it would probably be hard to remove.4. Size is good.  I only keep like 5 keys on there and I was afraid it would be too long.  I'd say if you have 10 or fewer keys, this will work for you.  It's not overly big.Overall a great key ring.  Worth the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJ7DRTW6XYZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EM6S5A#wasThisHelpful","R2YJ7DRTW6XYZ1","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sleep in earplugs every night and have for years.  I've used a ton of brands and this is the best brand and model I've used.I used to think one earplug was pretty much as good as the next but now I know that is not true.  These are special for a few reasons:1. They are a little shorter.  This could be a bad thing in some use cases, but for sleeping, it's nice to have shorter earplugs because they don't stick out and press against the pillow.  They also are less likely to make you sweat in your ear (yes, it happens).2. They exert less pressure on your ear.  When you wear earplugs for a long time the pressure can get quite irritating.  These are the most gentle earplugs I've used.3. They are softer than other earplugs.  They squish up and go in easily.  I guess pretty much all earplugs are easy enough, though, so while this is different, it's not necessarily better than its competitors.4. They conform more easily to your ear.  Lots of earplugs try to push your ear canal into a cyclindrical shape.  These just fill up the empty space comfortably.5. They make a good seal.  Much more than other ear plugs, their pliability allows them to fill all the crevices and stop the sound coming in.  I *think* it might be possible to get better sound absorption by a denser earplug than these, but only if you can get it to fill and sit just right.Overall these are better than any other brand I've used.  I wish the color was less earwax-like and the shortness takes a little getting used to (might not be everyone's preference) but overall they are highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ETWIHXWKVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051U7W32#wasThisHelpful","R31ETWIHXWKVO","ACY9QYNDFLVBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACY9QYNDFLVBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't think someone from my generation would have the imagination to design a book this way, or to include a photo feature about a Supreme Court Justice's ""swag."" But fundamentally this is a wonderful book about the difference an individual can make. The book's breezy style has a deeper and more serious significance, as well.I was touched by many things in this book, not only the courage of Justice Ginsburg's opinions, or the loving handwritten note from her dying husband, but even by the photos illustrating her close friendship with Justice Scalia, one of her ideological opposites - it's rare to see such a mensh in these times. The format is terrifically creative for this sort of subject: the NY Times reviewer aptly described it as being ""as if a scrapbook and the Talmud decided to have a baby."" The latter comes in especially for the way the book's margins are used for commenting on everything -- not just for the obvious connections to a Justice who is Jewish. (Apropos of that, though, one thing did puzzle me: the recipe for pork in milk at the back. Breaking two of the Jewish religion's food taboos at once -- isn't that a little gangsta? Was that the idea, or is the whole thing a joke? And actually, one other thing: the publisher's subject classification on the back cover is ""Fiction."" Aside from the recipe, I hope not.)I now live in Japan and teach comparative constitutional law there. Pretty much no one, including most law professors, can name the justices of the Japan Supreme Court, who are chosen for their anonymity, their conformity to a certain social background, and their timidity of thought. And throughout its nearly 70-year existence, the JSC has always upheld laws and regulations that limit civil rights. One reason I got this book was to be able to show my students how completely different the relationship between a country's Supreme Court and its citizens can be. In most countries of the world, a book like this would be inconceivable. While I'm not saying that many other Justices deserve such a tribute, this book should be a great reminder for Americans how lucky you are not only to have Justice Ginsburg, but also to be capable of such affectionate engagement with your government.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397LDX8VE204V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062415832#wasThisHelpful","R397LDX8VE204V","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book isn’t the exercise in applied analytic philosophy one might expect on the basis of its being published by Cambridge University. Rather, it’s a fierce and at times flowery defense of the enterprise of astrobiology, and especially of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), by one of the more prolific and imaginative members of the SETI community. Critics of either of those fields get a pretty sharp drubbing from the author (MMC).SETI and, to a lesser extent, astrobiology are some of the areas of scientific inquiry most influenced by literature: until we actually meet an alien life form or an ETI (which may be “postbiological,” @174), science fiction remains one of the best resources for imagining different scenarios. I thought MMC made good use of this literature throughout the book, and I also enjoyed the use of of paintings by René Magritte to illustrate the difficulties of distinguishing the natural from the artificial when it comes to identifying just who the ETs are, if we ever do encounter them (Chap. 8). Still, I thought there were many topics he didn’t address, such as the nature of a civilization, that would be appropriate in a more thorough philosophical approach to this topic.The writing style is quite different not only from usual philosophical writing but also from usual scientific writing, and was something of an obstacle for me. I admire MMC’s skill given that apparently English is at least a second language for him. But the tone has a sort of Edwardian ornateness about it, e.g. there is a philosophical dialogue with a character called “Simplicio,” on more than 20 occasions various people are called “distinguished” something or others, books are often “remarkable” or the objects of some other adjectival hyperbole, and paragraphs often have a circuitous flow. It became very tiring to get to the nub of what MMC was trying to say: maybe because I went out to brunch on the weekend I read it, I couldn’t help thinking that the book’s insights were hidden under way too much Hollandaise sauce.The book includes a very extensive and useful list of references in addition to endnotes. The index, though, is not so helpful: e.g., to find “postbiological” you’ll need to know the name of an author who pursues this topic (Stephen Dick, under ‘D’), because there isn’t anything about it under ‘P.’ And shame on the folks at CUP: Bad enough that they couldn’t recognize the gibberish Greek “quotation” from Thucydides (@41; it is utterly meaningless as printed, and would have botched the original even had it been spelt correctly), they should have at least been suspicious about whether the Latin expression “Hic Rhodes, hic salta!” was really an “old Greek saying” (@107). (In fact it’s the author’s mangling of Karl Marx’s mangling (“Hic Rhodus, hic salta!”) of Hegel’s uncomprehending quote of Erasmus’s Latin translation (“Hic Rhodus, hic saltus!) of a line from one of Aesop’s fables, which was in Greek.) In sum: if you can tolerate its excesses, the book will help you find a lot of the more thoughtful literature on astrobio and SETI.[POSTSCRIPT: You can find a more soberly written and more thorough philosophical analysis is David Lamb's ""The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence"" (Routledge 2001). It lacks the imaginative touches of MMC's book such as reference to paintings, and lacks the more recent references you can find in the book under review -- but it also lacks MMC's intrusive cheerleading for ""transhumanism."" Ultimately Lamb was more helpful to get me up to speed about some of the key philosophical arguments in astrobiology.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUI69SKKCO0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521197759#wasThisHelpful","RUI69SKKCO0P","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of this book is original and intriguing: to go back to classical Roman authors (Cicero, Sallust, Horace) to find inspiration for a post-Occupy form of republicanism. Unfortunately though, I found it very hard to get into the book — in fact, I was unable to finish the whole thing, despite being very accustomed to reading political theory, and also having several years of distant but not entirely rusty Latin under my belt.I’m posting a review for two purposes: first, in the hope that someone who reads this can direct me to a more succinct and straightforward presentation, if one exists, of the book’s thesis; and second, to give a heads-up to other readers who may be coming to the book from a different disciplinary or philosophical orientation. I come from more of a law and politics background than a lit crit one, and in recent years probably read more European scholarship than American. Maybe those factors have something to do with why I was so put off the style of presentation in this work. In giving the book four stars, I’m trying to give the book the benefit of the doubt, since I don’t know how to allocate the blame for my difficulties fairly as between my own limitations and the book’s.The author (JC) seems to draw the most intense inspiration from Cicero among classical authors, and from Hannah Arendt among modern ones. I confess to having a real antipathy for the prose style of each of these authors, plus some other reservations about Arendt, so this may be a situation where my own mishugas (3rd declension?) was the main impediment to my enjoyment of the book. And as JC admits, another problem is that Cicero was a spokesman for the power of the wealthy in Rome, so it takes a lot of explaining to transform him into a hero for the 99 Percent.On the other hand, I didn’t do much better with the chapter about one of my favorite Roman historians, Sallust. The main problem was that the discussion of his texts is chopped up between long digressions endorsing or sparring with points made by modern scholars, sometimes several of whom are discussed within the space of a single paragraph. JC also makes frequent references to painters and modern literary authors (e.g., Cézanne and Henry James), which are imaginative touches that I appreciated, except for wishing that they didn’t interrupt the discussion of, well, Sallust.A different type of difficulty comes up in JC's discussion of one of Horace’s bawdiest satires (Sermonum I.ii.). The poet recommends having affairs with freedwomen instead of other men’s wives: while he’s having sex with such a woman he doesn’t have to worry that her husband will come home, she’ll jump up, and he (Horace) will have to run out with an undone toga and barefoot; “It is wretched to be caught,” he advises us.  JC takes issue with another author who had said “Horace has no real issue with adultery: his argument is against stupidity”: “This reading takes us in the wrong direction,” says JC, “privileging the notion of a coherent subject that [sic] has a goal of self-government through self-knowledge. We should attend more carefully to Horace’s suggestion that judging others is violent and deceitfully seductive, not in so far as we fail to know ourselves but rather in so far as we trust too blindly in the redemptive power of self-knowledge” (@133). I couldn’t find anything quoted from Horace up to that point where he suggests that judging others is “violent” or “deceitfully seductive”: this seems to be imputed to him through JC’s personal reading. But more than that, her comment struck me as taking very broad humor way too seriously, and importing into it all sorts of theoretical concepts (such as “subjects”) that probably modern academics can see much better than typical readers, ancient or modern. (Cf. Jerry Lewis movies and the French film theorists of the 1960s.)Even if Horace did have a serious intention beneath his slapstick, a weakness of this book's very heavy and intricate reading is that there isn’t any attempt to show that Horace’s intended audience would have understood the satire in this way; nor is it claimed that this reading of his work had historical importance because it was adopted by someone like, say, Machiavelli, Locke, the Framers of the US Constitution, etc.. Without such anchoring, you're thrown back to the position that a text can mean almost anything that an imaginative critic can pull out of it. And while that might sometimes be a defendable position, it begs the question of why Horace's satire provides a better vehicle for this message about self-knowledge and republicanism than some other piece of literature, apart from the accident that Latin literature is JC's academic specialty.On a more prosaic level: the book has true footnotes and a list of references, a welcome departure from the recent university press fashion of endnotes only. However, I ran into at least one footnote citing only to a Kindle ""location,"" without a corresponding page reference. I own a print copy of the book in question (from Cambridge UP), but the citation was meaningless to me. Kindle-only citations would be a very disturbing trend. Probably the simplest way to avoid them would be for ebook publishers, especially university presses, to include real page numbers in their electronic versions; in the meantime, they should require authors to include page references, even if they also include a ""location.""JC says in her concluding paragraph, “I have sought to offer practical tools for civic education by articulating learnable _practices of knowing the world_ that characterize late republican texts. These practices arise from close reading, and I hope it is clear that the purpose of laying out my own readings in detail is to put the interrogative ethos that fuels them on display as much as to advocate for their content” (@208; emphasis in original). I totally agree about the importance of civic education, but only an academic could believe that the sort of analysis presented in the book could a practical tool for educating anyone outside a ridiculously elite audience. Even as a book of theory, more directness would have been helpful. Just this month alone I've read three books of theory that were truly exciting (Norberto Bobbio's ""Destra e Sinistra,"" ""Construir Pueblo"" by Íñigo Errejón and Chantal Mouffe, and Christoph Möller's ""The Three Branches""); none were easy, the theses were diverse, I didn't agree with any of them 100%, but each of them presented its arguments clearly. I was looking forward to this book's continuing that streak, and maybe even improving my opinion of Cicero, but neither of those happened. Perhaps if in a future work the author would concentrate less on demonstrating her erudition and more on communicating the urgency of the classical texts in a down-to-earth way, she could get more readers to share both her “interrogative ethos” and her enthusiasm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAU0OLGQR9MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=069116259X#wasThisHelpful","R1IAU0OLGQR9MG","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some important statistics about this book: the P-to-E section of this dictionary runs to 674 double-columned pages, while the E-to-P section is 40% bigger, at around 942. My unabridged monolingual Michaelis dictionary (Brazilian) runs to over 2000 triple-columned pages a few centimetres taller and a kilo or two heavier than the present volume, so this imbalance certainly isn't because there's any shortage of vocabulary or denotations in Portuguese. And although it has fewer entries overall, the Collins Concise dictionary manages to keep the discrepancy between the two sections within less than 10%. While it's certainly larger than other P/E dictionaries currently in print, and contains both Brazilian and European usage, it seems to be a dictionary better-suited for translating from English to Portuguese rather than the other way around. Multinationals looking to adapt their instruction manuals when selling into Brazil and other Lusophone markets might be well-served by this tilt.But even gung-ho globalists who are used to the performance standard set by, say, the the unabridged Collins French/English or German/English dictionaries — which are comparably priced — will be very disappointed with this work. For example, if you translate business writing from English into Portuguese, you won't find basic terms like 'tender offer,' 'leveraged buy-out,' 'put' (the right to demand that a counterparty buy an asset from you), or 'call' (the right to demand that a counterparty sell an asset to you). All of these are in the Collinses I mentioned, together with much more.Conversely, if you’re mainly interested in reading contemporary Brazilian literature and song lyrics, as I am (along with law and social science), you're also going to have some frustrations with this book. In the P/E section there are a few text boxes here and there that explain some of the names of political parties, a few popular music styles, etc. But despite these, you’d never know that “balanar” connotes dancing, and the book definitely ain’t got that “suinge.” The ubiquitous colloquial adjective “legal” is defined with an affectless “good” (it’s more like “terrific!”) If you prefer your beer cold, you’d never know that in Brazil you ask for “um chope estupidamente gelado”(or be able to figure out what that is if offered one).  If you read a headline about a “Tuiuiú na Copa” you’d never know be able to find out that the first word denotes a large bird native to the Pantanal region, much less that it’s also the nickname for a person from that region (who in this case is playing in the World Cup). The E/P section does include some familiar four-letter words and other obscenities, but the translations aren’t symmetrical, e.g., an F-word expression gets turned into an S-word expression when you back-translate the Brazilian equivalent; and I was puzzled by the translations of some other common obscenities and non-vulgar pejoratives that Oxford doesn’t blink at but that send Amazon’s automated Brain Police into conniptions even with some letters replaced by asterisks (honi soit qui mal y pense, Amazon!), so I can’t identify them here. Even if you are simply reading the very polite Brazilian constitution and run across the term “Distrito Federal,” you’ll need to look elsewhere to find out that this is the area around Brasília — whereas “District of Columbia” and many similar proper nouns are in the E/P section. And while you'll be able to find the translation for ""Azerbaijão"" (surprise: it's ""Azerbaijan""), ""Iemanjá"" and other important Brazilian cultural references are missing.To my annoyance, I found better translations of several terms mentioned here in either my Collins or my Larousse paperback concise dictionaries -- which means I can't free up shelf space by packing them away. And if you have the aging but indispensable Chamberlain & Harmon ""Dictionary of Informal Brazilian Portuguese"" (1983), don't even think of setting it aside.So the best I can say is that if some dire circumstance constrains you to have only one Portuguese-English dictionary, this book is certainly better than a concise dictionary, and much better than any made-in-Brazil bilingual dictionaries I’m aware of. But that's something of a contrived compliment, since for all but the most conventional work you're going to need other dictionaries to supplement this one. Anglophones still have a wait, it seems, for Portuguese to be on a par with other Western languages when it comes to resources for translators and the culturally curious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QATTFU4O541/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019967812X#wasThisHelpful","R28QATTFU4O541","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a dense and stimulating book about constitutional theory, written from a comparative point of view. Discussing not only national contexts but also the EU and general public international law arenas, it’s a rare examination of the meaning and purpose of splitting the powers of government among legislative, executive, and judiciary branches. The author (CM) is a leading German constitutional scholar who spent time studying and teaching in the US; this is an original work in quite clear English that elaborates on a couple of earlier works he had published in German. Even though most of the examples relate to a European or North American context, I found a lot to inform my thinking about the constitutional situation in Japan, where I live and teach.Despite the “checks and balances” narrative most Americans learn in school, that’s only one possible form for the separation of powers. As CM shows in Chap. 1, France, England, the US and Germany each exemplify a different style of separation. The theme that underlies them all is the tension between individual and democratic (collective) self-determination. Only a system that facilitates and guarantees both, says CM, can enjoy legitimacy. The judiciary tends mostly to protect individual freedom (since its main function is to consider cases involving individuals), a properly-functioning legislature exemplifies democratic freedom, and the task of the executive is to link the two. For CM the true rationale for the separation of powers “is not the repression and facilitation of political power, but rather the organization of a model of law-making in which individual and democratic matters of self-determination gain equal recognition” (@109).The discussion of legitimacy is approached from a general and philosophical perspective in Chap. 2, then applied in Chap. 3 to certain national-scale issues (including the regulation of administrative bureaucracy, dubbed by some other writers as the “fourth branch”), and then in Chap. 4 to the specific institutions of the EU, to issues of federalism generally, and also to public international law regimes such as the UN and WTO. A final chapter offers a brief and sometimes withering assessment of some other concepts, such as “governance,” that are floating around in the modern discourse about separation of powers.Note that the book focuses on systems that are considered to be democracies: it doesn’t discuss states such as China, the Soviet Union, most modern Middle Eastern states or military governments in Asia, even though most of those countries have constitutions that pay at least lip service to a three-branch structure; and despite the cover, Brazil is mentioned only once, in passing. Some of CM’s arguments, such as his concern about the democratic deficit when a dedicated constitutional court is very active in protecting the basic rights of individuals (@134-139), seemed shaped in response to the German situation — on the contrary, I think such a court might be a very welcome thing to have in Japan, for example. But CM emphasizes that he’s not proposing a “one-size-fits-all model” (@139), so the occasional German spin doesn’t reduce the usefulness of the book as a source of ideas for readers elsewhere.As mentioned above, CM’s argument is extremely dense, and I think impossible for most readers (myself included) to fully absorb on a first pass. While his writing style uses little jargon and usually avoids twisted syntax, it consists mostly of declarations made with confident certitude, one after another after another, without solicitous pauses for the reader who may have fallen off the pace — something like the first time I tried cross-country skiing, with a friend’s family who’d each been practicing the sport since childhood. Chapter 2, the most abstractly philosophical, was especially difficult for me to focus on, but it started to make more sense when I went back to it after having read the rest of the book.The book has a bibliography as well as true footnotes, not endnotes. (Though the tone of these usually matches the serious tone of the main text, I did enjoy one footnote's reference to ""the continuously imprecise"" 'State of Exception' by G. Agamben.) That it’s already two years since the book’s original publication without a single Amazon review nor, to the best of my knowledge, any comment in a US law journal or law prof blog is a testimony to the parochial mentality of the US legal academy, which is given to churning out books about “liberal democracies” (plural) based entirely on the jurisprudence of the US Supreme Court. I believe this book’s ideas and arguments are important, and deserve to be widely read and discussed. Suffice it to say: I’ve got books in almost every significant area of my home and office, but I’ve made a slot for this one on a shelf within arm’s reach of my desk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FT7Y5JNUV4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198738080#wasThisHelpful","R4FT7Y5JNUV4E","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very readable, not-too-difficult, but not at all easy, introduction to a difficult topic. The authors (DS/CN) aimed to pitch the book between Scientific American and the technical literature. At this they succeed, but that’s something like aiming between the top of a shopping mall and low earth orbit. It would be more accurate to say that the presentation is somewhere between SciAm and an undergraduate stat mech textbook. There’s no way, for example, that you can read this book and tackle the famous review paper on the topic by Binder & Young (Rev. Mod. Phys. 1986) unless you already have a good number of math and physics courses under your belt. What the book can give you, though, is a road-map to many of the topics that paper covers.It will also give you an overview of some applications of the mathematical apparatus of spin glass research to other areas (Chap. 6). Here I really appreciated the authors’ taste: they avoid trendy topics in economics or social physics, and stick to more reasonable fare: computational complexity, neural network computation and the protein folding problem. Cf. a paper on the arXiv about the spin glass physics of custody battles involving parents who either have more 2 or more children with multiple exes, or have children with one or more exes and are involved with a partner in a similar situation — not only is the problem contrived but it’s very unlikely in real life to be entrusted to physicists.The survey of applications doesn’t end the book, though. It’s followed by a chapter on short-range spin glasses, a family of models distinguished from those that assume an infinite spin glass, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, which are discussed earlier. This chapter is slightly more demanding mathematically, and the authors even suggest it’s skippable altogether — though I’d advise against that, for a few reasons. First, if your math can handle the earlier chapters it can probably handle this one;  second, this chapter is referred to several times in the conclusion. And third and most importantly, this material supports the conclusion’s point that it might not be justified to push analogies too far between different types of complex systems (or “quasi-complex” systems, as the authors believe spin glasses to be, since the latter aren’t adaptive). There might not be any “universality” in the behavior of complex systems — at some point, important behavior may be sui generis.Unfortunately, history shows that such insights will do little to discourage statistical physicists from branching into family counseling, or economists from spinning their very successful tales. For example, it’s been observed for years that the equilibrium models that underlie macroeconomics and some aspects of microeconomics as well are nonsense — a point made elegantly in this book, though without reference to economics, when the authors point out that a system that’s strongly characterized by its past is a system that’s out of equilibrium (@45). Of course even spin glass physicists use unrealistic models, like SK. But those physicists don’t make or influence any decisions that could affect your life, like whether to fire you, how much to pay you, or what should be the economic policy of the country as a whole. Even the financial crash of 2008 wasn’t enough to convince economists who hadn’t foreseen it that their models were wrong; the impact of this book on that issue is likely to be somewhat more modest.When I wrote to the authors to ask about a couple of points that had confused me, they both responded immediately, warmly, and effectively. Some of my questions grew out of my misreadings, but there are a couple of points a reader might want to keep in mind. One is that what makes the hierarchical tree in Fig. 5.6 “ultrametric” isn’t just its structure, but also the particular metric used with it. The other is that although the various models aren’t written with an express dependence on temperature T, there is a factor of exp[-E/(k_B)T] buried in there (see sec. 1.5). The absence of explicit T-dependence confused me when Chap. 6 started talking about adjusting T as a parameter; maybe this will be more clearly expressed in a future edition.The book includes a useful bibliography, though a little hard to scan because it’s organized in order of citation as in some science journals like Science or Nature, rather than alphabetically as in mathematics or some non-science fields. The index isn’t adequate: for example, ‘information’ is mentioned often in the text in various senses of that word, but none are indexed. The authors told me they’d done it themselves, because a professional job is expensive — since another Princeton U Press book I read recently had an even more amateurish index, I suspect that Princeton’s contract terms with its authors might be a little too greedy, shifting the indexing cost to them without regard to the impact on the book’s users. That’s a very minor point that’s not so pertinent to whether you should read this book. If you’re new to spin glasses, you should.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SK8ABGHS0L4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691147337#wasThisHelpful","R1SK8ABGHS0L4J","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sort of book only a law professor, current or aspiring, would pick up, much less finish. In fact, since most American law professors have no interest in comparative law, most of them will ignore it, too. Nonetheless, for a book in such an uncharismatic genre, it’s pretty good.The premise of the book is to encourage researchers in comparative law to be more thoughtful about the range of methodologies available to them. The author’s approach is patient and careful. Most of the book (Chaps. 3-9) focuses on teasing out the many ambiguities hiding the two key questions, What is ‘comparison’?, and What is ‘law’? It turns out that these concepts aren’t so easily pulled apart, especially when one recognizes the difficulty of maintaining the position that laws are rules, plain and simple. I found some of the chapters about methods of comparison — esp. the chapters on structural comparison and hermeneutical method — to be particularly well presented; e.g., if you’re afraid your grip on legal positivism, Hohfeld’s model of rights, duties, powers, etc. or Kelsen’s pure theory of law isn’t so solid, here you’ll find nice, clear descriptions in just a couple of sentences each.Along the way, one learns of some astonishingly dumb, dogmatic positions that famous comparatists have taken, among them: always start from the assumption that the systems you’re comparing are similar, and if you find that they don’t resolve an issue in the same way from a functional point of view, you’ve probably done something wrong; don’t waste your time comparing legal systems from the same tradition (civil law, common law, etc.); the categories used in English law are exactly identical to those in the Digest of Roman law; and even if some cultures didn’t or don’t have a concept of “rights” (like ancient Athens), all people have had rights, at all times in history and in all places. The author names and shames, but I leave that for you to discover when you read the book. The last two chapters present a series of dichotomies one should keep in mind when planning a comparative analysis —- a framework for the very undogmatic, “pluralistic, dialectical” approach the author encourages you to adopt.The book has some limitations. Maybe not surprisingly for a book in the European Academy of Legal Theory Monograph Series, it’s very Eurocentric, focusing especially on such European issues as harmonization (which constitutes universalization, the opposite of comparison, in the author’s view). As a result, certain uses of comparison, such as in developing legislation for practical domestic use, don’t get attention. The concrete examples (of which there were a bit too few, I felt) tend to come from the traditional textbook favorites of commercial and tort law — the same topics emphasized in the comp law textbook I studied from more than 30 years ago. Nothing about such modern mainstream fields as, e.g., intellectual property or privacy law — and my own main interest, constitutional law, is dismissed with an adverb when the author notes that “only” constitutional lawyers would be interested in Kelsen’s model, @101. Ironically, the text hews to the dogma of comparison between but not within traditions: all examples are based on that old chestnut, contrasting common law with civil law, but never, say, English vs. Scottish (much less American) or German vs. French. Also adding to the retro flavor is that the most modern “-ism” the book discusses is structuralism, whereas I know French comparatists in their 40s who speak a much more Foucauldian idiom, and maybe they already sound like old fogeys to their students.That said, the book makes welcome use of a wealth of French sources as well as English ones. The prose is earnest, a bit wordy perhaps, and some anecdotes or examples are repeated once or twice too often (such as Marie-Laure Izoche’s analogy that the purpose of a playing card only makes sense in the context of the full deck), but you probably aren’t expecting a ripping yarn when you pick up a book like this anyway, and this one is generally free of jargon and tortured academic syntax. Far more useful than slogging through one of those gigantic and pricey “companions to” or “handbooks of” the subject, this is a helpful, concise and cost-effective introduction to the philosophy of comparative law.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFWOD7WFXUKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849466432#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFWOD7WFXUKB","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a mathematician and no longer a student, just someone who reads math occasionally for refreshment. I picked up this book as part of my summer break reading, and found it perfectly suited to an enjoyable couple of days. Although it claims to be directed to an audience of grad students and professionals, I'm far away from either qualification: having read a book or two about knots and pieces of books about graphs in the distant past was enough to enable me to enjoy most of it.Most of the book relates to material published jointly or severally by the authors in the past couple of years, especially concerning the group action of duals and twists on ribbon graphs. Many of the pertinent references are on the arXiv and more than a few date from between 2010-2014, so the material is still very current as I write. However, the book is a synthesis and refinement, not just a repetition, of that material. It's richly illustrated, so you can learn a lot from trying to reproduce the diagrams. The pictures alone are already very suggestive of how embedded graphs are connected to knots and links. (I also really liked the authors'  phrase ""twisted duality"" -- geometrically apt, but maybe also a useful metaphor for marriage counselors and other therapists?)I do recommend though that you know something about graph and knot polynomials, which are of great interest to working mathematicians. My knowledge was more than zero but epsilon-sized in this area, and I wound up skimming large chunks of the algebraic proofs showing how various polynomials (e.g. Tutte, Penrose, Bollabás-Riordan, Jones, and HOMFLY, plus Kaufmann bracket) were related to each other and/or to the authors' ""transition polynomial"". The book's treatment of these topics is self-contained but only in a perfunctory way, despite (or perhaps because of) the topics' importance for many readers.I read this in the paperback edition. Thanks to Springer for allowing many illustrations in the print book make effective use of color. The list of references is good, the index is mostly adequate, and the number of typos average or less for a typical math book. The one drawback is that the price is a little steep for a thin book like this; but it's still pretty good value compared to some Springer Briefs in other fields. (I bought mine at a discount during the publisher's annual Yellow Sale.) Assuming you have the background mentioned above, this book is a fun and visually stimulating way to engage with current mathematical research, even for undergraduates and amateurs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZIZEN49B4FYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1461469708#wasThisHelpful","R2ZIZEN49B4FYF","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is based on using this book as a reference, not on reading it all the way through. One of the strengths of the book is its discussion of the classification of surfaces. It also has a great deal about ""voltage graphs,"" a/k/a gain graphs, a topic that apparently was hot in the 1970s and 1980s, but that you won't find mentioned in modern textbooks like Diestel, Bollabás or Bondy. (While the two latter books have short sections on electrical networks as an example, a voltage graph was a much broader concept.) As of the end of August 2015, I found only 25 papers on the arXiv that mention voltage or gain graphs in their abstracts, spread over a more than 10-year period.That's not the only indication that the vocabulary and research areas about graphs on surfaces have come a long way since this book's publication date in 1987 -- in particular, you won't find anything about such current areas of interest as the application of graph theory to knots and links, nor anything about Tutte, Penrose, etc. polynomials, even though these ideas had already been published prior to the book's appearance.The lack of answers or hints to exercises is definitely a drawback to self-study, despite what another reviewer has proposed. The book has both a ""References"" list and a ""Bibliography,"" though the difference between them isn't clearly spelled out. (The Dover edition has a supplemental bibliography from around 2001.) There is a subject index only - no name index, so, e.g., you won't be able to find references to Tutte or anyone else very easily.What really moved me to write this review was the deterioration in Dover's printing. I've been getting their books since the 1960s, and although the books stopped being bound with thread in the 1980s or so, this year (2015) I've gotten a couple of Dovers that really shocked me. This is one of them. The print is fuzzy and unpleasant to read, the paper has a lot of show-through, the product feels bulky: it looks like your usual lousy academic press digital transfer job. And the book doesn't even describe itself as being printed: it was ""**Manufactured** in the United States by Courier Corporation."" I've bought plenty of Dovers since 2000, when Courier acquired Dover (before being itself acquired by R.R. Donnelly this year); but either it's only recently that they shifted to lower printing quality, or else I had a long string of luck in getting earlier-printed shelf stock. The copy of Gross & Tucker I got was printed in 2013, and another title I got that was even worse than this was from 2015. Prices are jumping up, too, though this particular title is still reasonable as I write. It's worrying to think that Dovers could soon be bad value, thanks to corporate ""efficiency,"" i.e. greed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDDL5QFG1P4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486417417#wasThisHelpful","R1SDDL5QFG1P4Y","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has a lot of useful material and serious reflection on an important topic: the excessive degree to which our public policy is oriented toward boosting GDP. I've been engaged with many similar topics relating to economic growth for much of the past seven years or so --- which is as long as it took the author (DP) to write the book -- and I still was able to learn a number of new things from it.The book's greatest strength is the quality of historical research that went into it, which is featured in roughly the first half of the book. Among other things, DP consulted the archives and personal papers of both Robert La Folette, Jr. and Simon Kuznets. The former was the US Senator from Wisconsin thanks to whom the US would commission its first estimates of the national income during the Depression; the latter was the future Nobel-winning economist who led the effort to compile those estimates and who in the process laid the foundation for the GDP metric. A lot of this historical detail was new to me. And it's very timely to be reminded about the humanity of La Follette, whose more famous successors as Wisconsin Republicans have included Joseph McCarthy (who defeated La Follette in a primary) and Scott Walker. The book also made me realize the important contribution of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement to the discourse of development; I'd been under the mistaken impression that this was a postwar discourse only. DP's historical treatment is strongest in the early 20th Century through early post-WWII years. His emphasis throughout is on how GDP (then GNP) and the system of national accounts came to be standardized in the non-Communist world. The treatment is sketchier about how GDP growth came to be a priority for national policy from and after 1949. For that part of the story, one might consult the historical discussion in Walter Arndt's ""The Rise and Fall of Economic Growth"" (1978) and Lorenzo Fioramonti's ""Gross Domestic Problem"" (2013), which approach the issue from somewhat complementary angles.The second half of the book focuses more on the problems GDP-based growth causes in the world today, and why GDP isn't the appropriate metric to help us escape from them or from problems like global warming and inequality. DP proposes that we use a mix of new indicators that more directly measure things that are important to us -- and that the choice of these indicators be accomplished more democratically than was the case with the adoption of GDP. Personally I agree with DP that GDP-led growth is causing many problems and can't solve lots of others, though I wasn't entirely convinced that new quantitative indicators will be either a necessary or a sufficient part of their solution. However, DP's general approach does have a lot of support among those who criticize economic growth (including many in Continental Europe, outside the mainly Anglophone spotlight of this book).DP's writing style is serious but pleasant, and never academic. Unfortunately, though, the book could have been edited more crisply; and since DP tells us in the acknowledgments that he had a life-threatening illness after finishing the manuscript, I suspect it was the publisher's team who dropped the ball here. Some historical chapters begin with introductory digressions several pages long that make it hard for the reader to keep the thread of the story; these might have been better had they been pared down to a few paragraphs, and the rest of the material moved elsewhere. In addition to repetition of themes, there's sometimes repetition of words, as when we're told that ""By today's standards, the government of 1931 was very tiny"" (@72) and the same thing almost verbatim at @85. Some factual errors/inconsistencies escaped notice, as when we're told that GDP measures volume of production (@273) or the totality of goods and services produced (@3), even though DP spends much more time on correct explanations of what GDP measures (e.g., Chap. 7 and a very interesting discussion of the meaning of ""final"" goods and services in Chap. 10). Some words are used without much attention to their multiple connotations, particularly ""measure"" (as a noun) and ""distribution"" (in the context of income). A ""measure"" can be a metric, or it can be a plan or course of action, but which sense was meant wasn't always evident to me, especially when I ran into the oxymoron ""qualitative measure"" (@223, 230); I think ""measure [i.e., metric] of quality"" was meant. Similarly, it was a shock to see that GDP measures ""distribution"" of income (@94, 312n43), when it famously tells us nothing about how income is distributed among the population; I'm guessing this was a reference to distribution of contributions to national income across product and service sectors. There even was a running typographical glitch, when DP's own double-indented bullet-point lists were put into the same tiny type as block quotes from other people, thereby taking the punch out of precisely the things DP considered most important. An alert copy editor should have picked up almost all of the problems I've mentioned here.The book includes more than 70 pages of discursive endnotes (i.e., they talk about a lot of important stuff, not just citations), plus a good bibliography. The index, though, while looking adequate at first glance, isn't so good when put to use. The publisher used a lot of tricks of the trade to save paper, including too few subject headings (resulting in long strings of page references without much indication of each one's importance) and misuse of page ranges (such as ""110-15"" for ""Japan,"" which makes it look like there's a detailed discussion of the subject there, when actually all the references are very minor, they aren't related to each other, and Japan isn't even mentioned at all on p. 114). An even bigger problem is that the notes aren't picked up in the index at all: to a reader using the book for reference or reading it non-consecutively, or to a prospective buyer looking it over before buying it, this makes DP appear to have neglected many important issues that he in fact does address. Again, this is a cost-cutting trick -- but to add insult to injury, there are four blank pages following this index, a waste of an extra 40% capacity. All in all, though, while the presentation sometimes inadvertently clouds rather than clarifies, this book has a good deal of valuable information and thoughtful analysis for the patient reader interested in GDP and growth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A3ROGR4BZWJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691166528#wasThisHelpful","R1A3ROGR4BZWJG","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is an interesting and imaginative attempt to justify a right of writers and readers to literary freedom, based on the ""capabilities approach"" of Nussbaum and Sen (hereafter, the ""CA"") and certain human rights articulated under public international law. Among other things, it means to be a practical application showing how the CA can lead to different results from the usual ""negative rights"" approach to free speech, represented by John Rawls and the rest of the liberal Kantian tradition, among others.One of the more interesting chapters uses the CA to justify government support for ""high"" art, a/k/a capital-C ""Culture."" An even more urgent motivating problem for the author (HKM) is what to do with speech that incites others to violence, including (but in her view not limited to) genocidal violence. Her proposed solution is that instead of censoring such hate speech, the state should provide means for the targets of such speech to ""speak back"" against it -- i.e., fight it with more freedom of speech, instead of with restrictions on free speech. As she admits, though, this slim book isn't able to deal with many potential issues with this approach, such as determining when the right of speaking back is triggered, and how to resolve conflicting claims over who may exercise it.It helps to have some familiarity with political philosophy to get the most from this book, though a reader lacking that might be able to pick up enough from the context of the discussion. There are also some references to literary theory, though often the purpose is to make distinctions from the usual theoretical point of view, as in the cases of Theodor Adorno and Roland Barthes. (When discussing the latter, though, HKM maybe rushes too quickly over the distinction between authors and writers -- you may need to reach, as I did, for a dictionary of literary theory to catch her idea.) The writing style is light on jargon compared to a lot of other works on literature and politics. But the tone is that of an academic thesis, with lots of paragraphs explaining what's ahead and more paragraphs recapitulating the the same material once it's been presented, rather than a fiery polemic.I certainly had a lot of questions after reading this book, including not only the ones HKM mentions but also about such details as whether minority linguistic groups within a society have a right to require translation of literary works. And although I'm sympathetic to the CA, especially (like HKM) in Nussbaum's version, when HKM reminds the reader that all capabilities have to be enabled simultaneously or else none of them are enabled I had the uncomfortable thought that the CA might be like the ""free market"": a sort of perfect state that's unattainable in practice, so all sorts of unfalsifiable utopian claims may be made for it. Still, despite the unfinished nature of the argument, I found HKM's idea of using the CA to derive distinct practical results from the usual Rawlsian approach to be very stimulating, and a good reason to read the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QON4DG0N0XVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780998805#wasThisHelpful","R3QON4DG0N0XVM","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has some excellent aspects and some major drawbacks. Its best features are a very broad coverage of topics relating to comedy throughout history, and almost 20 pages of references and recommendations for further reading. The author's (MB's) juxtapositions of works from different periods and genres is sometimes very stimulating.MB's style, though is too clever by way more than half: it's a constant patter of allusions, quips, gratuitous references and supposed insights that too often dazzle rather than inform. E.g., MB mentions ""a confederacy of dunces"" in the context of a Shakespeare character (@67): the phrase comes from Swift or, if you prefer, J.K. Toole, neither of whom are discussed there at all -- it's just a gratuitous wink. Or: ""When Mark Twain noted that `reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated,' he hit upon a good epitaph for comedy, for the mode suggests that death as the final outcome is itself something of an exaggeration"" (@109-110). What does this mean, exactly? If it's comedy's epitaph, that means that comedy itself could die, an eventuality that even MB never suggests; but if it were to die, there wouldn't be any exaggeration. And why bring up epitaphs at all?: Twain's epitaph is something else entirely, and rather sentimental. MB's brilliant glibness too often dissolves into non sequitur or other sorts of thought-eddy that distract the reader; page after page of these rococo touches gets old very quickly.The book's other disturbing feature is that MB's taste in comedy evidently runs to the sadistic. The mild family sitcoms of the US Baby Boom years, or the animal-loving antics of films like ""Fierce Creatures"" (to say nothing of the pleasant plotless meanderings of much Japanese TV comedy) don't seem to be on his radar. Maybe the tortures inflicted in Voltaire's ""Candide"" are an important aspect of that tale's message (@83), but it's a bit much to be told that Jonathan's Swift's cruel joke about a flayed woman is ""gorgeous"" (@99). Similarly, after quoting an Evelyn Waugh passage mentioning how a caged fox had been killed in a British private club by being pelted with champagne bottles, MB notes, ""This is more vertiginously, comically delightful than just a satire on the bottle-throwers (satire is often a way of saying that you care, but in Waugh's fiction caring itself is satirized)."" (@89). I can imagine the expression on fictional detective Inspector Lewis's face were he to read that while investigating MB, who teaches within Lewis's jurisdiction at Oxford -- and I'd agree with the policeman.The book has quite a few jokes and quotes with four-letter words and/or sexual overtones, so if that would bother you, be warned. (Not that it affects my rating: I thought the funniest joke in the book was an almost-unquotable one-liner from Sarah Silverman, who BTW is also mentioned often in Oxford's VSI on Humour.) This has many ingredients of an excellent book, but sadly after the first few pages it becomes unpleasant to read. Traditional British understatement would have been much more effective.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHP8Y2RHLMB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199601712#wasThisHelpful","RQHP8Y2RHLMB2","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review pertains to the Howard Augenbraum translation published by Penguin (2006). I'd been expecting this novel to be mainly of historical interest, but it turned out to be quite enjoyable as well. There's a surprising amount of satire and sarcasm, as well as red-hot indignation, that comes through in this translation. (And a day or two after I finished reading it I saw the Archbishop of the Philippines interviewed on the BBC, which brought home that there's a great deal in the novel that remains topical, too.) Of course you may encounter some slower patches: for me, these were mainly some detailed descriptions of religious festivals. And some plot elements, such as the central romance, may seem rather quaint. But the whole thing compares favourably to a good Sir Walter Scott novel -- with a lot more political spice, to boot.The Penguin edition includes numerous endnotes to explain many allusions to local foods and customs, Latin tags, etc. (though I think the translator was a little shaky in his French and Latin in a couple of places). My one very tiny criticism is that a glossary would have been a better idea for most of those entries, since some terms in Tagalog and other languages appear often in the text but are defined only in the endnote attached to their first appearance; moreover the endnotes depart from the format used in most other Penguin Classics by not identifying the bit of text to which each note refers, making it difficult to read the endnotes pro- or retrospectively. But all in all, a very diverting read even for a reader like me, who lacks any personal or professional connection to the Philippines; I'll definitely read the sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLNQ5RDZZ628/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143039695#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLNQ5RDZZ628","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading this book about ""ecocriticism"" made me recall a word I had to learn during one of the duller stretches of 10th grade English: ""congeries,"" meaning a heap or aggregation of disparate items. That's pretty much what this is: the book's 20 chapters cover a wide selection of topics, but even reading it cover to cover didn't give me a more coherent idea of what ecocriticism is than I had before.Apparently the term not only takes in criticism of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also of non-fiction genres such as essayistic nature writing and science popularisations. On top of that it also often seems to morph into things like ontology (e.g., Chap. 6, which questions the ontological status of human beings as distinct from machines) or sociology of science (e.g., Chap. 15, which raises the question of what counts as good science). Unfortunately, the book doesn't present a clear case for what critiques of climate science or sociobiology *as such* have in common with critiques of Wordsworth, Mary Shelley and *essays about* climate change or sociobiology, even though all of these topics come within the book's ambit. Sometimes TC even muddles these distinctions, as when in a discussion of Stephen Jay Gould's essays he suggests that the notion of punctuated equilibrium is ""idiosyncratic"" to Gould and does not warrant the ""public authority"" his essays give it (@171) -- I suspect many paleontologists might differ with this.That's not to say that critiques of science and critiques of literature couldn't have anything in common. For example, it seems plausible that you could apply some form of discourse analysis to scholarly scientific papers, conference proceedings, journalistic reporting, advertising, etc. no less than to literary and popular genres. It's too bad that TC doesn't explore such avenues more specifically. Had he done so, a title something like ""The Cambridge Introduction to Environmental Discourse"" might have been an appropriate frame to help the reader see how all this stuff could hang together.As it is, though, the book's approach isn't unifying but kaleidoscopic -- with all of the connotations of fragmentation and disorientation that metaphor suggests. Very possibly TC doesn't deserve most of the blame for this incoherence: a lot of it might have to do with diverse camps of humanities scholars all trying to jump onto the ""eco"" bandwagon, as Education ministries in the UK and elsewhere demand they provide evidence of their productivity, competitiveness, and relevance. Whoever is to blame, though, the reader who's new to this field can't be faulted for concluding that ""ecocriticism"" is more about fashion than about synergy.On the plus side, TC's perspective isn't entirely Anglophone, as he brings in some German touches with discussions of philosophers Martin Heidegger and Hubert Zapf and fiction writers Christa Wolf and Wilhelm Raabe, among others. (TC seems eager to exculpate Heidegger of racism (@59), something not really feasible when this book came out and now much less so with the 2014 publication of his ""Schwarze Hefte"" [black notebooks]; at the same time he refers to Heidegger's being perceived as an archetypical ""eco-fascist"" (id.), a term not defined until two chapters later (@74), leaving me wondering whether the humor was intentional or inadvertent.) Of course the Three Musketeers (Foucault, Deleuze, Guattari) also make an obligatory appearance, along with D'Artagnan (Bruno Latour).Unfortunately, TC accepts Latour's definition of ""political ecology"" as the paradigmatic one, thereby ignoring an older and more fruitful line of thinking put forward by André Gorz, Ivan Illich, Jacques Ellul and others. He also ignores virtually the entire sustainability literature produced by economists. Some of this, particularly Robert Solow's notion of weak sustainability and the dialogue about discount rates led by Nicholas Stern and William Nordhaus, is very directly relevant to topics in the book, such as the ""rights of the not-yet-born"" (@110). And for someone who is quick to point out the political implications of most arguments, it's a pity TC lets post-humanism off without any criticism of its implications for democracy (Chap. 6). When writers like Timothy Morton read ""Frankenstein"" to mean that ""the task becomes to love the disgusting, the inert and the meaningless,"" and that ""the most ethical act is to love the other precisely in their artificiality"" (quoted @ 70), TC raises no question about who makes the decisions to release these monstrosities into the world. Just because crazed billionaire Tony Stark-wannabes have the ego, desire and resources to do so doesn't mean that we should all have to suffer the consequences.I suspect that the misleading title of this book came at the insistence of some CUP editor, given that the title of the series in which it appears is ""Cambridge Introductions to Literature."" If only that person could have applied the same gung-ho spirit to fixing the presentation of references, which is extremely inconvenient for a book of this sort. Unless you read the book in chapter order (as I did) and read all endnotes assiduously and with a photographic memory (as I did not), you'll find many endnotes just give an author surname, a short title and a page number without any indication of other bibliographic information (as happened to me almost all the time). I had to resort to Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature to find full information for some of the notes that interested me, which often was buried 20 pages or more prior to where I was looking: e.g., the full cite for Chap. 14, note 15 on p. 224 is findable only as note 15 of the Introduction, on p. 204. The nature of a book like this is that many readers will read chapters selectively and/or in multiple sittings over an extended period of time, and/or will look up only those notes that they need to. All abbreviated references should should have indicated the location of the first citation or, better yet, there should have been a full bibliography to accompany the notes.The text is also decorated with a number of unattractive and unfunny cartoons that add neither insight nor humor. I'm somewhat generous in my star-rating, since it's possible that the book's flaws are a faithful reflection of the field itself, and that those who are caught up in the glass bead game of academic literary studies might benefit from this work's presentation of their professors' preoccupations. But I emerged from the book much more skeptical about the enterprise of ecocriticism than when I entered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115SMWIZNGYD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521720907#wasThisHelpful","R115SMWIZNGYD3","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply one of the best books I've read in the past couple of years, in any genre. It's full of warmth, humour and insight. There's no comparison to some other writerly lectures on literature, such as Nabokov's volumes, which I tried to read many years back: this one is totally unpretentious, the text preserves the spontaneity of the lecture hall (including student questions in each of the eight talks), and Cortázar sounds like he was a real human being. In addition to saying many interesting things of a literary nature -- such as about the special qualities of short stories, and the distinctions among the comic, the humorous and the playful, among other topics -- Cortázar provides some great descriptions of the political engagement of both writers and readers. A pair of more formal texts in the appendices expand on this political theme.Most chapters focus on short stories, often quoting them at length, but there are also discussions of the processes of writing ""Rayuela [Hopscotch]"" and ""Libro de Manuel [A Manual for Manuel]."" Since a number of the stories were unfamiliar to me, reading them along with this book was a very enjoyable immersive experience. If your Spanish is weak, don't worry. I'm very poorly self-taught in the language, but at least in the expository passages Cortázar's Spanish was clear enough for me to make it through with great pleasure and interest, including being able to laugh at (I think) the right places. The passages from his fiction were of course more difficult to read cold for someone as unlettered in Spanish as I am, but in most cases I'd read the stories beforehand in English or French translation before tackling the original versions here. Now that I've finished it, I really miss it, and I know it will take me several days before I can let go enough to get absorbed in some other book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIIZ3PFU9H08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6071128714#wasThisHelpful","R2EIIZ3PFU9H08","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to narrative theory, and I came to this book looking for insights that will help me to talk about literature with college students, rather than to teach or write about theory itself. The book's wide range can certainly make for interesting browsing, and the various ""navigational aids"" are helpful, at least in the print version I'm using. Many articles, though, seem like lapidary summaries of their respective topics by contributors who are talking more to their peers and grad students than to poor shnooks like me who perhaps naïvely think of an encyclopedia as someplace to get an overview of the basics.Despite this book's very generous scope (which is the main reason I give it four stars), in any work of this type there are nits one can pick. I was disappointed that most of the entry ""Japanese narrative"" focused on works from around 1,000 years ago, with the 20th-21st Centuries getting barely a paragraph, and no mention is made of Japan's unique position in the worlds of graphic narrative and keitai (mobile phone) fiction. An entry on ""magical realism"" isolates Julio Cortázar's pertinent writings to 1951-1956 for reasons not immediately transparent. And while there's a long essay on ""Law and Narrative,"" the juncture of politics and narrative is hard to find, even in the index.A more serious problem is the relative lack of sample quotations to illustrate some of the entries on specific elements and techniques of narrative. At first I thought this might be because the publisher required authors to obtain permissions for all quotes, as many publishers do, but Taylor & Francis's policies for authors seem to recognize that fair use and fair dealing exclusions from copyright make such a burden unnecessary. So I'm figuring that the paucity of examples is due either to perceived space limitations or to the fact that they just aren't theoretical enough. Either way, it reduces some articles' pedagogical value for the uninitiated, albeit while enhancing their value as aids for the sleepless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7I6FNUHG4KWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415775124#wasThisHelpful","R7I6FNUHG4KWQ","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review relates to the Hanson/Messick translation: I was led to this book by a glowing review in TLS. I found my own reaction was favourable but much more moderate. From an historical point of view, it may have been quite bold and important for its time. As a story, though, it's stuck somewhere between being 2- and 3-dimensional. In particular, the characters weren't so well developed, other than Inés herself. Her interior monologues make it clear that the male protagonist was chosen as a lover because he satisfied certain emotional needs of hers, but that doesn't necessarily make him more interesting for the reader. The ending, too, was disappointing. For those with an interest in literary theory, the text has many diverting aspects, such as its use of symbolism, feminist themes, descriptions of nature, and variations in voice; in fact, these features are so easily accessible that the book could be a sort of textbook case for budding comparative literature scholars. Fortunately, the book is sufficiently well-written that one gets pulled into the story on its own terms, and the descriptions of the setting were very evocative. The text is supplemented by some turn-of-the-century postcards from Constantinople, which might have added more if they had been rotated on the page so that they could be reproduced in a larger size. I read this as some fictional/English-language relief in the middle of working through a large non-fiction volume in another language, and found it a refreshing change, quickly read, yet substantial enough to be memorable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICKH1BW7BPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909408050#wasThisHelpful","RICKH1BW7BPZ","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the 1970s, the US edition of ""Hopscotch"" -- part of Avon's series of several dozen mass market paperback translations of major Latin American authors, a literary project unimaginable today -- featured on its cover a melancholy caricature of the author, Julio Cortázar. Maybe I wasn't alone in getting the impression that he was a depressing read. Decades later, when I finally sat down to read him, though, I discovered my big mistake: although his writing isn't typically optimistic, it's often incredibly funny.This book from 1975 is a great example: farcical even for Cortázar, but with a serious edge as well. The story, narrated in the first person, includes panels from an actual issue of a Mexican comic book featuring the anti-hero Fantomas. The comic's story line drew on Fantomas's friendship with ""Julio, Octavio, Alberto and Susan"" -- as in Cortázar, Paz, Moravia and Sontag, major late 20th Century authors much better known by the general public back then than they or writers of comparable quality are today.  There's also a wonderful sequence of panels where Fantomas's ""civilian"" alter ego explains Bertolt Brecht to his socialite girlfriend, Ira von Fürstenberg (also a real-life person). The comic's plot revolves around a fanatic's scheme to destroy the world's literature, both by making books disappear and by physically threatening authors. (The full comic, issue 201 of ""Fantomas, La amenaza elegante"" [Fantomas, the elegant menace], is available online in Spanish from a blog called ""mundofantomas;"" it includes some additional enjoyable panels about Brecht, especially.)Somehow Cortázar transitions from his finding the comic book at the Brussels train station to his actually being friends with Fantomas. Eventually the comic's panels fall away and Cortázar the character is pulling Fantomas into the work real-life Cortázar was doing as part of the Second Russell Tribunal, which was investigating the brutality of several Latin American military regimes. The task is shown to be beyond even Fantomas's capabilities. The real Tribunal's findings are included as an appendix to the book.One can criticise some aspects of Cortázar's political engagement as naïve: e.g., his admiration for the Cuban Revolution, without acknowledging its harsh treatment of dissidents. But the military brutality in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and elsewhere that he decried was real. In any case, he's never so shrill about politics as to lose his self-deprecating sense of humor, such as in relating his unsuccessful attempts to attract a blonde sitting across from him in his train compartment, or how he paced around in his apartment ""smoking in the manner one learns from suspense films.""Given the book's genre-bending storytelling, it's no wonder this translation has been published through Semiotext(e), a literary theory journal. It's too bad the price is relatively steep for such a slim book. My copy of ""Hopscotch,"" printed in 1975 when an oil crisis was inflating the cost of ink, had a cover price of just $2.95; that comes out to under $12 in today's dollars, for which you got 570 pages, not 87. But considering how much I enjoyed the book compared to, say, some movies I've paid to see in theaters, I didn't regret the bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AC2G1OG3ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584351349#wasThisHelpful","R2AC2G1OG3ZL","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps because this book was published during the military regime in Brazil, I've run into several sources saying it's *about* the military regime in Brazil, some as sober as E. Bradford Burns's well-respected ""History of Brazil."" Actually, there's little or nothing in this book to tie it specifically to Brazil's situation in the late 1970s, when it was written. For the most part, the book reads as very contemporary, except for the absence of cell phones and other marks of modernity. The social problems portrayed are unfortunately timeless, and the author's sense of humor arrested in perpetual adolescence.The two central stories focus on the demi-monde of hookers (often with hearts at least partly of gold), pimps, crooks, prisoners, etc. and how they exploit each other and are oppressed by brutal police. The title story, a fantasy fable about a glass prison run by scientists, is a sort of cross between ""1984"" and the classic 19th Century novella ""The Alienist"" by Machado de Assis, whom the author acknowledges in the story. It can be read in hindsight to refer to life under the junta, but it's no less at home in today's universe of CCTV cameras, drones and ""Big Brother"" as an entertainment series. (But Machado's story, too, is very pertinent to now, and much more fun.) There's also a shallow story about a businessman who fantasizes he's a sexy beast, and a last story involving some fictitious histories of Brazil. That one has a lot in common with John Barth's ""Sot-Weed Factor"" (complete with archaic spellings, in the translation at least), set in a couple of framing narratives (another Barth trick).The lack of period historical color did disappoint my own expectations, but isn't the reason for ""disappointing"" in the title of the review. Rather, that's because the book is incessantly about violence, usually sexual, even as it seems the author is trying to be funny. He's certainly imaginative: each chapter tries a different narrative technique, some of which work well (particularly the second chapter, ""Friday Night/Saturday Morning""), and he makes creative use of parentheses (both the punctuation and the rhetorical trope). But ultimately the constant brutality becomes too oppressive -- to the reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5S118TA65YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564783464#wasThisHelpful","R2B5S118TA65YA","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The marketing of the Penguin edition translated by Boyle and Woodard is what moved me to write this review. Penguin's marketeers claim that Fasti is a ""subtle but powerful political manifesto;"" B&W expand on this theme in their introduction. This piqued my interest in the work, but I was frustrated once I began reading.Maybe Ovid wasn't hiding his jokes and barbs by the standards of his day: for all I know, his contemporaries would be smiling ironically or even rolling on the ground with laughter as they read. But for a reader of this edition to appreciate those bits requires something approaching a professional Latinist's erudition. If the political aspect of the book interests you, be aware that to a great degree it's not visible from the four corners of this work. Mainly its based on (i) what Ovid *omits* from the book (e.g., failing to mention Augustus or members of his family in certain contexts where they might have expected it), and (ii) what Ovid says here *taken together with* what he said in other of his works, e.g. Ars amatoria. Even the example about Jupiter and rape mentioned in the blurb, which seems to be in Ovid's entries for Feb 5 through Feb 12, is rather subtly expressed in the poem's text -- I might easily have passed it on a first reading if B&W hadn't mentioned it in their introduction.In other words, even if there's a political message written here in secret ink, so to speak, usually you'll need to bring in UV lights, lemon juice and other stuff to be able to read it. And often, you'll need to bring your own. While the translators are generous with apparatus (maps, an outline summary, almost 250 pages of scholarly endnotes, a glossary), this material isn't really focused on bringing into relief the political reading for which B&W argue. In particular, the endnotes don't highlight this big picture: although abundant, they tend to focus at a more micro level on specific events, names, places, and calendrical matters. The Introduction is the reader's best guide, but by its own admission it cites only a few examples -- hardly enough to make a ""manifesto.""So I wasn't entirely shocked to find, after some digging with a search engine, that the political reading of the Fasti is still quite contested among modern classical scholars. Many don't accept it, and even some who do read it as more pro-Augustus than, as here, anti. This edition is itself a manifesto of an academic sort. That happens all the time in scholarship and I can grant it's legitimate, though I wish I hadn't mistaken the sales pitch for something more neutral.There's another issue, too. The Fasti's subject, a festival-by-festival discussion of the calendar, prevents the poem from flowing along as beautifully as, say, the Metamorphoses. Nonetheless, for me this translation made things even choppier. Maybe in the belief that they were making things simpler for the reader, B&W use a lot of full stops where they don't occur in the original (or at least, in modern editions of the original text accepted as authoritative). The result is often a string of disconnected sentences, sounding at times more like oracle than narrative.Here's an example, from 4.275-280 (with Latin from the 2014 Latin/German edition published by Reclam, based on the 1988 Alton et al. edition of Ovid's text, published by Teubner -- the same as used by B&W):A thousand hands gather. A hollow ship painted/ With burnt colors holds the Mother of Gods.She is freighted through her son's water most safely,/ And nears the long strait of Phrixus' sister.She passes wide Rhoetium and Sigeum's beaches,/ Tenedos and Eëtion's old realm.mille mane coeunt, et picta coloribus ustis/ caelestum Matrem concava puppis habet.illa sui per aquas fertur tutissima nati/ longaque Phrixeae stagna sororis adit,Rhoeteumque capax Sigeaque litora transit,/ et Tenedum et veteres Eetionis opes.Notice how B&W use four sentences against Ovid's two, suppressing Ovid's ""et"" (""and"") and using periods instead of more liquid commas -- all the more unfortunate since what's being described is the passage of a ship. The choice to begin each line with a capital letter (by no means obligatory in English) chops things up further, especially when the syntax carries over into a new line, as in the first two lines quoted (275-276). I found that it was often easier to get the sense of the translation by looking at the Latin, instead of the other way around. Maybe such roughness is a trade-off for the technical tour de force B&W achieved: tracking the original couplet-by-couplet and usually line-by-line, while sticking to a standard couplet of 12 + 10 syllables. But for the reader who wants a smoother understanding of what Ovid was talking about, a prose translation might be clearer in many places. (That's the case at least with the inexpensive Reclam, if you read German. I haven't yet checked the Oxford Classics English-only edition, nor the Loeb, whose English is from the 1930s).My deduction of stars relates mainly to the gap between the ""political manifesto"" Penguin promises and its actual accessibility to the average reader, even one with some Latin; but the prickly translation is part of the reason, too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXSP3KQU6TNJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140446907#wasThisHelpful","RXSP3KQU6TNJT","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very uneven book, but worth reading for at least two reasons. One is the author's (JL's) snapshot of the current, and very twisted, Silicon Valley psyche. I inhabited the silicon end of the Valley (semiconductors and electronics) for more than a decade before leaving in 2007. To learn that nowadays the person who'd be next in line to me at Kepler's or sitting next to me at my favorite bubble tea place might be spending his or her zillions on research into transhuman immortality or attending Singularity University at a NASA facility I drove past daily (@325-331) made me lose my nostalgia fast.Even if you've never lived in the Bay Area, the other reason to read the book is for JL's perceptive and entertainingly cynical analysis of the dark side of the ""free"" online business model. I read this book more or less concurrently with Jeremy Rifkin's ""Zero Marginal Cost Society,"" which is a Leninist utopian interpretation of precisely the same model. Where Rifkin sees a coming global collaborationist society in which everything is a commodity at near-zero price, resulting in the ""inevitable"" collapse of capitalism and private property, JL sees greater and greater concentration of money and power in the proprietors of a small number of ""siren servers."" JL's vision is not only more plausible, but more authentic: unlike Rifkin, a B-school professor, ""futurist"" and cheerleader, JL has had a creative role in many of the innovations he describes.JL's affirmative arguments aren't as strong as his critiques. His main proposal to counter the growing power of Google, Facebook and others is to require micro- or nanopayments to you whenever someone uses information about you, or  uses your design or other creation. But you'd have to make a payment when you use someone else's creations, too. There are at least two key issues here: defining the subject matter of the micro- or nanopayments, and fairly attributing the subject matter to its sources. Is the subject matter the same as that of currently protectable copyright/patent/trademark/likeness rights, with an additional category for personal data? Or does it include any idea I might express, even if not currently protectable under an IP regime? As far as I can tell, JL inclines to the latter, including, e.g. translations of phrases, which might not be copyrightable by usual methods (and which are often based on someone else's other work in the original language, in any case). So suppose I come up with a translation: how much of that idea is truly mine, and how much does it come from something my high school Latin teacher taught me? The same problem affects even conventional inventions: how can I separate my idea from the ideas in many of the books and articles I read before, which I couldn't have understood without some trick in my Physics 151 lecture notes, as explained by my prof, who got it from somewhere else, etc. -- and by the way, let's not forget the whole family tree of math classes I needed to understand that bit of calculus in there. Do all of them get paid (at least, if they're still alive)? Also, is it really ""humanizing,"" as JL claims, to put every aspect of human creativity into a market-based intellectual property regime?In addition, JL's understanding of economics is somewhat haphazard. E.g., he tosses around terms like ""value"" and ""wealth"" without ever saying what he means by them. JL draws the Laffer curve upside down, with correct axes but as a U-curve (@149), perhaps misled by a belief that equilibria have to be stable; the correct version is an inverted-U with a maximum (an unstable equilibrium) purporting to optimize tax revenue as a function of  tax rate. And he believes that ""future intents of borrowers"" constitute ""assets"" that ""no longer exist"" when borrowers ""do something other than promised,"" thereby ""making it possible for banks to fall apart when people don't pay their mortgages back"" (@33). Actually, a proper mortgage transaction would give the bank legal claims against seizable assets that are worth enough so that the borrower's inappropriate actions or changed intentions can't cause much damage. If the deal comes back to bite the bank, usually it means the bank should have been more prudent before making the loan -- or shrewder afterwards, by passing the risk on to another party, as often happened in the lead-up to the Lehman Shock. (BTW it turns out that, contrary to media mythology, homeowners'  mortgage defaults per se weren't a direct cause of bank failures during the Great Recession, according to a recent paper by Antonis Antoniades of the European Central Bank appearing after this book was published.)Ultimately, JL's solutions ring too much of ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"": fight monetizers by monetizing yourself. A further discouragement is that, as other have observed, the book is poorly and self-indulgently structured. Nonetheless, JL's puncturing of the usual sunny, Disneyland portrayal of the commercial Internet and his well-aimed satirical jabs at Silicon Valley culture are genuine rewards of putting up with this idiosyncratic hodgepodge of a book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQHJXQGV8R57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451654960#wasThisHelpful","R2JQHJXQGV8R57","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a much more moderate view of this book than some other reviewers. The book was written in the early 1960s. Back then, physicists were assumed to be interested mainly in finite groups, and these take up a lot of the book. The symmetries involved tend to be geometric symmetries in 3-space, e.g. of molecules, crystals, rotation of light, etc. The more generalized notion of symmetry commonly spoken of in physics classes today, based on Noether's theorem and connected to conservation laws, is missing from this book. Most of the applications are in chemistry and crystallography (though not necessarily solid state physics -- e.g., Bloch's theorem is mentioned only in passing, more than 80% into the text). Classical mechanics, quantum field theory, and particle physics are all absent. So is much of the vocabulary that a student today might be interested in: Lie groups aren't mentioned by name, nor are orthogonal groups, linear groups, Galilean groups, Lorentz groups, SU(n), SO(n), etc. etc. So are some of the usual math text topics, such as quotient groups and Sylow theorems.The book is written in straight exposition without definition/theorem/proof, and without exercises too. But it's written in a more formal and pedantic style characteristic of the ""Father Knows Best"" era, when scientists smoked pipes and wore neckties under their lab coats -- very top-down, not the more eye-to-eye style of some textbooks today. Also typical for its time, the presentation is heavily reliant on all sorts of typographical tricks. On the plus side, the book has relatively many illustrations.I bought this book based on some of the reviews on this page. I teach in Japan, and was hoping to find something I could recommend as a first math/science book in English to some aspiring grad students who are interested in particle physics, but who aren't yet so strong in groups or other algebraic structures. Sadly this didn't fill the bill. Regardless of English ability, if you're, say, a physics undergraduate who's interested in elementary particles or cosmology, and you're new to groups but allergic to pure math books, I think this could be a frustrating place to start. While the opening pages might have some useful information and visualizations, so do the early pages of some pdf introductions to group theory you can download for free, and those are written in a more contemporary style. If you're interested in chemistry, the early chapters of ""Symmetry and Spectroscopy"" by Harris and Bertolucci (available in a Dover edition) provide a much more user-friendly way to learn about groups. That said, as other reviews evidence, the book might be useful for some audiences. Crystallographers and others who work with finite groups might be one, and very gifted high school students who are thirsty for knowledge but who lack the need and impatience to dive into the contemporary math or physics literature might be another.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFEKQT1EZT3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486421821#wasThisHelpful","R3GFEKQT1EZT3K","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several decades ago, I took Harvard's music history survey course for non-majors (non-""concentrators"", in Harvard-speak), taught by the late Elliot Forbes, a Beethoven scholar. Near the end he devoted a class to jazz, and especially to the music of saxophonist ""Charles Parker,"" whose name his fine Boston Brahmin accent elongated elegantly and ludicrously. Notwithstanding that the editor hailed from Cornell and Chicago, this book captures that old Harvard spirit: a nod to the popular, but only in the most dignified way -- Chaahles Paahka, never Charlie (metaphorically speaking).It's hard to figure out the vagaries of such genteel taste. Several genres of American popular music have their own entries, among them rock, rap, hip hop, and even ""acid rock"" -- but forget about chill, grunge, lounge, alternative and electronica. From Brazil, chro, samba and bossa nova appear, but nothing about afoxé, axé, forró, frevo, Música Popular Brasileira, or Tropicália. From Mexico, son and mariachi, but not banda or ranchera.  Maybe something is buried in there about the music of Hawai'i or other Pacific islands, but I couldn't find it; nor anything about the music of Haïti, either (aside from a passing reference to méringue in the article on Dominican merengue). Other genres, such as (Algerian) raï (here written as ""rai"") and (Greek) rebetiko are mentioned only in passing in entries about regional music, without any description of what they are; ditto for dangdut, which in this work is spelled ""dang dut"" even though it's never spelled that way on any of my cassettes or CDs from Malaysia and Indonesia. Speaking of that part of the world, you won't find a drawing of a gamelan ensemble, either. Balalaika and bouzouki get their own entries, but are omitted from the group portrait of lutes, as is the oud (to find a verbal description of which you need to know to look under "" 'ūd ,"" since there isn't any cross-reference under 'O'). The entry on rumba entirely omits mention of its Mediterranean version (rumba gitana, made popular by the Gypsy Kings, Paco de Lucía and others); lambada, the forbidden dance, is strictly verboten -- and limbo is in limbo.Even the more orthodox entries are hit and miss. The list of famous names omitted from the entry on ""Film Music"" is as along as your arm, among them Nino Rota, Ennio Morricone, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Lalo Schifrin, etc., etc., etc.  Various famous classical pieces have entries, but the criteria are hard to fathom. All of Stravinsky's ballets rate, as do Hindemith's Das Marienleben and Mathis der Maler, but not the collective Les Mariés de la tour Eiffel by Les Six, nor such popular works as Le boeuf sur le toit or La création du monde by Milhaud. Among post-war operas, you'll find The Rake's Progress (Stravinsky), Billy Budd (Britten) and Death in Venice (Britten again), but not Einstein on the Beach (Glass) or Nixon in China (Adams), nor even Olivier Messiaen's monumental Saint François d'Assise. Messiaen, who taught Boulez, Stockhausen and scores of others, and who continued to compose major works into the early 1990s, is represented only by entries for two works from the 1940s: the Quatuor pour la fin du temps (not Quartet for the End of Time) and the Turangalila Symphony (not Symphonie Turangalîle). More appalling than this linguistic inconsistency is that Messiaen is entirely absent from the entry entitled ""Twentieth Century, Western art music of the."" As long as you want to look up the Right Sort of Thing, this is a great reference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2911IPBQ7PMVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674011635#wasThisHelpful","R2911IPBQ7PMVE","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book performs a valuable service by emphasizing government's crucial role in both directly and indirectly structuring markets. Sad to say, ever since some point after the Nixon Administration all too many Americans have forgotten that role. The author (AM) presents his thesis with many examples ranging from political philosophy to the design of water systems and typewriter keyboards, in clear and jargon-free prose.The solutions he proposes aren't always persuasive: e.g., he advocates a National Companies Act as an antidote to state laws like Delaware's that are very favorable to corporate management, but doesn't consider that, given that 60% of the Fortune 500 are incorporated in Delaware (@113), a federal corporations law is likely to look very much like Delaware's, or even more pro-management. And the connection between markets and some topics wasn't always so clear, e.g. in the discussion of prisons (@174-175; Bernard Harcourt's ""The Illusion of Free Markets"" (Harvard 2011) might have helped to put a finer point on this). Still, the range of topics is very imaginative, and should open the minds of many readers.I'm very much in sympathy with AM's broad purpose, so I don't want to be too negative about this book. Because of that sympathy, though, I was really hoping for a tight argument that would be hard to attack -- and was all the more disappointed by the frequent slackness I found instead. Here are a few examples of inaccuracies and semi-accuracies I was able to catch:(a) First, the book's neatest sound-bite: ""'There is no difference between Google and San Francisco,' said Harvard Law prof Gerald Frug]. They are both corporations -- 'bodies, empowered by government to do stuff.' [¶] Let's say that again. There is no difference between Google and San Francisco. No difference between New York City and IBM. No difference between Albany and Acme Insurance."" (@94.) AM calls this notion ""astonishing"" and he's right -- because, pace Prof. Frug, it is utterly wrong.Let's neglect for the moment any differences among the corporation laws of the various states: Google and IBM are formed under something called the Delaware General Corporation Law and California has a Corporations Code, so for the sake of argument we can treat them as the same thing. And let's also ignore the fact that, uniquely in California, San Francisco is both a city and a county (unlike, say, Los Angeles, where the city and county have distinct borders). Nonetheless, SF isn't a ""corporation"" formed under a statute similar to the one to which Google and IBM owe their existence: it's a charter city under Title 4 of the California Government Code. As such, it has quite a few powers and responsibilities that Google, IBM et al. lack.Even if you don't know California's law codes, a moment's thought will reveal the silliness of the assertion. Can Google issue parking tickets? Assess and collect taxes? Throw you in jail? Do you have to buy your right to vote in San Francisco elections? Does anyone pay people who move out of SF and give up their rights to vote there, the way selling shareholders receive money or other consideration? If the city disincorporates, do you have any legal right to a share of its assets, as Google's shareholders would if it dissolves?People who go to the beach on the Fourth of July aren't lizards just because they happen to be vertebrates who like to lie in the sun. Cities and corporations may have something in common, but that doesn't prevent them from being very different creatures. Even by standards of general-audience nonfiction, this passage goes beyond oversimplification into the realm of misinformation.(b) In Chapter 3, AM complains about the common law, calling it judge-made and undemocratic; he also claims (@35), ""It is profoundly difficult, although not impossible, for the legislature to pass laws that overrule common law."" That's simply not the case. Legislatures pass such laws all the time; any obstacles are political, not legal. Moreover, a great deal of common law winds up getting embodied in legislation. See, e.g., the California Civil Code, and the commentaries to the various versions of the Uniform Commercial Code that have been enacted in all 50 US states. As for the democratic character of judge-made law, in addition to the power of the legislature to change the rules ex post, in most US jurisdictions judges are either elected directly, or are appointed by democratically-elected officials.In that respect, judge-made law is a lot better than arbitration, which involves private adjudicators who are immune from all forms of democratic intervention. Arbitrators are typically lawyers or current or retired experts with ties to the rich and powerful, and have the leeway to apply their own judgment, which might or might not be in conformity with statutory law and case law. In a string of recent decisions by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court has upheld the right of big companies, professional service providers and others to force you to accept arbitration instead of having your day in court. But instead of complaining about arbitration's truly undemocratic character, AM mentions it only in its international context, where he oddly considers it to be aligned with regulation by sovereign states (@228).(c) In several parts of the book, AM discusses the political philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Unfortunately, he often quotes them out of context, or relies on a paragraph about them from a 1929 treatise about common law by Theodore Plucknett, instead of looking at the originals. E.g., AM twice quotes Plucknett to the emphasize a contrast: Hobbes, we're told, believed all law to be a command from the State, whereas Locke believed in natural law (@40, 184). AM also mentions that Locke's arguments rely on G-d but Hobbes' do not (@183), and he objects to Locke's countenancing the possibility that there could be a ""natural"" relation of master and slave, citing to Locke's Second Treatise on Government, Chap. 7, § 85 (@183). In fact, though, Hobbes talks about natural law at length, including how it's coextensive with civil law, a/k/a the commandments of the state (Leviathan XIV, XV, XXVI.8). He also mentions that every man has a natural right to every thing, ""even to one another's body,"" i.e. slave ownership (XIV.5), and that even as a subject of a commonwealth one retains a natural right to protect oneself if the state doesn't (XXI.21). And Hobbes talks an awful lot about G-d in Leviathan Parts III (""Of a Christian Commonwealth"") and IV (""Of the Kingdom of Darkness""). AM cites only to Part I (""Of Man""), so he seems to have missed the bulk of the book. Meanwhile, Locke's Chapter 4 (""Of Slavery"") makes it clear that his notion of justified slaveholding is very narrow, deriving from conquest of opponents in a just war.These examples are drawn from areas with which I'm relatively familiar, like law and political philosophy. Maybe AM has his facts in better shape when he touches on topics closer to his own professional comfort zone, like urban planning; I'm necessarily agnostic on that point.On the production side, thanks to U Texas for going against the Zeitgeist and providing both endnotes and a bibliography. To sum up, if you're shocked or intrigued by the idea that there isn't any such thing as a ""free market,"" you can benefit from reading this book. Just be careful before you start quoting some of its more specific arguments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHRXVTT8JDKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292756755#wasThisHelpful","RPHRXVTT8JDKY","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small book -- it can almost fit into a shirt pocket -- is an outstanding piece of rhetoric in support of economic growth. While economics textbooks seem to take for granted that economic growth is a good thing, this book lays out numerous reasons that will appeal to both secular and Christian readers. With its calm tone, its acknowledgement that some opposing viewpoints ""contain elements of truth,"" and its hopeful message, it comes close to the 1980s-era tour de force of Rose and Milton Friedman's ""Free to Choose."" It will persuade many, many readers. And skeptics about economic growth should read it, to find out what they're up against.It is, however, Goliath's message - not a dumb, brutal Goliath prone to violence but a clever, slick Goliath schooled in public relations and the levers of power. The publisher is the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an ostensibly nonpartisan think-tank funded by, among others, the Koch Bros. that nonetheless supplied many members of various Bush Administrations, and on whose Board of Trustees now sits former Vice-President Dick Cheney. The usual neoliberal themes of strong property rights, rule of law, reduced government intervention, market freedom and lower taxes are sounded often. Like the works of the thinkers whom it criticizes, the book contains many elements of truth. Unfortunately, they do not add up to a whole truth: there are misleading statements on almost every page.To be fair, I should note: if you are one of those folks who posted a 1-star review of Thomas Piketty's ""Capital in the 21st Century"" without having read that book, you will **love** this one. Even if you don't read it either.Here is a slightly more detailed critique:1. The book's core argument is roughly as follows (along with the sources cited, or, if no citation was given, pertinent page numbers): Growth is good for the poor (Dollar & Kraal 2002). Inequality in the US has been exaggerated (Burkhauser & al. 2012), and even if growth does increase inequality that's no excuse for not helping the poor by pursuing growth (@10, 42). Redistribution of income in poor countries is futile (@16-17, 31, 68). Growth helps clean up the environment (Dasgupta & al. 2002), and in any case environmental protection and preventing global warming are no excuses for abandoning the moral imperative of helping the poor by pursuing growth (@59). Materialism and lack of concern for the poor are ""inherent in free human communities,"" and are not the result of, or exacerbated by, economic growth (@67, 77).2. Selective citation is the authors' main forensic technique: they tend to support their claims with at most one citation to the economics literature for each major proposition. They also omit to tell the reader that every one of the cites they choose is heavily contested in the economics literature. The Dollar & Kraal study in particular, which was originally published as a World Bank working paper in 2001, has been challenged by numerous scholars both for its statistical methodology and for its inappropriate inferences of causation. (A few critiques you can find online with a search engine: Nye & Reddy 2001, Foster & Székely 2001, Lübker & al. 2002, Amann 2002, Ashley 2007.) Once this prong of Noell & al.'s argument is recognized as shaky, so must be their dismissals of environmental damage and rising inequality as arguments against growth, since they claim that growth's benefits to the poor outweigh those other harms.Another example is their claim that ""the existence of the EKC [environmental Kuznets curve] is well documented,"" citing solely to Dasgupta & al.'s paper, ""Confronting the environmental Kuznets curve."" The EKC is the basis of the argument that as per capita GDP continues to increase, pollution first gets worse and then gets better. However, EKCs have not been confirmed for all forms of pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when one takes into account that richer countries have offshored much of their manufacturing to China and elsewhere. Nor do EKC studies focus on groundwater or soil contamination, some of which persists for more than 100 years. Some citations you might look up include Wagner (2008); Stern (2004); Webber & Allen (2010); Sinha (2010) (to find the references quickly, combine your search on those names with ""EKC"" or its spelled-out version).When the authors credit economic growth with reducing infant mortality rates, they prudently mention only the UK, France and Japan (@5-6) -- thereby avoiding the inconvenient truth that more than 45 other countries have lower rates than the US, including Greece, Hungary and Cuba. To support their claim that growth is good for health, they cite Robert Fogel, a Nobel economics laureate; naturally they don't mention the work of Simon Szreter, Stephen Kunitz or Angus Deaton, who show that economic growth is neither necessary nor sufficient for improving public health. And sometimes their citation doesn't even rise to the level of ""selective"": to evidence their assertion that ""sometimes simply defining and enforcing property rights can clear up a pollution problem,"" the authors offer as support the Disney film, ""WALL-E"" (@50).I expect that the authors or their defenders might protest that in a short book such as this one can't get into all the nuances of academic controversies. No doubt that's true; so why make the book so short? Or one could adopt the authors' technique and write another book about economic growth with one cite per proposition, too -- and come to a conclusion 180 degrees opposite to the authors'.3. Another technique is the confident but unsubstantiated assertion that growth has brought us many sorts of good things, ranging from basic health to material prosperity to social trust. The authors never take the trouble to establish that growth is a necessary or a sufficient cause of any of those good things. A simple example: ""Because growth helps the poor, its effects on inequality (often overstated in any case) should not hinder pursuing growth"" (@10). What if there were some other way of helping the poor that did *not* aggravate inequality -- might it not be better to pursue that, instead of growth? Never considered, even to be rebutted.Similarly, ""Moral critics of economic growth ... fail to acknowledge the connection, in market economies, between growth and moral goods such as social trust, honesty, compassion, and taking responsibility for oneself and one's family"" (@76-77). Come on: even assuming this is accurate (the list of compassionate for-profit insurance companies, international big-box retailers and fast food giants being probably a rather short one) are these virtues *only* attainable through economic growth? The authors never try to demonstrate this.Some arguments are worse than unsubstantiated -- they are simply false. E.g., we are told that "" Growth helps national finances directly and powerfully. Faster growth means higher tax revenues, because more people are working and paying taxes"" (@81), and again: ""Growth helps government finances directly and immediately"" (@91). Maybe, but not if tax rates are low enough. GDP isn't a flow that goes into the Treasury. E.g., thanks to the Reagan-era tax cuts, real government revenues declined despite economic growth (check the OMB's Historical Tables). This theory also doesn't work if the growth is caused by higher productivity, higher exports and reduced employment. The US economy might grow if, say, more low-income American people who don't spend much are replaced by robots that produce goods and services sold to wealthy Asians and South Americans, with the profits going to rich Americans who lobby for lower taxes at the corporate and personal levels, and who utilize off-shore tax havens. It's hard to claim that's a wild science-fiction scenario.4. Throughout the book you'll hear the billionaires' seductive song of less regulation and more free markets. Sometimes it's in general: ""Governments seeking to unlock long-term growth should eschew command-and-control policies. Instead they should craft economic institutions that reward all types of investment in physical and human capital, and that help markets function securely and inexpensively"" (@29). And sometimes it's on behalf of specific industries, like the oil industry: ""[T]he development of new ways to drill sideways into shale (fracking) has unlocked vast new amounts of natural gas reserves in the United States"" (@54). Or the financial industry: ""[T]he financial system --  commercial investment banks, insurance companies, and other financial firms -- must be allowed to do its crucial job of pooling funds from savers to lend for investments"" (@96). Or private health insurance companies: ""In the United States, demand for universal health care is testing our traditional aversion to coercive government control over intimate aspects of individuals' lives"" (@101). Are we to infer, then, that among the ""all types of investment"" to be ""rewarded"" should be investment in guns, drugs, prostitution and alcohol? After all, it's hard to find more ""intimate aspects of individuals' lives"" than the ones those industries cater to.5. The authors are strangely silent on that point, even though they frequently frame the book's arguments in a Christian context. In fact, out of the vast academic and popular literature critical of economic growth, the only segment that the authors try to refute is that written by religious Christians (none of whom I'd ever heard of previously -- and I've been following the de-growth literature professionally for six years already). Odd then that they shy away from confronting the arguments of ecological economist Herman Daly, one of the most prominent US critics of economic growth, who frequently mentions Christian values in his writing. They also ignore the conservative British Christians Robert and Edward Skidelsky, who, like the current authors, reject the claim that growth harms the environment, but whose moral arguments against growth are far more sophisticated than are this book's moral arguments in favor of it.Some of the authors' religious arguments are also clearly political, though they are too canny to say so. E.g. ""Though fallen due to sin, humans retain the image of [G-d] and thus have a kind of intrinsic goodness that makes them worthy of care, too. Individuals have an inalienable dignity that requires institutions that respect their freedom of action and the legitimacy of their command over resources ...."" (@73). That argument is more from John Locke (Second Treatise on Government, Chapter 5) than from the Bible. Political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who was way more theologically learned than the present authors, was *quite* confident that the sovereign has the right to deprive you of your property (Leviathan, Part 2).Bottom line: this is a book from a well-heeled lobbying group designed to persuade readers to accept the billionaires' point of view about economic regulation. Unfortunately, it tries to take advantage of Christian sensibilities to spread the gospel of Mammon. True, it's a 5-star brilliant piece of propaganda. But then, the Devil always has the best tunes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BVRCYOEV6SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0844772569#wasThisHelpful","R9BVRCYOEV6SR","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The collection of Messiaen's works is by no means complete, but offers a terrific cross-section of his output for an extremely reasonable price. The performances I've listened to, comprising most of the discs, are of high quality, and the historical range extends from some of his earliest works, such as « Le banquet céleste », to one of his last ones, « Éclairs sur l'au-delà ». That said, though, Messiaen's last quarter century of work prior to « Éclairs » is absent, other than a brief organ work; so the set doesn't include such major works as « Des canyons aux étoiles », « Saint-François d'Assise » and « La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ ». Other notable omissions are « Couleurs de la Cité céleste », the so-called « Sept haïkaï », the orchestral version of « L'Ascension » (though the organ version is here) --  and pretty much everything with the word ""oiseaux"" (""birds"") in the title.Apropos of « Éclairs sur l'au-delà », the recording quality of the performance included here -- the Berlin Philharmonic under Sir Simon Rattle -- was a little disappointing. The piece is full of soft dynamics, such as trills played 'ppp' beneath a 'p' or 'mp' main line. Unfortunately, many of these passages were impossible to hear in their full range: either you had to turn the 'mp' up to 'ff' to hear the softer lines beneath, or else those softer lines were inaudible, period. (The harmonic arpeggios in the strings in the first movement and the paired trilling triangles in the last were both in the inaudible category for me, though I admit that out of consideration for the rest of my household I didn't quite max out my stereo's volume.) The piece is still heartbreakingly lovely, but it would be nice to hear it the way it is scored.I worked my way through the box while reading Hill and Simeone's biography of the composer, which led to many pleasant discoveries. In addition to the major works mentioned, a strong recommend for a supplemental disc is the « Fête des belles eaux » by the Ensemble d'Ondes de Montréal (ATMA Classique ACD2 2621). Aside from offering the novelty of a piece the 29-year-old Messiaen wrote for 6 ondes Martenot, in the fourth movement you can hear the original version of the first ""louange"" in the Quartet for the End of Time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHUO5ONMBHG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DCQJUO#wasThisHelpful","R1GHUO5ONMBHG9","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm still low on the learning curve about security issues, but from that perspective, at least, this is an extremely informative and interesting edited volume. The  title, which seems to be a nod to President Obama's supposed Asian ""pivot,""  is perhaps a little misleading, because the issue of rebalancing isn't discussed so much per se; but the subtitle is pretty descriptive of the contents. Most of the chapters are organized about particular territories: Guam, Japan, S. Korea, Australia, Diego Garcia, Singapore and Central Asia.  (There is also a chapter about sea basing.) While some contributions emphasize the history of the relationship with the US, e.g., the Australia and S. Korea chapters, others are intensely focused on strategic considerations. For me, these were the standouts, particularly the chapters about Guam, Diego Garcia and Japan.That last, by Toshi Yoshihara of the US Naval War College and based extensively on Chinese-language sources, is quite unique. Rather than providing a broad portrait of US bases in Japan, it focuses on the doctrine of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) about using missiles to neutralize those bases (e.g., by intimidating Japan to deny the US access to them in case of conflict over Taiwan or other islands). I found this chapter quite hair-raising -- but not only because the PLA talks about firing missiles at Yokosuka Naval Base in Tokyo Bay in the event of a dispute with Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Prof. Yoshihara shows that the PLA writings are actually quite naïve, both about the accuracy of missiles and about politics. Misunderstandings between politicians and the military in China could easily lead to escalation for very stupid reasons, with dire results. He compares the situation to the US in the post-WWII years, when America was overconfident about both its power and the correctness of its assumptions about the threats it faced. It took events like the Cuban missile crisis to make the US recalibrate; China, though, hasn't yet had to confront such ""sobering incidents.""I don't at all mean to minimize the interest of some of the other chapters covering topics farther from my own backyard. The narrative of the ups and downs of US relations with some Central Asian countries (I hesitate to call them republics) is especially picaresque. I should mention that the geographic coverage isn't comprehensive: e.g. the Philippines and Taiwan are mentioned only in passing, and bases within the 50 States, e.g. in the Aleutians, aren't discussed at all. Nonetheless, a strong recommend for anyone interested in a better understanding of the geopolitical situation in East Asia and the Indian Ocean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6R2P0BWZZR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612514650#wasThisHelpful","R3H6R2P0BWZZR7","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps the title of this book could be a sort of litmus test for a generation gap: if you're an American in your 20s or 30s you might more immediately associate it with the phrase beginning ""We ~,"" whereas if you're old enough to remember the Cold War, the US civil rights movement and various other struggles of the 1960s and '70s, ""Power to ~"" might jump into your head about as quickly. The author of this slim book (MC) deftly parses out these connotations of the phrase -- as ""abstract authority in reserve"" and as ""concrete power to be seen in action"" -- and many others as well. As she shows, the word has been characterized by multiple and often conflicting meanings ever since its origins as the ancient Roman ""populus."" A particularly strong chapter analyzes the many varieties of ""populism,"" and explains how this same term can be applied to such very different people as Tony Blair, Hugo Chavez, Hitler, and William Jennings Bryan.A popularization, though, this isn't: while it's short enough to be read by a dedicated reader in a few hours, the book does presuppose some prior exposure to academic political philosophy. But if you've got that background, you'll find it's a very useful synthesis. I teach a college-level course that includes a lot of readings in classical political philosophy, and some of MC's acute observations and distinctions will help me to make some points more vividly (especially about Hobbes and Locke, who all too often make my students' eyes glaze over). The one drawback is that the book's emphasis is primarily from a British and American point of view, albeit with occasional European notes (Rousseau, Y. Mény & Y. Surel, D. Schnapper). I wonder whether a more comparative approach, including not only a heavier dose of Continental perspectives (including Rancière and Schmitt, among others) but also some views from recently decolonized countries, might have lead to even more nuanced conclusions. The style is a bit dry but very clear, and there is a good bibliography. All in all, a very nice and inexpensive survey of the subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEHZP7OL6SL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745628222#wasThisHelpful","R1DEHZP7OL6SL2","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From time to time I teach some modules about metaphors, narratives and ethics to business executives from multinational companies. I read this book to give me ideas about how to freshen up my material, and indeed got a couple of helpful hints.In particular, the book made me more aware of the differences between teaching how to recognize metaphors and respond to them critically, on the one hand, and teaching a more open-ended way of thinking via responding to poems, on the other. Metaphors occur far more pervasively than just in poetry, and poems don't reduce simply to metaphors, so these activities are complementary. Since most participants in my modules are non-native speakers of English and come from a variety of linguistic backgrounds, encouraging them as a group to get comfortable with poetry is a difficult task, but there were a number of poems in this book that seem suitable even for such an audience. If you're teaching students who are native in English, the selection of poems in the book may be that much more useful.A few too many of the poems, perhaps, are about poetry, and a bit too much of the exposition asserts and argues that poetry can be helpful for business strategists rather than illustrating how. (Not for this book Ezra Pound's ""Show, don't tell."") But the biggest drawback is the author's (CM's) self-indulgently ""creative"" style. She spends a lot of time telling us about her struggles writing the book, e.g.:""Wittgenstein, I write. Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein. I make a list of the reasons Wittgenstein must feature [sic]:...."" [@86]and about the picturesque backdrops to her conference room pitches:""Four o'clock on a hot June afternoon. The punts are moving lazily along the surface of the Cam, and there's hardly a ripple. At Cherry Hinton, in the deliberately utilitarian office of [her client], a fly is buzzing. I click to the next image in my PowerPoint presentation."" [@96]She makes frequent use of dramatic dialogue, e.g. at 192:Maybe it is changing? I ask him.He shrugs.Maybe.This is pushed to its most irritating extreme when CM engages with a couple of unnamed ""readers,"" who are addressed with a passion and yearning usually reserved for lovers -- though also with a Zen pedantry that should be reserved, period:_""Poetry leads us to the unstructured sources of our beings, to the unknown, and returns us to our structured, rational selves, refreshed.""Do you believe that?_ My reader's voice speaks that, just a whisper, quite close to my ear.I put down the article by A.R. Ammons, whose work, up to now, I haven't been familiar with._""Poetry is a verbal means to a non-verbal source,""_ I whisper back, _""That's what Ammons says. It is a motion to no-motion, to the still point of contemplation and deep realization.""_There's a short silence, I can hear nothing but hiss and crackle, like the ether maybe, like listening to the airwaves. Eventually my reader comes back to me. His voice is small and distant._Given the context,_ he says, _I think that makes sense._ [@175-176].The over-the-top quality of such exchanges -- the whispering, the dramatic pauses before the banal responses -- is more entertaining in small doses like this review than in a book of 200+ pages. I don't think most businesspeople, and especially ones who need to be convinced about the value of poetry, will tolerate it. So you might want to ""waterski"" over much of that stuff, to use an image from one of several poems whose full texts are printed twice in the book (Billy Connolly's ""Introduction to Poetry,"" in this instance).The reader might also raise an eyebrow at some of the author's interpretations, such as one in which she overlooks the primary meaning of ""incandescent"" (to glow from heat), which is very apposite in context, and suggests that it means ""up in a big and blinding flurry of light and then gone again,"" @170. If that describes what happens to incandescent light bulbs in her home, she should have an electrician check the wiring. Occasionally CM's very British pronunciation may disconcert American readers, such as when she claims that ""bra"" rhymes with ""are."" Despite these smaller issues, the book could have been more effective had CM chosen a less ""clever"" and more conventional presentation. Even so, some of her observations are nonetheless interesting, and her selection of examples can be stimulating for people who teach humanities to business students and businesspeople.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKRMHSMO4L4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0472050869#wasThisHelpful","R1TKRMHSMO4L4K","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably one book in ten thousand: the blurbs for it accurately describe both its contents and its quality. Although the book's compact size took me aback when it first arrived, the author does an excellent job of packing in a great deal of information about commercial, military and other uses of outer space, as well as the legal and diplomatic context for them, into a small *printed* space.Among other things, the book provides an overview of the space programs of a wide range of spacefaring countries, as well as some historical insight into how each of those countries has contributed diplomatic initiatives or obstacles (and often both) to the development of international cooperation in space. A particularly intriguing topic that gets mentioned a couple of times is the coming trend toward cubesats, nanosats and picosats, small boxes filled with sophisticated electronics and weighing about as much as a couple of bags of cat litter, or even considerably less. While these are are being pushed by some start-ups (e.g., Planet Labs, Skybox Imaging) as the cutting edge of Yankee ingenuity, in fact they could make the space debris problem far more complicated, since they don't carry any fuel and aren't controllable once they're in orbit.I did find it tough to share the author's acceptance of the idea that humanity will ""need"" to obtain resources from the Moon and asteroids, though he may be more correct to say it's ""inevitable"" that we'll do so (@190). The legal context for mining and other commercial exploitation of heavenly bodies remains pretty gray, though, so it would be nice to see more discussion about that in a future update of this book. Maybe next time there could also be more discussion about intellectual property issues relating to space. One can find a good introduction to that and a few other issues in Matthew Kelman's ""The Little Book of Space Law"" (ABA 2013), another very nice entry-level book. Kelman speculates about a possible ""flag of convenience"" issue that might create obstacles to enforcing patents on spacefaring technology. But since Kelman's book tends to focus on US law more than on international policy and practice, overall it's narrower in scope than this one.In keeping with the recent unfortunate trend in academic publishing, the book has endnotes but no bibliography; the saving grace is that the endnotes only take up about 15 pages, so finding useful references is less painful than it would have been for a longer book. All in all, this is an excellent way to get up to speed about current issues in the international use and regulation of outer space, regardless of your prior background.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1604P6Y3UIMCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231159129#wasThisHelpful","R1604P6Y3UIMCK","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jean-Claude Schmitt (JCS) is an historian best known for his curiosity about how people in the medieval West looked at the world and at themselves. In this illustrated essay entitled ""The Invention of the Birthday"" (French publication: 2009) he asks, when did our birthdays start becoming important in the way they are today, celebrated as milestones in an individual's aging?In many Western countries today, the celebration of birthdays is one of the earliest events in a child's socialization. In pagan societies, the anniversary of one's birth had both public and private religious significance. But for centuries after the advent of Christianity, it was the date of one's death that was considered more important. Birthdays were hardly mentioned at all, and literate societies were a prerequisite for recording and remembering them anyway. The earliest recorded ""modern"" birthday celebration appears to have been only about 200 years ago, when the German poet-of-all trades J.W. von Goethe celebrated with a cake and 53 candles in 1802. Goethe also kept meticulous records of a lifetime of birthday gifts -- and their prices (e.g. his father gave him a spiral bun costing 20 kreutzers when he turned 5 years old, and a bretzel of the same value the following year). It would take more than 120 years after that birthday cake for the ""Happy Birthday"" song to get its lyrics, in 1924.JCS finds some of the earliest steps toward an interest in birthdays in the celebration of saint's days, and, for the rich and powerful, in mindfulness of the astrological configuration at the time of one's birth. But as he points out, neither of these captures the contemporary attitude: the former is a celebration of the saint rather than of oneself, and the latter is an interest in a particular moment frozen in history, entirely separate from one's own aging. (A holdover of this attitude is that even today when Christmas is celebrated as Christ's birthday, it's entirely without reference to Christ's age.) Of course, there are some glimmerings of the contemporary attitude before Goethe. JCS discusses one of the most fascinating and moving of these at length: a portfolio of portraits of the 16th Century German Catholic merchant Matthias Schwarz, which he commissioned to keep track of changes in fashion during his lifetime.The time period covered by the book is roughly from around 1100 to 1800, pretty much ending with Goethe. Throughout, JCS is interested not only in how attitudes towards birthdays evolved, but why an interest in birthdays was absent for so long. There are also many interesting comments on the uses of calendars, the ""Ages of Man,"" and other pertinent topics. The narrative is supplemented by more than 30 plates, mostly black-and-white with a few in color.Compared to an earlier, and also fascinating, study by Schmitt available in English, ""The Holy Greyhound"" (about a dog who became revered as a Catholic saint in rural France), this work is much shorter, flows better and wears its scholarship more lightly, though a very erudite set of notes is provided. I think it could be enjoyed by a broad audience if it were translated into English. It might even be appropriate for a trade publisher's list rather than an academic one. I read this book shortly before my own birthday; it stimulated me think about that day in new ways, through the rediscovery of old ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260QIQKC5T0R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2918682004#wasThisHelpful","R260QIQKC5T0R1","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a light, funny and -- obviously -- fictionalized memoir of the author's (EA's) childhood and adolescence during the 1940s and early 1950s. I'm not a big fan of coming-of-age stories, but EA's reputation as a performance and conceptual artist with a sense of humor drew me to the book. As it turns out, I laughed often.What's especially impressive is that the tone is so fresh, as if it were written by someone under 30, even though EA is already in her late 70s. The author sounds like she was quite a handful and a bit of a drama queen. But whenever her story gets close to being overwrought, the Stalin character, whom the young EA meets in Central Park for advice from time to time, brings things back to earth with some very Stalinist common sense. In other books such conceits often get old pretty quickly, but EA's ventriloquism and her sense of timing keep it working for just long enough (it helps that the book is short).The writing style is rather salty and the situations rather adult, so don't recommend this to your kids before you've read it first yourself. A bigger caveat is that this book's charm might be less evident to a reader unfamiliar with New York Jewish culture, and especially the culture of the early postwar era. It's hard for me to gauge: unlike EA's household, my parents weren't communists, but like EA herself they were from the Bronx and they went to City College and Hunter; even though they were slightly older than her and I'm a generation younger, I recognized a lot. It's not just the references to resorts in the Catskills and the untranslated yiddishisms, but certain attitudes, such as EA's mother's dream of a husband who would ""do culture together"" and then take her to The Russian Tea Room. I take off half a star on general principles because, let's face it, War and Peace it isn't; but it is a quick and fun read that fits cozily inside a weekend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZX3SLIND26B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557134200#wasThisHelpful","RCZX3SLIND26B","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of this book (HK) displays a terrific command over a wide range of literature in the philosophy of science, probability theory, statistical inference, and econometrics (EM). There's no question that his scholarship is deep, and that the book is a useful reference. Its critique of Popperian falsificationism is especially sharp. HK even has a dry sense of humor that he indulges from time to time (see, e.g., the entries for John Maynard Keynes and John Neville Keynes in the ""Personalia"" at the back).The casual reader should be aware, though, that the book is also a difficult read, especially if you aren't an econometrician. The book had its origins as a Ph.D. thesis, and therefore was addressed to an expert audience; a good deal of technical jargon is taken for granted (e.g., noninformative vs. informative priors and Wald test, to choose a couple of examples at random). I came to the book already knowing a little bit about philosophy of science, probability theory and its history, and the basic idea of significance testing, and had skimmed through a fair number of applied EM studies, but there were definitely several passages about statistical tests that I had to take on faith. The prose style aims at efficiency rather than pedagogical clarity or charm.The gist of the book's argument seems to be that what most people expect of EM -- such as that it can be used to verify or falsify economic theory -- is something that it's not capable of delivering, and that most EM practitioners are pretty oblivious to the reasons why this is the case. The author proposes that EM be used as part of a positivist program in economics, providing explanations that are good enough for making predictions, without necessarily presenting a ""true"" picture of what's going on in the economy. Milton Friedman's notion of ""as if"" models gets a pretty warm reception -- and an energetic philosophical defense -- in this book.That said, the book is fundamentally conservative. It belongs to a certain genre of economics books that aim to look daring while boldly criticizing peers and founding fathers, but that actually are like someone bouncing around inside a soap bubble that he or she is deathly afraid of breaking. (The book's origins as a dissertation perhaps explain this -- few students have the guts to tell their profs that they're full of garbage before getting their degree, or even tenure.) The point that EM has never falsified any tenet of economic theory is repeated many times, but the basic value of EM is never truly doubted. Neoclassical economic theory is never questioned. Even when HK is discussing problems of aggregation of demand, he approaches this purely as a statistical issue - the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theoretical result is never mentioned. Chapter 8 provides a concrete example of this rosy-eyed outlook. It details how EM testing repeatedly seemed to falsify homogeneity as a tenet of consumer theory, but economists never changed the theory. HK applauds this result, especially in light of the ""strong prior support"" for the homogeneity condition (@212). But where was this ""prior support""? In the theory.HK asserts late in the book: ""Conditional prediction is the principal aim of economics; in the end, it is the rational expectation of the effect of interventions that makes economic analysis relevant"" (@258).  This seems highly disingenuous. The first sentence is at least misleading: in practice economics also has normative aims that it seeks to impose on society through its way of framing issues. HK's neoliberal hero Milton Friedman exemplifies this attitude par excellence. (Think, too, of value-laden words like ""efficiency"" and ""productivity,"" which often translate into ""You're fired."") And as the second sentence acknowledges, economics is very much about intervention, not merely prediction.  For something that really has conditional prediction as its principal aim, try, say celestial mechanics: aside from putative ""Armageddon""-like asteroid-shuffling adventures, no one seeks to intervene in, say, the orbits of the moon or planets. (Better yet, try the study of stellar atmospheres: nothing we can do but watch.) Neither economics nor economists have such modest objectives.Just as the book compartmentalizes economic theory and makes it unquestioned, it also ignores politics. How EM data are used politically, and whether considering their impact affects the vocabulary one should use in describing EM ""findings,"" such as language of causation, is never discussed. For a discipline that has intervention as its aim, this is quite irresponsible -- though again, Friedmanesque. As John Kenneth Galbraith often pointed out, economic discourse and interventions are unquestionably about power, but most economists deny this with their models based on ""perfect competition"" and the like, and their urgings that we bow to the impartial will of the market.But this politics issue is a rather highfalutin' critique. There's also a more down-to-earth one: even if we assume that conditional prediction is the principal aim of economics, how helpful is EM at making actual predictions? This is never considered in the book, either -- and becomes kind of the elephant in the room.I'd say that the books' various omissions were for the sake of preventing the economists' thought-bubble from bursting, but as Philip Mirowski has shown in his recent ""A Good Crisis is a Terrible Thing to Waste,"" even real data and systemic catastrophe turn out not to be threats to their self-delusion. Because the book obviously achieves so well the rather narrow objectives it sets for itself, I deduct only one star for my substantive concerns. My print-on-demand copy was printed in pale ink, almost gray, that was very unpleasant to read; Cambridge U Press should be ashamed for charging so much for such poor production, especially for a book that requires tremendous attention to every page.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFE54RBOUPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521029732#wasThisHelpful","RYFE54RBOUPJ","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a student or expert in spatial analysis -- say, a reader of Environment and Planning B, a journal that this book's author (MJB) has edited for many years -- it's very possible you'll find this book a masterful survey and extension of the professional literature.If, however, you're a general reader interested to learn new and stimulating facts about properties that the world's cities have in common, you'll almost certainly be disappointed. There's very little empirical discussion of cities in this book, and a great deal of math (mostly matrix algebra, with a bit of graph theory thrown in). A more descriptive title for this book might be something like ""Mathematical modeling of cities and the planning process."" You should also be advised that this new ""science"" is essentially economics. There isn't any biology or ecology involved, or anything about how the built environment affects the local weather (as it sure does here in Tokyo); and even the bit of physics the book contains is sometimes off-kilter.I came to the book as one of those general readers, albeit with a fairly high tolerance for math-heavy exposition. I found the book frustrating on several levels, as I'll describe below. Nonetheless, I admire the author's attempts to synthesize his field, and also the modesty with which he makes claims for this purported new ""science."" Throughout the book he is scrupulous to point out the limitations and the tentative or even metaphorical nature of many of the techniques he describes. For these reasons, as well the book's possibly being intended for an expert-only readership (notwithstanding the MIT Press's marketing that roped me in), I give the book close to a 4-star rating despite my own issues with it.While that's the short of it, the rest of this rather long review delves into the things that disappointed or even troubled me about the book. In fairness again, I should note that some of those things -- maybe even more of them than I recognize -- arise from the conventions of spatial analysis and its sister discipline, urban economics, rather than from the specific approach taken in this book. And the following long list notwithstanding, I suppose it's to the book's credit that instead of giving up on it, I kept hoping it would get better. I'll start out commenting on style, and get more substantive as I go farther down the list. I hope that at least some of the earlier points might be addressed in a subsequent edition of the book.A.  There's a lot of room for improvement in the illustrations. First, this book is really crying out for an insert of color plates or color printing within the text -- some illustrations are almost unintelligible in black/white. Unfortunately, the publisher followed a recent trend and punted the color pictures to an online website. There have been some delays in uploading them, but a bigger question is how long will the site stay active. Not an issue if they were in the printed book, which might last decades.For other illustrations, it wasn't just lack of color but lack of context that made them hard to use. To get the most out of the maps and hierarchical diagrams in Chapters 2 and 3, you'll need to know something about the geography and sociology of London neighborhoods (I don't). Chapters 6 and 7 present ""spatial syntax"" and ""heat map"" illustrations of a French town called Gassin; the reader is advised that these maps don't give a good visual portrait of the town's physical layout -- but we're never given a conventional map or aerial photo of Gassin to see for ourselves. Ditto for Cardiff in Chapter 8, where we're shown results of computer simulations of its growth, without any schematic of the un-simulated city for comparison. (BTW the issue described in this paragraph itself illustrates how models are the featured actors in this book, with real cities merely the supporting players.)B. The text, too, could be more user-friendly. Paragraphs are long and dense, with important points or definitions sometimes buried in the middle (e.g., the definition of ""hierarchy"" @152). Other concepts are often explained by reference to the specialist spatial analysis literature instead of to sources more accessible to a general readership. E.g., when MJB takes pains to distinguish his sense of a ""dual"" graph and a ""more common"" sense of that term, he points the reader to an out-of-print 1971 design monograph by March and Steadman (@182-183). But if you check a good standard graph theory textbook, like Diestel, or even just Wikipedia, you can quickly learn that MJB's use of ""dual"" already has its own name: ""line graph"" (Diestel @4).C.  Readers with a natural sciences background may also be confused or even exasperated by some of the analogies to physics and the treatment of some mathematical topics. Here are three examples:(1) Chapter 2 discusses ""gravitational"" models of flows of people between two cities. These are based on equations with the formT_{ij} = K P_i P_j (d_{ij})^{a}  [1]where the P's are populations of two cities and d is the distance between them; it's supposedly like Newton's equation for gravitational force, F = G M_1 M_2 r^{-2}.Different to the physics approach, though, the treatment of [1] in this book doesn't obey the rules of dimensional analysis. T_{ij} is sometimes described as a ""flow"" and sometimes as a ""force,"" even within the same sentence (@ 48, 52) -- but a flow includes a dimension of [time]^{-1}, whereas a force has [time]^{-2}. Later, MJB rearranges equation [1] to create certain quantities that he likens to ""potential energies or summations of forces (Stewart, 1941)"" (@64), even though energies and forces aren't dimensionally comparable, either. And a few pages later, he splits the proportionality constant K into a product of K_i K_j, and then considers the case when ""K_i = K_j = K"" (@71). This can only make sense if K is a pure number (equal to 1, BTW), in which case the left- and right-hand sides of equation [1] can't be dimensionally balanced. Also disappointing is that equation [1] is never compared to empirical data in the rest of the book, so we're never told what a real-life value for the exponent /a/ might be.Another issue here is that the Stewart 1941 reference doesn't provide an explicit expression for demographic potentials and doesn't mention summations of forces at all. Moreover, as is clear both from that paper and from his longer 1948 paper in Sociometry on ""demographic gravitation"" (not cited in the book), Stewart developed his ""potential"" in the context of a static gravitational field, which is quite different from this book's context of population flows. (Incidentally, I hope that in a future edition MJB will drop Stewart altogether, because the man was a galloping racist. In his 1941 model of rural population density, he blames the inaccuracies in his model on the ""concentration [of] the Negro population"" in certain states -- i.e., he hadn't counted them in his calculations. In 1948 he proposed that the (metaphorical) ""molecular weight of negroes [sic] in the Deep South averages only 1/3"" that of the (predominantly white) residents of the Northeastern and Midwestern states. That's even worse than in the 1789 US Constitution, where a slave was reckoned at 3/5.)Economists usually cite to Jan Tinbergen's ""Shaping the World Economy"" (1962) as the source of gravity models. That would have been appropriate here, too, because his equation for flows of international trade has roughly the same mathematical form as [1], albeit with a significant difference: Tinbergen's equation was dimensionally kosher. Tinbergen himself didn't use the gravity analogy, perhaps because he found empirically that the distance exponent in his model has a rather un-gravitational value of around -1.(2) In Chapter 8 we're told,""In cities, filling the two-dimensional plane with particular forms of development from the parcel to the street line and at different densities suggests that their fractal dimension lies between 1 and 2. Thus this dimension becomes the signature of urban morphology, which is the outcome of processes that generate fractal shapes"" (@250-251).This passage doesn't make it clear that on a 2-dimensional surface it will be the *boundary* of the city that has fractal dimension -- not the city per se, which, being an area, has dimension 2. Moreover, a fractal dimension between 1 and 2 is the ""signature"" of *any* fractal curve on the plane. (See the definition in Mandelbrot's classic book, which appears in MJB's reference list, of a fractal as a set for which the Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension (Mandelbrot 1982 @15).) If one took this passage at face value, every island would count as a city, since its coastline shares the same fractal ""signature.""(3) Chapter 9 develops expressions for ""entropy"" and ""free energy"" in connection with flows of people between home and work. We find ""the total energy C = S + F,"" where the right-hand side ""expresses energy in two varieties -- 'unusable,' which is entropy S, and 'usable,' which is the free energy F,"" citing Atkins 1994 (@282-283). In physics, though, entropy and energy don't have the same dimensions: S has dimensions of energy divided by temperature. BTW that's what it says in Atkins's 2010 physical chemistry textbook and all of the other thermodynamics, stat mech and chemistry textbooks on my shelf -- so although I don't have it to hand, I'd be surprised if Atkins 1994 said something different.Of course the ""science of cities"" is NOT physics, so one could object that its formulas don't need to be precisely analogous. I would agree, but this then begs the question of whether the analogy is illuminating at all.D.  If a fondness for physics analogies coupled with loose dimensional bookkeeping calls to mind neoclassical economics (NCE), that's no mere coincidence: NCE provides substantive inspiration for the ""new science of cities"" as well. (I leave aside here the question of whether NCE deserves to be called scientific at all.) Consider:""Cities exist primarily to bring individuals together to trade the products of their labor. Historically, clusters of individuals formed at points where their labor could best exploit natural resources while providing sustainable locations where production could be achieved."" (@16-17.)Reading this, I couldn't help thinking of those just-so histories of mankind one finds in 17th and 18th Century philosophical works, confidently stating as fact conjectures that conform to the writer's favored theory. Can anyone really know that ancient city sites always afforded the ""best"" exploitation of resources? And that this was always the ""primary"" reason for their founding? I don't think, say, Hobbes, Locke or Rousseau would have ignored the role of military and spiritual considerations in the founding of ancient cities.The NCE influence perhaps also explains why the reader must occasionally slog through descriptions of highly artificial mathematical models, such as one in which cities' populations change only by swapping residents (@124-128). It may also explain why certain dissociated points of view are accepted as reasonable, such as the rather disquieting prospect of ""an entire new class of models [that] is generated if the population is allowed to become negative, as is the case when the population might be considered as capital or wealth."" (@127-128.)But the influence of NCE and its expansionist aspirations is nowhere stronger than in the way the book brands a blend of economics and fashionable math as ""the"" science of cities, with an exclusive emphasis on flows of commercially significant goods and services. What about cities' numerous impacts on biology, ecology, meteorology, geology, and much else? For example: the way waterfront high-rise buildings have changed Tokyo's climate over the past 15 years; the heat island effect that's increased the number of thunderstorms in Phoenix AZ; the proliferation of sinkholes around that same city due to the population's demands on the water table; the nationwide impact of the growth of Beijing and Tianjin on China's water supply; and so on. Why are these and other similar concerns unworthy of being integrated into a ""new science of cities""?E. Part III, a set of five so-called ""normative"" chapters, disturbed me the most. They incorporate the all-too-typical discourse about ""governance"" -- the idea that what works in running a business should be applied to public affairs -- but go beyond this, by replacing politics with mathematical notions of equilibrium. Sometimes this fits explicitly into an NCE framework, such as the allusion to Walrasian ""ttonnement"" in averaging the difference between a matrix summarizing actors' interest in land, and another matrix summarizing their control over it (@414). All interests are of course measured in cash values.An even loopier idea is to use the theory of Markov matrices to reach decisions about public policy; the idea here is that when you crash these matrices together often enough, they often reach an equilibrium or ""stationary"" state -- embodying your ""optimal"" decision -- in the long run. (By ""loopy,"" I mean that it sounds like what 1st-year grad students who've recently learned about Markov matrices dream up on a cocktail napkin after a couple of beers. Nonetheless this line of thought has a long academic pedigree, apparently.) To create such matrices requires that each actor in a planning decision be able to quantify a priori his, her or its interests vis-à-vis all others', and possibly to update these with each iteration (or possibly not). People are removed from the process once their set of matrix entries has been tabulated by the master planners cranking everything through its Markov paces. No matter that MJB tells us occasionally that such models are metaphorical -- the metaphor is a pretty chilling one.Moreover, no case is made for why an ""equilibrium"" decision should be the best decision. Even if there were a strong case, the possibility of realizing such a decision is about as plausible as the NCE notion that an economy can reach an equilibrium when each household figures out a priori how what its preferences are for every possible bundle of goods during, say, the whole year ahead. Or even less plausible than that, because certain problems identified by NCE economists are entirely ignored here. E.g., Kenneth Arrow pointed out that it's impossible for a set of voter preferences to be aggregated in a way that they are transitive for the whole community, given certain prima facie desirable constraints (please check Wikipedia if you need more specifics). MJB never tells us what happens if the community preferences are intransitive -- and much less if various individuals' preferences suffer from this drawback, too.Mathematical problems aside, the real issue here is that equilibrium is the negation of politics. Nothing in this book contemplates a situation where an actor makes a concession on an issue today because she expects reciprocity in the future; where an actor makes an apparent concession today because he's giving an opponent enough rope to hang himself; or where power simply wins. Machiavelli, not Markov (and not the Prince but the Discourses) would have been more apt here: the basis for the greatness of a city lies in providing appropriate institutions for the conflict between rich and poor. Or, as a French children's book (Godard & Pilon's « Les démocraties ») wisely put it, achieving democracy is always a battle. The task of achieving it shouldn't be taken out of the hands of citizens and put into the hands of ""planners.""In sum, I wanted to like this book better than I was able to. I should mention that MJB was very gracious in a few brief emails we exchanged about it, early in my reading. Also, some of his editorials in Environment and Planning B (available on his website) are more down-to-earth and humane than one might guess from the rather detached perspective of this book. I hope he will put those good qualities to use in a sequel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BSACV0CNHJY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262019523#wasThisHelpful","R2BSACV0CNHJY4","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's easy to come away with a ""resistance is futile"" feeling after reading this book -- i.e., resistance to what the author (PM) calls the Neoliberal Thought Collective. PM continually demonstrates that they have a lot more money, own the top economics departments, occupy almost the full range of America's now hyper-narrow political spectrum, and play dirty when it comes to rhetoric. Nonetheless, I was glad to have read the final, rather pessimistic, chapter, in which he points out a wonderful parallel between the neoliberal approaches to climate change and to the financial crisis. Perhaps the NTC's tendency to repeat itself might be turned into a vulnerability.I've read most of PM's other monographs and edited volumes, as well as some of his uncollected articles, and found this one to be more uneven and often a less pleasant read. PM's style is best when he is marshaling lots of sources and criticizing most of them, while the passages with fewer footnotes sometimes are wandering and tedious. Chapter 4 and parts of Chapter 5, in which PM's targets were better-defined, were more entertaining -- if one can say that about tales of Nobel laureates so rigidly opposed to acknowledging their own mistakes or other aspects of reality. It may be indicative, though, of PM's struggle with this oversized book that his trademark baby-boomer cultural in-jokes here are more strained than Paul Krugman's (compare ""Repent, Harlecons, Cried the History Man"" @301 with Krugman's ""The Night They Re-read Minsky,"" quoted @292; if you were born after 1960, you may find this comment inscrutable).Maybe it was desperation at taking on such a gigantic and resilient foe that led its author to throw the proverbial kitchen sink at the theme. The book's structure is not transparent (unlike, say, ""Machine Dreams,"" with its von Neumann story arc), and the topics feel very heterogeneous. Excursions such as the one on Foucault in Chapter 3 and the blow-by-blow history of the TARP in Chapter 5, each 10 pages long, make it hard for a reader to stay focused on PM's many truly insightful observations. I agree with another reviewer, though, that the reification of the NTC and the reductivist emphasis on it/them as the sole, ultimate villain of the piece weren't always convincing.PM's argument is richly sourced, and I expect to be mining his bibliography for months. I read this book not long after finishing Steve Keen's ""Debunking Economics,"" a more technical -- and fiery -- critique of neoclassical macroeconomics. Taken together, the books suggest that while telling neoclassical economists how wrong they are may be an important exercise from an idealistic, justice perspective, it brings only rapidly diminishing returns as a practical matter. More effort is needed both to deepen constructive heterodox approaches and to explain them in an upbeat way to a broad audience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9MZTOTA8WIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781680795#wasThisHelpful","RV9MZTOTA8WIC","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the past 7 or 8 years I've been reading quite a bit, and writing a little, about what's wrong with neoclassical economics (NCE). Although I was aware of this book, I'd put off looking into it because I thought it would be redundant to my other researches. I finally picked up a copy after seeing several citations to it in another fine book, Gilbert Rist's ""The Delusions of Economics."" I quickly found it actually contains a lot of original or hard-to-find material, very nicely expressed.Most critiques of NCE concentrate on microeconomics, which the author (SK) covers in the early chapters of the book. But whereas many such critiques focus on problems with the notion of utility per se, such as its amorality or, at a more mathematically sophisticated level, problems with the notion of ""revealed preferences"" (one of Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson's innovations), SK makes different points. For some readers the most familiar micro topic SK discusses will be the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem, which at least a couple of graduate level textbooks do mention -- though not all of them. This theorem says that your Intro Econ textbook's explanation that lots of individual demand curves add up to one market demand curve with a downward-sloping shape is nonsense, under all but the most artificial conditions. More novel probably will be his discussion of the work of Cambridge University economist Piero Sraffa (1898-1983), who explained why producers' supply curves generally don't slope upward with increasing quantity, and why you can't maximize profits by setting price equal to marginal production cost. (Don't bother looking Sraffa up in the index of your textbook -- he is ignored by NCE.) SK also shows how, ironically, a paper by Chicago economist (and Nobelist) George Stigler lends support to some of these arguments. Another nice touch is a discussion of a 1952 paper by finance scholars Eiteman & Guthrie, who asked businesspeople about their cost curves -- and found that over 90% chose shapes that are way different from what's shown in your textbook.In addition, SK goes into more depth about competition and especially NCE macroeconomic theory than I usually see. He also gives an especially good explanation about the meaning -- and the fallacies -- of equilibrium at both the micro and macro scales, which leads off with a wonderfully apt analogy to learning how to ride a bicycle. In this regard, SK's clear and concise description helped me to appreciate a result from the Leontief input-output matrix approach, which I'd long assumed was too boring to bother with. Also good are SK's survey of the leading heterodox schools of economics, his parsing out of what remains worthwhile about Marx, and his comments about the sociology of economics education and academic publication. (Some essays in ""Pluralist Economics,"" edited by Edward Fullbrook and also from Zed, are additional good sources on the sociological issues.)While the book is quite gigantic, it by no means exhausts the field of critiques of NCE. Some topics that don't get much attention are economic growth, NCE's handling of the environment, and neoliberalism, including about what it does and does not have in common with NCE. (Nor does it discuss international trade; and while SK mentions in Chap. 2 that there is material pertinent to this topic at his website, at this writing it's not obvious where to find this material or indeed if this portion of the website is still functional at all.)  What the book might exhaust, however, is the patience of a reader who isn't familiar with textbook economics. While the quantity of material SK provides can be overwhelming, the more you know about the field, the more you will appreciate the thrashing it gets here.Given the fact that some background in economics is helpful for understanding -- and sustaining one's interest in -- the book, SK's intentional banishment of equations isn't always successful. For example, the discussions of perfect competition (Chap. 4), cost curves (Chap. 5), and the Cambridge capital controversy (Chap. 7) are intelligible if you recall how to take the Product and Chain Rules for taking derivatives, but it's annoying to have to read through this in words.Quite a few of Keen's criticisms, plus many others besides, have been floating around in one form or another for decades. Unfortunately, they've made absolutely no difference in how economics is taught -- nor in how economists influence policy. Even Paul Krugman, whom some might think is an unconventional economist because he's such an outspoken political liberal, both has drunk and continues to serve the NCE Kool-Aid. In a recent review entitled ""Gambling with Civilization"" (NY Review of Books, 2013 November 7), concerning a book about climate change by Yale economist William Nordhaus, Krugman says that ""most of the standard [economics] textbook analysis ought to apply"" to how to deal with global warming. What you'll take away from this book is that, no less than global warming, following the advice of true believers in NCE is itself a dangerous gamble.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGJ5VEPBFSFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848139926#wasThisHelpful","R2JGJ5VEPBFSFG","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In recent years, there have been a number of voices criticizing economic growth, including such writers as Tim Jackson, Juliet Schor, Peter Victor and Richard Heinman. None of those authors cite to this book -- which seems a  bit unjust, since the author (CH) anticipated them by 5 years or more, at least in the universe of English-language publications. And whereas most of those other writers foreground the looming environmental disasters of global warming and/or ""peak oil,"" CH puts more human issues up front, such as how society's strong emphasis on consumption distorts our way of looking at the world. In this he is more like some European critics of growth, such as the late André Gorz, whom he was again out front in reading and quoting.Some parts of the book have aged better than others. CH's praise for the liberating power of non-regular employment (Chap. 6) was already off-base as to the situation in some countries, such as Japan, at the time he wrote; it's certainly too rosy a picture for many other Western economies post-2008 crash. (It's amazing how many tenured university professors who've never been unemployed love to recommend to others that losing a career isn't so awful: judging by the CV on his website, CH seems to have held various prestigious positions, sometimes several at a time, continuously since getting his Ph.D. in 1984.) On the other hand, while the chapter on politics focuses on the Third Way of Blair's Britain, its observations remain remarkably pertinent to the policies of the Obama era. The existence of such a chapter is also refreshing, since more recent books in this genre are much more focused on economics and the environment. Apropos of which, CH's chapter has a nice typology of philosophical attitudes toward the environment (@191ff) that remains useful, even though global warming has become even more serious than it was in 2003.Unfortunately, the final chapter about the ""post-growth society"" probably never was very pertinent: it's heavy on grand utopian wishful thinking, such as that a post-growth society will ""engender and reflect a historic transformation of consciousness"" (@214), provide ""an opportunity ... to trigger a cultural renaissance"" (@226-227), and will ""encourage a reinvigoration of democracy"" (@217). Among other issues here, it is far more likely that a revived and strengthened democracy will be a pre-requisite for attaining any ""post-growth society"" than a result.Nonetheless, if you take this last chapter with a grain of salt, there's plenty you can learn from this book if you're new to the idea that economic growth might not always be a good thing. If you've already read a few books on de-growth, this one won't tell you many things that will seem new -- but I give it a healthy star-rating because it deserves credit for having said them before many others did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISEE1QJIRTEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745322506#wasThisHelpful","R3ISEE1QJIRTEM","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent overview of many of the fallacies of neoclassical economics (NCE), which is the mainstream variety taught in Econ 101. I've read many critiques of economics during the past several years, and yet I found that this one had some new things to say. The author's (GR's) attention is mainly focused on microeconomics, although he does touch on macroeconomics when he criticizes both the idea of economic growth and some of growth's critics, especially in Europe. He deals with many of the classic topics, such as self-interest, utility, market (and other) exchange, equilibrium, etc. While many of his observations echo those available elsewhere, he often adopts an anthropological perspective that brings some insights not so common in the English-language literature on this topic. I also found his demolition of NCE's doctrine that scarcity is the driving factor of economics to be especially thorough and new.One of GR's chief concerns is that NCE fails to consider the environment in its description of the economy. The textbook fiction of NCE describes the economy as a circular flow, wherein one person's expenditures becomes someone else's receipts, which in turn fund that person's expenditures, and so on. As Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen pointed out in the 1960s and '70s, this is nonsense when it comes to the material flows arising from economic activity: if all the materials incorporated into products or wasted during production moved in such a circle, we wouldn't have landfills, greenhouse gases, or other pollution. The somewhat heterodox field of ""ecological economics"" aims to reformulate economic theory to take these environmental realities into account. Meanwhile, GR makes a clever connection between this issue and the issue of scarcity, one which I hadn't previously encountered. He wryly points out that if the economy really flowed in the neat circle envisioned by NCE, all ""scarce"" goods and materials would be recoverable -- and so not scarce at all. That is, NCE holds entirely inconsistent views about the primacy of scarcity and the ""externality"" of environmental matters. Even the leading textbook of ecological economics (Daly and Farley) fails to make this elegant and deadly argument.A big reason that GR's treatment is fresh is that he relies on many Continental European sources not usually mentioned in the Anglophone literature. His anthropological point of view draws especially on the France-based Movement for Anti-Utilitariaism in the Social Sciences, a/k/a MAUSS (named after the early-20th Century scholar and activist Marcel Mauss, whose book ""The Gift"" is a staple of undergrad anthro survey courses); little of this group's work appears in English. He also mentions plenty of European economists, mainly French and German (though I confess I didn't find the latter to be so persuasive). On the other hand, some of the usual sources you might find in English-language critiques of NCE, such as some terrific works by historian Phillip Mirowski and his colleagues, are absent. So if you're just starting to investigate what might be wrong with mainstream economics, this is a good place to start -- but don't stop here. And if you've been reading in that field for a while, then you'll still find many new ideas to complement those that sound familiar. I read a lot of the recent French literature in this field myself, yet I found myself highlighting plenty of items in the bibliography, especially from the 1970s-1990s. The publisher also deserves compliments for an excellent index, which picks up matters and authors mentioned in the footnotes. GR's style is more philosophical than empirical, but light on jargon and with a touch of irony here and there, as others have noted. My main criticism would be that GR doesn't incorporate politics sufficiently into his analysis; a smaller point would be that his discussion of debt doesn't take finance adequately into account. But these are minor points, in the context of the work he has delivered. All in all, the book is an engaging and enlightening read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HR3BQJ0P30YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848139225#wasThisHelpful","R3HR3BQJ0P30YA","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dense book seeks to achieve a synthesis of the various philosophical and practical trends driving global regulation of corporate activity. I admired the author's (GT's) ambitious attempt to pull together arguments from economics, law, political philosophy and public policy. I also agreed with many of his observations and concerns, such as his worries about how the increased use of private arbitration is separating the legal sphere from the democratic process, and about how organs of the WTO are effectively making law that had not been agreed to by the member nations. However, I was unconvinced by the argument overall, and, I confess, even confused by some parts of it.There's no question that a multitude of bilateral and multilateral treaties are changing the legal landscape within which multinational companies (MNCs) operate. To some extent these arrangements may restrict options for MNCs, but in many cases they are giving MNCs many new opportunities and tying some governments' hands in the bargain. An example of the latter type of development is bilateral investment treaties (BITs, discussed in Chap. 5), which often require that governments submit to private-style arbitration of disputes with foreign corporate investors. GT does a good job of identifying and describing some of these mechanisms.The motivation to bring ""constitutions"" into the mix seems to have been the recent shift in corporate discourse from ""corporate social responsibility"" to ""corporate citizenship,"" which GT describes in Chap. 3. Personally, I see the new discourse simply as a form of self-promoting, power-grabbing corporate propaganda, bringing results like the Citizens United case and perhaps more ""civil rights"" for corporations in the future. Occasionally GT acknowledges this possibility, too. But most of his political explorations are much loftier, from the angle of a ""cosmopolitan"" global order such as envisioned by Immanuel Kant, leavened with modern Kantians John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas, plus some material from leftist theorists Hardt, Negri, Virno and Marazzi that I found somewhat mystifying.Unfortunately, the book's notion of ""constitution"" never comes into clear focus. At one point GT adopts an unusually broad definition: ""All organization[s] or institutions are made up of constitutions, or have constitutions, so constitutionalization is a genuine societal process, one happening almost everywhere"" (@28). A moment later he catches himself in a footnote, acknowledging that ""[t]o see constitutions everywhere means that they are nowhere,"" and emphasizing that he will confine himself to ""a rather more traditional focus on just 'political' constitution making, where the rule of law is a key problematic element"" (@id. n7). But his method of talking about ""political"" constitutions is not so traditional: e.g., he deliberately doesn't speak in terms of power or sovereignty, even though political scientists have been doing so ever since Aristotle.I admit to being somewhat disoriented by these omissions, and by GT's occasional references to ""the parties to the constitution,"" whom he says include not just citizens but ""the institutions of rule"" (@21). This isn't a traditional political understanding. Think of the opening of the US constitution: ""We, the people of the United States of America, ..."": the constitution is written in the name of the people, as source of sovereign power. In that case, the people, through their duly constituted representatives (pursuant to state, not federal law) enacted a constitution that describes the limits of their sovereign power as delegated to certain institutions ""constituted by"" the document, such as Congress, the President, etc. -- those institutions aren't ""parties"" to it. The document also provides for how those limits on delegated sovereignty should be enforced and obeyed.Can these more traditional notions be transposed to the ""global corporate sphere,"" such as the World Trade Organization, BITs, the Basel III banking regulations, and so on? I don't think it's so easy. Take the WTO as an example: MNCs lobby governments to represent their interests in WTO negotiations, but (i) they aren't themselves parties to the treaties, (ii) they can't participate in the dispute resolution mechanism under the treaties, and (iii) it is questionable whether a government's ""representation"" of MNCs in such a negotiation is legitimate, since the interests of MNCs and that country's (natural) citizens may conflict. So it's hard to see how a treaty that might begin ""we, the countries of the world, ..."" could be a constitution for corporations, even though they might benefit from it as a practical matter. (BTW, the ""institutions of rule,"" such as the WTO itself, aren't ""parties"" to the WTO treaty, either.) I don't see that much is gained by calling the  growing global web of regulations and treaties affecting corporations a ""constitution"" instead of, say, ""treaties and regulations"" -- and I do think that calling it a ""constitution"" is positively confusing.Moreover, even if we accept the ""constitutionalization"" frame, there are some important issues that need to be faced. One is the problem of conflicts between treaties. There are tens of thousands of treaties in force between nation states, although most of them are bilateral and many don't relate to commerce. However, due to the political nature of treaty negotiation, even the smaller number of commerce-related treaties isn't policed for mutual consistency, neither as the treaty is being written nor ex-post. For example, should the terms of the WTO treaties prevail over the terms of environmental agreements, or vice versa -- and who decides? If ""rule of law"" is a hallmark of constitutionalism, it seems we are far away from it here. An even more important issue that troubled me was that if there are constitutions for human beings and different constitutions for companies, what's the relationship between the two?GT doesn't address either of those issues in depth. Nonetheless, he evidently felt that the case for ""constitutionalization"" was strained, even though he had put that word into the book's title. Early on, he downgrades that word to the ambiguous expression 'quasi-constitutionalization' (@10). Then in the final chapter he admits that there isn't any ""definitive"" way to establish whether even quasi-constitutionalization ""has happened or is happening"" (@160). This is a little discouraging to a reader trying to understand the author's point.Perhaps there is a strong case for a ""constitutional"" angle to the evolving trade and global corporate regulatory regimes, but more along the lines of Machiavelli's Discourses than of Kant's ""Perpetual Peace."" Machiavelli used ""constitution"" in the Aristotelian sense of a positive description of a country's political institutions. He particularly praised the Roman constitution for building in means to represent both rich and poor. Here's the point: when it comes to the 21st-Century global ordering, the trend is clearly for the rich to be over-represented -- both at the level of rich countries versus poor countries, and rich companies versus less powerful individuals.For example, there is a trend to force individuals to submit to private arbitration in their dealings with companies, thereby bypassing both the legislative and judicial authority of democratic states. See such US Supreme Court cases as Rent-A-Center (2010) and Marmot Health Care and Compucredit (both from 2012). There are also many democratic deficits in the way trade treaties are negotiated. The conflict between rich and poor nations at WTO is one example; another is the Obama Administration's insistence that the drafts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership accord be kept confidential even from Members of Congress (to say nothing of ordinary folks in any of the countries the US is eager to dominate, like us here in Japan). Unfortunately, GT mentions such issues at best only in passing in this book, and his proposed solutions -- such as making companies more democratic by proposing lists of people from NGOs, trade unions and other trusted sorts who might be selected to serve as ""champions"" of certain issues on corporate boards (Chap. 6) -- tend to be very idealistic and unworkable, as well as not being particularly democratic. (Cf. Aristotle's ""Athenian Constitution,"" or the mechanisms mentioned in the final chapter of John P. McCormick's excellent ""Machiavellian Democracy"" (CUP 2011) for more democratic procedures.)A quick note on the book's production: The book's small dimensions make the already metaphorically dense text literally so, and a somewhat uncomfortable read. The small size also makes the book's high price seem all the more inflated. On the bright side, the book includes footnotes (not endnotes), a full list of references, and an index. Apropos of the references, though, I estimated there are somewhere between 450-500 of them, but only one in a foreign language (Danish). How global is that?With its obvious erudition but numerous hesitations and qualifications, the text seems more like a senior scholar's thinking out loud than a finished argument. I wonder if it might have benefitted from a longer gestation period, maybe roughly another year or so of letting the big ideas simmer until they could consolidate better. I hope the author will present such a sequel, but until he does so, readers should take the question mark he put into this book's title very seriously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SONXMOL1864/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019959483X#wasThisHelpful","R34SONXMOL1864","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I was looking for ideas from an opposing perspective that might help me to sharpen my own research and writing in political economy. Unfortunately this book wasn't a whetstone but a slab of clay: a soft block of old clichés such as one would expect from crotchety Tory apologists on BBC's ""Dateline London"" or their American cousin, the noted historian Newt Gingrich.The author (NF) starts from Adam Smith's observation in The Wealth of Nations that the ""progressive state"" of economic growth is better than an economy's being in the ""stationary state,"" characterized by ""miserably low"" wages and ""the monopoly of the rich"" (@9-10). The bitter irony is that whereas Smith mentioned China as being in the stationary state, now it's us Anglo-Saxons who are in that condition; the book is devoted to exploring the reasons for this. (Id.) By the end, NF boils down his message into four lessons from the 19th Century: First, were Edward Burke alive to see our staggering public debt, he'd tell us we are betraying future generations. Second, complex regulation to avoid future financial crises evidences a misunderstanding of the market economy, a folly that Walter Bagehot (founder of The Economist) would never have fallen into. Next, the rule of law is better than the rule of lawyers, as Charles Dickens ""well knew."" Finally, ""excessive pretensions of the state"" have caused our civil society to fall into a ""state of decay,"" just as Tocqueville warned us (@133-134).While these august Victorians provide a nice organizing conceit for the work, NF clearly feels at home in their company, too. After all, he tells us that his contribution to civil society is to pay his dues to three clubs in London, one in New York, and one in Cambridge, MA -- that is, the sorts of clubs that Mycroft Holmes is often seen in on ""Sherlock,"" with sports facilities, dining facilities and guest bedrooms that NF ""occasionally"" uses (@125). He also tells us a heartwarming story about how he enlisted volunteers from the local Lion's Club to remove the garbage washing up on his beachfront estate in Wales (@112-113), instead of actually paying anyone to do the job.From this lofty perch in society, NF acknowledges the existence of income inequality, both within countries and between countries. While he shows little interest in dealing with the former, the reduction of the latter seems to terrify him. ""The number of Big Macs an employee of McDonald's can buy with an hour of work is just four times higher in the United States than in China,"" he tells us @136, then comments that this is ""still a significant gap."" But his adverb ""just"" says it all: NF isn't irate at McDonald's disgusting exploitation of its Chinese workers -- he is *relieved* that the gap is ""significant."" Again: ""Having been more than twenty times richer than the average Chinese in 1978, the average American is now just five times richer"" (@35). Is this welcome evidence of progress toward a more egalitarian world? Perish the thought: rather, it leaves ""little doubt that the West is experiencing a relative decline unlike anything we have seen in half a millennium"" (@ id.) Egads, man!As Gingrich is wont to do, NF loves to speak in long strings of statistics occasionally leavened by scientific-seeming jargon. E.g., he riffs on how financial systems are ""evolutionary systems"" with ""genes,"" ""biodiversity,"" ""mutations,"" and the rest (@63-64), while also following the same ""power law"" principles of complexity theory as ""earthquakes and epidemics,"" and are even ""wholly indeterministic, meaning that it is next to impossible to make predictions about their future behavior based on past data"" (@67). (NF doesn't seem to realize that even deterministic systems can be unpredictable.) Of course, ""the difference between the natural world and the financial world is the role of regulation,"" with the implication that nature is better -- both because regulation is based on a ""complex"" political process (@68-69), and because the regulation itself can be ""complex"" (e.g., his criticism of Dodd-Frank in the same chapter). Unfortunately NF trips over his metaphors: if finance is a complex system just like nature, and if complexity in nature is cool and unavoidable, then why is complexity in financial regulation necessarily so bad? Are the environmental factors that ""regulate"" evolution really so simple?To be fair, NF isn't against all regulation of finance. But he wants it to be by regulators as wise as Bagehot, and with discretion to follow remedies of their own devising instead of strict rules (@74). He doesn't suggest, however, how such discretion can avoid regulatory capture, where the regulated and the regulator become too chummy, as in the US. Perhaps the solution is a Victorian stiff upper lip? In this case again, his pet themes seem to tangle themselves up: Early in the book, he tells us that ""impersonal forces like the rule of law"" are among the keys to an ""open access pattern"" of human organization that leads to economic greatness (@24-25). A key of the rule of law is that ""the law must be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable"" (@79). How does giving broad discretion to regulators meet these criteria?Some more of NF's observations:@  The world would be better with more property rights (and did you know that's what the Arab Spring was all about? see @31).@  A common law legal system is better for economic growth than a civil law system (@79-96) -- I admit it might appear so if one clings to the wildly false idea that only common law systems ""evolve"" (@96; I speak as a common law lawyer who lives in a civil law country and teaches comparative law).@  It is ""strange"" to find lawyers interested in political reform (@107) -- evidently the civil rights struggles of the past 50 years, in which lawyers played a crucial role, never made it to NF's club.@  ""Carmen Rinehart and Ken Rogoff have shown that ..."" (@45, 147) -- well, forget what they've said, because the research NF relies on was shown to be fundamentally flawed by a U Mass grad student earlier this year.@  The US is ""slipping behind"" in ""competitiveness"" and ""governance"" (@99-102). NF never questions whether these concepts from the microeconomics of private companies are appropriate for democratic governments; quite the contrary, he wants government to ""follow the lead of business and adopt the [sic] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles"" (@46). (Hint to Harvard's Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History: there's more than one set of GAAP -- and none of them is written for governments. You might have checked with your accountant in Wales. And while you're at it, please take a look at the historical role of securities regulatory legislation in inspiring the creation of GAAP in the US and UK: it wasn't exactly business's idea.)I should note that NF, like the Hon. Newt, isn't above using fallacious logic and smear arguments. ""[I]t was the most-regulated institutions in the financial system that were in fact the most disaster-prone: big banks on both sides of the Atlantic, not hedge funds. It is more than a little convenient for America's political class to have the crisis blamed on deregulation and the resulting excesses of bankers. ... Who regulates the regulators?"" (@61). With that last innuendo, NF suggests that the financial crisis was the fault of both the regulation *and* the regulators, not the banks. But aren't banks heavily regulated *because* they are disaster-prone, not the other way around? And couldn't that chain of causation be consistent with the view that in the years leading up to 2008 they weren't regulated enough?That episode of blame-shifting, though, is quite genteel compared to his implication that millions of disabled Americans are malingering: ""The percentage of working-age Americans collecting disability insurance has risen from below 3 percent in 1990 to 6 percent. [cite omitted] Unemployment is being concealed -- and rendered permanent in ways all too familiar to Europeans. Able-bodied people are classified as disabled and never work again. And they also stay put. Traditionally around 3 percent of the US population moves to a new state each year, usually in pursuit of work. That rate has halved since the financial crisis began in 2007."" [@3] These healthy Americans collecting disability insurance and staying on their fat rear ends in their home states instead of moving to find work must be some of the ""dependent drones"" that NF talks about a few pages later, loafing in the ""hives"" constituted by our institutions (see @12-14). Does this style of argument sound familiar? Of course, NF's a Brit, so he's understandably shy about adapting our more royal American metaphor: the ""welfare queen,"" one of the Reagan era's contributions to political propaganda.In his conclusion, NF tells us about the ""exciting"" prospects of global urbanization, which is accelerating at ""more than exponential"" rates (@139, 141). ""People even walk disproportionately faster in big cities than in small ones,"" he tells us breathlessly (@140). No matter that the scientist whom he quotes, complexity researcher Geoffrey West of the Santa Fe Institute, mentions that systems that grow super-exponentially eventually hit a wall and collapse (@141n). NF reassures us that ""[w]here there is effective representative government, where there is a dynamic market economy, where the rule of law is upheld and where there is a civil society independent from the state, the benefits of a dense population overwhelm the costs"" (@142). One wonders how NF can be so certain, after he's told us about how ""nondeterministic"" complex systems can be.In any case, that taste for fast walking is far from the view of the most eminent Victorian omitted by NF, the economist and philosopher John Stuart Mill. Mill held that Adam Smith was wrong and that the stationary state""would be, on the whole, a very considerable improvement on our present condition. I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress."" [J.S. Mill, Principles of Political Economy, IV.6, Sec. 2 (1848)].Perhaps if NF had framed the book as a conservative's attempt to debate Mill's point of view, the work could have maintained its 19th Century theme while also being less silly. After all, if our supposed ""decline"" is actually a ""phase of industrial progress,"" perhaps it's not anything to be so worried about. BTW, that's what NF's beloved evolution would tell us, too: no organisms have evolved that grow forever, and ones that live longest, like the sequoias in some of America's national parks, attain something like a stationary state and survive for thousands of years.A brief gripe about the publisher's greed: at $26.95 list price for this tiny book (hardcover), it's an insult that Penguin Press doesn't provide an index. In sum: I never expected to be persuaded that we're in trouble if the Chinese are less than 20 times poorer than ourselves, but I did expect more challenging conservative arguments than the sloppy, careless ones presented here. By the end, the book's title evoked not so much the state of Western society, as it did the quality of the author's rhetoric.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5PMPXBZRAX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205450#wasThisHelpful","R2W5PMPXBZRAX2","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good assortment of stories, but the versions presented here are quite different from the originals. Concurrently with this issue, Granta's Brazilian affiliate published its issue 9,  O melhores jovens escritores brasileiros ». Each issue contains 20 stories by as many authors; 14 of them appear in both languages, while in the cases of 6 authors, a different story is presented in English and in Portuguese. On its own, each edition is a better than average anthology, maybe around 4.5 stars. It's when I compared the two that I felt at least another star must come off.As far as the substance of the stories goes, I enjoyed about two-thirds of them, and admired a couple more, even though I wasn't always so keen on the most common themes or moods in the collection. Stories about difficult relations with parents or about events in the past outnumber more romantic stories, for example, and rather serious stories far outnumber more light-hearted or suspenseful ones. No stories focus on working life, and there isn't much that is anchored in Brazilian history or society specifically, other than two stories about Rio, a loving meditation on the city by Tatiana Salem Levy and an entertaining rant by J.P. Cuenca. Those two stories, the politically-themed story by Julián F. [sorry: Amazon's robots misread his name as an obscenity], and an entertaining tale of suburban consumerism by A. Prata were probably my favorites in the English edition. I also enjoyed some stories about contemporary urban life by A. Xerxenesky and C. Bensimon. Xerxenesky is one of the six authors with different stories in the two issues, the others being L. Sarmatz, L. Geisler, R. Luisas, C. Mattoso, and C. Saavedra. Some of these contributions were better in one language or the other, or equally good in both, or equally annoying -- so it would be tough for me to say that either the English or the Portuguese version has a better selection. One tip, though: Salem Levy's very lyrical story ends the Brazilian volume, and I would recommend reading it last in English, too. The story that closes the English volume, ""Apnoea,"" by Daniel Galera is quite strong, but in a much darker mood.It may matter to some readers, though, to know that the stories in the English-language edition have been very puzzlingly, or even disturbingly, edited. Important descriptive phrases or even whole sentences or paragraphs have been elided in almost every story. In some cases (e.g., stories by Julián F., J. Arancibia Contreras and M. Del Castillo) these changes occur in the *final sentence* of the story, effectively shifting the meaning of the whole work. (On the other hand, a phrase has been added to the end of E. Fraia's story as if to make its point more obvious, but this intervention is relatively harmless.)I don't want to spoil the plots of the stories for those will read them only in English, so I'll cite just a couple of mild examples. In the Portuguese version of Fraia's ""A Temporary Stay,"" the tennis-playing protagonist is referred to by only a personal pronoun throughout; in the English-language version he is given a name, Nilo. The final sentence of the Portuguese version of Del Castillo's ""Violeta"" brings some nice closure; in the English version, the entire sentence is dropped, making the story much flatter. C. Aguiar's ""Teresa"" is divided into numbered sections in the original, making its parable-like structure easier to understand; these are eliminated in English.Salem Levy's story is also told in short episodes, and the original's divisions between these have not been strictly observed, which results in changing the meaning of some passages. And while the ending of that story wasn't tampered with, there are many other important changes to the text. An entire section of 100 words has been dropped. The story is addressed to the narrator's lover, abandoned in some Northern Hemisphere (European?) city when the narrator decided to return to Rio, but many deletions erase the narrator's affect toward that character. E.g., whenever the narrator address the lover with the phrase ""meu amor"" (""my love""), this is not reflected in the English.  Important sentences and adverbial phrases in the second section of the story, describing the lover's reaction to the news of the narrator's departure, have also been suppressed. And the English title of the story, ""Blazing Sun"" continues in this vein: the original name was ""O Rio sua"" -- ""Your Rio"", addressed to the lover. Changing this not only furthers the erasure of the lover but ignores an important meaning of the story: as the narrator says near the end, ""I think that I don't need you in order to have you with me, after all."" The new title is a bad choice for a simpler reason, as well: the narrator repeatedly emphasizes the *humidity* of the city, not its sunlight.The sample above is a tiny fraction of the changes like this that I found -- and there could easily be others. I can't rule out that some were proposed by the authors themselves, but it seems unlikely that so many authors felt that their stories in Portuguese needed so much improvement, and always by cutting (the exception being Fraia's story, where material was added in a couple of places). It also is hard to believe that so many different translators would drop such important chunks of so many stories through carelessness. In any case, it should have been up to the editors to have caught such errors (and simpler ones: even with my so-so Portuguese I was able to find the occasional howler, such as when the Portuguese for ""hour"" was translated as ""day,"" @171). My suspicion is rather that it was the editors who instigated these ubiquitous random and disfiguring cuts. Fortunately, even when those cuts are serious, they aren't mortal wounds: you can still enjoy this collection despite them, especially if in blissful ignorance of what's missing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A5T2BNRX1O61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1905881630#wasThisHelpful","R1A5T2BNRX1O61","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By the time I read this book I'd been researching and writing about GDP and ""de-growth"" for roughly five years; yet I still found a lot of new information here. That, very simply, is why I give this book 5 stars. The author (LF) is a political statistician who's obviously enthusiastic about his field. His writing is generally clear, without much jargon or tortured syntax. I do wonder whether the richness of detail might be a little overwhelming for a reader who's new to these topics. If you're a wonk, though, the book can be quite enjoyable.As LF makes clear, objecting to GDP as a metric of well-being or economic production doesn't equate to objecting to economic growth. Most of the alternative metrics discussed in Chapter 3 of the book have been proposed by economists or institutions who are very much in favor of economic growth. Even some of the activist alternatives to growth described in Chapter 4 aren't necessarily in opposition to growth: e.g. while supporters of décroissance/de-growth do object to growth for reasons of justice and ecology, the ""transition towns"" movement is based more on the idea that economic growth will inevitably wind down because of lack of resources, such as the unavailability of petroleum. It's refreshing to see this distinction made in an English-language book. Writers like Bill McKibbin and Richard Heinberg tend to lump arguments based on peak oil (growth would be nice but no longer an option) together with arguments based on environmental destruction (growth is killing the planet); obviously that kitchen-sink style of pleading isn't internally consistent. That said, LF seems to be in the camp that objects to both to GDP and to economic growth, and he sometimes blurs the line between the two, as in his conclusion.Among the topics that were newest to me were: the discussion of growth metrics used in the USSR (Chap. 1); a very interesting 1959 paper by Stanford economist Moses Abramovitz (d. 2000), which lays out some issues with using GDP as a welfare measure, especially over extended time periods (Chap. 2); and the spontaneous development of barter and cooperatives during the Argentine credit crisis of the first decade of this century (Chap. 4). There is also a useful brief survey of alternative currencies, focused mainly on Germany and the UK. (There have also been other experiments with them, e.g. in France and Japan).One of the few places where I felt the exposition could have been clearer was in LF's discussion of the treatment of financial assets in national accounting. The United Nations System of National Accounts was revised in 2008 to include a definition of financial derivatives, as LF notes. But he goes on to say that ""[T]he 'apparent' wealth produced by financial speculation ... was fully integrated into GDP accounting so as to become a key driver of measured economic growth"" (@111). This strikes me as unclear and potentially misleading. Fees for services relating to financial transactions, such as underwriters' commissions in a public stock offering, are indeed included in GDP; but the amounts involved in the financial deal per se, such as the money paid for shares of stock, are not. The latter is much huger than the former, which helps to explain how the total annual volume of trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ has exceeded US GDP every year since 1997 (including the crash years of 2008 and 2009). By the way, less than 3% of that annual volume represents money raised by issuing companies, i.e. less than 3% of the volume will be used by issuers to pump up GDP through the purchase of goods and services. Other financial markets are even bigger: e.g., monthly turnover on the foreign exchange market exceeds global annual GDP. These matters aren't mentioned in the book.This is a relatively short book, so there's a lot of other pertinent material left out, as well. Here are some places to look:@ LF often mentions the tragic results of ignoring the advice of Simon Kunznets, the inventor of GNP (predecessor to GDP), who was maybe the one truly wise Nobel economics laureate in history. But he leaves out the story of the ""Kuznets curve,"" which led to billions of dollars of foreign aid being deliberately spent on creating inequality in nations of the South (once again, the opposite of Kuznets's intentions). You can find a great article by Timothy Patrick Moran about this (2005) online.@ The book's brief history of GDP doesn't quite explain why economic growth became such a priority in the post-WWII period. H.W. Arndt's ""Rise and Fall of Economic Growth"" (1978), written during the height of the Cold War, will help to fill this in. Among other elements of the story, Arndt highlights the role played by the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1940s, and the outbreak of the Korean War.@ Another refreshing feature of LF's book is that he occasionally does cite to non-Anglo-Saxon authors, sometimes even when they're not writing in English.  Still, André Vanoli's gigantic history of national accounting (2002) and Jean Gadrey and Florence Jany-Catrice's survey of alternative indicators (3rd ed. 2012), which are standard references in French academic literature in this field, aren't cited here. There isn't really a true alternative to either work in English. (Vanoli's work is available in English translation, albeit at around $200, and the other work is also available in English, but in a now-outdated edition.)@ The de-growth field is far more fractious than LF has a chance to describe. E.g., the same Jean Gadrey mentioned above is a prominent economist who was a member of the Stiglitz Commission, whose work LF does discuss (Chap. 3); but he is also an ""objector to growth"" whose approach is more nuanced than that of Serge Latouche, whom LF flags as ""arguably the most prominent intellectual in the [de-growth] movement."" (Latouche is certainly among the most vocal, at any rate.) If you can read French, Gadrey's blog, on the website of the magazine Alternatives Économiques, is worth checking out. Although he is no longer alive, André Gorz's ""Ecologica,"" which is available in English, provides an even deeper intellectual framework for the de-growth movement. And if you can read Italian, Pierangelo Dacrema has written an entertaining polemic against the ""dictatorship of GDP"" that manages to make a few caustic points not made in the present work ( « La dittatura del PIL », 2007).The publisher has allowed the author to include both endnotes and a list of references, a kindness to the reader that's falling out of fashion at university presses. Despite the omissions I've mentioned above, you can learn a lot from this book; I certainly did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UI51DYU7ZXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780322720#wasThisHelpful","R18UI51DYU7ZXG","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book offers a thoughtful summary of, and apologia for, virtue ethics in a business context. The author (EH) has a broad knowledge not only of the writings of the key philosopher for this field, Aristotle, but also of contemporary business ethics literature, some of it very recent (within months of the book's electronic publication). And he does a good job of explaining many sophisticated philosophical ideas in clear and direct language, quite unlike most academic philosophy.The first four chapters of the book concentrate on explaining Aristotle's ideas. Chapter 5 then applies them to an organizational context, often using Alasdair MacIntyre's somewhat anti-business ""After Virtue"" (1981) -- a book often credited with inspiring a modern revival of interest in virtue ethics -- as a foil. EH's goal is to show that it is possible to lead a virtuous life within a capitalist business. Chapter 6 has many interesting things to say about the challenges of teaching virtue ethics, and Chapter 7 considers whether this chunk of Aristotelianism has relevance in a multicultural business world.I myself teach a short module of business ethics in leadership training programs for corporate executives, though at between 35 and 55 years old they may be a bit older than EH's usual students. I agree with EH that virtue ethics is in many situations a superior approach to the ethical dilemmas faced by businesspeople -- and that it's also the most challenging to teach. Students are usually more comfortable with what they perceive as the simple rules and algorithms of deontological and utilitarian ethical approaches. EH's observation, ""The notion that business is essentially about maximizing something can create a mindset that a business ethics course can barely penetrate"" [64%] made me laugh out loud in sympathy.However, my teaching experience also makes me skeptical that this book would be enjoyable reading for any but the most intellectual and dedicated business executives (a few of whom might instead dive straight into Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics). A lot of the discussion focuses more on the writings of other ethicists than on examples from life in business organizations. In comparison, Michael Sandel's books are much richer in concrete illustrations of ethical problems. For students, especially ones who are already in the business world, I think a book like Schwartz and Sharpe's ""Practical Wisdom: The Right Way to Do the Right Thing"" (2010) is a more user-friendly introduction to Aristotelian ideas. EH's book may be more appropriate as a motivating pep-talk for ethics instructors.EH warns us in the introduction that his is a particular interpretation of Aristotle with which some might disagree, and indeed I did on some small points. Some of his interpretations made use of relatively modern philosophical concepts, such as his references to ""rationality"" (which doesn't appear in the translation of the Nic. Eth. that EH relies on), or when he says that Aristotle had  a ""deficient notion of rights"" (Chap. 3, n.25; rights didn't become prominent in political thought until roughly 2000 years after Aristotle's death). Elsewhere, he speaks of buying someone lunch as ""creating eudaimonia for you and him"" [18%]; I had thought of eudaimonia as something determined over much longer timeframes. A strength of the book is its discussion of how each person is responsible for choosing his or her own commitments; I found it a bit narrow, then, that the discussion of business was always in a capitalist, ""free market"" context. Maybe it's inherently more virtuous to choose to work for a non-profit, or a cooperative, or in other sectors of the ""solidarity economy."" It would have been nice to see this issue discussed, just as it would have been nice to see some general recognition of Continental authors on ethics and economy, to diversify the very ""Anglo-Saxon"" crew in the bibliography (I'm speaking intellectually, of course, not ethnically). The work of Luigino Bruni, Stefano Zamagni and many other Italian scholars in the field of ""civil economy"" is especially pertinent, because it, too, rests ultimately on an Aristotelian foundation. Some of that group's work is available in English.I read this book in an ebook edition (Kindle for iPad), because it was the only edition available even more than a month past the publisher's official release dates for the other ones. At the time, the price was less than 25% of the hardcover's, and less than 50% of the paperback's; I hope that the pricing is still so reasonable when you read this. I find reading ebooks quite unpleasant and inefficient, but this was less exasperating than some. In particular, navigating from text to endnotes to bibliography and back again was fairly fluid. I do wish the publisher had included real page numbers, though. All in all, a solid book about a diffuse-seeming topic for those who use applied ethics in their teaching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30KNQZ40J1NZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5RJE9I#wasThisHelpful","R30KNQZ40J1NZC","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a couple of ways that the title of this collection of 34 articles misses the mark. First, most articles focus less on the ""state of the world"" as it is in 2013, than about how it might be in the future. And (spoiler alert) the overwhelming majority of articles answer the title question in the affirmative. Unfortunately, I'm not sure a reader will wind up with a better idea of what ""sustainability"" is after reading this book than she or he had beforehand; at least, I didn't.Nonetheless, even though I've been researching and writing in a this general field for a while myself, there were maybe 10 or so articles I found that made very good points new to me, or made their points unusually well. Most of these articles had a narrower focus than talking about how to change the whole world at once. Roughly an equal number of chapters had me madly scribbling critical comments in the margins. The remaining, slightly biggest chunk were at least pretty good overall. My star score reflects this average. (DISCLOSURE: Before you read further I should mention that the publisher contacted me and offered to send me a copy of the book if I would agree to write an honest review. Based on my impression of other books from this publisher, I accepted. This is my first invited review out of more than 200 reviews I've posted on Amazon to date. Should there be a recurrence, I will highlight the fact again.)While I'll have more specific remarks below about the contents of some of the chapters, the absence of some important topics was also notable. First, none of the chapters engaged seriously with *finance.* Several chapters were critical of GDP and production; but the economy of goods and services, which is what's measured by GDP, is several times smaller than the financial economy, both in the US and globally. (This might sound paradoxical, but it's not: capital gains, such as from the sale of stocks on the stock market, aren't included in GDP statistics.) One author proposed in his conclusions that corporations shift to becoming ""capital factories"" (Chapter [12] @ 152), which sounds like an expansion of finance. Another seemed to suggest that the expansion of debt runs into trouble on account of the Second Law of Thermodynamics ([7]@76), but the Marxist characterization used to justify this inference, that debt is a claim on future production (id.), seems rather out of date in an economy based on exchange rate speculation, derivatives, etc. This characterization of debt is repeated in a subsequent chapter about de-growth [11], whose authors wisely shy away from making any explicit connection between compound interest and ""matter-and-energy throughput."" While a section of chapter [11] does engage with the US monetary and banking systems, the focus in that passage is more fiscal (i.e., about taxing and spending) than financial. A whole menagerie of financial services products and practices, such as high-frequency trading, simply slip under this book's radar.Second, none of the articles talked about *regional conflicts,* especially ones that have historical, political or religious bases. Since more than a few authors talked with at least guarded optimism about solutions at the global scale, the failure to engage with this issue made it hard to take their analyses seriously. E.g., it's lovely to propose that environmental groups form alliances with the world's religious communities ([28] @ 316), but what about the fact that some of the world's religious communities are killing each other in large numbers, over quarrels that go back many centuries at least? Or about the fact that, e.g., political tensions are rising in East Asia, and are likely to remain so during most of our last window of opportunity to cooperate about the environment, namely, the current century? Why should any reader believe there's even a ghost of a chance that everyone is suddenly going to hold hands?A third missing topic is *treaties.*  I mean especially of the free trade type, not the Kyoto Protocol type. Treaties such as those relating to the World Trade Organization, plus various intellectual property treaties that impact agriculture, actually can make it very difficult for countries to adopt many of the measures discussed in the book, because the countries can be punished if they try to do good things. The timeline of 2012 events at the front of the book mentions one example: in May 2012, the WTO outlawed ""dolphin-safe"" labels on tuna as being unfair to Mexican fishermen. Especially because there are thousands more bilateral treaties in the world than anybody can humanly keep track of (such as ones that allow Japan to ship nuclear and medical waste to certain poorer countries, but not vice versa), this topic is to sustainability like the iceberg was to the Titanic -- huge, (potentially) fatal, and still lurking in the dark.Finally, and this is maybe a more technical objection, I was surprised not to find any mention of Nobel economist Robert Solow or of his notion of ""weak sustainability,"" which has been the dominant notion of sustainability in mainstream economics to date. Weak sustainability assumes that natural capital is interchangeable with man-made capital and financial capital. To paraphrase Solow, it's the height of arrogance for us to presume that those in the future will prefer trees to concrete. This book seems to favor a stronger idea of sustainability -- i.e., that these different forms of capital are NOT substitutable for each other -- but some argument against the prevailing contrary view might have been fruitful.Probably most readers with an interest in sustainability will find at least some useful articles in this book. But for some articles you should keep a lot of salt handy. I mention some highlights and lowlights below, grouped according to the book's three main divisions:I: Introduction plus The Sustainability Metric [1-9]Most of the articles in this section were pretty solid. I particularly liked the ones about planetary boundaries [2], resource impacts of renewable energies [8], and conserving nonrenewable resources [9], though the articles on fresh water [5] and fisheries [6] might also be useful for those new to those topics. A future article about nonrenewable resources might mention something about research in alternative materials using high earth-abundancy elements (materials science being another topic quite missing from this book overall). I also wished the fisheries article were more specific about some countries and regions that are exacerbating the problem.I had more difficulty with ""Defining a Safe and Just Space for Humanity"" [3] and ""Energy as Master Resource"" [7]. The former is written in the utilitarian jargon of mainstream neoliberal economics, e.g. equating human well-being with property rights (specifically, ""a claim on the resources [a person] need[s] to live a life of dignity and opportunity,"" @30). The entire sphere of politics is reduced to a single dimension (""voice"") in an 11-dimensional set of ""social foundations"" (@32). And we are told that ""sure, the direction of GDP still matters"" (@38), i.e. that economic growth should continue, without a good case being made for why.The energy article brings up a number of not-quite-accurate physics-based arguments. (I've earlier critiqued most of these in detail in my Amazon review of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's ""The Entropy Law and the Economic Process,"" including the comment thread thereto.) The biggest problem I had with it was that it repeatedly portrays what are essentially political or practical constraints as if they were mandated by the laws of physics. For example, the laws of physics allow us to send up huge solar panels into geostationary orbit, where even current technologies operate at higher efficiency thanks to the extreme cold, and to beam power back to earth via microwave. That would make the supply of ""low entropy"" fuel sources on earth (see @75) much less of an issue for a very long time, and allow us to use the entire terrestrial insolation for economic growth. As Freeman Dyson pointed out roughly 50 years ago, we could even build a sphere around the sun to capture almost all of the solar output, not just the fraction that reaches us here at earth. Whether we would want to spend to money and effort on this, or suffer other consequences of shielding the world with a geostationary disco ball -- fat chance to both -- are practical and political matters, not issues of the Second Law. Similarly, the Energy Return on Energy Invested metric is portrayed as identifying an ""Energy Trap"" that we ""cannot build our way out of"" (@ 81); actually, though, there isn't any stable consensus on how EROI is to be computed, and the ""trap"" is again a political and economic one, not a physical one. It was also puzzling to read that ""alone among disciplines that aspire to the status of rigorous science, economics alone remains relatively unaffected by the reconstructive impulse of thermodynamics,"" instead ""retain[ing] its roots in the Newtonian mechanism"" (@75). The author should read Phillip Mirowski's well-known historical work, ""More Heat than Light"" (1988), which shows that mainstream economics has been *very heavily* influenced by thermodynamics (albeit not by the Second Law).One last issue with this section of the book is that it doesn't live up to its promise of describing a ""sustainability metric."" Many metrics are proposed -- e.g., EROI [7], ""living within boundaries"" [2], ""1-planet living"" [4], and various other ""dashboards"" [3] -- but no attempt is made to synthesize or reconcile them.II: Getting to True Sustainability [10-23]Books like this tend to be filled with ""top-down, expert-led, apolitical managerialist schemes and technological fixes"" ([14] @ 166). This section broke the mould a bit by having a few articles with a more political focus. For me, the stand-out article in this section was [14], ""Keep Them in the Ground: Ending the Fossil Fuel Era,"" which not only made a great case for shifting the focus of the climate change struggle from CO2 emissions to fossil fuel extraction, but was very up-front and insistent about the inherently political nature of such an effort. ""Pathways to Sustainability: Building Political Strategies"" [22] and ""Moving from Individual Change to Societal Change"" [23] are less intense and more optimistic about the future, but each makes a good point often forgotten by other authors. The first reminds us that with all the talk about ""deliberative democracy"" and the like, it's all too easy to overlook who is framing the agenda for the deliberations. The second emphasizes that small individual actions ""are a fine place to start. But they are a terrible place to stop."" ([23] @ 245.) Also interesting were a pair of chapters on agriculture ([17], [18]), and a very practice-oriented chapter about the impact of energy-saving improvements on the real estate market [16].Another good chapter is ""Building a Sustainable and Desirable Economy-in-Society-in-Nature"" [11], by an all-star team of 9 heterodox economists who are individually outspoken critics of economic growth (including Herman Daly, Tim Jackson, Juliet Schor, Peter Victor and others). This is the chapter in the book that's most up-front about the need for wealthier countries to abandon economic growth. If you're new to that idea, it's well worth your reading this essay. It does suffer somewhat from doses of ""top-down, expert-led, apolitical managerialist"" vocabulary, as well as from what seems to be a universal occupational hazard of economists (maybe J.K. Galbraith excepted): overstating the centrality of economics. E.g. it talks about ""sustainable governance"" (@131), and about how a strong democracy builds ""social capital"" and ""helps to satisfy myriad human needs,"" thereby casting the political in economic terms (@135). A sentence in the next paragraph beginning, ""If society instead adopts the central economic goal of sustainable human well-being, ..."" (@135), had me wondering why should this be solely an *economic* goal? And one of its recommendations, that ""all of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of natural and social capital should be identified and allocated, to the extent possible"" (@132) almost certainly can't be achieved. Cost-benefit analysis is an inherently slippery exercise, easily manipulated by advocates for one position or another: new costs and benefits can be identified at will by anyone with enough imagination and motivation. Though CBA uses the language of economics, it's essentially a rhetorical and political tool. Nonetheless, despite my fussing over some details of this chapter, you should read it anyway.My pencil wasn't so busy while reading most other chapters in this section, but I did notice a few unfortunate metaphors. The title ""Valuing Indigenous Peoples"" [19] makes it sound as if the people themselves are being valued monetarily, even though the article doesn't propose anything of the kind, and was generally good (if perhaps too categorically optimistic about the democratic proclivities of indigenous peoples). ""Respecting"" or ""Empowering"" might have been a more appropriate verb. Dynamism and stability seem to clash in the title ""Transforming the Corporation into a Driver of Sustainability"" [12]; metaphors aside, the article's vision of ""Corporation 2020"" as being simultaneously a ""factory"" of ""financial capital,"" a ""community"" and an ""institute of learning and skills training"" sounded both too good and too inconsistent to be true. The ultra-rational-sounding title ""Re-Engineering Cultures to Create a Sustainable Civilization"" [10] was more indicative of the article's culturally insensitive content -- I suspect I won't be the only reader to be turned off by the article's rather Spock-like argument for why we should give up our pets.III: Open in Case of Emergency [24-31]The author of the pet diatribe would have done well to heed the excellent article, ""Teaching for Turbulence"" [24], that kicks off this final section of the book --  specifically, its observation that ""a politics of guilt can never mobilize and inspire."" (@261) The article also has an excellent critique of the attitude that a catastrophe would be a welcome occasion to convince people to finally act (an attitude that is also trendy in Europe, particularly among French authors). Although the article was ostensibly aimed at university environmental studies and science (ESS) programs, its insights have much wider application. I thought it was easily one of the top 3 articles in the book.I was also pleasantly surprised by ""The Promises and Perils of Geoengineering"" [29], which was remarkably even-handed. An article about Cuba's ability to do more with less was also very stimulating [30], even if a reader is left with the suspicion that more discussion about civil rights under the current regime would have made for a more nuanced portrait of Cuba's sustainability.Unfortunately, this section of the book was a hotbed of articles that spoke of politics via the neoliberal notion of ""governance"": [25], [26], [32], [33]. ""Governance"" is a concept whose modern origin is in the management of private corporations; it's not a substitute for democracy or for politics, nor is ""deliberation"" a substitute for real power. (Canadian political scientist Alain Deneault has recently published a book criticizing ""governance"" from literally 50 different perspectives; I don't think it's yet come out in English, but if you can read French I recommend it: « Gouvernance: Le management totalitaire » (Québec: Lux 2013).)A chapter about community response to catastrophes [33] was marred for me by rather ignorant and offensive characterizations of Japanese culture and of the March 2011 events in Japan, where I live. For example, the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which to date has resulted in a handful of deaths, is likened to the ""annihilation"" of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (@370), while no mention at all is made of the roughly 20,000 people (if not 1.5x-2x as many, as some have estimated) who truly were annihilated by the tsunami. We are also told that Japanese culture ""rewards conformity and eschews challenges to authority,"" but no mention is made of the numerous anti-nuclear protests following the accident. (Moreover, when one considers Japan's whole history, rather than only the past 30 years, that comment is fantastically off base.)I had been looking forward to the concluding essay by science-fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson [34], whose Mars novels I enjoyed some years ago, but it didn't break the book's terminal string of strikeouts. Naïvely proposing that science can be a form of political action, and that ""scientizing"" economics can lead to sustainability, it is far below the level of sophistication of the rest of the book.CONCLUSIONDespite a number of good essays, at the end of the day the book does nothing to sharpen one's understanding of what sustainability is. In particular, it doesn't improve on current political and economic discourse, in which ""sustainability"" connotes continued growth done better ... somehow. The book does occasionally mention de-growth (i.e., opposition to continued economic growth, or at least to the prioritization of growth as a matter of policy), and no doubt the editors had good intentions by being so inclusive. But those mentions are a mixed blessing, or perhaps no blessing at all, when it comes to advancing the cause of de-growth. Better to distinguish it from sustainability more sharply, rather than to allow it to get sucked into a cloud of ambiguity by being presented as *a form* of sustainability.The copy I read was printed on coated paper, similar to what's often used in art books. This seems a gratuitous choice, since the book doesn't have any color illustrations, and as part of an annual series it will be superseded soon enough. That paper choice, though, adds significantly to the book's heft, and thus to the fuel expenditure needed to transport it -- a bit ironic, given the subject matter. And sorry to say, but the endnotes are devilishly poorly designed. They occupy more than 50 pages, but no guidance about pertinent chapters or text pages is given in the top margins. Worse, when the notes to one chapter end and those for the next begin, the title of the new chapter is presented in a lighter-colored font than that of the notes themselves. As a result, it's almost impossible to identify to what chapter any bunch of notes pertain, without continually losing time in annoying searches (unless, I suppose, you're fanatic about reading all chapters and every single footnote in sequence). Of course, this minor vexation shouldn't impact your decision about whether to read this book, a forest that doesn't quite hang together but that does contain some attractive trees.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8V0MQGZWGLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161091449X#wasThisHelpful","RE8V0MQGZWGLX","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short textbook can quickly give you a good picture of what the calculus of variations (CoV) is about. But it may be best for those who have already encountered the subject in another context (e.g. a physics course), rather than for learning it from scratch.I first heard of CoV in a classical mechanics course based on Goldstein in the '70s. While I got the gist of the specific application in that case, the idea of CoV always remained rather murky in my mind. With all due respect to the famous book by Lanczos, the only supplementary resource available back then, it was too long, wordy and philosophical to be attractive to a very average student like me. One of the great virtues of the present slim book is that it immediately gives you a very concrete understanding of the goals of CoV -- minus the metaphysical justifications for the topic that have clung to it since the times of Huygens and Maupertuis.Like the applied math textbooks of my college days, this book focuses on calculation, rather than proof. But also like them, applications are discussed only rarely, at best. E.g., Hamilton-Jacoby theory and most other applications to mechanics aren't discussed at all. The exposition also usually assumes a Cartesian coordinate system, and other aspects of the notation will seem quaint (or annoying) to many readers who started reading textbooks in the 1990s or later. Some topics often discussed in modern textbooks, such as ""second variation"" to discriminate between weak and strong extrema, actually are included here but without using the modern terminology. Other topics, such as the Pontryagin maximum principle, are outside the scope of the book, and in fact the word optimization barely or perhaps never appears.This 1961 book is also a good example of the clear Soviet pedagogy of a half century ago. However, the author takes it for granted that you will have a command over differential equations and analytical geometry typical for Soviet science and engineering students of the Space Age era -- which is a rather high bar to reach. There is also a bit of Cold War charm, as when the author announces that a certain equation ""is called the Ostrogradski equation, after the famous Russian mathematician M.B. Ostrogradski, who discovered it first in 1834. It is also *sometimes* known as the Euler-Lagrange equation."" (@50-51; my emphasis.)I should mention one important caveat, concerning the discussion of Lagrange multipliers in Chapter 4: the exposition of this topic is quite brief and bears little resemblance to US pedagogy from around the same time as this book, much less the way it's presented now. The one or two examples applying the technique are also quite sketchy. I think you would have to be a *very* gifted student to develop a command over this topic for the first time -- or simply to learn much about it at all -- from this book. (Economists, especially, take note.) All in all, though, a great and inexpensive guide for those perplexed about the big picture of CoV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FUV5IF6WU9QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486457990#wasThisHelpful","R3FUV5IF6WU9QR","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wisdom in the 1970s was that only a staunch anti-Communist like Nixon could ever have persuaded US anti-Communists to recognize Red China, and a few years later it took an ex-terrorist and an ex-general to make peace between Israel and Egypt. The premise of this book seems to be that only neoclassical economists could ever persuade other neoclassicals that GDP isn't an adequate measure of social well-being. Both the chattering and the political classes seem to have accepted this idea in recent years, but, to use a word of which Marc Fleurbaey and Didier Blanchot (F&B) are fond, this book demonstrates that proposition _rigorously_. Not everything else in the book is so convincing, however.1. This is not a book for the casual reader. If you read Tim Jackson's ""Prosperity without Growth"" or the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi report about alternative indicators (known in the US as ""Mismeasuring Our Lives""), be advised that most of this book is for a very different audience -- namely, those who aren't thrown for a loop by integral calculus and references to quasi-concave indifference curves. The Introduction declares that the book is accessible for undergrad economics majors and even those who simply have a year of calculus, but Chapter 2 pulls in Hamiltonians from dynamic optimization theory, which usually is a more advanced topic. I'd advise you to decline the authors' invitation to skip some chapters, unless you're already conversant with most of the sources in their bibliography -- I read it straight through, and found there were many references to the supposedly ""skippable"" chapters.  F&B do conclude each chapter with a summary in more straightforward prose, but this is both a blessing and a curse, as I will describe below, and might not justify the purchase of the book for readers impatient with a couple of hundred pages of mathematics. Finally, one more warning to fans of Tim Jackson or of ""de-growth"": please note that while this book criticizes the use of GDP as an indicator of well-being, it is *not* a critique of economic growth or even of GDP as an indicator of growth.The book is perhaps most effective when F&B show that orthodox economic theory doesn't support any purported connection between GDP and well-being (Chap. 3). This surprising result is probably 180 degrees opposite from most readers' assumptions about what the theory maintains, so the fact that it pops out from an argument based on neoclassical techniques and assumptions is especially powerful. There are also some very interesting negative critiques of composite indicators such as the Human Development Index (Chap. 1), of attempts to ""correct"" GDP by adding or subtracting certain categories of GDP-like data (Chaps. 2 and 3), and of politicians' current fad for subjective well-being a/k/a ""happiness"" data (Chap. 5). In that context, F&B make the interesting point that although economists analyze consumer purchases on the basis of maximization of ""utility,"" or ""satisfaction"" of preferences, such an analysis doesn't carry over well to life as a whole. People don't want just to feel satisfied in their lives, they want to obtain the actual things or circumstances that make them feel satisfied. (F&B cite Brian Barry's analogy that if a football fan merely wanted to *feel* satisfied per se, he would support whatever team was most likely to win, instead of wanting his favorite team actually to win (@171).) I'm not yet convinced that this principle applies as universally as F&B claim, but at least it was the first time I'd heard this piquant idea.2. Eventually, though, I found the book's grounding in mathematical models to be a two-edged sword. While the models might be effective for persuading people who spend their professional lives thinking about maximizations and complete transitive orderings, a reader not of the neoclassical faith might get frustrated that they're far removed from practical reality and seem designed to make simple things appear complicated. Once F&B get around to expressing their criticisms in plain English, they often turn out to be things that other critics have earlier noted without need of tortuous math. Such as that if you ask a lot of people to grade their overall happiness with their lives on a scale of 0 to 10, it's hard to compare their answers because not everyone might think of the scale in the same way (see @201-202). Or that if you try to put prices on the different dimensions of peoples' lives, it would be too simplistic to assume that all individuals would value each such dimension the same way (@114). Or that it's hard to assess sustainability ""without a prior consensus about what we want to sustain"" (@75). This aspect of the book reminded me of an article I read a few years ago (2003, to be exact) in Harvard Business Review, in which a couple of B-school profs suggested that you sell more stuff if you use the word ""SALE"" and end your prices in a '9' -- principles already known to retailers the world over for decades or centuries or millennia. Economists aside, are there really people who won't believe such evident points until they hear them from the mouths of Ph.D.s?3. F&B ultimately argue quite reasonably in favor of using several indicators, not just one. However, they urge that one of these should be based on ""equivalent income,"" sometimes called a ""money-metric utility function,"" for which they make an affirmative argument in Chapter 4. I didn't find this affirmative argument at all convincing, and in fact found parts of it disturbing.Here's the gist of the argument: One of the problems with ""utility"" is that it's psychological, and that it's therefore very difficult to compare from person to person, or to aggregate over many people. So consider a framework ""in which an individual _i_ consumes a bundle (x_i, y_i) made of market commodities x_i and other nonmarketed dimensions y_i (such as public goods and personal characteristics and functionings). The money-metric utility [a term that F&B use ""interchangeably"" with ""equivalent income,"" @120] is then equal to the expenditure in x_i needed to reach the utility level u_i(x_i, y_i) under a reference price vector ṕ and with reference ý. ... The equivalent income for _i_ is the level of income that, combined with reference parameters for the nonincome dimensions of life, would give _i_ the same satisfaction as the current situation. If _i_ is indifferent between his current situation and an income of 120 combined with the reference ṕ, ý, his equivalent income is 120."" (@120-121; I have had to modify some diacritical marks.) The idea being that it's easy to compare money to money, and to add it up.In simpler language, equivalent incomes are ""incomes leading to the same utility level as the one currently attained but for given reference values of nonmarket aspects -- health, leisure, social interactions, environment, and so on. This concept provides an indirect way to assess who is more or less advantaged in a society ... without requiring more than the choice of a reference bundle for the nontraded goods and some knowledge of how people are ready to trade these goods for monetary income, that is, only some information on elasticities of substitution of the kind we measure when we assess willingness-to-pay for certain nonmarket goods."" (@243). F&B then give a more concrete example, of two countries A and B, where the first has many natural amenities, while the second has a harsh environment but a population that engages in commerce a lot and so has higher incomes. Then ""[l]et us assume that the natural conditions of country A are taken as the reference. The approach consists in asking how much of their monetary income inhabitants of country B would be willing to abandon to benefit from the natural amenities of country A."" (@243-244.)F&B like this approach because it ""appears as the only possible methodology if one seeks a method of measurement of well-being that respects individual preferences while considering that there are certain situations of dominance in which comparisons can be made in terms of bundles"" (@158). In contrast to subjective well-being and the Sen-Nussbaum ""Capabilities Approach,"" it is neither ""inherently paternalist [n]or perfectionist"" (@245), being instead consistent with ""the classical principle, in welfare economics, of respecting preferences at the individual level"" (cf. @226).A key concept here is a procedure known as ""willingness-to-pay"" (WTP). This is often used by environmental economists to find out how much you'd pay to preserve rain forests or prevent pandas from becoming extinct, and health care economists to value a certain quality of life. One problem with F&B's reliance on WTP is that they don't specify how it would be possible to accumulate sufficient WTP data. Even worse, they never consider any criticisms of the probity of such data. WTP data are notoriously shaky when they are based on hypothetical choices (see, e.g. criticisms by authors such as Douglas Kysar, Frank Ackerman, Steven Kelman and other critics of cost-benefit analysis). As F&B themselves say (while criticizing happiness data in Chap. 5), ""people are not very good at predicting their future feelings"" (@165). Such data, even if they could be collected, seem unreliable right off the bat.A further complication is that F&B seem to be using WTP interchangeably with willingness-to-accept (WTA), i.e., how much money I would accept to *give up* something I enjoy now. For example, by choosing balmy country A as a reference, the problem posed to country B residents is WTP. But what if the question had been asked of Country A residents, using harsh country B as a reference? Presumably many of them would need to be paid to give up their current life, i.e. a WTA issue. In fact, most of F&B's definitions of equivalent income (@ 120-121 and @243, 1st full paragraph) are phrased in terms of WTA, not WTP: e.g. ""incomes leading to the same utility level **as the one currently attained** but for given reference values of nonmarket aspects"" (emphasis added). As Kysar and others have pointed out, there are major cognitive and ethical differences between WTP and WTA assessments -- with WTA assessments being notoriously less accurate, to boot. Nothing in this book suggests such difficulties.What is disturbing about this? It is the supposition that, as one of my creepier law school professors liked to smugly remind us, ""Every man has his price."" For everything. E.g., who is the ""reference spouse"" I'm supposed to judge my current one against, and how can I translate the difference into money? (Readers who are eager to get divorced might have a ready answer, but many others will not, I hope.) Suppose you have two children: how much would you have to get paid to give up one of them? Both of them? How much would I accept to give up having cats? How much would I accept to give up my personal characteristic or functioning of fluency in English? How much would I have to be paid to live in New York City again? (Finally, an easy question: no amount of money would be enough, period.)Capping this all off is a more technical problem: implicit in the reliability of the equivalent income method is that individuals must have transitively ordered preferences. This is the assumption that if I like X>Y and Y>Z, I must like X>Z and would never choose Z>X. However, while perhaps most individuals can say this about a few commodities (e.g., choices from among 3 ice cream flavors -- though some days even this can trip me up), this is certainly false for many people, and perhaps false for everyone, when a wider range of preferences are considered -- and especially preferences about those nonmarket aspects of life that F&B denote by y_i in several chapters of the book. For all of these reasons, F&B's optimistic confidence in ""WTP"" comes off as both inhuman and naive.4. To close, a bigger-picture comment: I found it troubling that, while indicators are supposed to guide political choices, there was no acknowledgement of the role of democratic politics or of collective interests in choosing policies. The problem of policy was assimilated to consumer choice, or to government hand-out -- see, e.g., where the ""situation of an individual"" is described by {(x(y,e), y, e| e ε E}, where y corresponds to ""history and nature (circumstances),""  e to ""the individual (personal responsibility), and x to ""social policy (via transfers)"" (Section 6.2.2). It's deemed a drawback that in the Capabilities Approach ""the weights for different functionings and capabilities have to be decided collectively by the concerned population rather than adjusted to every individual or subgroup of the population;"" this results from the wrong way of constructing interpersonal comparisons, whereas an ""understanding"" of the right way preserves individual diversity (@230-231).This point of view is indeed consistent with the ""classical"" view of neoclassical welfare economics - but the relegation of democratic deliberation to ""the selection of dimensions and the choice of weights"" for the indicator (@235) seems dangerously technocratic. Consider some of the big issues we face today: wars, climate change, immigration, social justice for minority groups -- are these all ""consumer choices"" for most citizens? As Kent Greenfield nicely puts it in a recent book (""The Myth of Choice""), should we allow big decisions about important things to be chopped up into little decisions about money? Is a discourse based on our own self-interested preferences really the best way to frame all of these issues? And should the expression of those preferences be the limit of our participation in deciding them? The vision of civic life that emerges from this book seems at times to be of a state in which citizens are merely consumers of state services, with a mandarin bureaucracy that runs public life by numbers after first finding out from us how much money we'd need to jettison the various things that matter most to us in our lives. (I'm caricaturing, but not wildly.)Despite the serious reservations described above, I have great respect for the obviously Herculean intellectual effort that went into making this book, for which reason I don't subtract more than a star. In addition, F&B have produced a work that is certainly more readable than most books that rely so heavily on mathematics. Hats off to OUP for including a full bibliography, though I wish they had also chosen an ink that would have been more impervious to the beads of water that fell off my iced coffees at the cafés where I read this. No doubt this will be a work of reference for technocrats and welfare economists; and a demanding but provocative read for the brave among the rest of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8236T6FOR3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019976719X#wasThisHelpful","R1K8236T6FOR3A","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I concur with the other reviews about the rambling story, the weak lead actor, the silly supporting characters, the intrusive musical score, and many other sins. And while the original Wall Street at least had a blue-collar hero we could root for, the characters we're supposed to empathize with  in this one are folks who get $1.4 million bonus checks or have $100 million stuffed away for them in Switzerland. But no less a disappointment for me was seeing how LITTLE the plot has to do with the actual financial crisis. It makes it appear as if 2008 financial system meltdown was about *equities* (the stock market). The actual financial crisis was about *derivatives* markets and credit liquidity -- but these concepts were obviously too difficult for Oliver Stone to understand. Moreover, the lead character, supposedly an expert on energy, is shown celebrating a little too early, because without question he's going to lose all the money he and the people he advised have invested in a technology that has *never* been on the brink of working, despite decades of development.  (BTW he still thinks it's a great bet even though the start-up takes only 6 months to burn through $100 million, and doesn't even have a working prototype: only in a fairy tale like this!!)

"According to Lynn Stout (LS), the ""homo economicus"" model -- the rational, calculating selfishness that is presented as a universal trait of human behavior in modern economics --  is anything but universal. While we may exhibit this sort of behavior some of the time or in certain contexts, e.g. when trading on the stock market, most of us are actually unselfish a great deal of the time. We don't drop garbage onto freshly-cleaned floors, we line up patiently for ice cream on a hot day, we usually obey the law and expect others to, as well.LS describes experiments with certain types of games, which show that this unselfishness is common across cultures. They also show that depending on the rules of the game, ""unselfish prosocial behavior"" can be encouraged or undermined. Financial incentives -- the favorite remedy of economists, and judges and lawyers who follow the ""law and economics"" school of thought -- can actually undermine unselfishness. She cites the famous example of the (Israeli) day-care center that decided to fine parents who were late to pick up their children: lateness was even more frequent than in the pre-fine regime, because parents' guilt was transformed into the feeling that they were paying a bit more for the convenience of showing up later. Certain aspects of American law take this unselfishness into account. For example, those who injure the person or property of others through negligence (an example of what's called a ""tort,"" in legalese) aren't expected to pay the full amount of the victim's damage, while those who seem to have been deliberately callous might have to pay far more than that amount, in punitive damages.The book makes many good points. The ""H. economicus"" model is certainly flawed. Usual law and economics scholarship does often come up with flawed or even perverse recommendations. Legislators and regulators ought to structure laws so that they don't undermine our tendency to be unselfish. And what I found to be maybe the simplest and most important point: we just don't notice enough about how nice people are most of the time. Bad behavior grabs our attention more, misleading us into believing it's more prevalent than it is. These points are presented in a very clear style that reads as smoothly as the work of a professional journalist, which is quite an achievement for a law professor.While I agreed with these big points, and also with some of LS's more specific recommendations (such as that companies not be treated the same as individuals under the law, since they more often exhibit selfish behavior than humans do), I was less persuaded, and sometimes confused or even troubled, by some of LS's supporting argumentation. Moreover, with its combination of utilitarianism, scientism and elitism, the book comes across more as a sort of heterodox Law and Economics, rather than a ""blistering attack"" on it, as a blurb would have it. The rest of this long review focuses on these reservations.1.  LS's use of the word ""conscience"" seems to be inconsistent throughout the book. After emphasizing that the distinction between acts and feelings is crucial (@12f), LS defines conscience as behavior: ""Emotions like pride, guilt, and irrational worry feel subjectively selfish. But the _behavior_ they inspire is not. However egoistic her motive, the person who sacrifices time or wealth to help or avoid hurting someone has acted, objectively, unselfishly. ... As a result, this book will define an act as unselfishly prosocial when it requires the actor to sacrifice time, money, or some other valuable resource to help, or to avoid harming, others. ... A principal theme of this book is that unselfish prosocial behavior -- conscience -- is a very real, very common, very powerful and very important phenomenon."" (@13-15; emphasis in original.)Often in the rest of the book, though, the text vacillates between speaking of conscience as behavior and conscience as feeling. E.g., LS speaks of ""the idea that most people have a conscience"" (@16), and faults scholars who don't consider ""how conscience might influence behavior"" (@36). And later:""To the regulator or policymaker, it doesn't matter if 'selfish' feelings prompt people to keep promises, follow rules and help others. What matters is that they _do_ keep promises, follow rules and help others -- even when they have little or no external incentive to do so. We don't need to fully understand the workings of conscience to study, and value, how it affects behavior."" (@55; emphasis in original.)And again: ""'[C]onscience' may be a form of cognitive error, a prosocial glitch in our thinking that prompts us to behave as if we expect to meet people again and as if we believe we are being observed ...."" (@135f.) If a person's conscience is *behavior,* it cannot be a cognitive error or ""prompt"" her to behave in a certain way.I'm surprised that none of the Princeton U. Press editors or peer reviewers caught this ambiguity about the most important word in the book.2.  Declaring psychological utility to be a ""crafty and common"" strategy of economists (@33), LS points out that ""[a]ny and all types of philanthropic, destructive, or downright bizarre behaviors ... becomes by definition self-interested. This circularity ... erodes the value of economics as a predictive tool. ... For economics to preserve its predictive power, we must assume people get utility primarily from improving their own material circumstances.""By excluding psychological pleasure or pain as motivators in economics, LS rejects more than 200 years of economic theory (dating back at least to the French utilitarian economist J.-B. Say). The early neoclassical economists, such as Léon Walras and Francis Edgewood, whom most would say *gave* economics its predictive power, were firmly in this psychological camp. They would agree that such behaviors can be self-interested; indeed, the Chicago School accounts of altruism, crime, etc. are based exactly on this sort of psychological pay-off.But does LS's revisionism actually improve the predictive ability of economics? According to her theory, there are times when people do act in a ""self-interested"" way, e.g. when shopping for cheap gasoline, and times when people act with a ""conscience."" Her theory still needs to account for how we can discriminate between the two regimes of behavior *predictively.* Moreover, by defining ""conscience"" as behavior, she doesn't offer any *explanation* of why people behave that way in the specific circumstance. Conscience becomes merely a descriptive term.Conventional utility theory is much more elegant, because it explains ALL our actions through the notion of utility. Sure, it too needs some criterion for predicting when we will be motivated by material benefits and when by psychological ones -- but this is no weaker than LS's own theory.  By having a unified explanation, instead of introducing an operational notion of conscience that is unexplained, conventional utility theory avoids dragging unnecessary entities into the theory, as Occam's Razor recommends. (NB: I'm not a fan of conventional utility theory. I'm simply pointing out that it isn't weaker than LS's theory when it comes to prediction, and in fact is superior in some formal ways.)I think what LS might be getting at is falsifiability, not predictability. Psychological utility theory isn't *falsifiable,* because it can justify any action ex post by the notion of ""well, you did it, so that means you really preferred to do it."" If that's really what she meant, I'd agree that this is indeed a ""crafty"" weakness of the theory, and one that can lead to evil applications of economic argument.3.  Evolutionary theory plays a strange role in this book. Several times LS speaks of observations of unselfish behavior ""finding support"" in evolutionary theory (e.g., @ 101, 146). Shouldn't it be the other way around -- that observations support a theory (or don't)?Chapter 6 of the book is a long, speculative proposal for how conscience evolved. It has falsifiability issues of its own, being in the vein of that somewhat plausible speculation you find in Polybius, Hobbes and Rousseau about how different forms of human organization were created. Another flaw of the explanation -- and an ironic echo of the fallacy of psychological utility theory -- is that it assumes that because a trait exists today, it's therefore adaptive or useful in some way. LS deals neither with the notion of evolutionary neutrality, nor with Stephen Jay Gould's idea of ""spandrels,"" characteristics that didn't originate through natural selection, though they may prove to be adaptive later.Overall, the true function of evolutionary explanation in the book seems to be a form of scientism: borrowing the prestige of science for rhetorical purposes, even when it isn't justified in terms of the science being invoked. LS provides more in this vein by frequent references to fMRI brain scans and the like (10, 112, 138, 241). Modern economics is guilty of scientism in spades, with mathematics and physics; but I'm not sure that retaliation with biology is an improvement. And LS's gambit creates some other explanatory problems, as I'll mention below.4. One explanatory problem is that LS ignores culture as a differentiator. Traits that evolve biologically and claimed as features of ""human nature"" should apply to all groups of people, and at all times on sufficiently short time scales (e.g., less than tens of thousands of years, for human evolution). So, in Chapter 7, LS points out that understanding conscience helps us to understand the US system of tort law (e.g., @174). What about tort law outside the US? What about US tort law at other times during the past 300 years? Should we credit human nature for the presence of certain features in current US law, if those features aren't shared by all legal systems that are near enough to ours in history?5.  Some important cultural features missing from the book are religion and deontological ethics. LS declares that we are all ""intuitive utilitarians"" (@115, 225). But does everyone always ""weigh benefits to others against costs to ourselves in choosing to act prosocially"" (@225)? Many people act because they *believe it is the right thing to do,* period. Far from being a ""cognitive error "" based on mistaken beliefs, some people might be nice to strangers because of a belief in karma, a belief that there is something divine in every human, or a reading of Kant, among other possible explanations.6.  On a more specific note: the book's analysis of contract law (Chapter 8) is far removed from actual business practice, being overly concerned with the roles of judges and lawsuits and the theories of professors. Based on my roughly 30 years' experience as a transactional lawyer, it sure doesn't seem to me that parties to contracts treat each other decently because of what judges say; most parties to contracts *don't have any idea* of what courts say, nor could they care less. The chapter also doesn't discuss the realities of unequal bargaining power, which affects people's choice of partner and constrains their subsequent behavior, and arbitration, which is on its way to making judges obsolete in contract disputes in the US.This lack of realism also impacts the book's broader arguments. LS faults ""behavioral economists"" for relaxing the assumption of rationality in economics while retaining the assumption of selfishness. But she herself retains the fiction that economics consists in transactions between strangers (see esp. her copious references to experimental gaming). In fact, much of economic life occurs between parties who know each other. We are still waiting for a theory of economics that takes this adequately into account.7.  Finally, a point that troubled me most: LS encourages readers to understand conscience as *instrumental*, a tool of control. She presents a ""model"" of conscience based on three ""variables"": instructions from authority, beliefs about other's prosocial behavior, and the magnitude of benefits to others (@99). Immediately afterwards, in a section entitled ""WHY THESE THREE SOCIAL VARIABLES?,"" LS notes ""[T]hese three variables are especially easy for lawmakers and policymakers to manipulate; that is, they offer especially good levers for shifting human behavior on a large scale."" (@100.)This emphasis on regulators and policymakers (who in the US are typically unelected officials in the Executive branch), as well the book's frequent references to ""lay"" people and terminology, reminded me uneasily of the elite ""Planners"" in Sunstein and Thaler's ""Nudge,"" an example of the behavioral economic analysis LS lambastes. There isn't any role for politics in this book, just as there wasn't in S&T's. Moreover laws are to be obeyed -- no role for civil disobedience or conscientious objection, either. Clearly, LS had many good and humane intentions when writing this book. But it is uncomfortable to see control as the central theme, and justice and democracy absent.In her closing pages, LS contrasts the beliefs of two early 20th Century US Supreme Court Justices, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis. Holmes believed that the law should assume that all men are bad, whereas Brandeis believed that ""no small part of the law's function is to make men good."" ""The scientific evidence supports Brandeis over Holmes,"" she declares. I don't read her book as supporting this conclusion at all. For more than 250 pages LS emphasizes that the scientific evidence is that men are *already* good, at least most of the time. What law can do, she points out, is to create incentives for men to be selfish and bad -- so policymakers and regulators should be careful not to undermine their goodness. I think that's a very important message. I only wish that the book's own arguments put it into clearer relief.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI05O9VFLV6GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691139954#wasThisHelpful","RI05O9VFLV6GY","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Ehrenfeld (JE) doesn't see ""sustainability"" as increased energy efficiency or ""green technology.""  Instead he sees it as ""flourishing[:] ... a metaphor that captures happiness, health, and the many characteristics of what humans believe is a good life. And it captures a sense of the health of the natural world"" (@22). He believes that the usual corporate tactics to promote sustainability, through sustainability scores for products, corporate social responsibility programs, etc., miss some essential points: (A) sustainability is a property of a whole interconnected system, not of a specific enterprise within it, and (B) it can't be reduced to a few quantitative dimensions. (Not all corporations have the wrong idea: he says some interesting things about a Patagonia ad campaign to encourage people not to buy the company's products if they don't really need them, and to buy them used rather than new, when possible (@122-123).) JE very elegantly and accurately characterizes the usual meaning of sustainability, deriving from the 1987 UN report, ""Our Common Future"" (a/k/a the Brundtland Report), as ""try[ing] to hold onto the world we have now by doing things better."" This means, among other things, continued economic growth. But, warns JE, such ""business as almost usual"" can't lead us forward to sustainability as flourishing. What we need is a ""shift"" in the ""dominant culture"" (@120), ""a shift in our view of ourselves first from one of Having to one of Being, and second from one of Needing to one of Caring"" (@83). This involves, among other things, changing our patterns of consumption, and abandoning economic growth as a goal.JE sometimes comes up with some very apt ""sound-bite"" formulations, such as the Brundtland report characterization above, or that ""[T]he prevailing belief that I am what I own stands firmly in the way of any sort of redistribution"" (sc. from rich nations to poorer ones, @72). He brings critiques of consumption down to earth when he notes tersely that ""Consumption is an essential part of life. Amoebas consume. All life consumes.""(Id.) But the frequency of such verbal nuggets, and of practical illustrations, tapers out a bit toward the end of the book, where the the level of the discussion tends to be quite philosophical and general. I concede, though, that maybe one reason the book takes that turn is to provide a salutary shock to some readers, by demonstrating that an MIT engineer who advises businesses can nonetheless consider philosophy to be very important.I found myself in agreement with JE far more often than not. But I confess he began to lose me when he emphasized the contributions of Martin Heidegger to his view, including crediting Heidegger as the pioneer of bringing Caring into philosophy (@89). Heidegger joined the Nazi Party in 1933, remained a member throughout the Second World War, never expressed regret for his involvement, and indeed was still writing in an ultra-nationalistic, Nazi-era rhetorical style more than decade after the war ended. To be fair, the work of Heidegger on which JE relies, ""Being and Time,"" was written in the late 1920s, and JE mentions that he himself is Jewish and that Heidegger is ""controversial."" Nonetheless, it was a bit discomfiting to read his paraphrase of Heidegger to the effect that ""who we are ... is determined by the culture we live in. ... Each human being becomes whoever they are by learning from and existing within a culture that embodies and endows that human being with the knowledge of the world that it takes to live effectively. To me [i.e., JE], that is getting to the essence of sustainability-as-flourishing."" (@26.) Decontextualized from the rest of Heidegger's life perhaps this can sound benign or insightful, but it's hard to forget that Heidegger clearly believed that one particular culture was superior to all others. There is a faint from-the-sublime-to-the-ridiculous echo of the Heidegger/""Caring"" dissonance when JE elsewhere describes ""fishing as love"" (@8). JE always releases (at least some of) the fish he catches -- but instead of painfully hooking them, pulling them out of the water and suffocating them for a while, and then tossing them back in wounded and terrified, wouldn't it be at least as loving simply to leave the fish alone? Or does the lovingness consist in helping the fish experience the ""authenticity [that] springs from anxiety in the face of death,"" another paraphrase from Heidegger (@95)?There was one point that troubled me even more, however:  the discussion of the title word itself. Andrew Hoffman, JE's interlocutor and former student, characterizes the word 'flourishing' as ""unusual"" in his introduction (@6), and later asks JE ""Where did you get the word, flourishing?"" JE replies it ""just kind of came up. ... It popped up first during an exercise at a personal training session where I was asked to express an important personal vision."" (@22.) And a few pages later he refers to the ideas of ""Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen [who] argues that well-being (or flourishing, as I write) requires the availability of a set of basic capabilities ... ."" (@32.)I don't for a moment doubt JE's sincerity that he independently lit upon the word in the way he described. But to say ""as I write,"" while discussing Sen, of all people? The capabilities approach to well-being has been based on a notion that's been called ""human flourishing"" since at least the 1980s. As developed by Sen and philosopher Martha Nussbaum, it's *far* more prominent in social science than are JE's ideas, with all due respect. Moreover, the word was picked as a translation of the ancient Greek word ""eudaimonia,"" which (along with related grammatical forms) was used by many authors to connote a true happiness -- most prominently by Aristotle, whose sense of the word in his Nicomachean Ethics is the one Sen and Nussbaum follow. Neither Aristotle, nor Nussbaum, nor the widespread use of ""flourishing"" in the literature on well-being are mentioned in this book. (JE's 2009 ""Sustainability by Design,"" which also talks about flourishing quite a bit, omits both Sen and Nussbaum, and discusses Aristotle's Nic.Eth. without mentioning eudaimonia at all.)  If JE's nuance is to include all of nature, and not just humans, under the term ""flourishing,"" then the book could simply say so, while acknowledging the earlier use of the term.  At best, this book's origin story about ""flourishing"" is symptomatic of the way it overemphasizes the uniqueness of JE's thought, without seeming fully aware of just how much work has been done by others along the same lines (namely, lots more than is suggested by JE's passing references to Herman Daly, Tim Jackson, Juliet Schor and Richard Heinberg).Some of this lack of historical perspective might be related to the book's being published under Stanford U. Press's business book imprint. I also suppose it was the SUP editor, or lack of same, who failed to catch that Adam Smith's ideas weren't ""put forward ... nearly four hundred years ago"" (@41), but less than 250 years ago.  In sum: JE seems like a very interesting person with whom to have a conversation. He makes many well-aimed remarks about why sustainability as currently practiced is useless and hypocritical, especially in the earlier chapters. But the high level of generality in the latter half of the book makes it seem targeted more to MBAs who aren't used to thinking about the big picture, than to readers who are looking for a practical vision of how to get off the unsustainable path we're stuck on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3ZXXKPEWHU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804784159#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3ZXXKPEWHU1","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is mainly a book about the film production business in Italy during the 1950s and 1960s and, to some extent, about the Hollywood business of the same era. While some of Ms. Loren's most die-hard fans might consider this essential reading, she's present in this book simply to provide a case study of how producers ""moulded"" stars. Having worked as a lawyer on entertainment deals from time to time, I enjoyed the emphasis on contract provisions and producers' tactics, and didn't mind that SL herself was cast in more of a supporting role; but you might feel differently.After an introductory chapter, the book focuses successively on SL's professional relationships with producer (and husband) Carlo Ponti, with Hollywood generally, with director and co-star Vittorio Di Sica, and co-star Marcello Mastroianni. Only the business and on-screen aspects of the relationships matter here: e.g., legal difficulties surrounding the Pontis' marriage are discussed only from the standpoint of the publicity this generated for SL and how it affected her perceived status as a star in Europe and the US. Most films discussed are from before 1965. Even the 1977 Loren-Mastroianni-Ponti drama released in the US as ""A Special Day,"" which was nominated for the Best Actor and Best Foreign Film Oscars and which won numerous other awards (including for SL), is mentioned only once in passing, as a ""melodrama"" (@89).The author (PS) did a great deal of research in both private and Italian state archives, and turned up a lot of interesting material about contracts, European movie magazines, and fund-raising methods, among other things. For example, some famous comedies that were actually directed by Di Sica were credited to other directors, because of the fear that crediting Di Sica in that capacity would create expectations of a more serious type of film. Also, contracts for stars like SL and Gina Lollabrigida expressly allowed them to contribute ideas to the script. However, PS often can also be frustratingly opaque when presenting these fruits of her labors. Monetary amounts are stated in Italian lire, without any contemporary or present-day equivalents to US dollars or even sterling (PS teaches in England). When discussing films released in both Italy and the US, she includes a table captioned ""Separate and Combined box office returns,"" but we're not given that information at all; instead there's a column called ""Box office position,"" for Italy only. PS shares some of the typical concerns of cultural studies, such as gender-related issues, ""subversion"" of stereotypes, etc., but fortunately she usually steers clear of the worst jargon. Occasionally, though, some does creep in, e.g., her references to ""the diegetic"" (@33; I suspect ""narrative"" would have done nicely there).The most frustrating feature of the book is the dearth of pictures. Sequences from films are analyzed in detail without any photos, or occasionally (in the case of ""Two Women"") a single photo that appears in a different chapter. SL's appearances in photo- and cine-romances of the 1950s are discussed extensively, but not a single example is shown. A ""case study"" in chapter 3 that claims to analyze three photos shows us only two of them. Many other photos and movie scenes, too, are described in passing but missing in action. The cumulative effect of this was quite annoying. And while I at least could dredge up a vague memory of several of the Italian movies described, having seen them about 20 years ago at a film festival at UCLA, I can't imagine how irritating this book might be for someone who only knows SL's Hollywood or post-'60s work. There should have been at least twice as many photos as the book contains, and perhaps even a few more than that.The book is produced in a wide-page format featuring a small, sans-serif font, resulting in long horizontal lines of type that are unpleasant to read. Given the relative lack of illustrations, it's hard to understand why this format was chosen. The copy editing, if any, is subpar: the reader has to puzzle out the meaning of sentences like ""The participation of Ponti and Girosi ... did little to halt Loren's struggling fortunes"" (@47) -- little to halt the struggling, or to halt her fortunes altogether? And who is Girosi? If you missed the one other mention of him a couple of pages back, you won't find any index to help you. If you're familiar with Italian comedies of the 1950s and are interested in the business side of the European film industry, the book is worth a read; otherwise, prepare to be less than fully satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U995KIHH3I8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841502340#wasThisHelpful","R1U995KIHH3I8F","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite its title, this book isn't some sort of anarchist tract. Abner Greene (AG) is arguing against some very specific obligations, namely (i) an obligation always to obey the law, regardless of its content, (ii) an obligation always to respect the past in the juristic sense, including respecting the ""original meaning"" of the Constitution and respecting judicial precedent, and (iii) an obligation always to respect the US Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution. (Philosophers give the name ""political obligation"" to obligations like (i), and AG gives the name ""interpretive obligation"" to (ii) and (iii).) Even if we take these only as prima facie obligations, i.e. being subject to override in particular circumstances, AG argues that they don't exist. I've recently posted a lengthy review of this book on a law blog called Concurring Opinions, so here I'll just mention a few main points.I thought the most successful part of the book was Chapter 4, dealing with (iii). AG lays out the circumstances in which public officials -- including the President, Congress, lower court Federal judges, and even state and local officials -- ought to feel comfortable about acting on their own interpretations of the Constitution, even if the Supreme Court has said that it means something else. Many of its arguments were new to me. Chapter 3, about why even the Supreme Court shouldn't get hung up on originalism or even on following its own precedent (issue (ii)) was also quite good for an American audience, though I don't expect a majority of the Justices will follow AG's advice anytime soon. Note that AG doesn't argue that precedent should always be ignored: rather, he argues that it should be merely one influence among others on a judicial opinion. Similarly, in the context of (iii), the Supreme Court's interpretations might raise good points that public officials should consider; the point is that they don't have a duty always to follow those interpretations just because they emanated from the Court.Political obligation has been controversial for a long time, and while AG isn't the first to deny its existence, his Chapter 1 provides a very densely-argued rebuttal to the best-known theories by British and American writers. This chapter is written at a relatively high level of abstraction, and (along with the Introduction) may be tough going for some readers. Chapter 2 provides a sort of affirmative argument for why the State should recognize that its jurisdiction is ""permeable -- full of holes."" On this basis, the State should sometimes grant exemptions to, e.g., religious groups so that they can live ""by themselves,"" as long as they ""abide by constitutional rules."" I thought this chapter was quite problematic, for reasons discussed in depth in the Concurring Opinions review.Just as the title might mislead you about the scope of book's arguments, so might the subtitle: ""The Multiple Sources of Authority in a Liberal Democracy"". The book's arguments are really focused on the US case only, not on liberal democracies generally, or else will be most persuasive to scholars who share certain American philosophical tastes. For example, the UK is a liberal democracy, but lacks judicial review of Parliamentary legislation, so all or most of Chapter 4 wouldn't apply. France and Germany are liberal democracies, but don't regard judicial precedent as binding in the way we do in the US. A reader familiar with a civil law system like those countries' will wonder what's the big deal about most of Chapter 3. AG's discussion in Chapter 1 assumes away much of the problematic of political obligation by explicitly assuming that law and morality are distinct; some Continental thinkers devote much more analysis to this problem, even if they share AG's skepticism about political obligation. And Chapter 2 is based almost entirely on the religion clauses of the First Amendment -- though ironically, German constitutional jurisprudence sometimes reaches similar results to those urged by AG, and might have made his argument more persuasive. Unfortunately, AG doesn't refer to any Continental sources since the 18th Century, and doesn't refer to any non-US court cases at all. To be fair: AG does at times make it clear that he's speaking only about the US case, especially in later chapters; and as for those portions of his argument where he speaks in a confusingly general or universal tone, he's in plentiful company. Many Anglophone legal philosophers, including Ronald Dworkin, are very unclear about the geographical scope of their comments, which often apply to the US (or at most, common law jurisdictions) alone.AG's style is dense and serious, but free from the critical studies jargon and vagueness currently fashionable in some parts of the legal academy. I was cheered to see that the book has both endnotes and a full bibliography. A book to contend with if you're interested in the philosophy of American constitutionalism, but perhaps less useful if your interests are more in comparative law or politics, or in political or legal philosophy more broadly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IX9VHWZ37N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674064410#wasThisHelpful","R13IX9VHWZ37N6","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't presume to add to the erudite commentary on this page about the substance of Schoenberg's music. The performances are good, and I rather liked the fragmentary 3 Pieces (1910), which are less than 60 seconds each. However, I felt that this CD, based on ""super bit mapping"" remastering of a 1982 analog recording, may suffer from some artifacts of the digitization process. The sound is unnaturally hyper-clear, and becomes uncomfortable in the higher frequencies. Overall the recording is weak in the bass. This is especially disappointing for Verklärte Nacht, but not only; the piano part in the Suite suffers too, and some portions of the 3 Pieces, such as the low pedal that opens the third one, may be inaudible unless you pump up the volume quite a bit. I'm not sure whether these bass problems stem from the digitization or from the analog original, but whatever their cause they're a drag for the listener.

"There's no question that this work is a tremendously valuable reference for English-speaking scholars interested in the working of Japan's Supreme Court. Employing a variety of quantitative and qualitative research methods, it's based not only on Court decisions and other published sources but on Prof. Itoh's interviews with many Justices and his research into the details of their social backgrounds. It's especially valuable for its wealth of detailed information about the inner workings of the Court. The stand-out in this regard is the discussion of research judges, who fill the ecological niche occupied in the US by Supreme Court clerks while wielding a great deal more power than their younger American counterparts; they not infrequently become justices themselves.The book's general thesis is that the Court's conservatism, marked especially by its reluctance to deem any action of the executive or legislature unconstitutional, isn't the result of ""subservience"" to the political party in power, but rather stems from the nature of the institution and of the social and professional background of the justices. Prof. Itoh claims that the Court's attitude and actions exemplify ""benign elite democracy"" -- government by a self-interested elite ""many of [whose members] are not only self-centered but public-regarding"" (@277). (I found his evidence for non-subservience more convincing than that for benignity, but I'll expand more about that in a couple of minutes.)While Prof. Itoh does highlight a few conscientious and intellectually rigorous justices, he minces no words in describing how some of the others either lacked the imagination and courage to speak up for themselves, or else relied on what they deemed to be their own superior intuition to make quick judgments without logical reasoning and thoughtful reading of precedents and statutes. By the middle of the book I was thinking of the late US Senator Roman Hruska's (R-S.D.) defense of G. Harrold Carswell, a Nixon nominee to the Supreme Court who was attacked in 1970 as ""mediocre"": ""Even if he were mediocre,"" the Senator said, ""there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a little chance? We can't have all Brandeises, Frankfurters and Cardozos."" From Prof. Itoh's account, I got the feeling that the Japanese government has unwittingly taken this to heart in spades, notwithstanding that its judges tend to think themselves better than most people. It's a virtue of his presentation that this book is deeply depressing to a reader who cares about improving the quality of law and politics in Japan.I did have a number of reservations about the book, however. To use a legal metaphor, some of these are more ""procedural"" and some are more substantive.The procedural ones relate to the timeframes covered and to the style of presentation itself, both of which reduce the book's ease of use as a reference. Despite the book's having been published in 2010, and mentioning the 2009 power shift (now reversed) from the Liberal Democratic Party to the Democratic Party of Japan, the period from the 1980s to the present receives relatively little attention. Prof. Itoh seems most comfortable talking about the period from 1947-1980 or so. Chapter 3 is an extended case study of the Osaka airport litigation, which was concentrated in the 1960s and '70s. Even an interesting statistical chart about the disposition of constitutional cases (@264) is truncated at 1999. This is a disappointment to one who wants to understand the Court's role in contemporary Japan, especially because Prof. Itoh does remark that the Court is much more conservative nowadays, and the older ways don't necessarily apply.As for style, Prof. Itoh often illustrates his points with numerous 1- or 2-sentence narratives about various Supreme Court justices. However, he doesn't identify the dates of the incidents he mentions, and rarely supplies details to make even the decade apparent. Here's an example, excerpted from a single paragraph:""Becoming a career judge was not the first choice for some justices. ... Kishigami failed entrance tests to join private companies in a very tight economic market. Although he passed a civil service test as something to fall back on, he did not have a strong desire to become a judge. ... Taniguchi wanted to major in economics at a university in order to find a good job in business .... Sekine wanted a job that would give him independence without relying on anyone else for a living ... Kurimoto wanted to go into law while at senior high school, but unlike Okahara Kurimoto did not think himself suited to becoming a prosecutor...,"" etc. (@231-232).Appendix 2 to the book does include a list of all 150 or so justices who served since 1947, but this list is chronological, not alphabetical, so it's quite time-consuming to search for each justice named. (Moreover, for some reason this appendix lacks page numbers.) The index not only omits references to Appendix 2, but also lacks entries for even the most-discussed justices in the book. As a result, it's tough work to figure out which of these many anecdotes relate to the Court in the 21st Century. It doesn't help that the vast majority of the justices are rather bland and faceless -- one justice is even quoted as remarking that there haven't been any members of the Court worth writing a biography about.As for substance, the first thing to note is that this isn't a truly comparative work. Although Prof. Itoh occasionally makes remarks about the US or France or about civil law jurisdictions generally, he provides relatively little detailed comparison. As a result, some of his generalizations seem overbroad, such as when he attributes the Japanese justices' reluctance to rule statutes unconstitutional to their background in civilian -- and especially German -- jurisprudence. It would have been interesting to consider, then, why the German Constitutional Court has found hundreds of statutes and administrative actions to be unconstitutional (a fact unmentioned in this book). Similarly, while the Japanese justices wrung their hands over the fact that Japan's constitution doesn't describe what's supposed to happen when they declare a statute unconstitutional, Germany's Basic Law doesn't make this explicit, either -- so why do the latter's justices apparently have less Angst?Another substantive limitation is that this book focuses on politics without sufficiently explaining the legal background. For example, the Court rarely sits in a Grand Bench of all 15 justices, and instead usually sits in three Petty Benches of 5 justices each (though since the Chief Justice doesn't attend the one to which he is assigned, one Petty Bench sits with 4 members present). From a casual remark, I got the impression that decisions of one Petty Bench don't bind other Petty Benches, but the details of stare decisis in Japan are never spelled out in the book. This point of law, though, also has a political impact, so it would have been nice to be able to understand it better.Finally, the usages of some words gave me pause (speaking as an American lawyer). Prof. Itoh refers to ""judicial"" conservatism or liberalism when he actually speaks of those attributes in a political, social or economic context (with the last of these adding another twist of ambiguity to ""liberal""). He speaks of judicial ""self-restraint"" even in cases when the Court modifies its policies or precedents in order to avoid conflict with the executive. The meanings ascribed to the words are explained in the text, but still it's hard not to read them with a different spin.One needn't be a lawyer, though, to find the use of the word ""benign"" to be question-begging: does this relate to the *intentions* of the elites, or to the *impact* of their actions? Unfortunately, Prof. Itoh never interrogates this point, and leaves with the reader with the impression that he feels it relates to both. Yet much of the book is a narrative of intellectual cowardice, arrogance, and rationalizations for inaction, as when the Court yields to laws as the ""voice of the people"" even when passed by Diets that the same Court has declared were elected in serious violation of the constitutional principle of one person, one vote. Moreover, the trend in recent decades has been toward conservative judgments by a judiciary that has institutionally locked in a trend to select conservative elites as its members. One ought to wonder if the benign characterization is really justified in this context. In sum: a necessary reference in this field if you aren't proficient with Japanese legal materials, even if you differ with some of the author's views; but not necessarily a convenient reference to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN9BA50LOKIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=075467603X#wasThisHelpful","R3UN9BA50LOKIA","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of this volume (SG) succeeds wonderfully in packing a lot of valuable substance into a slightly shorter-than-average ""very short introduction"" (only 104 pages of text). Most of the book focuses on some common misconceptions about the nature of objectivity, while the final three chapters consider the relationship of objectivity to the social sciences, ethics and aesthetics.Starting from Plato's notion of knowledge as ""justified true belief,"" SG makes the point that objectivity pertains to justification, not to truth. And while many people believe objectivity to consist in the absence of judgments, SG emphasizes that in fact it exists solely as a *property* of judgments. My own background is in physics, law and business, and in all three of those fields there are people prone to be confused on these points (including myself, from time to time). Many scientists and engineers, as well as plenty of other people, tend to believe that objectivity relates to truth, and that the methods of science are the unique path to truth; for many, too, the phrase ""objective reality"" seems like a natural idea. On the other hand, many lawyers believe (or behave as if they believe) that all truth is relative. And too many in business believe that truth is to be found in numbers and measurements. All such folks could profit from reading this book. I learned a lot.My one quibble was with SG's praise of decision theory as an ""inestimable help"" for dealing with ethical issues, ""offer[ing] a simple way for calculating the 'utility' of any particular action"" (@76-78). Here SG implicitly assumes that a utilitarian ethical position is the most helpful one in a given situation. He also ignores that estimating each of the necessary inputs for decision theory -- the utility of an action or outcome and the probability of its occurrence -- is usually anything but simple. (The question of whether there even exist probabilities for the outcomes of certain common types of decisions is a topic that itself could fill a chapter of a VSI, at least.)  But this is a minor lapse, and a few pages later SG is more even-handed about deontology and utilitarianism, in his chapter on ethics per se.The book is written in the traditional lucid style of British analytic philosophy: while the words and sentences are relatively simple, they contain much to think about. The book's roots in the analytic tradition are also a limitation: I'd have liked also to have seen some discussion of Continental thought on objectivity, e.g. from the phenomenological tradition. Nonetheless, one of the best entries in the VSI series that I've read to date: truly a very short introduction, but not at all a superficial one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCBZIGBU50IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199606692#wasThisHelpful","R1FCBZIGBU50IC","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book presents an interesting thesis: that the American faith in unlimited economic growth is based on a centuries-old Western modernity myth -- namely, the belief that man can make an exodus from a traditional world based on time and history, into a ""timeless"", ever-young paradisiacal world. According to the author (DWN), this is a false faith, because economic growth is limited by the limited physical resources of the real world - the one based on time and history. The second, timeless world doesn't exist. Some branches of the academy, he says, especially in the sciences, rediscovered this ""one-world"" view during the 20th Century, while neoclassical economics remains the epitome of an academic discipline championing the two-world view. Meanwhile, the humanities seem to carry on in willful ignorance of these science-based issues, despite the fact that they're already having an impact on our lives. DWN writes from the point of view of a participant during the past 60 years' evolution of academic American historical and cultural studies. He says that he wrote the book ""in the hope that I can persuade a few of a few of my colleagues in the humanities to participate in replacing the modern metaphor of two worlds with the new but traditional metaphor of one world.""Prior to reading the book, I was already in agreement that perpetual economic growth is neither viable nor desirable, so I can't say the book brought me around to that view. The ""two-worlds"" theme was new to me, though, and I found DWN's explanation of how it wound its way through American historiography especially interesting. I also very much enjoyed his comparison of Thomas Friedman's ""The World Is Flat"" to Frederick Jackson Turner's hollow ""frontier thesis"" of American history (Chap. 6), though I think DWN overestimates how much Friedman subsequently changed his views (see below). I should mention though, that I came to the book pretty familiar with many of the folks named in the economics, ecology and final chapters and even, thanks to a terrific A.P. American History course long, long ago, having heard of about 50% of the historians DWN discusses. If your background is less wonkish, you might find it tough sledding.I did have some reservations about the exposition, three big ones in particular. First, much of the book surveys scholarship in history, economics, literary criticism, and ecology by describing various authors' views seriatim. Notwithstanding my prior exposure to many of the authors discussed, it was sometimes difficult for me to follow the thread of the two-worlds theme during these detailed catalogues of commentary. A little more synthesis so that the reader could know where he or she is would have been helpful. Second, many of DWN's arguments rely on rather broad generalizations, often attributing agency to various ""bourgeois"" groups, ""middle-class Greek men,"" and the like, ""waving [their] magic bourgeois wand[s]"" (@28). I'm old enough to remember the '60s and '70s, when such rhetoric was everywhere on university campuses, and I couldn't help feeling that leaning on it now was a little too facile. Nor am I sure about in what sense Plato, for one, was a ""middle-class Greek,"" or whether that class would be in any way comparable to the ""middle class"" of other times and places.And third, once we've left Plato behind, the book's focus is very, very American. DWN will occasionally mention that some school of thought or belief was ""transnational,"" but doesn't give any examples. This is a pity, because there have been numerous European authors, esp. Francophone, putting forward very sophisticated critiques of economic growth ever since the 1960s. I don't mean the usual suspects so loved by American academics (Foucault, Latour, Baudrillard, Lyotard, et al., who all do make an appearance in this book), but people like Cornelius Castoriadis, Peter Kende, and especially André Gorz, to say nothing of more recent authors one can find in the journals ENTROPIA and La Décroissance. Gorz's notion of ""écologie politique"" is just the sort of synthesis of ecology and political/economic critique whose absence DWN laments. DWN also overlooks the work of Gorz's more famous friend, Ivan Illich, who wrote in English and came down hard on growth in his classic ""Tools for Conviviality"" (1973). For that matter, Brit Tim Jackson's ""Prosperity without growth?"" (first released in 2009) is missing, too. As a result, it's hard to share DWN's excitement over statements like ""And then in 2010 Kenneth Sayre [in his book ""Unearthed: The Economic Roots of Our Environmental Crisis""] had denounced growth economics as immoral"" (@85) given that this denunciation had been going on more or less continuously during the last 30 or 40 years -- just not always emanating from Americans.Smaller stuff: DWN seems to believe (@158f) that Thomas Friedman had seen the light about a limited earth in his ""Hot, Flat and Crowded"" (2008), but actually Friedman is still optimistic in that book about growth -- ""green growth."" DWN also mentions Einstein's relativity theory and modern quantum theory as evidence of science's return to a historical sense of time (""Nature is timeful; nature has a history"" (@124)), but these theories can also support the opposite proposition. In fact the notion of ""particles were disappearing; other particles were appearing"" (@125) often is accounted for by a mathematical trick known as ""time reversal"" (e.g. in Feynman's view of quantum electrodynamics). Physics-based discourse about the arrow of time, unmentioned by DWN but more pertinent to his thesis, comes from statistical mechanics; DWN cites Ilya Prigogine, whose ideas are indeed relevant, but Prigogine was wrestling with the problem that the arrow of time *doesn't* pop out from quantum theory. This book also takes at face value Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's suggestion that economic activity ""is permanently limited by a finite amount of concentrated energy that can be used to drive machines and automobiles"" (@132); but NG-R's physics arguments were mistaken, for reasons described in, among other places, the comment thread to my Amazon review of his ""Entropy Law and the Economic Process"". Finally, many of DWN's footnotes cite to entire books, often several at a time, without page cites. This is quite frustrating to a reader, especially when the arguments the cites are claimed to support are quite sweeping.In sum, this book isn't exactly a focused argument against economic growth directed to a general reader. But when it comes to convincing humanities scholars to adjust their world-view in light of our current environmental straits, I think it has a shot, and I hope it succeeds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210YKKR4V2DYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816680590#wasThisHelpful","R210YKKR4V2DYC","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This commentary is more directed to professional classicists than to readers like me, who studied the language for a few years in college and have allowed it to grow rusty. Plautus's Latin is quite entertaining and attractive, but full of forms one doesn't encounter in the usual Golden Age prose authors or poets. The present book, an outgrowth of the author's Ph.D. thesis, assumes you're already familiar with all of those non-Classical grammatical forms. Its learned connections to other classical literature, describing the staging of the play, etc., are often interesting, but may frustrate the reader whose top priority is to figure out what the heck the Latin is saying. Prosody is noted in an unusual notation (explained in the introduction) that will puzzle most readers who have just an undergrad background, and perhaps others as well. The earlier reviewer on this page may be right to deem Christenson's main intention to be to help with construction of the Latin -- but he obviously is a much more proficient and professional reader than I. If you're simply an amateur like me, you might want to spring first for Ann Mahoney's commentary in the Focus Classical Commentaries series. It has grammatical notes in simple Latin facing the text, conventional prosody notation, and the convenience of a complete vocabulary of the play at the end. (Mahoney's text also includes the 15th Century supplement in Plautine style that attempts to fill in some scenes near the end of the play missing from the surviving MSs.)That said, this commentary is a useful supplement to Mahoney's, not only for its background about many literary and historical aspects of the play, but occasionally even for some basic help in understanding the meaning of a line -- truth be told, it's far more detailed. As for the quality of Christenson's philological and critical judgments, I'm not able to judge; but I was more interested to read them once I wasn't so desperate to make sure I'd understood the text. In sum: might be excellent for scholars, but for your first approach to Plautus this will serve better as your second commentary. In that capacity, though, it's very helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VOI7NVEIHVQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521459974#wasThisHelpful","R2VOI7NVEIHVQY","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent, must-buy reference book for beginners in Japanese, and even for intermediate speakers who don't mind dealing with romaji instead of kana script. Its organization of verbs is especially sensible, and it's both easier to use and more cost-effective than most of the zillions of language reference books from Japanese publishers like Kodansha International.However, if you own an earlier edition of the book, rest assured that there's NO NEED to buy this ""3rd edition."" I already owned a copy of the 1995 first edition, and figured the passage of 15 years and (apparently) 2 revisions was a good reason to spring for this one, but I could have saved my money. As far as I can see, there isn't ANY new content in the Grammar and Common Expressions sections (the first 125 pages out of 142) since the first edition. The Vocabulary section and an Appendix on writing systems have been modified slightly, but not necessarily usefully. There's about 4 pages of new material explaining some ultra-basic concepts about kanji (origin as pictographs, what radicals are, etc.), but you'd get that plus more when you buy any reference or instructional book about kanji, which you will need to do anyway. Some vocabulary sections have been rearranged, and formerly separate categories like ""Insects"" and ""Post Office"" have been merged into others (""Animals"" and ""The City"", respectively).  OTOH, while the vocabulary list still has an entry for ""telegraph"", it has *zero* about the Internet or mobile phones. The most conspicuous changes are a new publisher and an uglier cover -- and higher price, naturally. This is too bad and a missed opportunity: a kana edition would have been a great update for learners who want to keep their brains a bit more engaged with the language while they look stuff up.

"Like lots of people, I watched every season of ""Lost"" and felt let down by the finale; it turned everything that preceded it into trivial fluff. Despite all those years of watching, I rarely think about the show since then. This book was a similar experience. Not that the ending per se was a cop-out -- it was more a similarity in aftertaste. Mostly, it's quite suspenseful and moves along well; one or two stories even have a sense of humor. But by the time I got close to the end, I felt it was more like candy than something nourishing. After I finished it, I immediately chose a new book in which to immerse myself -- unlike some novels that I savor for one or two days, or even for several.There's no question that Mitchell has narrative talent. Even the central narrative set in the post-""Fall"" Hawai'i held my interest, once I got accustomed to the dialect. All the stories have a theme of some person or group abusing his or its power over the main character, and often over others too. Eventually this aspect of the book kind of hits you over the head, and the targets of Mitchell's indignation are pretty predictable: racists/colonialists, capitalists, sadists and the simply greedy. Still, rooting for the good guys is often part of the fun of a novel, and in several storylines Mitchell doesn't deny us that pleasure. Some other conspicuous connections between stories were more contrived: character T's story reappears in movie form in character S's, A's journal shows up about 80 years later as a published book in character R's, etc.; and there is a recurring birthmark. (It looks like the movie is going to make even more interconnections than in the original novel, thanks to its casting choices and, judging by the trailer, added dialogue that will make the story ""easier"" and more obvious -- but at least some of those connections will confuse the narrative, not deepen it.)There were also a few minor details that really broke the spell of some stories. Mitchell's biography says he had lived several years in Japan; nonetheless, he managed to come up with a racist distortion of Shinto religion in his ""Jacob Zoet"" novel. In this one too, his quasi-realism is a bit too quasi-. Some Englishmen refer to themselves as ""Aryans"" in the 1850s, when it wasn't until the 1860s that this meme had its first use in English. Native-born Californians use terms Britishisms like ""quay"" (instead of dock or pier), ""first-class"" in reference to a UC Berkeley degree (instead of summa cum laude), and ""fourth September"" instead of the other way around. Stacks of shipping containers play a role in a 1945 event, even though they weren't developed until the 1950s. The US Department of Energy is supposed to have existed in the Ford Administration and even during the 1960s, when in fact it was created by Pres. Carter. And a Christian American uses the word ""dybbuk"" in his Gold Rush-era journal, even though that yiddishism didn't hit English until the early 20th Century. Is it so tough to consult Wikipedia, the OED and a real American person? Had these stories been overtly ""alternative history"" in genre, maybe some of these anachronisms and slips could be excusable, but that doesn't appear to have been Mitchell's game. Sure, these are small details -- but so are most pebbles that find their way into your shoe.While I don't recall any other work that combined all of this one's structural and stylistic tricks into one book before, individually they have indeed all been done, and often in a more engaging way. The nested story/interconnection trick was done a couple of times by John Barth (Chimera; Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor); one could even go back the the turn of the 20th Century with Arthur Schniztler, and maybe earlier, for the linked-story motif. Barth also excelled at mimicking and inventing distinct voices (Sot-Weed Factor, Giles Goat-Boy), as did lots of comparable (Anthony Burgess) and incomparably better (Melville, Joyce) writers. To be fair, Mitchell is emotionally slightly warmer than Barth, even if his technique isn't as dazzling. For literary science fiction, though,  Doris Lessing's interlinked Canopus in Argos series is far more rewarding. It's just as politically-themed as Cloud Atlas, occasionally quite funny, but often subtle and moving enough to bring a tear or two to a reader's eye. And unlike ""Lost"" or this novel, Lessing gives you a lot more to think about after the story ends.  In sum: for the most part, fun while it lasts, which may be a good enough reason to read it; but keep your expectations low to moderate. [P.S. ADDED A COUPLE DAYS LATER: After a few more days, I came around to feeling that the author's sloppiness about detail wasn't merely annoying, but a more serious symptom of the book's superficiality: he seemed to have been more concerned about producing something flashy than about craft. Kind of appropriate that's it's been movie-ized by the same folks who brought us ""Matrix Revolutions"" with Keanu as savior. So for me, at least, it was a book that I soured on once I was out of its immediate spell.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NYFTUI4GGBF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812984412#wasThisHelpful","R1NYFTUI4GGBF6","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My perspective is as a reader who teaches a course in English-language contract-drafting in the law section of a Japanese university, and who's been a US transactional practitioner for nearly 30 years. There are a number of nice things about this book, including that the book's author (SP) is obviously a long-term practitioner herself. She provides a selection of transaction scenarios likely to appeal to students, involving artists, bands, movies, toy inventors, etc. An appendix includes some good advice for interviewing clients. There's also an amusing ""dictionary of negotiating and drafting slang"" that reminds us that terms like ""no-brainer"" and ""deal-breaker"" might not have intuitively obvious meanings (though I think ""megillah"" might be differently understood in NYC or L.A.).While the book itself omits any mention of instructor's materials, I learned about their existence from the publisher's website. The publisher graciously provided a link and a password after I'd emailed them from my university account. These materials are quite generous, ranging from confidential instructions to the parties for negotiation exercises, to various types of error-spotting exercises, general contract drafting skill exams, and a clever ""imagine-a-deal"" exercise that I think would be popular in my classroom.However, a few aspects of the book aren't instructor-friendly. There isn't any index. There's an introduction for students,  but none for instructors. And neither the book nor the online teacher's materials provide any guidance on how the various ""sequences"" of scenarios and exercises are to be used: seriatim, in the alternative, or some other way. This lack of guidance is especially disconcerting because there's a lot of highly obvious repetition in the material, from one ""sequence"" to the next. E.g., a paragraph that begins ""3. The naked drafter rules the world. No, I am not advocating that you draft in the nude. ..."" appears both @161 and @ 353. In fact, the surrounding two pages are virtually exactly the same, except that some substitutions have been made for the names or roles of the parties. I think students would be put off by reading such cute stuff more than once, but the book doesn't tell an instructor how to avoid this. Many other features of the book are also repeated from one scenario to the next, including checklists that could have been relegated to an Appendix.Substantively, I had some issues too, though maybe a couple of these reflect regional differences between the US Midwest, where SP practiced, and the West Coast, where I spent the lion's share of my career to date.@ The book includes some sample memoranda from associates that are far too wordy; they wouldn't be suitable role models in any of the contexts in which I've practiced. In fact, they're the kinds of memos I wrote as a 1st-year associate -- and caught heck for. (At one of the Silicon Valley-based global manufacturers where I later worked, senior executives, including the General Counsel, went so far as to demand memos of no longer than 1 page.)@ Some of the scenarios include ""transcripts"" of meetings with clients, presented as background documents -- but I've never encountered such a luxury (or constraint) during my practice. It might be better to present these conversations simply as dramatic dialogues, instead of leading students to expect that transcripts are a norm.@ The discussions of Non-Dislcosure Agreements refer to the ""term"" of the NDA, without making it clear that there are at least two different time frames to be negotiated in any NDA, which students need to learn to distinguish well. Many tactical issues relating to the use of NDAs go unmentioned -- e.g., the book takes it for granted that an NDA will be mutual. (Again, my expectations are set by Silicon Valley practice, e.g. tech development.)@ The book encourages, in more than one scenario, the use of a term sheet PLUS a non-binding, executed letter of intent. Personally, I think it's a better practice to stick with just an unsigned term sheet if the parties won't need to perform any obligations prior to execution of a definitive agreement, and to use an executed LOI only when one or more parties need to be bound in the interim (e.g. no-shop or due diligence obligations during certain M&A negotiations). I spend close to 2 hours in my course giving students practice in distinguishing between when to use term sheets and LOIs.@ A few exercises mention a ""negotiation prep sheet,"" where the client's position is to be filled in upon further instructions from the instructor, but the book does not seem to teach about BATNAs.@ The book has a bias toward ""Plain English"" drafting, which not all practitioners will share -- even those who believe that contracts should be intelligible to non-lawyer clients. Cf. the more intermediate position of ""standard English"" advocated by Kenneth Adams in his Manual of Style for Contract Drafting 2nd (ABA 2008). Also, the book anticipates that even if two sides to a deal start out with different styles, they will be able to converge on Plain English. It ignores the reality that sometimes one has to tolerate a bit of legalese because of power differentials, e.g., where the lawyer who wrote it represents your client's humongous customer, or else simply to save the other side's face.I've subtracted one star in the aggregate for the unclear structure and for these substantive issues. I hope that most of these matters will be remedied or clarified in a future edition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSE13VTVW475/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735589259#wasThisHelpful","R1PSE13VTVW475","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a passionate, some might say overly gloomy, assessment of Indonesia, based in large part on numerous interviews by a journalist (AV) who has lived in-country. I should make it clear that though I'm favorably disposed to the land, people and cultures of Indonesia, I'm not an expert on the country, and have visited it only a few times. But I did find much of AV's description consistent with my own impressions of, e.g., a filthy, gridlocked, un-walkable capital with open sewers, the aggressive privatization of cultural treasures, and once-beautiful landscapes being systematically destroyed by palm plantations for the benefit of a select few who ship their money to Singapore and other overseas destinations. AV's discussion of the government's intentional undercount of the population, and of its implausible assertion, condoned by the World Bank, that an income of US$2-$4 per day qualifies as ""middle class,"" was also quite interesting.One of AV's theses is that the events of 1965-66 still hang as a cloud over the country. These events include the execution of several generals by factions within the Indonesian Army, the blaming of the executions on the PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia), a bloodbath of suspected PKI members and sympathizers that left around 500,000 dead, the deposing of populist leader Sukarno because he was deemed to have been too ""easy"" on the PKI, and the installation of Suharto as dictator (with the support of the US -- a pattern that would be repeated 6 years later in Chile). Suharto would run the country for more than 30 years.  Despite his downfall in 1998 after popular unrest, he's still held in high regard in many quarters. Many of the military officers who served under him are still active in politics (including the current president), and many of the predatory elites who robbed the country during his reign are still at it, says AV. Frank discussion of Suharto's rule, and of such shameful events in the country's history as its 1972 invasion of East Timor, is not allowed. A whole generation has grown up from whom many of these events have been hidden.Meanwhile, says AV, the public are fed various macroeconomic data that make it sound as if great progress is being made, though its fruits are not widely shared; here the government's undercounting of the country's poor helps the statistics to mask what is apparent on the ground. The same upbeat message is fed to the outside world, such as on numerous ads running on CNN here in Japan, touting the great investment climate and educated workforce. The US helps to spread the message, too, says AV: just as it had been in its interest to support Suharto's coup during the Cold War, it's now in the American interest to hold Indonesia up as a ""democracy"" following ""moderate Islam."" This, despite burnings of churches and stoning of adherents of minority Muslim sects, as reported, e.g., in a July 31, 2011 entry in the ""Banyan"" blog run by that leftist rag, The Economist.Over on Amazon.uk, I had an exchange with a journalist living in Indonesia who had given this book a 1-star review. He had many complaints about AV personally, but very little specific to say about the book, other than that, in his opinion, it is too focused on the past, and blind to the great strides made in the country since 1998. Since, unlike both AV and the reviewer, I haven't lived in the country, I can't judge how great the strides have really been. But if there really is a big gap between the current reality and the propaganda for the country, that fact is at least as important as any ""strides"" since the past. In that regard, AV's book certainly was an eye-opener well-worth the read, and made me want to learn more.That said, I do have some strong reservations about the book's sourcing for some of its assertions. An important example is the claim that Pres. Obama's Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, had been an officer in the Indonesian army, and was called back to the country in 1965 to serve under Suharto in purging Indonesian Communists and ethnic Chinese (@220). If this is true, it might further explain why the Obama Administration has been so supportive of the current regime, run by an army general. But AV doesn't cite to any primary source for this claim; instead he quotes an August 18, 2010 report by journalist Wayne Madsen.Madsen's report, in turn, quotes various de-classified CIA documents about the situation in Indonesia generally at the time, but offers no citations in support of the claim that Soetoro was an Army officer or that his ""recall"" was so that he could ""serve as a senior army officer and assist General Suharto and the CIA in the bloody overthrow of President Sukarno,"" and ""help launch a bloody CIA-backed genocide [sic] of Indonesian Communists and Indonesian Chinese throughout the expansive country."" (For what it's worth, Soetoro's Wikipedia biography omits his alleged army connection, and claims Soetoro himself was of Chinese ethnicity; one should note that Indonesian Chinese were not allowed to use Chinese names.) It doesn't inspire confidence that Madsen's report is full of other unsourced assertions and tortured connections, such as the following: ""Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, [was] ousted in a CIA-inspired coup in 1966, one year before to Obama Sr's son, Barack Obama, Jr. and his mother joined Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian who Obama's mother met at the University of Hawaii in 1965, when President Obama was four years old."" To put this in a fair context: Madsen also asserts that Obama Sr was a friend of Tom Mboya, a Kenyan politician who had CIA connections and who ""had helped to rally pro-U.S. pan-African support for the CIA's overthrow of Nkrumah in Ghana in 1966."" I suppose the conspiratorially-minded will ignore the lack of substantiation and find some sort of smoking gun here. But actually, this jumbled juxtaposition of facts is simply smoke.While there are many other statements in AV's book that seem more solidly grounded, it's a pity that he relies on this sort of ranting innuendo for some of his more intriguing claims. So despite its being an interesting and readable book, I can't give it more than 3.5 stars, absent better documentation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Y6038GVZ4E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745331998#wasThisHelpful","R32Y6038GVZ4E1","A29SAQV356DDQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29SAQV356DDQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Holy moly, but this stuff works!! And it's not a fake-looking orange tan, nor does it go on streaky--probably because in my case I got a mitten to use with the product and didn't use my hands. I recommend purchasing the mitten to apply this lotion. I used it three days in a row, right after drying off after my shower. I especially focused on my tan lines. They're pretty much faded into the rest of my tan just four days later. I also used the product on my face and it is working there also. The warning/guidelines say to wear dark colors after applying this, but I just wore my usual bedtime attire and it happened to be pastels, but the color did not come off on my clothing at all. My only complaint...where is the scent? It promises a scent and I have a keen nose, yet didn't smell a thing. I suppose that's better than stink.

"Dr. Dody is back, and better than ever. While this novel doesn't explore too deeply the prejudice she faces in her line of work (she's a death doctor in Victorian England for those just now hearing about this series), it does explore a different kind of prejudice toward women during those times. There's an epidemic sweeping the country. Women are being declared insane and thrown into institutions where horrific surgeries are performed on them.Dody's sister Florence plays a huge role in this novel as circumstances lead to her being incarcerated on the inside. Behind the scenes is Dody with her breaking and entering, Pike ready to acquire search warrants, suffragists running in front of the king's horse (real event included in the story), and doctors will ill intentions.And that's not all. More drama ensues with the maid's beau, tensions rise at police headquarters, and Violet, Pike's daughter, shows a headstrong side. Dody and Pike continue their romance nevertheless, but it appears their secret is no longer a secret and women did not take lovers and maintain careers both back then. So there's a lot of tension in this story. And did I mention female genital mutilation? Talk about frightening.I really enjoyed it, but feel the really intriguing stuff, such as Florence going ""undercover"" and the midnight breaking and entering, came a little too late. Everything really got exciting in the last half, making the first half feel a tad slow. Florence also irritated me in the first  half with her refusal to take responsibility for her actions and I was displeased with Dody too for going along and not doing the right thing. But it also made me wonder, ""What if it was my sister?"" I appreciate the story line for making one think.I look forward to the next installment in this series. Please keep them coming. Lots of strong women, tension, ""what would you do?"" scenarios, and history.

There's a huge debate over how much the volunteers should be allowed to do. There's a secret engagement, secret babies, possible love affairs. Resentment, jealousy, fear. Each episode brings up something new to think about: the trials of nursing, how very difficult it can be for a young lady in those times to see a man's body. Cowardice. Should they be shot? Not every man is cut out for war...yet should they shot for their weakness?There's Irish/British tensions, and even more fascinating to me was the experimental procedures the surgeons perform. I'm not a medical expert, but though brief, the side story involving a wounded patient being put through a painful routine every two hours rather than losing his leg was intriguing.While the first episode was slow and I had my doubts the series would improve, by the third episode, I was hooked. I became engrossed in everyone's lives and scandals. I found myself shouting at people, especially the wife who tells her husband she doesn't want to hear his war stories. What a shocker of an episode. I dare not say what happens, but I will say it raised a lot of emotion in me.The secret engagement turned into a shocker of epic proportions bringing the issues of treason. Right man, wrong time... I was happy with the way this resolved. It was realistic and yet could have been worse. I must say though, I am not pleased with one sidestory's resolution...Kitty. Fascinating woman with hints of a scandalous past...but yet we never get the full story. I wanted the full story there and I didn't care for her love interest. I'd have chosen the other guy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21M5AYY8MSK3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC1YFBG#wasThisHelpful","R21M5AYY8MSK3U","A3THYM7XMB8B0U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3THYM7XMB8B0U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently purchased this bagel cutter: Hoan Bagel Biter, Silver -- and, for safety's sake, the manufacturer said to use a bottle brush to clean the blade. This brush has bristles flexible enough to fit up into the blade's housing, but strong enough to get the blade clean. I will also be using the brush to clean some tall glasses that are too narrow for my hand's comfort when I'm trying to wash the glass all the way to the bottom.

It sliced through it perfectly with no residue. Unlike some others' experience, it also did not mash down the bagel. (The instructions give hints for avoiding that, by the way.)It's good to find a slicer that can accommodate large bagels like Costco's. I also love how quickly the blade slides through the bagel. It feels much safer than using a knife. Also easier and faster. I ordered the gray/black one because I have stainless and black appliances near where the slicer will sit. It's not beautiful, of course, but at least it fits in.The instructions say to use a bottle brush for cleaning the blade because it's too sharp to touch.

It was the Sling TV option that had me looking for a replacement for my previous streaming device (Sony blue ray player, streamer combo).

"I came to this book knowing nothing about Allen Dulles. I learned not just about him and his control of what we do and do not know about our country's dark past, but also new (to me) information about JFK's murder. I was less interested in the Nazi section than the assassination section, but the whole book is solid reading. Talbot kept firm control of his material and laid it out in inviting prose that prompted me to keep turning the pages. This struck me as a feat not many writers could have pulled off so successfully.

If the result isn't good, I'll update this  review.Edited to add: The odor dissipates quickly. Also, it's easy to get the turned up edges flattened. Just put something heavy on each end and it goes straight in a few days. But I noticed something I really, really don't like. On the underside of the runner there's a very large label that does not simply peel off. I tried taking it off bit by bit but it's so fused to the backing that after hours of trying, I gave up. The reason this label bothers me so much is that I intend to use the two runners I bought outside on my deck. I want water to be able to drain. I don't want water to just sit on the top of the rug.

Worse, I found a thin black line on it. It's going back to Amazon. In repackaging it I discovered that the wadded up package is, indeed for the pillowcase (it can be folded to fit), but the the package had been ripped down the side, not opened with the flap at the top.

I would have preferred more pictures, mainly because I like seeing what the meal will typically look like once it's finished, although they do give a photo at the beginning of each chapter, a few more through the recipes would have been nice.I did receive this item at no cost in exchange for an honest review.

"I purchased this for my husband for our anniversary (1/3 of his gift) because he loves Thundercats. Although this is the reboot and there have been a lot of people who feel it doesn't do the original justice, my husband enjoyed the story line. It's (believe it or not) a Rankin/Bass production.This bluray set packs the entire series onto two disks, where the dvd version is 6 disks long. There are no special features at all that we could find, just the series itself.The only thing my husband never liked about this series is that it just abruptly ends. They didn't tie it up at all and we feel they could have done far more with it and brought in more characters, but it seems like it was just canceled at the last minute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T81E6K5VKTUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWGP47C#wasThisHelpful","R3T81E6K5VKTUU","A2L20SNQ4EZJ8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L20SNQ4EZJ8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the reviews of these frames before purchasing a huge box of them for our vow renewal. A lot of reviewers seemed to say these were cheap frames and weren't worth the price, but I went ahead and ordered 14 of them anyways. I have to say, I don't know why everyone was complaining. They are REALLY nice frames. Of course they are plastic, I don't see anywhere where someone would think they were wood, but they are a nice, sturdy, thick plastic.I had purchased these mainly to hold photos of Disney couples as that is what we are using instead of of numbers to mark the tables. I love them so much that I don't mind using them in my house after the ceremony. I promised a few to my brother and his fiancé for their apartment, but I don't think I can part with any of them. I love them that much.They have two ways to hang them on the back, either vertically or horizontally, and they also have a ""stand"" piece on the back so you can sit them on a table, shelf, or mantle. They came packaged really well, too. Wrapped in plastic, then again in bubble wrap, and I appreciate that they (Amazon) packaged them all into one box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHFGTHRLX7TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MX4XILY#wasThisHelpful","RHHFGTHRLX7TN","A2L20SNQ4EZJ8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L20SNQ4EZJ8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Infinity scarves are not only comfy to wear, but look great with your fall or winter outfit. I love the many different ways they can be worn, too! You can wear it as a long circle scarf, doubled up, a hooded scarf, shawl, hooded shawl, and many more different ways. I received the red and had expected it to be a darker, more maroon color, but it's actually a brighter red. It's still really nice and it's very soft as well. It's held up rather well. I pulled at it and kept it's shape, with no frays or unraveling.  Overall, I absolutely love this scarf.

"This is not a book on how the modern Jewish or non-Jewish reader should understand the Talmud, and other rabbinical writings, in the light of modern realities. A better title for this book could be: How Certain Modern Scholars Understand Rabbinic Writings.I touch on a few items of interest:COMMON ELEMENTS IN STORIESHillel I. Newman, of the University of Haifa, touches on the origin of common motifs in Jewish, Christian, and other accounts. He mentions the one about a gem found inside a fish, and suggests that it is unclear who copied whom. (p. 126).CHRISTIANITY IN THE TALMUDOded Irshai, of Hebrew University, clarifies the term MIN/MINIM, and refers to the book, JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SELF-DEFINITION II. The term MIN/MINIM can variously refer to dualists, Gnostics, Gentile Christians, sometimes Judeo-Christians, and pagans. (p. 181).Irshai supports the premise that there are many anti-Christian texts in the Bavli (Babylonian Talmud). This fact is in no way vitiated by the unimportance of Christianity, in Babylonian society, at the time. (p. 187).HALAKHIC RULINGS ON TALMUD AND THE CHRISTIANSThe remaining paragraphs are in reference to Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica, 3).  Jacob Katz had repeated the Talmud apologetic that would have us believe that the objectionable verses on gentiles are long defunct. They had been determined, by halakhic rulings, to refer solely to ancient pagans, and not to modern Christians.Oded Irshai, of Hebrew University, mentions several scholars, and it is unclear who he is specifically referring to, as he writes, “An example of his reservations about what he seemed to perceive as modern apologetic interpretations of halakhic rulings attributed to medieval rabbis can be found in his criticism of Jacob Katz’ evaluation of the halakhic attitude of R. Menahem Ha-Meiri towards the gentiles…” (p. 191). [Unfortunately, the quoted work is in Hebrew, which I cannot read.]Irshai’s quoted statement shows, at very least, that the alleged authority of medieval halakhic rulings, to nullify or limit the antigoyism in the Talmud, is debatable.  [Also, please click on the link, and see my review of Katz.] In addition, please see the following online article by David Goldstein, ""A Lonely Champion of Tolerance: R. Menachem ha-Meiri's Attitude Towards Non-Jews"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGSY5DRAIB8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593332149#wasThisHelpful","R2SGSY5DRAIB8J","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rav was Rabbi Joseph Baer Soloveitchik (1903-1993). This book is a collection of biographical information, religious messages, photographs, and much more. The first part of the book includes a very helpful, and detailed, Soloveitchik family genealogy. This makes it much easier for the reader to keep track of the various personages discussed in the book.Unlike those Jews who rejected God because He allowed the Holocaust to happen, the Rav did not. He considered the ways of God beyond human understanding (Exodus 15:11), and called on Jews to retain their faith in God despite their doubts and inner conflicts. (p. 171).This work includes interesting information going back two centuries—to Russian-ruled eastern Poland, and into the present. I later touch on some of this.JEWS AND THE MODERN INTERPRETATION OF THE TALMUDAccording to standard Talmud apologetics, certain controversial verses, on Jews and gentiles, had been largely abandoned by Jews, or reinterpreted in halakhic rulings, many centuries ago. They were said to apply only to the ancient peoples, and certainly not to Christians. Deviations from this position are limited to so-called extremists, notably by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in Israel.Information in this book contradicts the foregoing sweeping assertions. It turns out that “old” interpretations of the Talmud, and that in just the Rav’s lineage, not only existed, but had done so among very influential rabbis, and moreover had persisted at least to fairly recent times. In terms of background, necessary to the reader for understanding the ensuing paragraph, “The Vilna Gaon” refers to R. Elijah ben Solomon Zalman (1720-1797). R. Chaim Volozhin (1749-1821) was his student. [Vilna is also called Wilno and Vilnius.]In 1994, the Rav had this to say to his Talmud class, (quote) The rabbis stated “that the Holy One, blessed be He, stipulated with the Works of Creation that they would only continue to exist if Israel accepted the Torah. If not, He would turn the Works of Creation back into emptiness and formlessness” [SHABBAT 88a]. The Vilna Gaon held that the world would only endure if the Jews did not just accept the Torah but continued to constantly study the Torah. The Vilna Gaon’s student, Rev Chaim Vozhiner, later incorporated these ideas into his NEFESH HA-HAYYIM [Fourth Gate, chap. 11, p. 4d]. (unquote). (p. 164).To re-affirm the value of Torah study is one thing: To make the world’s very existence contingent upon the behavior of the Jews, is quite another. It is plain to see that the old Talmudic Jewish supremacist theme, about the world created for the sake of the Jews, was not only being quoted, but was also being applied to the present, if only metaphorically. [Note that a nonliteral racist narrative is nevertheless racist.]JEWS, TSARIST RUSSIA, AND NAPOLEONA selection in this book (pp. 255-258), from the Rav, and stated in 1976, offers a snapshot of history of the early 19th century. [This was shortly after the Partitions of Poland. The Poles were fighting for Napoleon, against Russia, in hopes that his victory would lead to a resurrected Polish state.]Reb Levi Yitzhak suggested that anything that lessened the tsar’s yoke was beneficial to the Jews. In contrast, Rev Schneur Zalman warned that, (quote) “A victory for Napoleon would open the gates to the spirit of assimilation which was then engulfing Western Europe.” (unquote). (p. 257). The Jews sided with the Russians against Napoleon. In fact, the Rav’s article focuses on Jewish espionage on behalf of the Russian forces.[It is obvious, from the foregoing, that Jewish conduct was being governed by narrow self-interest, and that the Jews had no regard for Poland—the very nation that had freely welcomed them and given them refuge centuries ago. Is it any wonder that later Poles (notably the Endeks) did not warm up to Jews, and generally did not consider Jews part of the Polish nation?]JEWS BRIBE RUSSIAN OFFICIALSSome unmentioned historical background is in order. In the 1905 Russian revolution, many, if not most, of the revolutionaries, were Jews.Decades later, in 1959, the Rav related the account of a Jewish youth, from Brisk, who was responsible for the killing the Russian governor-general of Warsaw, with a bomb, as part of the 1905 disturbances. Reb Chaim led a massive campaign in 1906, among the Jews, to raise a large amount of money to bribe a Russian official to free the boy. It worked.This prompted the Rav to comment, (quote) He [Rev Chaim] knew that in Russia bribes worked wonders. Jews could not survive without this magical policy of bribing officials. (unquote). (p. 234).THE RAV IN POLANDThe Rav was born in foreign-ruled Poland in 1903 (p. 21), and lived much of his early life there, and in the resurrected Polish state (1918-on). The Rav entered the Free Polish University in 1924. Later, he went to the University of Berlin. This was, in part, to avoid the possibility of military service, or at least of being drafted into the Polish Army. (p. 26, pp. 68-69).AMERICAN JEWS AND “GETTING AHEAD”Soloveitchik moved to the USA. For a time, he lived in Boston.The Rav maintained that the Jew yearns for holiness. Nevertheless, this did not prevent him from uttering this scathing critique of America’s Jews, (quote) Thus, we were confronted with his continual amazement at the contrast between how the “modern Jew dedicates vast emotional resources, talents, and ingenuity to acquire material possessions.” This same Jew who “shuts out the spiritual values of Judaism through a selective dullness, insensitivity, a numbness to all things holy” (12.05). “The American Jew,” the Rav observed, “follows a philosophy which has equated religion with making Jewish life more comfortable and convenient.” (12.06). (unquote). (p. xxx). [Not a few Christian preachers have made the same complaints about American Christians.]JEWS AND THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCILAround 1960, the Rav was invited to a Jewish-Catholic dialogue, as part of ecumenical activities, which, in turn, were part of Vatican II. He called for mutual respect between religions, and suggested that Christians and Jews make common cause against secularism, materialism, and atheism. (p. 49).However, he declined to participate in the dialogue itself, pointing to the distinctiveness of both religions, and the fact that one religion should not be equated or merged with the other. In addition, one religion should not be viewed against the backdrop of the other religion. (p. 50). [Ironically, this actually happened, but probably not in the way that the Rav had feared. Many Catholics nowadays refer to Jews as the “elder brothers” of Christians, effectively making Judaism the backdrop of Christianity, and, to some extent, blurring the distinction between Catholicism and Judaism.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C779FMEFLMBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881256145#wasThisHelpful","R1C779FMEFLMBM","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew what this book was about, before getting it, only because I saw it mentioned in response to the exclusivist aspects of Jews as the Chosen People of God. However, the unsuspecting reader may erroneously think that this is a book about Jewish philanthropy, and related topics. It is not.This work is an impressive collection of positive Jewish statements about gentiles. For instance, righteous non-Jews deserve a place in the World to Come (SANHREDRIN 105a). (p. 131). Maharal of Prague (1512-1609) taught that he shared the blessings that he got from God with all humankind. (p. 126). According to Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi, God’s promise, to wipe away the tears from all faces, includes the faces of non-Jews as well as Jews. (p. 156).This book also features Jewish concepts of the Messiah and of the Messianic age, especially its universalism. For instance, it interprets Isaiah 53 as describing the antecedent sufferings of the Jewish people, and interprets Isaiah 11 in a purely allegorical manner. Thus, according to this interpretation, the lion and the lamb dwelling together refer to Israel’s warlike neighbors, and Israel, living in peace. (p. 153).SOURCES OF INFORMATIONA small portion of this book consists of the universalist verses in the Old Testament and the Talmud. As an example of Talmudic citations, Sears (p. 31) quotes BERAKOT 17a, which speaks of Jews living in peace with gentiles as well as non-Jews. He also (p. 29) quotes GITTIN 61a, which commands Jews to provide for the non-Jewish poor as well as the Jewish poor, to visit non-Jews as well as Jews when they are sick, and to attend the funerals of non-Jews as well as Jews, “for these are the ways of peace.” However, the unmentioned preceding verse, in GITTIN 61a, as written in the online Babylonian Talmud (Soncino version), says “to avoid ill feeling”. In addition, the portion quoted by Sears ends with “in the interests of peace”, instead of “for these are the ways of peace.” What, if anything, does all this mean? Sears does not say.Most of this book consists of quotes and citations from 50 Jewish universalist-oriented thinkers, all of whom had lived many centuries after the Talmud had been written down, and quite a few of whom had lived in fairly recent times. Author David Sears includes biographical paragraphs of these Jewish thinkers. (pp. 199-218). Perhaps one shortcoming of this book is that it does not put the development of Jewish universalism in historical context. For this reason, I have done so, for the benefit of the reader. I have taken the 50 Jewish thinkers, and apportioned them by date of birth. Of these, 13 were born between 1000 and 1300 AD or CE. None were born between 1300 or 1400, and 2 were born between 1400 and 1500. The remainder were born in modern times. Of these, 9 were born between 1500 and 1700. The remainder were born during and after the Enlightenment. Of these, 10 were born between 1700 and 1800, 14 were born between 1800 and 1900, and 2 were born after 1900. (The latter, and total of 50, does not include quoted contemporaries, such as R. Ahron Soloveitchik and Menachem M. Schneerson.)JEWS SHOULD NOT DEFRAUD GENTILESAuthor David Sears devotes an entire chapter (pp. 41-on) in rebuttal to the claim that Judaism allows Jews to cheat, or steal from, gentiles. For example, he quotes from Rabbi Moshe Rikvah (1595-1761), who had lived in Wilno (Vilnius) during the Cossack revolts, and then was forced to move to Amsterdam. (p. 213). Rikvah said that, (quote) “I write this for future generations: I have seen many people become wealthy by causing non-Jews to err in business in order to gain profit thereby. However, they did not remain successful, in the end, all their wealth was confiscated by the government, and their descendants were left without an inheritance.” (unquote). (p. 43).WHY ISRAEL IS CALLED “ADAM”Here are some excerpts, from the author, on this subject, (quote) I have always found it difficult to understand the statement of our Sages that whenever the Torah uses the term ADAM (man), it refers only to Israel (YEVAMOS 61a)…The Talmud also teaches that non-Jews possess the Divine image (AVOS 3:14)…The medieval Talmudic scholars of France (BAALEI TOSEFOS) in their glosses on the Talmudic passage cited above point out that the collective singular HA-ADAM (man), with the definite article, does include non-Jews. If non-Jews are not designated by the term ADAM, why should the definite article make a difference? (unquote). (pp. 131-132).The justification for the conflation of Jews with ADAM is summarized by Sears, with the items in parentheses and brackets done by the author, (quote) From this point of view, it would be inappropriate to call all people ADAM. Adam was so named because he was formed of the earth (Hebrew: ADAMAH), whereas the rest of his descendants were born of flesh and blood. [That is, he was formed directly by God; the rest of mankind was formed through natural procreation.] Israel alone deserves to be called by this name---not because of greater honor, but because, like Adam, all that happened to them, as well as their spiritual perfection, was the doing of the Holy One, blessed is He, Himself, and not primarily the result of their own endeavor. (unquote). (p. 135). In addition, (quote) HA-ADAM (with the definite article) refers to all mankind; for we are all rational beings who possess the Divine image, Jews and non-Jews alike. (unquote). (p. 136).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZAWGE1D8VC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765799871#wasThisHelpful","R31ZAWGE1D8VC4","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DVD is worth seeing for its photography alone. It can teach even a biologist a thing or two! The authors show the extreme complexity of the dolphin's sonar system. Did you know that a blindfolded dolphin could locate a BB pellet on a pool floor? It can also distinguish a ping pong ball and a golf ball on the basis of density. There is so much about the sophistication of marine life that we do not know!A variety of marine creatures use the Earth's magnetic field to find their way back to their breeding grounds after thousands of miles of travelling. This is notably true of certain tropical turtles. The salmon can find the correct river, on the Pacific Coast, to which to return, even though there are hundreds of them emptying into the Pacific.The humpback whale has a very complex system of clicks and other vocalizations. The male also has a very sophisticated cooling system for its reproductive organs, which are unusual in that they are internal, thereby subject to overheating from body heat.The four examples presented by the authors are just the tip of the iceberg of the complexity of the living things. Many more examples could be presented, but the examples clearly make the point.The authors argue that all these systems are much too complex to have arisen by natural selection acting upon random mutations. They propose Intelligent Design instead.The photography is very moving, and the dolphins very playful. This is an enjoyable DVD to watch. My wife and I liked it very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX2CGC6JIVV73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYSKLU2#wasThisHelpful","RX2CGC6JIVV73","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author is Professor of Rabbinic Judaism at University College London. He identifies himself as an Orthodox Jew. (p. xxii).In his assiduous analysis of rabbinical literature, author Sacha Stern employs Talmudic sources (Mishna, Tosefta, Yerushalmi, and Bavli), many different Midrashim, and other sources. (pp. xi-xii). As part of my review of this and related works, I have regularly consulted the online Babylonian Talmud (Soncino edition), and have included specific references to it below. All my specific references below are from the Bavli, in CAPS, and from this online source.Let us first put my review in perspective. Volumes upon volumes of books have been written by Jews (and not a few non-Jews) on the need for Christians and Poles, for example, to ""be mature"", to ""get over the heroic narrative"", to ""come to terms with the past"" and even to ""confront the past"". Jews should be held to the same standard. At least that is my opinion. This book is a step in that direction.As for anti-Semitism, the reader must ask this honest question: What causes anti-Semitism--the candor about certain Talmudic verses, or the nearly-total exemption of criticism of Jews for them? Could taboo topics about Jews actually encourage the proliferation of anti-Semitic literature--with its strident, nonobjective portrayals of the Talmud, and its unsubstantiated and frequently-bizarre accusations against Jews?IMPLICATIONS OF RACISMRacism can be defined as a strong self-aggrandizement of one's own people and/or a consistently contemptuous attitude towards other peoples. Both are graphically obvious in this book.Let us keep this oft-emotional matter in perspective. Jewish racism and Jewish universalism are both real, and one does not negate the other. In addition, neither one of them defines, or represents the totality of, Judaism. For a detailed study of Jewish universalism, please click on, and read my review, of Compassion for Humanity in the Jewish Tradition. See also my analysis of Jewish universalism towards the end of this review.The controversial Talmudic verses are not ""mistranslated"" or ""misunderstood"". Nor are they just the private opinions of one or two rabbis. Nor are they ""cherry picked"" out of the Talmud by anti-Semites. Instead of all this, there are very many verses involved, and moreover they come together in the form of specific, irrefutable THEMES. I specify some of these themes below. Moreover, the themes do not ""float around"" in isolation from each other. Instead, they coalesce together, forming a systematic pattern of Jewish self-exaltation and a systematic pattern of denigration of the gentiles.Author Sacha Stern actually uses the term racism in reference to rabbinic Jewish thinking, albeit in quotations, as he comments, (quote) In way of apologetics, we may note that unlike other forms of ""racism"", the early rabbinic view of Israel as superior to the non-Jews was almost never called upon to vindicate the use of violence or exploitation. (unquote). (p. 4). [This is a separate issue, and is debatable. For instance, please see my review of Reckless Rites: Purim and the Legacy of Jewish Violence (Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the Ancient to the Modern World)].As part of his Talmudic apologetic, Stern also points out that, in his words, the ""racial"" prejudice of this kind, and rabbinic ""racism""  (his words ""racial"", and ""racist"" in quotes) were common currency in the Late Antique near eastern world. (pp. 4-5). [However, the racism of one people does not negate or excuse the racism of another people. See first comment.]ANDREAS EISENMENGER AND HIS Entdecktes JudenthumThe author is more critical of Eisenmenger's motives than of his findings. Stern quips, (quote) The passages I have quoted already suggest that the rabbinic image of the non-Jews is xenophobic in the extreme. Indeed, rabbinic sources assume, as we shall see in the course of this study, that non-Jews are intrinsically wicked and dedicated to murder, sexual offences and idolatry (see section I.3.A). They suggest, besides, that whereas the Jews are akin to angels, non-Jews are akin to animals (section I.4.A). Much of this material has been quoted by anti-Semitic writers of the early modern period--not least, by Eisenmenger in his ENTDECKTES JUDENTHUM--with the sole purpose of vilifying the Jews and their religion...Whilst his quotation of original sources is generally reliable, his translation and interpretation of them not always are. Eisenmenger makes no effort to hide his anti-Jewish stance and motives. (unquote). (p. 4).Stern repeats the argument, based on Jacob Katz and his book, Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica, 3), that medieval Talmudic scholars had ruled that the negative portrayals of non-Jews pertained only to the pagans of Antiquity. They are no longer binding. (p. 5). [Katz is less than convincing. See my review.]THE TORAH ONCE OFFERED TO NON-JEWS?How did Jews become the Chosen People in the first place? Stern cites Israeli scholar Joseph Heinemann. He suggested that the teaching, that God offered the Torah to many nations but only Israel would accept it (e. g, AVODA ZARAH 2b), was an invention designed to ward off gentile criticism of the exclusiveness of Jews as the Chosen People of God. (p. 211).THEME: JEWISH SUPREMACIST THINKING ON GOD'S CREATIVE PURPOSESStern provides numerous, specific rabbinic citations for all the points he raises, as he writes, (quote) The world could not exist without Israel. It was created for the sake of Israel, and is maintained entirely through their merit. Without Israel, there would be no rain or sunrise.  Israel brings light to the world. All the blessings in the world are due to Israel. This is because the Almighty attends only to Israel, whence the rest of the world draws indirect benefit. Therefore, the nations could not exist without Israel...This ""ethnocentric"", highly self-centered worldview, confirms the extent to which the authors of our sources are exclusively concerned with their own identity. The notion that the ""others"" (the nations, the world) are subordinate to the ""self"" (Israel) and owe it their existence, suggests a dialectical relationship of self and other where the other serves no purpose, and has no other RAISON D'ETRE, but to define and enhance the essence of the self. (unquote). (p. 46). [Isn't that exactly what racism is all about?]The world-incapable-of-existing-except-for-Israel Talmudic verse is from TAANITH 3b, and the remaining verses are extra-Talmudic. Stern fails to mention the verse in BERAKOT 32b, wherein the stars were created for the Jews and only for the Jews. Please click on, and read my detailed review, of The Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Berakot.THEME: ONGOING JEWISH SUPREMACY OVER ALL OTHER PEOPLESAgain, Stern provides numerous, specific rabbinic citations for all the points he raises, as he writes, (quote) Righteous and angelic, the superiority of Israel over the nations should be by now self-evident. Rabbinic sources do not shy away from stating that Israel are the choicest of all nations, the best, the greatest, the highest, the most beloved of the Almighty. One Jew outweighs all the nations put together. Appropriately, every morning is recited the daily blessing ""that He has not made me a non-Jew"". This superiority is said, in Talmudic and other sources, to provide substantial benefits to Israel...A non-Jew who hits a Jew is punishable by death...""Israel are mighty before the nations"", like God, they are masters over all the inhabitants of earth...This superiority appears to represent a subjective, ""internal"" truth, transcending, on some other plane, the experiences of the outside world. (unquote). (pp. 42-44).The Jew-hitting verse is from SANHEDRIN 58b, and the verse in which Jews thank God for not making them gentiles is from MENAHOT 43b. The remaining verses, for the foregoing quoted statements, are extra-Talmudic.The Jewish privileges are, at least to some extent, ones that come solely from the fact of being born Jewish. For instance, the Divine Presence (the SHEKHINA) rests upon Israel even when they are impure. (YOMA 56b). (p. 41).In addressing the disparity between fancied great Jewish power and the lack of it in reality, Stern comments, (quote) An attempt to rationalize this contradiction may be found in the Talmudic claim that were it not for the TORAH which restrains the Jews, no nation would be able to resist them. (BETZA 25b). (unquote). (p. 44).THEME: JEWS ARE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSEAlthough this inflammatory theme is strongly denied in discussions of Jewish Chosenness, it is inescapably true. Stern writes, (quote) As well shall see in later sections, the WHOLE of Israel is described indiscriminately as righteous and angelic, just as the WHOLE of ""the nations"" are wicked and akin to animals. (unquote). (emphasis in original). (p. 7). Furthermore, (quote) The righteousness of Israel stands in direct contrast with the wickedness of the nations...The nature of this righteousness, however, is taken for granted more often than it is described. (unquote). (pp. 30-31).Exceptions to these foregoing themes do not invalidate them. Thus, Stern brings up ""wicked"" Jews and ""righteous non-Jews"", but then stresses this salient fact, (quote) Broadly speaking, these exceptions are presented as marginal in our sources, and do not affect the general, rabbinic image of the non-Jews and Israel. (unquote). (p. 7).The polarity between Jews and gentiles is almost absolute. Israel and the nations are juxtaposed with light and darkness [PESAHIM 103b]. This is repeated in extra-Talmudic literature. (p. 2).Now consider antigoyism (my term) in more detail. The author elaborates on the rabbinical teachings about the abject moral inferiority of the GOYIM relative to the Jews, with the following introduction to this subject (quote) As we shall see, the wickedness of the non-Jews is taken for granted in our sources rather than actually reported and observed: in this respect, it is a purely ""cultural"", ""theoretical"" construct. Nevertheless, the rabbinic image of the non-Jew takes on a reality of its own which forms the background to a number of Halakhic rulings. (unquote). (p. 22).THEME: ANTIGOYISM: GENTILES ARE ANIMALS--VIRTUALLYIn some respects, all humans, according to the Talmud are like animals, and some features of a specific animal may even be applied to Israel. (p. 33-34). However, Stern points out that such comparisons are superficial in scope and significance. (p. 34). In addition, the fact that human-animal comparisons are not always derogatory (p. 34), of course, means that they usually are.In like manner, while some comparisons of animals and gentiles are superficial, others are clearly not. They form distinct themes. Stern comments, (quote) Some passages suggest a more general affinity between non-Jews and animals...These comparisons are not restricted to any specific, superficial feature: they refer to the non-Jewish person AS A WHOLE, and suggest that the latter is generally akin, in his lowliness, to animals. General, all-inclusive associations of this kind are common with reference to dogs...It is quite clear that these statements aim at conveying that the non-Jews share the GENERAL features of the animal world, and particularly the lowliness of dogs. (unquote). (Emphasis in original). (p. 35). The foregoing is based on specified non-Talmudic writings.The author brings up Ezekiel 23:20, and how this reference to Egyptians had been applied, by the Talmud, in his words, indiscriminately to all non-Jews, as in reference to gentiles as donkeys (notably BERAKOT 25b and BERAKOT 58a). Stern assesses this, (quote) Indeed, far from treating this affinity as mere, figurative metaphor, the BABYLONIAN TALMUD treats it as a tangible and concrete reality to the extent that it requires PRACTICAL, Halakhic significance. (unquote). (Emphasis in original). (p. 37).Clearly, Stern goes beyond the usual Talmudic apologetic about Halakhic fatherhood, which would essentially have us believe that the donkey-gentile equation was nothing more than a fancy way of expressing disapproval of Jewish-gentile marriages.With reference to BERAKOT 25b, Stern writes, (quote) ...the suggestion that the non-Jew may have been treated IN CONCRETE PRACTICE as equal to the donkey suggests far more than mere metaphorical similarity between them. Finally, one passage in the Babylonian Talmud suggests that as donkeys, the CONCRETE PHYSIOLOGY of the non-Jews is different from the Jews'...[NIDA 45a] Here, more than anywhere else, we find that the affinity of non-Jews with donkeys may be treated as tangible and hence, as a form of VIRTUAL IDENTITY. (unquote). (Emphasis in original). (p. 38).Finally, the equation of non-Jews with donkeys has sexual connotations. For instance, with reference to BERAKOT 58a, intercourse with non-Jewish women amounts to bestiality. (p. 39, 165). This, of course, further reinforces the fact that gentiles are virtual donkeys.On a separate issue, non-Jewish slaves of Jews have an affinity with animals. (KIDDUSHIN 22b). (pp. 96-99).However, the entire foregoing discussion is rather academic. The persistent equating of GOYIM and animals is racist on its face, and the racism is not dependent upon whether the equation is literal, metaphoric, or somewhere in between.THEME: DEFENDING JEWISH EXCLUSIVENESSThe rabbinical authorities, at the time, tended to doubt both the sincerity and permanence of gentile conversions to Judaism. (pp. 93-95).Author Sacha Stern touches on several rabbinic verses that call for the killing, or allowance for death, of gentiles. He calls them variously idiosyncratic, heavily censored, and allowing a Jew to escape punishment for killing a gentile but not thereby allowing a Jew to kill a gentile. (p. 4). He does not elaborate.On the other hand, the command to execute a gentile who observes the Sabbath [SANHEDRIN 58b](pp. 207-208), or even one who studies the Torah [SANHREDRIN 59a], in Stern's opinion, stems from the following, (quote) ...the non-Jews must be PREVENTED from engaging in them, lest this leads to the erosion of the distinctiveness of Israel. (unquote). (Emphasis in original.) (p. 215).TALMUDIC TERMS FOR PAGANS AND CHRISTIANSAVODA ZARA (""pagan"", ""idolater"")(p. 9) is used throughout rabbinic literature. In fact, Stern suggest that it is used so broadly that it is functionally a loose (though inexact) synonym for non-Jew. (pp. 196-197).According to some heavily-censored passages in the Bavli, AVODA ZARA can apply to Christians. (p. 28).  MIN/MINIM does, or can, refer to Christians. (p. 9, 28, 107-108). Some Talmudic verses defending the Torah are, or may be, covert anti-Christian polemics. (pp. 74-75, 210).AKUM does not appear in the early manuscripts. It is apparently an invention of censors. (p. 9).Did Jews use code words for peoples? Yes. In the Bible, Edom referred to Idumaea, but, in the rabbinic period, it was applied to Rome. (p. 19).THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: JEWISH UNIVERSALISMModern forms of Jewish universalism teach that gentiles can be righteous before God, moreover on a large scale, based solely on their ethical conduct, and can freely do so outside of Judaism. As elaborated below, the early rabbinical concept of Jewish universalism was almost the opposite.Stern comments, (quote) In the TOSEFTA, R. Yehoshua is attributed the view that some exceptional non-Jews are righteous (TZADIKIM) are have a share in the world to come (while R. Eliezer maintains that no non-Jews have any share in it.) [SANHEDRIN 105a]. (unquote). (p. 30). The author then cites a variety of extra-Talmudic rabbinical literature to show that righteous gentiles were thought of as uncommon, and as needing to convert to Judaism. He concludes that, (quote) It seems that to be non-Jewish and righteous are so inherently contradictory that the only viable option, for these exceptional individuals, is to convert. Which confirms the adage: exceptions prove the rule. (unquote). (p. 30).Modern concepts of Jewish universalism teach that the Noahide laws enable a gentile to be righteous by obeying only 7 laws, while Jews have the much greater duty of obeying 613 laws. Early rabbinical concepts, on the other hand, saw this situation as one that only deepened the chasm between Jew and gentile. For instance, it was stressed that the GOYIM were so ethically inferior to Jews that they were incapable of obeying even the 7 Noahide laws, let alone the 613 ones that Jews keep. (pp. 204-205; 215). Moreover, this meant, with some exceptions, that gentiles keeping the Noahide laws get no reward for doing so. [BAVA KAMMA 38a; AVODA ZARA 3a]. (pp. 205-206).Rabbinic verses that praise the gentile who studies the Torah, comparing him to a high priest, refer to one who studies the Noahide laws. Otherwise, they are counteracted by the verses, noted earlier, that condemn gentile study of the Torah, even making it a capital crime. (p. 201, 212-213).On another subject, the acceptance of gentiles in Jewish public worship is identified by Stern as an exception--in fact, virtually the only practice that Jews were willing to share with non-Jews. (p. 204). However, the later MIDRASHIM expressed hostility to this, even requesting the Almighty not to honor the prayers of non-Jews. (p. 203).MISCELLANEOUS INTERESTING INFORMATIONCircumcision was not limited to the Jews, even in the Middle East. It was also practiced by some Arabs, and Gibeonites/Gabnonites (YEVAMOT 71a). (p. 206).Some commentators had taken SANHREDRIN 74a-b, and related teachings, as requiring Jews to wear distinctive clothing. Stern leans against this. (pp. 191-192).As for Jewish resistance to assimilation, Stern brings up the Biblical prohibition against Jews adopting the ways of the nations (Leviticus 20:23). However, Halakhic prohibitions against specific forms of gentile-imitating acts were quite variable. (pp. 186-on).Pork is exceptionally abominable to Jews--so much so that Jews are cursed merely for breeding pigs. (BABA KAMA 82b). (p. 57).The Star of David has no basis in early rabbinical literature. It is mentioned in medieval Kabbalistic works, and only became a religious and political Jewish symbol in the late 18th century. (p. 86).A TALMUDIC INSPIRATION FOR EXTREME JEWISH POLONOPHOBIA?Author Sacha Stern elaborates how, in Jewish thinking, the Romans most embody the wickedness of the non-Jews. He comments, (quote) The only reason why they [Romans] do not completely exterminate the Jewish people (besides the fact that it would be impossible) is that they do not want to be called “the murderous kingdom”: PESACHIM 87b; AVODA ZARA 10b. (unquote). (p. 16).I was struck by the foregoing, because I hear it today! Some very anti-Polish Jews accuse Poles of having wanted to exterminate their Jews, but not doing it because of incompetence, and for not wanting to have the onus of “a nation of murderers”. Furthermore, according to this Polonophobic canard, once the Germans exterminated Poland’s Jews, the Poles were satisfied that the Nazis had done the work for them, and--better yet--that it was the Germans who went down in history “a nation or murderers”.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC744S0FTEOUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9004100121#wasThisHelpful","RC744S0FTEOUC","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And assuming that there is to be such a meritocracy, who decides on what basis this meritocracy is to be constructed?We keep hearing that the Holocaust was unique (and thereby entitled to greater historical memory than the genocide of any other peoples) because Hitler made it a point to insist on the death of every single Jewish man, woman, and child. According to a well-worn cliché, ""Not all victims of the Nazis were Jews, but all Jews were victims of the Nazis."" Author Rigg shows that this was certainly incorrect. There were thousands of German Jews who were deliberately spared by Hitler and other leading Nazis, and re-labeled Aryans. It is high time that Holocaust education be changed to devote equal time to Jewish and non-Jewish victims of the Germans.WHO WAS A JEW?""Not every one who had Jewish ancestry was a victim of the death camps"" (Rigg, p. 268). According to both the Halaka and Israel's ""Law of Return"", a Jew is defined as a person having a Jewish mother while remaining unconverted to another religion, or one who converted to Judaism. Based on this definition, a large fraction of the Mischlinge (German-Jewish ""mongrels"") consisted of true Jews. In fact, based on a sample which he has analyzed, Rigg (p. 18, 283) estimates that 60% of half-Jews and 30% of quarter-Jews in Nazi Germany were Halakically Jewish.SOME NUMBERSThe number of Mischlinge spared from persecution by Hitler undoubtedly numbers in the thousands (p. 3). Perhaps 16,000 Mischlinge officers were in the Wehrmacht in 1940, and more than 150,000 Mischlinge fought for the Nazis in WWII. Although Hitler had the final say, many of the top Nazi officials were actively involved in the relabeling and protection of German Jews, including Ribbentrop, Sauckel, Bormann, Canaris, Donitz, Heydrich, Himmler, von Schirach, Kaltenbrunner, and Goring (p. 182). The latter reputedly remarked: ""I'll decide who is a Jew."" (p. 21).Moreover, the exemptions from persecution were NOT limited to those of partial Jewish ancestry. Luftwaffe Field Marshall Erhart Milch, was either a half or full Jew (pp. 29-30). According to Rigg (p. 203), some 200 full-blooded Jews (the Schutzjuden, or protected Jews) were spared persecution in Berlin alone. One way or another, at least 6,000 full-blooded Jews served in the Wehrmacht (p. 65).JEWISH GERMANS COMPLICIT IN THE HOLOCAUSTRigg briefly discusses the involvement of German Jews in the Holocaust itself. Mention is made of part and full Jews such as Killy, Eppinger, Goldschlag, Abrahamsohn, and Scherwitz (p. 258). Much less attention is paid to the Jewish origins of many top Nazi leaders. There is some elaboration of Hitler's obsessive fear of his Jewishness, as well as the probable Jewishness of Reinhard Heydrich (p. 176), one of the chief architects of the Holocaust itself. Most relevant documents that trace the ancestry of top Nazi officials have been destroyed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVSI06KFORXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EEYTH0#wasThisHelpful","R2QVSI06KFORXX","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The reader may erroneously get the impression that this book is primarily about the trivialization of the Holocaust, or a retreat from its moral gravity. Such themes are only a modest portion of this book. Most of it is about how the Holocaust has been treated by academia and the media, little of which involves a softening or trivialization of Nazi crimes. A good deal of it is about how Germans try to relativize the crimes of their forebears.Author Gavriel D. Rosenfeld includes both sides of the Holocaust uniqueness debate—a debate that he considers spent. However, he keeps falling back on the premise that the Holocaust was unique insofar as the Jews were targeted for complete annihilation. (e. g, p. 81, 110, 119). Who decides that a total genocide is qualitatively more significant, of greater moral gravity, or more deserving of historical memory, than a less comprehensive genocide? Furthermore, who decides that there should be ANY kind of meritocracy, for genocides, in the first place? Finally, it is not true that the Nazis targeted all known Jews for annihilation. Nazi leaders, including Hitler himself, deliberately spared thousands of German Jews by re-labeling them Aryans. Please read my detailed review (October 26, 2005), of HITLER""S JEWISH SOLDIERS.The author features numerous alternative histories revolving around WWII. For instance, Gavriel D. Rosenfeld critiques Patrick Buchanan’s book, on the alleged preventability of WWII, by pointing out that Buchanan fails to appreciate the racist and expansionist nature of Nazi philosophy. (p. 54, 56). [In addition, WWII did not start over Danzig (Gdansk). That was merely a smokescreen. It was about Poland’s sovereignty as a whole. In addition, Poland would have fought for her freedom even had there had been no promise of assistance from France and England.]Even the actual “normalization” of Hitler, far from making him look less evil, may actually be based precisely on the fact that Hitler was (supposedly) uniquely evil. For instance, when a politician calls an opponent “Hitler” or “Nazi”, it is precisely because Hitler and Nazism are irrevocably and recognizably evil. Of course, overuse of Hitler can dull sensitivity to his acts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8RDXA3RFX60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110742397X#wasThisHelpful","R3L8RDXA3RFX60","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review is based on the original 1831 English-language edition, a translation from the original German. I focus on a few themes.The author identifies himself as a German, or at least one of German extraction. (p. 94). He served as a cadet in Grand-Duke Constantine’s Imperial Russian Body Guard.THE POLISH NOBILITYAuthor Harring confirms the fact that the Polish nobility, unlike that of other countries, was not stratified according to rank, and that it constituted a much larger percentage of the population than its counterpart in other nations. He writes, (quote) The nobles form only one body. The distinction of high and low nobility is not legally recognized. The richest magnate in the law, not a more important person than the poorest knight,---EQUES POLONUS PAR OMNIBUS, NEMINI SECUNDUS. The nobles are extremely numerous—At least 60,000 families belong to the class of which, however, only about a hundred are wealthy, all the rest are poor. (unquote). (p. 253).THE NOVEMBER 1830 INSURRECTIONOne of the reasons for this Insurrection had been the growing heavy-handedness of the Russian authorities against Poles, notably in just the last several years before the event. For example, a large group of Poles had been beaten, imprisoned, or sent to Siberia merely because a boy had scratched this message on a wall, “Long live the Constitution of 1791.” Harring describes his personal impressions of the tsarist Russian repressions just before the Insurrection, (quote) I was an eyewitness to the misery and affliction with which thousands of families were then visited. The overwhelming sentence fell on the most distinguished families of the land, far and near. (unquote). (p. 83).The author has little to say about the Insurrection itself.  However, towards the end of the book, Harring mentions the privations of the Poles following the recently-concluded and failed November 1830 Insurrection. (p. 275).A TWO-SIDED GENERALIZATION ON JEWSAuthor Harro Harring avoids the tendency to see Jews exclusively as victims or exclusively as ones responsible for the fact that they are disliked. He comments, (quote) The Franciscan Street in Warsaw is like those busy districts occupied by the Jews in Frankfort, Prague, Rome, Amsterdam, and Leghorn. In short, wherever the Jews congregated together, they are characterized by the same peculiarities, viz, uncleanliness, and the love of finery, avarice, and dishonesty: while the persecutions and insults to which they are exposed render them real objects of pity. (unquote). (p. 188).SPECIFIC INCIDENTS INVOLVING JEWSThe author describes two events to which he was an eyewitness. In one of them, a Jew was caught stealing an item, and was beaten, by a Russian officer, for allegedly having stolen an earlier item. (pp. 207-on).In another incident, the Jew had entered an unauthorized area, and had engaged in attempted exploitation. Harring describes the event, (quote) Entrance to the Lazaretto, as well as to the barracks, is prohibited to all but officers and soldiers. The Jews in particular, are strictly kept out, and the sentinels drive them back whenever they attempt to enter. Notwithstanding the rigor with which this regulation is enforced, a Jew now and then contrives to slip into Uyazdov accompanied by a soldier, and under the pretext of having been sent for by an officer. In this manner a Jew peddler once found his way into the apartment occupied by the seven officers above mentioned, and offered his wares for sale. I asked the price of a pair of scissors, and Baron R--- asked the price of a comb. The Jew according to custom demanded twice their value. “Dog, villain!” exclaimed the Baron, “Do you think we are fools? I will make you remember this. Alexiyeff! Here is a florin for you. Give this fellow a thrashing, and drive him down stairs.” (unquote). (p. 215). He did, and beat the Jew very savagely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XTDNFTQWFWCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011WLZ500#wasThisHelpful","R1XTDNFTQWFWCM","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is primarily about anti-Semitism, but the author's treatment of the Talmud overshadows everything else. For this reason, as well as the fact that other reviews already tell the reader about the general contents of this book, I emphasize the Talmud in my review.Otherwise, rhe author focuses on traditional Christian teachings against Jews. That is a given. However, he also presents interesting information on the anti-Semitism of leading atheists, including Voltaire (pp. 34-on), Wilhelm Marr (p. 207, 269), Eugen Duhring (p. 269), and others.HOW KATZ UNDERSTANDS TALMUDIC INTERPRETATIONBy way of introduction to this subject, Jacob Katz writes, (quote) Indeed, many sections of their books and even entire chapters were no longer regarded as valid and binding--not literally, at any rate. Dialectic and homiletic exegesis enabled those who grew up on Jewish sources to maintain the sanctity of the entire tradition on principle, despite the astounding laws and bizarre legends that were included. The Mishnah and the Talmud did not serve as guides for the daily behavior of the Jews, but as books for study. For guidance in daily life, the Jew relied on what he had been taught by his parents and teachers and on recent legal codes that adapted the requirements of the law to contemporary conditions and dominant ethical views. In the matter of theoretical concepts, beliefs, and opinions, no binding principles were ever established, although there were certain dogmatic assumptions that violation of which was considered heresy. Within the constraints of these assumptions, the faithful were free to interpret the tradition themselves; indeed, preachers in every generation devoted unbounded energy to making the sources--even the most bizarre legends to be found in them--correspond to the demands of reason. (unquote). (pp. 16-17).The author places all this in the context of the changes in the environment of the Jews, from a pagan one to a Christian and, later, also Muslim one, as elaborated in his earlier book [See my detailed review of]: Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica, 3), which includes a Talmud apologetic. In my review of this item, I also critique Katz' apologetic.ANDREAS EISENMENGER AND HIS Entdecktes Judenthum: BROADER ISSUESKatz would essentially have us believe that, sometime after the Talmud was completely written down about 1,500 years ago, the Jews underwent a complete metamorphosis, effecting a complete makeover of their understanding of the Talmud. Following Katz' reasoning, one can think of a ""Talmudic Newspeak"" that had replaced the classic ""Talmudic Oldspeak"". (my terms, not Katz'). On this basis, the Talmud does not say what a straightforward reading of it would indicate. In fact, Katz asserts that Andreas Eisenmenger had a solid grasp of the content of the Talmud, but was also completely wrong about what it meant to Jews. (p. 14). That is because Eisenmenger, and other critics of the Talmud, were reading it through the lenses of ""Talmudic Oldspeak"".HOW FAR DO HALAKHIC RULINGS GO?There are numerous unmentioned problems with attempting to nullify the antigoyism of the Talmud by invoking medieval halakhic rulings on this subject. To begin with, there is no sharp boundary between the implications of rabbinical halakhic rulings and the implications of direct intervention of Christian censors. As for halakhic rulings themselves, some are based on sound halakhic principles, while others are an ad hoc concession to circumstances. One rabbi's halakhic ruling does not have to be obeyed by, or even known to, another rabbi. Finally, Talmudic glosses act to distort the meaning of teachings--for instance, the arbitrary substitution of ""Canaanites"" for Gentiles, in BABA KAMA 113b, on the permissibility of not returning the gentile's lost item or overpayment. For details on all this, and more, please see the following online article by David Goldstein, ""A Lonely Champion of Tolerance: R. Menachem ha-Meiri's Attitude Towards Non-Jews"".OTHER LIMITATIONS OF HALAKHIC RULINGS ON THE TALMUDThe author touches on nonliteral statements, such as the ones about God studying the Torah or wrapping Himself in a prayer shawl. (p. 17). These are, or should be, intuitively obvious.However, nonliteral interpretations must have a limit somewhere, and it is unclear where these limits are located. The author suggests that verses such as ""a Gentile who observes the Sabbath deserves death"" or ""a Gentile who studies the Torah deserves death"", in Talmudic usage, were nonliteral. They mean nothing more than a severe condemnation. (p. 19). However, Katz leaves the reader hanging. On what basis was it decided that it was nonliteral, and who made that determination? [I am asking a probing question; I am not insinuating that Jews kill others.]The literal/nonliteral situation has other implications not considered by Katz. It adopts a pick-and-choose approach to ancient texts, and raises the question if ""Talmudic Newspeak"" can actually be so easily dichotomized from ""Talmudic Oldspeak."" In addition, saying that something is nonliteral can be a facile explanation for the dismissal of any inconvenient verse. Finally, if the exclusivist or controversial verses in the Talmud are nonliteral, then what prevents the humanitarian teachings of the Talmud--at least theoretically--from also being nonliteral?CONTRAINDICATIONS TO KATZ' IDEAS ABOUT THE TALMUDKatz' apologetic for the Talmud is contradicted by quite a few Jews who, even in recent centuries, have testified that normative Jewish interpretation of the Talmud does in fact include some embrace of its Jewish supremacism and antigoyism. Was every single one of them untruthful? For Katz to be correct, the answer would have to be ""yes"".The informed reader probably realizes that there ARE informed Jews, even today, who accept the controversial Talmudic verses just as they are written. The best known of these is probably the late Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, a Talmudic scholar who can hardly be accused of ignorance of the Talmud or of past halakhic rulings on gentiles and the Talmud. Yet he taught that the GOYIM are effectively donkeys that exist to serve Jews. The standard explanation is that Yosef was a singularity. Is he? How many other rabbis have similar views, but do not verbalize them, at least to non-Jews? If a researcher were to do an anonymous survey of Talmud-informed rabbis and ordinary Jews today, what percentage of them would more-or-less agree with Yosef? What would the corresponding percentages be for the Talmud-informed rabbis and ordinary Jews of 100 years ago? 500 years ago? 1,000 years ago?Until the foregoing questions can be definitively answered, and backed up with solid evidence, the rather overgeneralized arguments of Katz should be treated by the reader with caution.IMPLICATIONS OF KATZ' IDEAS ABOUT THE TALMUDLet us conclude, however, by assuming that Katz' general reasoning is correct. If so, the reader will have to evaluate the implications of the following considerations, none of which are mentioned by Katz:Halakhic rulings can only do so much. Literature does not have to be literally true, or to be precisely relevant to the present time, in order to be able to move the reader, and to create or reinforce prejudices. How can a Jewish person read the Jewish supremacist and anti-gentile verses in the Talmud and not be influenced by them--even if he/she believes that they are nonliteral, nonbinding, and inapplicable since ancient times?In fact, this very consideration was tacitly recognized even in very recent times. In the 20th century, the relevant Jewish prayer, the Alenu, was deliberately changed, in Reconstructionist Judaism, in order to eliminate the admitted Jewish superiority and the admitted invidious contrast of Jews and non-Jews, which are partly based on the Talmud.

"My review is based on the original 1921 edition. Talmudic scholar Abraham Cohen provides the reader with the entire Tractate Berakot in a handy single volume, and provides brief notes and commentary. This is in the form of small side-notes and brief footnotes. As told by the author, the Tractate commonly features feasts and benedictions. I focus on a few salient topics of lasting interest.By way of introduction, Cohen comments (quote) The Rabbis were not only theologians; they were principally ecclesiastical lawyers. This was necessarily so, because Rabbinic Judaism aimed at controlling the whole life of its adherents. (unquote). (p. xxix).BERACHOT 32bThe following series of passages is quoted in its entirety so that the reader can see the full context. (Quote) ""But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me"" (Is. xlix. 14). But a woman forsaken is the same as a woman forgotten! R. Simeon b. Lakish said: The community spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Lord of the universe! Should a man marry a woman after his first wife, he remembers the deeds of the first; but Thou has forsaken me and forgotten me!"" The Holy One, blessed is He, replied, ""My daughter, twelve constellations have I created in the firmament, and for each constellation I have created thirty hosts, and for each host I have created thirty legions, and for each legion I have created thirty files, and for each file I have created thirty cohorts, and for each cohort I have created thirty camps, and in each camp I have suspended three hundred and sixty-five thousands myriads of stars, in accordance with the days of the solar year, and all of them have I only created for thy sake; and yet thou sayest, ""Thou hast forsaken me, Thou hast forgotten me""! ""Can a woman forget her sucking child (ULAH)?"" (Is. xlix. 15). (unquote). (pp. 216-217). [The online Babylonian Talmud (Soncino Edition) is very similar in these verses, with Berakoth 32b including the following wording: ....and all of them I have created only for thy sake...]ANALYSIS OF BERACHOT 32bIn dealing with controversial passages in the Talmud, I follow a Judeo-realist approach. In doing so, I try my best to avoid the extremes of anti-Semitism (making false or unsubstantiated accusations against Jews) and philo-Semitism (treating Jews as incapable of wrong thinking or action.). That is where I stand. Take it or leave it.The biblical passages quoted above, Isaiah 49:14-15, present a beautiful picture of God being no more capable of forgetting the Jewish people than a mother would be capable of forgetting her nursing child. They are more than sufficient to capture the essence of God's unending care for the Jewish people. The Talmudic statement, quoted above, and which is inserted between the quote of Isaiah 49:14 and Isaiah 49:15, is something quite different. It clearly elevates the Jews, to a supreme position, above all other peoples.For a Jewish analysis of Berachoth 32b, see Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American-Jewish Life, and read my detailed review (of March 12, 2015). The conclusion of this analysis can be summarized as follows: In the Old Testament, God does not specify His reasons for creating the Earth and the stars. Consequently the notion, of God creating the Earth and the stars for the Jews, is recognizably a groundbreaking excursion of Jewish Chosenness.There are other implications. To believe that ""Jews are the Chosen people"" means that Jews have the duty of obeying 613 Laws (p. xxxiv), while Gentiles only have to obey the 7 Noahide Laws, is one thing. To believe that ""Jews are the Chosen people"" means that God had created the stars exclusively for the Jews, is quite another. It partakes of Jewish elitism, and means that Jewish Chosenness now involves the bestowing of expansive privileges to the Jews.In addition, the ""Stars were created for the Jews, and only for the Jews"" notion is racist on its face. Imagine a white supremacist suggesting that God created the stars for white people, and only for white people. The creation of the stars exclusively for the Jews does not shed its racist character merely by being presented as an expression of God's care for the Jews, any more than its Caucasian counterpart would shed its racist character by being presented as an expression of God's care for white people.Moreover, Berachoth 32b is no isolated instance of Jewish supremacist thinking, even solely in terms of God's creative acts. It follows a theme, in rabbinical literature, wherein Jews are portrayed as effectively the Master Race in that everything that God had created (not only the stars), He had explicitly created for the Jews. For more on this, please click on, and read my detailed review, of Abraham Cohen's Everyman's Talmud: The Major Teachings of the Rabbinic Sages (My review was posted July 29, 2015).BERAKOTH 58aThe following series of passages is quoted in its entirety so that the reader can see the full context. (Quote) R. Shela flogged a certain man who had had intercourse with a gentile woman; so he went and laid a charge against him before the king, saying, ""There is a certain Jew who judges without the king's consent."" The king sent an official for him [to appear]. When R. Shela came he was asked, ""For what reason didst thou flog this person?"" He replied, ""Because had had intercourse with a she-ass."" They said to him, ""Hast thou witnesses?"" He answered, ""Yes."" Elijah came in human guise and gave evidence. (unquote). (p. 382).Author Abraham Cohen points out that some versions substitute ""Egyptian"" for ""gentile"" out of fear of the Censor. (p. 382). Otherwise, the online Babylonian Talmud (Soncino Version) is very similar as per these verses.A comparable juxtaposition of gentiles and donkeys can be found in Berachot 25b, and elsewhere in the Talmud. Clearly, this is part of a consistent pattern, and it therefore cannot be said that some rabbinical author had merely misspoken, had uttered words in anger, had merely been giving his personal opinion, or had been misread.ANALYSIS OF BERAKOTH 58aTo learn how Jews actually understand these verses, I have examined the online Talmud apologetic, ""The Real Truth About the Talmud"", specifically the ""Gentiles Are Human"" article therein.The author of the apologetic tells us of Talmudic passages that indicate that gentiles are fully human. His argument assumes NV [see first comment] which, if valid, only dispenses with the literal aspects of the donkey-GOYIM equation.The author of the apologetic states that the cross-reference to Ezekiel 23:20, on the ""flesh of donkeys"", had been broadened to refer to all gentiles. However, he not explain why this had been done by the rabbis.The apologist's analysis relies, in part, to the ideas of Talmudic scholar R. Chaim Soloveitchik. It would essentially have us believe that the passages were only intended to teach us that Jews and gentiles are maritally and sexually incompatible, and that a Jewish-gentile union has no legal standing in Jewish law.This apologetic confuses the issue, which is not the inappropriateness of Jew-gentile marital unions, but is something quite different--the conflation of gentiles and donkeys. Besides, the rabbinic author was perfectly capable of expressing his objection to Jewish-gentile marriages without dragging the donkey-GOY equation into the picture.Surely the rabbis who repeatedly equated GOYIM and the animals, throughout the Talmud, were fully cognizant of the fact that the juxtaposition of humans with animals is derogatory in nature. Even a child would know that!The racist antigoyism is palpable, and is inescapable. Imagine the white racialist objecting to interracial marriage by saying that a white marrying a black is comparable to a white marrying a donkey. In addition, the racist character of the equation is unchanged by the fact that it is framed in terms of its non-literalness, and in terms of the opined unique value of white-on-white marriages, or the lack of standing of white-black marriages.The issue is clear: The preservation of Jewish distinctiveness is one thing. A condescending attitude towards non-Jews is quite another.MENTIONS OF CHRISTIANITY IN TRACTATE BERAKOTHAlthough he does not go into any detail on this subject, Talmudic scholar Abraham Cohen parts ways with those who say that the Talmud has nothing to say about Christianity. He also validates the work of R. T. Herford, CHRISTIANITY IN TALMUD AND MIDRASH, by referring to its identifications of often-Censored allusions to Christianity in Tractate Berakot. (p. 113 [referring to 17a] and 189 [referring to 28b]). He also mentions Berakoth 7a, without relying on Herford, as alluding to Christianity. (p. 37).Cohen also rejects those who say that MIN/MINIM never refers to Christians. Based again on Herford, he defines the term as follows, (quote) A heretic, especially the early Jewish-Christian. (unquote). (p. 429).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAZ70MT1NT2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1140014501#wasThisHelpful","R2FAZ70MT1NT2G","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"British historian Alexander Bruce Boswell has written this 10-page pamphlet on Poland's eastern half (the KRESY). It had been annexed by the USSR during the 1939 German-Soviet conquest of Poland, and was later given away to the Soviet Union, by Churchill and Roosevelt, at Teheran in 1943.The author stresses the Polish majorities of many cities and towns in the Kresy, especially the larger ones. He also focuses on the economic importance of the Kresy to Poland. These territories accounted typically for at least 40% of many specified crops. (p. 9). Also, 59% of Poland's forests are there.Countless Polish luminaries came from the Kresy: King Jan Sobieski, Jozef Pilsudski, Ignacy Paderewski, Joseph Conrad, Adam Mickiewicz, Julius Slowacki, and many others. (p. 10).What about those in the Kresy--the majority--who are not ethnic Poles? What about the self-determination of peoples? Boswell quotes from the newspaper of the Ukrainian National Alliance (of the USA), SVOBODA, in which an article says that, had there been genuine free elections in the Kresy, no more than 10% of the population would have voted for incorporation into the Soviet Union.

"My review is based on the two-volumes-in-one 1968 reprint of the 1888 reprinted edition of the 1832 work. Each volume uses separate pagination.POLAND MORE ""EGALITARIAN"" THAN OTHER NATIONS OF THE TIMEMuch anti-Polish propaganda at the time of the Partitions (and later!) centered on horror stories about Poland’s feudal class structure. Ironically, the accusers were the main offenders.Editor Adam Gielgud alludes to the fact that the Polish nobility constituted a much higher share of the total population than the nobility of other nations. He comments, “It is a common mistake among Englishmen to talk of Poland as ‘an aristocratic republic’. The so-called nobles did not form an aristocracy in our sense of the term, but consisted of all those who had political privileges. In the eighteenth century they numbered one-fifth of the population—a proportion considerably greater than that of the electorate to the population in England, even after the first Reform Bill.” (Vol. 1, p. 3).  [This comes out to 20%. Other sources give the Polish nobility at lower levels, 10%-12% of the Polish population, but still considerably higher than the 1%-2% of their counterparts in other European nations.] Let us keep all this in perspective. We can consider the end of serfdom as a progressive ennobling of more and more of the population. Nowadays, there are no more serfs, because we ALL are nobles. That is, we all have the right to vote and the right to own property. We all (at least theoretically) have a right to literacy and education, and a reasonably high standard of living.Editor Gielgud mentions one advantage that Polish serfs had over Russian serfs. He writes, “Serfage properly so called, i. e., the right of selling a peasant as part of one’s property, never existed in Poland; it was a purely Russian institution.” (Vol. 1, p. 91).Now consider the famous May 3, 1791 Constitution. The editor mentions those who reject the contention that it did nothing substantial for the enserfed peasantry. He comments, “…Volney remarked that Poland was the only country of Northern Europe which had ameliorated the hard lot of its peasantry.” (Vol. 1, p. 53).Adam Czartoryski mentions some of those directly involved in the landmark May 3, 1791 Constitution: Count Potocki, Count Thaddeus Mostowski, Julian Niemowicz; Mayor of Warsaw Zakrzewski, General Sokolnicki, master bootmaker Kilinski, and money-changer Kapostasz. (Volume 1, pp. 149-150).IMPLICATIONS OF THE PARTITIONSPrince Adam Czartoryski referred to the infamous Conference at Targowica as the “fatal league.” (Vol. 1, p. 84). Otherwise, relatively little of these volumes refer to the period of the Partitions. (1772-1794).Both the editor and Czartoryski refer to the fact that the Russians punished Polish patriots by seizing their estates and giving them mostly to Russians, and sending these Poles to Siberia. (Vol. 1, pp. 67-68, 74, 90-91, 93-94, 275).Most of the content of the volumes refers to Czartoryski’s international contacts, and to his efforts on behalf of winning concessions for Poland.CZARTORYSKI'S CONTACTS WITH TSAR ALEXANDER IPrince Adam Czartoryski alludes to his personal conflict between his devotion to Poland and his fraternization with the Emperor of Russia. (Vol. 1, pp. 329-on). Tsar Alexander I was widely considered a “liberal”, and one who might be amenable to the voluntary restoration of at least some of Poland’s rights as a nation.It was not to be. Both the editor and Czartoryski refer to the fact that Tsar Alexander I was insincere in his apparent conciliatory attitude towards Poland, and that even his “liberalism” evaporated with time. (Vol. 2, p. 205, 209, 313). Because of this, Czartoryski eventually dropped all contact with the Tsar.SIDING WITH NAPOLEONSo how was Poland to regain her independence? The author defended Poland’s alliance with Napoleon against Russia. He rejected the charge that Poland is supporting Bonaparte’s oppressive policies, pointing out that these are, first of all, dwarfed by the oppressive polices previously practiced by the Powers that had partitioned Poland. (Vol. 2, p. 208). In addition, Poles condemn Napoleon’s policies against nations, and pity the Spaniards, but, “…no nation can be expected to commit suicide in order that other nations be benefited. The Poles regret the necessity of their being attached to Napoleon’s fortunes, but they cannot refuse benefits at his hands which are not offered them by anyone else.” (Vol. 2, p. 209).Napoleon failed. Poles then turned to other efforts. After the fall of the Poles’ November 1830 Insurrection, Prince Adam Czartoryski, who had fought in the ranks of the insurgents, was forced to flee into exile. (Vol. 2, p. 315).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMJ8B0VMUBID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092I743M#wasThisHelpful","R2SMJ8B0VMUBID","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author A. Bruce Boswell was Professor of Russian at the University of Liverpool at the time of this work (1941). This short 32-page pamphlet is packed with information.I focus on a few themes, notably Boswell's detailed analysis of the long history of Polonophobia and defamation of Poland. This has very much relevance today. Astonishingly the same age-old anti-Polish propaganda is nowadays recycled, modernized, and used for the ""Politics of Shame"" to intimidate Poland into paying off the extortionist claims of the Holocaust Industry. It is also used to assist in the transformation of Poland into a mere province of the European Union, the inducing of Poles to despise their history so that they are easier to control by the powers that be, etc. For one reason or another, Poland is to be delegitimized.ANTI-POLISH PROPAGANDA THEMES AT THE TIME OF THE PARTITIONS(Quote) Propaganda was more pronounced after the Partitions in justification of action already taken. It was, as in our own day, illogical, untrue and self-contradictory. Poland was blamed for her conservatism in preserving the ""golden liberty"" of her gentry at a time when both Russia and Prussia were maintaining that liberty in order to prevent Poland strengthening herself by reforms. She was accused of anarchy, Jacobinism, violence and militarism, as well as of reaction, pacifism and intolerance. These curious and paradoxical attacks on Poland were maintained till our own day, i. e. for 170 years. They were carefully preserved, strengthened by the additions of scholars and military men, and so systematically spread that they gained credence with the general body of European people who knew nothing of Poland, as there was no Polish State, no official representatives and no free press to deny them. Among the more famous supporters of anti-Polish propaganda, it is strange to find Voltaire, Carlyle and several eminent English Liberals in the twentieth century. (unquote). (pp. 11-12).ANTI-POLISH PROPAGANDA CONFESSEDLY HAD LONG DOMINATED BRITISH THINKINGBritish author Boswell admits that, until recent times (WWI), the British view of Poland had been derived from German propaganda about Poland. He writes, (quote) Before 1914 few Englishmen had ever read Polish history in the original Polish. Mention of Poland was either absent from our books or consisted of a few conventional remarks. An analysis of most of these remarks shows that they can be traced back to a defense of Prussian diplomacy by the followers of Frederick the Great and to variations on the same theme by later writers, among whom Thomas Carlyle was the most fervent. Poland comes into our history and political outlook as the idle apprentice whose sins bring him to the scaffold, and whose career is contrasted, not with the virtuous life of England, but, significantly, with the success of Prussia, the good boy of our historians before 1914. (unquote). (p. 3).ANTI-POLISH PROPAGANDA RE-USED AGAINST THE SECOND POLISH REPUBLIC (1918-1939)Quote) The second feature is the revival in all its force of propaganda. But this time Germany and Russia were both socialist republics, so all efforts are concentrated on making Poland appear reactionary, aggressive and militarist. Also hints of older propaganda appeared--that Poland was inefficient and unable to remain an independent State. Most of it was ridiculous...But, believed, and Poland was once more the Bad Boy of Europe. (unquote). (p. 26).The informed reader realizes that the same propaganda was later used to justify the Communist puppet government over Poland---by making pre-WWII Poland look as terrible as possible. It later also became part of Holocaustspeak---in order to make Poland seem one in spirit, if not action, with the Nazi German-made Shoah.THE FAULTS OF POLAND'S NOBILITY: NOT THE DECIDING ELEMENT IN POLAND'S DECLINE AND FALLThe author keeps Poland's feudal social structure, as specifically applicable to the last century or so before the Partitions, in perspective, (quote) While clinging passionately to the ""golden liberty"" of the old times, the gentry lost their equality, their civic sense of responsibility and became parochial, corrupt, and obscurantist. It is possible that the faults of the Polish gentry were common to all such classes in the eighteenth century. Pride of class, ignorance, faction fighting were common in France and Germany. The English gentry were just as selfish and corrupt as the SZLACHTA. But most countries had a central administration run by a body of experts, whereas in Poland the legislature, run by the general body of gentry, was supreme. (unquote).(p. 9).The LIBERUM VETO, first used in 1652, had originally been a good thing, in that it had served as a democratic safeguard. It only became a problem when it became constantly used, and abused, by the Polish nobility, in the 1700's. (p. 9).THE END OF SERFDOMThe author assesses the end of Poland's feudal structure as follows, (quote) Serfdom was now abolished in all parts of Poland. The emancipation promised by Kosciuszko in 1794 had been delayed by the Partitioning Powers till 1823 in Prussia, 1848 in Austria, and 1864 in Russia. (unquote). (p. 20).JEWS--GOOD FOR POLAND OR BAD FOR POLAND?Boswell takes a middle view on this question. He writes, (quote) From the Charter of 1364, the Jews were given the right to settle, to speak Hebrew or Yiddish, to practice their own religion and maintain their own schools, which they never lost. They gave Poland skilled middlemen and artificers, who made an important contribution to her economic life; but at the same time they hampered the rise of a national middle class and formed an alien body in the Polish community, presenting problems, particularly in the days of oppression by Russia, which grew greater as modern nationalist feeling grew up. (unquote).(pp. 5-6).Fast forward to the 19th century, and especially as applicable to Prussian-ruled Poland. Boswell comments, (quote) One great weakness in Poland had been the dependence of landowner and peasant on the Jewish moneylender and German capital. (unquote). (p. 22).Fast forward again--this time to interwar Poland. The author identifies the reason behind the much-condemned NUMERUS CLAUSUS of Jewish students at Polish universities. It was not because Poles were mean and anti-Semitic. It was because the Jewish students had, (quote) ...poured into the universities in such large masses that their numbers were limited by the authorities. (unquote). (p. 28).POLISH ROMANTICISM: THE ""HEROIC NARRATIVE"" AND POLAND AS THE ""JESUS CHRIST OF NATIONS""Nowadays, the theme of Poles thinking themselves as the ""Jesus Christ of Nations"", or thinking in terms of the ""heroic narrative"", is much overemphasized by the critics of Poland. This is done especially by those who want to depreciate her sufferings in favor of those of the Jews under the Nazi Germans, and to make Poland the ""bad guy"" in Polish-Jewish relations.Ironic to those who keep shooting this dead horse, the Polish Romanticist view of Polish suffering had largely disappeared long ago. Moreover, it had largely been replaced by practical nation-building initiatives (see section below).On the fact of the temporary hold, on the Polish mind, of ""Jesus Christ of Nations"", Boswell comments, (quote) Themes of revenge, the theory of a Messianic mission of Poland, unscientific views of Polish history had their day and fanned the flame of rebellion at home. Practical workers or believers in compromise were unpopular beside the glittering visions of the romantics. The failures of 1848 and the futile guerrilla war of 1863 brought an end to these dreams. (unquote). (p. 19).POLITICAL REALISM AND THE EXEMPLARY WORK OF PIOTR WAWRZYNIAKContrary to the mischaracterization of Poland as a land of romantics, Boswell tells the reader much about Polish long-term nation-building work. This was notably true of Polish priest Piotr Wawrzyniak, whose successes are detailed on pp. 22-23 of this book. For instance, by 1912, there were 197 Co-operative Societies with a membership of 121,875, involving Polish bankers, administrators, and various experts.

"My review is based on the original 1900 edition. Most of this work deals with family matters and personages, as seen by the author, and not historical events per se. Nevertheless, I focus on the latter.The author takes pride in the fact that her father was one of the nobles who refused to sign what she calls the ""iniquitous document"" dictated to the Targowica Confederation by Russia. In retaliation, his fortune was sequestered. (p. 15). [This raises the question: To what extent were the signees traitors who had willingly betrayed Poland for the sake of their personal self-interest, and to what extent had they been manipulated or forced by the Russians to do so.]Countess Potocka, as a little girl, was an eyewitness to the ghastly Russian massacre of Poles at Praga (eastern Warsaw) in November 1794. She puts the death toll at 9,000. (pp. 7-8). [Other sources say 20,000].The author was always well-respected by Napoleon. (p. 85). She reveled in the valor of the Polish forces in Napoleon's army, notably in its taking of Smolensk. (p. 196). However, it was not to be.Countess Potocka assessed the Duchy of Warsaw as follows, ""The form of government instituted by Napoleon very closely resembled that of all the Rhenish countries. We had a council, composed of seven ministers and a president. This hierarchy, to all appearances entirely national, was in reality subject to the influence of the French resident, a veritable proconsul, who exercised an almost boundless power."" (p. 182).Following the defeat of Napoleon, Kosciuszko wrote an 1815 letter (reproduced by Potocka: pp. 225-226) to Tsar Alexander I. In it, Kosciuszko requested unrestricted amnesty for the Poles, the establishment of schools for the peasants of Poland, and the abolition of serfdom (with rights to land ownership) in ten years. [Does her inclusion of this letter, especially the part about the emancipation of the peasantry, imply that Countess Potocka favored the abolition of serfdom right then and there?]The author assesses Prince Czartoryski and his contacts with Tsar Alexander I. She characterizes Czartoryski as a man of great integrity and erudition, and one known for his civic virtues. (pp. 240-241). She opines that Czartoryski, though well-intentioned and zealous in his efforts on behalf of Poland (p. 231), had been blinded by illusion. (p. 230). Finally, she suspects that Tsar Alexander I had never been sincerely friendly to Poland to begin with. Thus, it would not be correct to say that Alexander I had merely backed off in the face of Russian criticism of his apparent partiality to Poles. (p. 235).Towards the end of this memoir, Countess Potocka testifies that she finds it difficult to write because of her sorrows over the misfortunes of Poland. (p. 252).For another memoir by a member of the Potocki family, which is especially interesting in that it shows how the Polish landowner sought to move beyond the estate-based feudal system, see, and read my review of, Master of Lancut : the memoirs of Count Alfred Potocki.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFC4WS31CCKUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1169775659#wasThisHelpful","RFC4WS31CCKUZ","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"British author John Thomas James describes his 1813-1814 travels to several countries in Europe. My review is based on the original 1827 edition of this two-volume work. Owing to my personal interest, this review is limited to James’ visit to Poland. At the time of the visit, Poland had recently been Partitioned. The author spent much of his time in Austrian- and Russian-ruled Poland.All of the following page citations are from the second volume of this work.The author called attention to the heroism of the Kosciuszko-led peasant uprising of 1794. (p. 413). He focused on important noble families in Poland, such as the House of Lubomirski, Czartoryski, Sapieha, and Potocki. He found the Poles a generally hospitable people. (p. 390).THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWSThe author refers to the trades, practiced by the Jews, a number of times. His experience at Volhynia, in Russian-ruled Poland, near the town of Ostrog, is instructive. He writes, (quote) …the accommodation too afforded us at the inns was every where excellent, and the venal Jews usually surround the stranger in crowds with samples of their articles for sale, giving to understand that money will command every thing, even to the services of their wives and daughters. (unquote). (p. 368).As for the ethical behavior of the Jewish middleman, author John Thomas James takes a middle view, as he comments, (quote) Wheat is never grown but with this view, and often left to spoil or waste if no opportunity of sale occurs: yet it would be difficult to say at what price it is generally afforded, for all advices are here received from the lower country through the hands of the Jews, who are the factors, and as selling prices vary not only in proportion to the urgency or slackness of the demand, but also to the honest or roguish representations of the above persons, the fluctuations in the same year are innumerable.

"My review is based on the 1970 reprint of the original 1816 book. It describes the British author’s visits of Russia and Russian-ruled Poland, which took place less than twenty years after the last Partition of Poland, and only some two years after Napoleon’s defeat. In fact, the author refers to sites of combat, and the local damage caused by the war, a number of times. (pp. 297-on, pp. 337-on). The author met with a small party of Polish officers that had served in Napoleon’s army. (p. 359).POLAND'S PARTITIONS: THE AFTERMATHJohnston lamented Poland’s fate, (quote) The fate of Poland must ever excite sympathy. With all the materials of freedom, independence, and glory, she has sunk to nothing;--her name is scarcely known among nations; and those very materials, which once constituted her pride, now constitute her misery. (unquote). (p. 383).The author eventually visited Warsaw. He found the city to be, in some ways, more singular and picturesque than Moscow. (p. 375). He condemned Russia for the massacre of Poles in 1794. (p. 374, 378).Robert A. Johnston found Poland’s culture and traditions magnificent. He challenged Poles to break the Russian yoke, and expressed confidence that they would. (p. 378, 384).POLISH FEUDAL CLASS STRUCTUREThe author describes Polish nobility as well-dressed (p. 345), and frequently refers admirably to the buildings that belong to the nobles. He depicts the serfs as ones that usually owe their labor to an agent or lessee, and not directly to the proprietor. (p. 389). Nowhere does visitor Robert A. Johnston ever repeat the stereotype of the Polish nobility being particularly harsh to the serfs.The author provides little detail about Poland’s magnates. However, the Czartoryski family is said to own land that is nearly in size to a fourth of the territory of Scotland. (p. 390).TWO SIDES TO POLISH ANTI-SEMITISMThe standard narrative is quite familiar to the informed reader. Volumes upon volumes of books have been written, in recent decades, mainly by Jewish authors, about Polish anti-Semitism, and they always blame Polish anti-Semitism entirely on the Poles. This standard narrative also blames Christianity (especially the idea of Deicide) for centuries of hostility to Jews, and even for the eventual Holocaust.The information in this book, which is based on the author’s direct experiences and not on what somebody told him, though not pleasant reading and definitely not politically correct, admits a challenge to the standard narrative. It is for this reason, and only for this reason, that I bring up this distasteful information.The following material refers geographically to the Kresy, primarily to what is now Belarus. I now let the author speak for himself without comment:DIRECT QUOTES FROM AUTHOR ROBERT A. JOHNSTON ON HIS EXPERIENCES WITH JEWS[AT ORCHA]. The greater part of the town has been burnt: its population is about two thousand, and consists mostly of Jews; a more despicable, artificial, mercenary set of wretches cannot be seen; they are without character, without patriotism, and without manners. [p. 331][AT KROUPKI]. The houses are entirely of wood, with a population of about three hundred Jews. We were detained the whole day before the Jews would give us horses. They disregarded the Russian order for horses, and nothing could equal their knavery and extortion. In most countries Jews are perfectly alike; but in none perhaps do they excel more, in knavery, than here. Every traveler must bargain for what horses he requires, and is sure of being imposed upon;—there is no appeal, and he must be at the mercy of these imposters. The instant he arrives, he is assured that there are no horses to be procured—shortly after he is asked what price he would give for them, and a price is demanded in proportion to the haste of the traveler to proceed. At night they invariably deny having horses, in order that the traveler might be detained, and pay lodging money, or more likely, be robbed. [p. 334][AT MINSK]. The population is about seven thousand, of which about three thousand are Jews. Of the lower classes, the Jews are the most filthy and the most annoying; it is impossible to avoid the pestilential intrusion of these groveling reptiles. The moment a traveler arrives, he becomes haunted by them—he cannot stir without being watched. Every Jew employs a vagabond to ply in the streets and solicit the custom of the stranger; his house is ready on all occasions, for an hotel, or any thing else, no matter how base! On entering the town we had great difficulty in finding an hotel to breakfast in, every house being crowded by the military. Jews innumerably flocked around and invited us; one of them begged us to enter his house, with the utmost obsequiousness; but at the door demanded sixteen roubles for the use of a room. Fortunately, we found a German, less imposing, and here we were lodged in a common billiard room, and slept on the long benches, amidst all the noise, filth, and vociferation of the gambling Jews and Lithuanians. [p. 343][AT MINSK]. We were detained in this place several hours to repair the damages our carriage had received and met with several traits of the Jewish character. For the next stage they demanded as many roubles as what we had agreed to give for the former ones; this is a common piece of imposition with the Jews, a charge was also made for the time the carriage had occupied the stable, and a still more extraordinary demand was made for a few blows which one of our servants had given the Jew at the time he overturned the carriage! The greatest confusion and vociferation prevailed. The Jews had just quitted their morning prayers, and entered the stable in a brody. One half spoke the Hebrew tongue, another the Lithuanian dialect, and German, French, and English, added to the noise. The glimmering rays of the carriage lamp were feebly thrown over this motley group, and never did a scene of such confusion prevail. At length the dispute was settled by money, the only power the Jews would submit to. [p. 348][NEAR KORELITZI]. At sunset we left this village, and had not proceeded more than seven wersts, when, on descending a steep hill, we felt one of the carriage wheels giving way, in consequence of the damage it had received the night before, and the rapid manner in which we had driven during the night. Shortly after we had procured a light, and examined the extent of the damage, a band of Lithuanian Jews arrived, and offered their assistance. The wheel was taken off, and the carriage dragged to a solitary house named Pollanna, in a lonely, wild and sequestered vale; here our perplexities were increased, for no sooner had the Jews and their associates got possession of the wheel, than it was stolen;--neither threats nor reward could induce them to restore it. Hitherto we had traveled by night, as well as by day, among hordes of Cossacks, through endless forests and marshes, over hill and dale, and never met with an obstacle which could retard our progress; but such a check given to our speed made us feel the inconvenience of being in the wilds of Lithuania, among Jews, whom we knew both by report and experience would rob us, and who had been accustomed to attack and plunder the wretched French soldiers. [p. 353][NEAR KORELITZI]. We now dispatched our servant to Korelitzi, for the assistance of the police, and had, during the night, agreed to all the exorbitant demands of the Jews, who demanded sixty-three roubles for the horses standing in the stable, and ten more for the use of the posts which supported the carriage! When the police officer arrived every one had disappeared, and the Jew was most submissively content to receive seven roubles, and to permit us to retain the plank which supported the carriage. [p. 355][AT NOVOGRODEK]. The scene of our entering Novogrodec, with the carriage supported on a plan, and with only three wheels, was a source of infinite amusement to the inhabitants. As usual we were surrounded by Jews. [p. 356]JEWISH ECONOMIC AUTONOMYAccording to the standard narrative (or exculpation), Jews were essentially servants of powerful individuals, be they the Polish nobility or Russian government officials. Jews merely transmitted the exploitative policies of these powerful non-Jewish leaders onto the masses.The foregoing quoted statements challenge this narrative. One can immediately see the freedom that the Jews enjoyed, notably in economic matters. In addition, the intervention of the police official, against the Jews and on behalf of the traveler Johnston, points to the fact that, far from setting Jews upon non-Jews, those in authority over the Jews acted to constrain Jewish conduct.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R402KB5RX2871/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H061QM#wasThisHelpful","R402KB5RX2871","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very detailed work which contains much technical detail. The title, MEN OF SILK (Kitajcy), stems from the fact that Hasidim commonly wore silk in order to avoid wearing wool—in which there was the danger of some linen threads being mixed in with the wool threads. (p. 2, 61).Much of what has been written about the Hasidim has tended to be written by their opponents. The author, instead, emphasizes the use of archival information to support his conclusions. Based on this, he tends to find the differences between the Hasidim and the Mitnaggdim to be less pronounced than commonly reckoned, and for the ways of the Hasidim to be less commonly esoteric than commonly supposed.Not all of the Maskilim (enlightened Jews) were negatively oriented towards Hasidism. Some of the Maskilim praised this movement for its sense of community, its love for the poor, and its devotion to the Jewish people. As for the objectionable resistance to reform, this hostility to innovation was not limited to some of the Hasidim. It was equally true of some of the Mitnaggdim and their “zealous Talmudism”. (p. 161).Author Glenn Dynner finds parallels between the Hasidim and comparable spiritual movements in Christianity, such as Pietism, Quietism, Wesleyanism, Jansenism, the Great Awakening, and the Old Believers. However, he sees no cause-effect relationship between these developments in Judaism and Christianity. Instead, both trends developed in parallel, according to the ZEITGEIST. This, in turn, was not a reaction to the Enlightenment but rather a sharing with the Enlightenment--of the spirit of individual independence of thought and feeling in matters of the spirit. (pp. 16-17).Now let us consider religious dissent and the Inquisition. The political and religious establishment of Poland was, if anything, harsher towards unconventional religious expression among Catholics than among Jews. Dynner remarks, (quote) These Christian cases place official treatment of Hasidism in perspective: Official concerns about fanaticism, exploitation of gullible folk, and disruptions of public order applied in both cases. If anything, the zaddikim ultimately enjoyed better treatment than Christian miracle workers. (unquote). (p. 86).Demonology existed in 17th century Polish Hasidism as well as in Polish Catholicism. Dynner (p. 143) believes that Polish demonic lore was richer than its relatively narrow and formulaic Jewish counterpart. (p. 143).I now move beyond Hasidism itself, and focus on matters of direct relevance to issues outside of Jewish religion. I use brackets to relate the information to timeless matters that go beyond the immediate purview of this book.JEWS AND THE PARTITIONS OF POLANDThe disloyalty to Poland by some of Poland’s magnates, at the infamous Conference of Targowica, is well known. However, questions have sometimes also been raised about the loyalty or otherwise of Poland’s Jews at the time of the Partitions. Although this subject is beyond the scope of this book, the author provides interesting information about one prominent Polish Jew.Enter Szmul Zbytkower. He is identified by Dynner as having an unclear attitude towards Hasidism, but one who was very wealthy. (p. 97).The author describes Zbytkower’s conduct in the period up to and including the Partitions of Poland, (quote) He [Szmul] settled in the Warsaw suburb of Praga around the age of twenty-five (i. e., 1752), and acquired his fortune by provisioning both the Polish and Russian armies with horses, grain, leather, cloth, and other goods during the struggles accompanying the partitions of Poland…As for Szmul, his double dealings and varied connections yielded houses and entire estates. He became the first Polish Jew to own real estate. The designation “court Jew” is quite appropriate in his case. Yet Szmul’s supplies to the Russian Army and the Confederacy of Targowica during the Kosciuszko insurrection left him vulnerable to charges of espionage and treachery, and led to the destruction of his tannery and confiscation of his other property. Although he was cleared of those charges by the court of the Insurrection, several historians strove to clear his name again. (unquote). (p. 98).However, there is more to this. Dynner remarks, (quote) Tadeusz Korzon argues, however, that as Jews felt no connection to Poland, there is no reason to expect patriotism from Szmul. (unquote). (p. 292).Perhaps the wrong question is being asked. Szmul Zbytkower should perhaps be best described not so much as a court Jew, but as an early version of the international Jew—one who has no loyalty to any nation, and who works with any nation that will further his influence and his wealth.JEWS AND MILITARY SERVICEThe author touches on the Jewish paying of extra taxes in exchange for being exempt from military service. This was notably true of the Tsarist Russian Empire in the early 19th century. (p. 295).THE HASIDIC MOVEMENT AND SEGREGATED SEATINGSome of the reasons that the Hasidim encountered opposition from their fellow Jews are intuitively obvious, while others are not. Dynner comments, (quote) Not surprisingly, Hasidim were confronted by formidable opponents—Jewish and non-Jewish—at every turn. Among Hasidism’s Jewish opponents, the traditionalist-oriented Mitnaggdim decried the separate Hasidic prayer quorums on the grounds that they employed ritual modifications supposedly reserved for the elite. Separate spaces for worship also undermined the local pecking order, manifested in preferred seating assignments and ritual honors in the synagogue. (unquote). (p. 59).[The informed reader may recount a more recent situation in which the question of segregated seating came up. When Poles of the 1930’s were condemned for instituting ghetto benches for Jews at Polish universities, they responded with the fact that they were only imitating the kind of segregated seating that the Jews had already been practicing for centuries.]SOCIALISM: CONTINUITY IN JEWISH FAMILIESAuthor Glenn Dynner defines the YIHUS as a rabbinical lineage—commonly found among both the Hasidim and the Mitnaggdim. (p. 80, 124). The YIHUS had a secular Jewish counterpart. Dynner comments, (quote) Interestingly enough, Jewish socialists developed their own version of YIHUS, derived from a relative’s fame as a revolutionary. (unquote). (p. 135).[Nowadays, Jews who are related to Communists (e. g., Adam Michnik vel Szechter) commonly act as though they had nothing to do with the attitudes and conduct of their relatives. While this may sometimes be true, one must not overlook the opposite tendency—of the fact of involvement in socialism (and Communism) tending to run in Jewish families, and for being honored as such.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22OEFZ8MW042U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019538265X#wasThisHelpful","R22OEFZ8MW042U","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much of the content of this book is by Joseph Tennenbaum, and is already found in his In Search Of A Lost People: The Old And New Poland (See my review). For this reason, I do not repeat it here.The book begins with the various medical specialties practiced by the Jewish physicians of pre-WWII Poland. This included psychiatry, which was dominated by Freudianism. (pp. 73-on). [The informed reader may recall that many Polish Catholics opposed Jewish influence through Freudianism, owing to its hostility to morality and religion, its tendency to lessen human responsibility for conduct, and for its pansexualism.]The authors complain about the discrimination that Jewish physicians faced in prewar Poland. However, they never tell the reader that Jewish physicians were grossly over-represented in Poland, and that Poles had enacted ""affirmative action"" policies to create more opportunities for nascent Polish physicians. One of the Jewish physicians featured in this book is the famous Ludwig Hirszfeld, who is categorized as a microbiologist. (pp. 61-62). For his perspective on the Polish discriminatory acts against Jewish physicians, please click on, and read my detailed review, of his Ludwik Hirszfeld: The Story of One Life (Rochester Studies in Medical History).GERMAN JEWS ON HITLER AND ZIONISM: REVEALING ATTITUDESThe most interesting part of this work is Tennenbaum's experience with German Jews who were trying to fit Hitler into a Zionist framework. He writes, (quote) If a personal reference may be permitted, I would like to recall that at a preliminary World Jewish Conference held in Geneva in August, 1932, I, an American citizen not of German descent, prepared a paper entitled ""The Menace of Hitlerism"". In it the basic idea was stressed that Hitlerism was a menace not merely to German Jews but to world Jewry as well. It appealed to the world not to lose sight of the fact that ""German anti-Semitism [is] an international danger signal, a prelude to social upheaval, revolution and war,"" and it called upon the whole world ""to unite in defense of civilization"". The incident is mentioned not so much for its contents, but for the reaction it elicited among the Jewish delegates from Germany, two of them outstanding personalities and Zionists. First they strongly objected that a ""foreigner"" dared to trespass upon an area that was of purely German-Jewish concern. Unable to stop the reading of the paper, they countered with a show of confidence that even ""were Hitler to succeed in government,"" a thing they vehemently discounted, ""Hitler in office will be quite tame in comparison with Hitler on the Party platform."" And anyhow, there were ""National Socialists with whom Zionists maintain friendly relations and with whom one could come to terms, if and when the most unexpected should happen."" All this occurred (lest we forget) not years but less than six months before Hitler was summoned by the aged von Hindenburg to become chancellor of Germany, ""with all the safeguards"" that the wily von Papen could suggest. The rest is history. (unquote). (p. 129).WHO WERE THE NAZIS?The nowadays-customary de-Germanization of the Nazis, and contrived dichotomy between Germans and Nazis, is nothing new. Fifty years ago, when this book was written, Germans (and some Jews) were already treating the Nazis as if they had been, in the authors' words, some kind of jack-booted Martians that had magically descended upon Germany, ruled for a while, and then magically departed. (p. 129).THE JUDENRAETE AND JEWISH GHETTO POLICEThe authors implicitly reject the contention that the conduct of the Jewish ghetto police was completely excused by the extremity of the circumstances. They comment, (quote) One of the blackest taints in ghetto life was exemplified by the Jewish ghetto police...The Jewish police constituted the immediate guardians of ""law and order"" according to the Gestapo code. Their record is tinged with shame. Their actions in seizing Jewish victims, retrieving them form their hiding places during the so-called actions, beating and harassing them and surrendering them to the Nazi henchmen is so harrowing as to make one's blood boil in indignation. (unquote). (p. 171).HOW MANY FUGITIVE JEWS IN GERMAN-OCCUPIED WARSAW?The authors claim that 20,000 to 25,000 Jews were living, in Aryan Warsaw, on ""Aryan"" papers. (p. 263). However, they venture no estimate on how many additional fugitive Jews were hiding in Warsaw without such fake identification as gentiles.COMPREHENSIVE REGISTRY OF DEATHSThe heart of this book is a name-by-name catalogue of 2,500 Jewish physicians who perished at the hands of the Nazis. One striking fact is the many physicians who committed suicide once their fate became apparent. Was it because, being physicians, they had access to, and experience with the handling of, toxic substances?The data on the fate of Jewish physicians is of uncertain credibility, and there often are contradictory versions of their deaths. For instance, consider Jecheskiel Wohl (p. 488). He is described as variously having perished in Treblinka, died in the Warsaw ghetto, and been murdered after being betrayed by a Pole while in the Aryan sector of Warsaw. The contradictory fates of Dr. Wohl remind the reader not to believe anti-Polish tales unless their veracity is independently verified, which is rarely the case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ77LZEPM5MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I4MLFU#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ77LZEPM5MX","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with other works of the POLIN series, this one presents a lot of information, but often in a skin-deep manner. I focus on a few themes.JEWS FIRST EXCLUDED THEMSELVES FROM POLANDBrian Horowitz discusses Lev Levanda (1835-1888), a leading advocate of the Russification of Poland's erstwhile Jews, and the way that he felt ambivalent towards Poland. Perhaps while not intending to, Horowitz demonstrates that Jewish attitudes towards Poland (and Russia) were governed primarily by self-interest, not stable loyalties. He writes, (quote) Levanda was not alone in siding with Russia. Many Jews in the 1840s and 1850s saw an opportunity for social advancement in the Russian educational system and little room for social mobility within Polish culture. (unquote)(p. 281).Nowadays, the Endeks are routinely condemned for their ""exclusive"" concept of what it meant to be truly Polish, and for ""excluding"" Jews from Polishness. This was just one side of the coin. The Jews, by and large, had already excluded themselves from Polishness, and had often done so long before Roman Dmowski was even born.DO JEWS PROFIT FROM WARS?There is interesting information, relevant at least to the Jews of the area around Pinsk, which inadvertently touches on the question of alleged Jewish profiteering during and after wars. Adam Teller, identified as Professor at the University of Haifa (p. 468) writes, (quote) Many Christian townspeople abandoned trade and crafts during hard times, turning to agriculture to support themselves, and they often found it difficult to pay off their debts and reassume their previous professions when peace came. This meant that the Jews were in a much better economic position in the towns after the wars than they had been before. (unquote). (p. 31).POGROMS: JEWS CAN BE VICTIMIZERS AS WELL AS VICTIMSAdam Teller inadvertently ""sets the stage"" for understanding the Przytyk pogrom as he provides valuable information on previous pogroms from this part of Europe. He comments, (quote) Thus it was that in the shtetls, as elsewhere in Poland-Lithuania, the Jews were the victims of violence, both verbal and physical, on the part of their neighbors. However, a close examination of the sources reveals that the Jews were able to give as good as they got, and often did so. Violence in the shtetls and towns of Poland was by no means one-sided. The court records indicate many cases of Jews attacking townspeople, peasants on their way to market, and even nobles and priests who tried to interfere in their daily lives. This violence, which was endemic to Polish society in this period, should therefore be understood not so much as signifying the Jews' weakness in the face of non-Jewish society, or their excessive self-confidence in light of noble protection, but rather as a sign that the Jews were well integrated into urban society and acted, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, just like their neighbors. (unquote). (pp. 37-38).THE SOPHISTICATION AND DURABILITY OF JEWISH ECONOMIC HEGEMONYAuthor Rosa Lehmann traces the Poles' economic efforts, with their very modest successes, at Jasliska, beginning with some business initiatives, and half-hearted boycotts of Jews, in the 1890's, and then proceeding through the 1930's. She writes, (quote) The limited involvement of Poles in the local and regional market, apart from the activities of the rural co-operative, which from 1918 were heavily protected by the Roman Catholic Church and the Polish national authorities, can be traced to the lack of a Polish trade network to realize an efficient supply and distribution of merchandise and information. One major advantage of the Jewish merchant was that he had access to such contacts and information, and that, as a rule, he knew his customers. The extent and importance of the local Jewish networks is clear from the accounts of Jewish informants. First, through marriage bonds Jews were able to activate a family network that reached far beyond the confines of the local community. Jewish informants gave examples of how, in setting up one business or another, within or outside Jasliska, mostly relatives were consulted or involved in some other way. Secondly, generations of experience in trade laid the foundation for numerous contacts in the professions and with the main trading centers; hence, for example, the large number of Jewish companies that specialized in exploitation of local forests and that were run by local Jews with expert contacts outside the region, in Krakow, and even outside the country, in Slovakia. (unquote). (p. 159).(Quote) It should be noted that during the inter-war years Poles also entered the sector of moneylending. Mortgage deeds in the real-estate registers show that debtors and creditors were Poles as well as Jews. However, in contrast to Poles, who often were indebted to Jews (with debts sometimes exceeding 200 zlotys), the Jews themselves were rarely indebted to Poles as richer relatives or co-religionists were quick to help them out. (unquote). (p. 160).IMPLICATIONS OF THE `UNBEATABILITY' OF JEWISH ECONOMIC HEGEMONYIt is clear that, using modern parlance, the economic playing field, between Poles and Jews, was very, very far from level. Jewish economic privilege, having lasted so many centuries, had become so entrenched, so variegated, so versatile, and so sophisticated, that it was almost impossible for Poles to even put a dent into it. Poles could hardly ever compete successfully with Jews, and to start businesses. No wonder that Poles commonly thought in terms of ""supporting their own"" (that is, boycotting Jewish economic establishments).Now consider the Endek calls for more-systematic boycotts of Jews, the corrective-discriminatory policies of the pre-WWII Polish government against Jews, the arguments for harsher anti-Jewish action by the ONR, the increasing unpleasantries such as ghetto benches, and the increasing calls for most of Poland's Jews to be forced to emigrate. Considering the fact that Poles felt, quite reasonably, that there was no other way to emancipate Poland from Jewish economic dominance, and to start their own businesses, why, then, do Poles face opprobrium for feeling, and acting, the way they did?To ask this question is to answer it. Jews are not seen as the privileged, even though they clearly were, and Poles are not seen as the disadvantaged, even though they clearly were. Let us take this further. The reader must remember what liberals tell us about the privileged ""having won life's lottery"", of the privileged tending to hang on to their privileges, of the anger and hopelessness of those who are economically disenfranchised, of the root causes of violence in the face of these continued inequities, etc. Although never recognized by liberals as such, the disadvantaged state of the Poles accounts not only for Endek and ONR attitudes and policies, but also for the Przytyk pogrom.THE PRZYTYK POGROM: AN EXCHANGEThe exchange on this event is in the format of a debate. Jolanta Zyndul criticizes scholar Piotr Gontarczyk for his work, Pogrom? Zajscia polsko-zydowskie w Przytyku 9 marca 1936 r. : Mity, Fakty, Dokumenty (Polish and English Edition).  Gontarczyk gets to respond. Then Zyndul responds again. What kind of editorial standards are these, where Zyndul gets the first and the last word, and Gontarczyk gets only one statement?On top of all this, there are four other pogrom-accusing articles included in this debate. There is thus, numerically speaking, a 5:1 bias in favor of the standard narrative on the Przytyk pogrom. Pretty fair, huh? Then again, this is probably the best that can be expected from the transparently Judeocentric POLIN series. Most POLIN volumes--and I have reviewed a number of them--lack the inclusion of even a single article from a dissenting voice.THE PRZYTYK POGROM: COURSE OF EVENTSJolanta Zyndul concludes that the facts about the Przytyk pogrom, brought out by Gontarczyk, are not in dispute. (p. 387). Only their interpretation is.Zyndul tries to confuse the issue by making allegations of Endeks making hateful and incendiary statements against Jews (p. 388), as Ryszard Fenigsten does also. (p. 402). This is a red herring. Incendiary rhetoric is uncharitable, but is not synonymous with homicide. In addition, not only did incendiary rhetoric go both ways, but hateful Jewish rhetoric against Poland, even from presumably assimilationist-oriented Jews, and as exemplified by the periodical IZRAELITA, went far back in time. [See first Comment under this review.]Now, back to the Przytyk pogrom itself. Zyndul's irrelevant comments on incendiary rhetoric notwithstanding, nothing changes the fact, brought up originally by Gontarczyk, that it was the Jews, and not the Poles, that had escalated the heretofore-limited conflict into homicide. The Przytyk pogrom was first a Jewish riot before it became a Polish riot. It was the Jews who introduced firearms, and homicide, into the conflict, when they started shooting, and shooting indiscriminately, at Poles. Up to that time, the dispute had been non-homicidal. It had been limited to mutual insults, fisticuffs, and reciprocal overturning of booths--all the while Jews were trying to protect their economic privileges, and the Poles were trying to reverse them.What's more, after tailor Dalman had been attacked by Poles, the Jewish ""self-defense"" mob did not go after Dalman's assailants. They attacked Poles indiscriminately, in a fit of collective revenge. (Gontarczyk, pp. 394-395).THE PRZYTYK POGROM: WHEN IS A POGROM A POGROM?Zyndul and Gontarczyk go in circles on the applicability of the term pogrom, but do not examine this term in the broad sense. The term pogrom is not only a matter of semantics, but of application--an application that is determined according to politics. Consider, for example, the unmentioned Crown Heights riots of 1991. There had been a spasm of community anger directed against Jews collectively, and the Jew Yankel Rosenbaum was brutally murdered. Although some Jewish groups called the Crown Heights riots a pogrom, most did not, and the term pogrom never stuck. Why? The answer is simple. The USA is a sophisticated, pluralistic society. Therefore, a pogrom occurring in the USA is not really a pogrom. However, in Poland, a presumably backwards, hyper-Catholic nation, a pogrom is expected to occur, and the term sticks, even when only one Jew is killed, as happened at Przytyk.There is, in addition, the standard politics of victimhood in play, as determined by the leftists who steer our popular culture. African-Americans are a recognized victim group. Jews are a recognized victim-group, especially in the context of Polish-Jewish relations. Poles, in contrast, are not a recognized victim group. Therefore, a pogrom conducted by African-Americans cannot be a true pogrom, while one conducted by Poles certainly can.THE PRZYTYK POGROM: THE STANDARD DOUBLE STANDARDSJolanta Zyndul should, first of all, read the quote from Adam Teller above, on the tendency of Jews to do violence as well as receive violence. She might learn something.Jolanta Zyndul attacks Gontarczyk for referring to historian Marek Jan Chodakiewicz and his ZYDZI I POLACY scholarly work. She claims that the book was ""widely criticized."" (p. 398). ""Widely criticized"" by whom? By leftists? By Judeocentrists? She also provides not the slightest evidence that the criticism of Chodakiewicz is valid, much less that Chodakiewicz is wrong.Zyndul then berates Piotr Gontarzyk for comparing the Przytyk violence against Jews with other manifestations of popular violence in Poland at the time, accusing him of trying to ""soften"" it. (p. 398). Oh, dear!Zyndul's mindset is unmistakable, and is nothing new. When Jews are the object of hostility and violence in Poland, this cannot be juxtaposed with any of the co-occurring violence between other peoples in Poland. What's more, violence against Jews is entitled its own special, proprietary term--the pogrom--while the violence against other peoples never gets its own special term. The conclusion is inescapable. Jews are special. Therefore, violence against Jews is more grave, and more worthy of attention and historical memory, than violence against other peoples. [Such thinking goes back to antiquity: According to the Talmud, in Sanhedrin 58b, striking a Jew is tantamount to an attack on the Divine presence. Look it up, as I did.] It all boils down to this: There exists one standard for Jews and another, less favorable standard, for Poles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGT02VRICMYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1874774765#wasThisHelpful","R3FGT02VRICMYR","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The content of this book is pedestrian. The book begins with the Partition period, proceeds through WWII, and then sort of peters out as it approaches the present. There are, however, a few good points in this book. For instance, the author repudiates the oft-repeated 1939 WWII myths of Polish cavalry making suicidal charges against German tanks, and the Polish Air Force being largely destroyed in the first days of the war by the Luftwaffe. (p. 152).As with his earlier books, Porter-Szücs demonizes those, such as RADIO MARYJA, that merely questioned Poland's entry into the European Union. (p. 356). What he does not tell his readers is the fact that the arguments used to support the European Union are almost exactly the same as the arguments used to support the non-military aspects of European rule by the Third Reich. Please click on, and read my detailed review of, The Tainted Source: Undemocratic Origins of the European Idea.THE ""HEROIC NARRATIVE"" ATTACKED--YET AGAINThe title of this book itself is condescending and insulting. Evidently trying to avoid feeling left out, Porter-Szücs takes his turn casting the standard aspersions on Poland. He writes, (quote) The second corrective that comes from normalizing Poland is to burst the balloons of Polish nationalism. All too many historians of Poland have represented the country as unique because of its tragic suffering. We often get a story that marches from battlefield to battlefield, from oppression to oppression, from massacre to massacre, with Poland standing as an inevitable collective victim. This produces a national martyrology--an elevation of the entire collectivity to the status of sanctified victim. Within this lachrymose worldview, to impugn any Pole is to impugn Poland as such, because only the virtuous victims are allowed to represent the whole. When faced with stories about Poles who have done bad things, proponents of this view either insist that the evildoer was not a true Pole, or that the historian is lying. (unquote). (p. 4).Author Brian Porter-Szücs is verbalizing inanity on top of inanity on top of inanity. He is also demolishing straw men. The Polish romanticism that he caricatures had been repudiated, by the very Endeks that he despises, a century ago. Poles don't glory in suffering and martyrdom, and never have. They celebrate heroism IN SPITE of suffering, failure, and even defeat. [That is why, for example, they celebrate the herculean Polish effort in the defeated and Soviet-betrayed Warsaw Uprising.] No Polish historian, to my knowledge (and I have read many), ever suggested that Polish suffering is qualitatively exceptional [unlike many Jews, who believe in the uniqueness of the Holocaust], much less that Poland's historical experiences were nothing more than one tragedy after another.Polish ""nationalist"" works are full of admission of ignoble Polish conduct (and, yes, as conducted by ""true"" Poles), and Polish thinkers not rarely engage in Polish self-criticism and self-blame. What Poles don't like is being denied a fair airing of all the facts (e. g., about Jedwabne), and to be repeatedly slandered and lied about. Poles also dislike the blatant double standards, as occur, for example, when Jedwabne is made into such a big deal, while the Jewish mass murders of Poles, at places such as Naliboki and Koniuchy, are ignored or exculpated. (In fact, when it comes to Polish-Jewish relations, Jews are excused, almost 100% of the time, in whatever they do.) All Poles want is basic fairness--nothing more, nothing less. (That is also my position.)CONTINUED POSTMODERNIST RELATIVISM IN ACTION: THE WARSAW UPRISING, ETC.The author's thinking degenerates into abject and primal postmodernist relativism. He adopts an ""It's all the same"" spirit of false equivalencies--conflating minor issues (and non-issues) with major issues, molehills with mountains, warts with malignant tumors, the light from the firefly with the light from the Sun, the paper airplane with the Boeing 747, the crime of rolling through a stop sign with the crime of murder, and so on. This is quintessential postmodernist relativism.The author goes out of his way to impugn the patriotic memory of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. He cites a former participant, who published in (where else?) the left-wing GAZETA WYBORCZA, an article in which he felt that the Uprising had been a mistake, and apologized to the Varsovians. (p. 175, 182). To Brian Porter-Szücs, this man is an instant celebrity. However, such doubts are nothing new and they, alone, demolish the author's insinuation that Poles merely cling to historic myths. In fact, doubts about the wisdom of launching the Uprising had been voiced from the beginning, notably by the very Porter-Szücs bogeymen, the ""Polish nationalists"" (the NSZ). In any case, doubts about the Uprising, valid or invalid, are irrelevant to the fact and magnitude of Polish heroism in the Uprising.Another example of the author's vulgar postmodernist relativism can be found in his treatment of Bereza Kartuska. (pp. 99-100). He admits that this internment camp was dwarfed by Hitler's and Stalin's camps, and that virtually all governments at the time incarcerated political prisoners. Still, to him, it is not ""any less troubling."" The author's deliberate avoidance of perspective is glaring.CONTINUED POSTMODERNIST RELATIVISM IN ACTION: JEWS GET IT TOOBrian Porter-Szücs then lets Jews be on the receiving end of his heroism-bashing tirades, (quote) For Poles and Jews alike, the suffering of World War II remains visceral even today. Moreover, in both cases stories of martyrdom and sacrifice are still used to define ""national character"" and to stir up patriotic emotions. For such tales people want clear-cut heroes and villains, not muddy accounts in which perpetrators are victimized, in which heroes are driven by base motives, or in which good people make terrible decisions. People want to be able to say that ""we"" suffered because of ""their"" actions, and few want to consider all the intertwined layers of suffering that characterized Eastern Europe during the war. (unquote). (p. 176).Nobody is suggesting that history is black and white. However, to Porter-Szücs and his egregious postmodernist relativism, there is one and ONLY one color in existence--a vague, pallid grey.POLAND'S ""HEROIC NARRATIVE"" ATTACKED OVER AND OVER--WHY?This reviling of the Polish so-called ""heroic narrative"" has become so monotonically predictable, in recently-published works on Poland, that the well-read reader may be forgiven for suspecting an agenda. In fact, it is so certain to appear that it is startling. One is almost tempted to conclude that there is some kind of secret agreement, among recent authors, to relentlessly attack Poland in this fashion.Why is it SO important that Poles forget or tarnish the heroism and achievements of their past? Is it just postmodernism run amok, wherein postmodernists exercise their love of trashing everything that is sacred to people? Or is it part of a long-term goal of making Polish history repulsive to Poles, notably as proposed by Bismarck, so that Poles lose their self-identity and self-respect, and thus become easier to control by the powers that be?WARMED-OVER MARXISMIn a thinly-veiled exercise in the de-legimitization of Poland, author Brian Porter-Szücs dusts off old myths and stereotypes of Poland's past. These feature Poland's ""frightfully awful"" feudal Partition-era class structure, the (alleged) lack of consciousness of Polishness among Poland's peasantry (p. 9, pp. 13-16), the ""exclusion"" of minority groups, etc. His vocabulary itself speaks volumes. To him, Poland is ""a vaguely defined space"". (p. 1). Wow!The discerning reader can see where Porter-Szücs is coming from. According to standard Communist ideology, nations and patriotism are a recent invention, and that of the upper classes, intent on the maintenance of class privileges. The lower classes knew nothing of nations and patriotism, until they were indoctrinated by the upper classes--all done so that they would support upper-class privileges, and would go to war with each other on behalf of the privileged, instead of developing their own, authentic consciousness, which of course is class consciousness.Porter-Szücs is also engaging in chronological snobbery: Until modern forms of societies emerged, there was really nothing of value in existence, least of all in Poland. His reasoning, far from being original, is merely a mutation of old Communist propaganda: Until Communism came to the glorious rescue, practically everything had been bad, and there had hardly even been a Poland, worthy of the name, at all.The facts are otherwise. Nations are no recent inventions: They go back to antiquity, and their existence transcends changes in society and social structure. See, and read my review, of The Ethnic Origins of Nations. Pointedly, Poland may be much older than even the conventionally-accepted circa 1,200 years.Poland's quasi-feudal structure, far from being a horror story, had actually been relatively progressive for its time, as recognized, for example, by the Prussian Moltke, an avowed enemy of Poland (He had defended Poland's Partitions as a ""historical necessity"".) See, and read my review, of Poland; an historical sketch.Poland's peasants had a rudimentary national consciousness, moreover one that was not solely dependent upon what the landlords told them. In addition, this rudimentary Polish peasant national consciousness had long preceded the abolition of serfdom, the emergence of literacy and education, and formal instruction in Polish patriotism. See, and read my review, of The Nation in the Village: The Genesis of Peasant National Identity in Austrian Poland, 1848-1914.POLES=CATHOLICS. HOW TERRIBLE!Porter-Szücs realizes that Poland had historically been open towards non-Catholics. Not to be denied however, he complains that Poland's post-1918 policies ""only"" tolerated Catholics, but did not make them, in the author's opinion, full-fledged members of the Polish body politic. (p. 15, pp. 91-92). Excuse me. Do Poles get to define their nation as they see fit? Or does someone else do it? If so, who? Left-wing ideologues?THE STANDARD LAMENT ABOUT POLAND'S MINORITY GROUPSThe author trots out the standard leftist narrative on Roman Dmowski and the Endeks, exaggerating their belief in Social Darwinism, attacking them for their ""exclusive"" view of what it means to be truly Polish, and grotesquely mischaracterizing them as believing in a world Jewish conspiracy. (pp. 53-54). He butchers the facts surrounding the 1912 Duma elections and the Dmowski-led retaliatory boycott of Jews. (pp. 69-70).All along, Porter-Szücs is deafeningly silent about the way that Poland's minorities had first excluded themselves from Polish-ness while in the process of their own national development. With the exception of one cursory phrase (p. 172), Porter-Szücs completely ignores the centuries-old ""We are not Poles"" Jewish separatism. In fact, Jewish religious-based ghetto-style separatism was being increasingly replaced by the even more aggressive, and this time actively politicized, Yiddishist-based ""Jews are a separate nationality, and not Poles"" separatism and self-imposed apartheid. This Jewish separatism had long preceded the Endeks.The author's treatment of the events surrounding the Narutowicz assassination (p. 93) would have the reader believe the standard notion that Poles were paranoid about imagined Jewish influence. They were not. Poland's minorities had formed an electoral bloc for the deliberate political purpose of swaying Poland's elections.For more on all this, please see the first Comment under this review.JEWS AND COMMUNISMIn common with many authors, Porter-Szücs is in deep denial about the fact and the scale of Jewish-Soviet collaboration, which he dismisses as ""the myth of Zydokomuna (Judeo-Bolshevism)"". He repeats all the standard glosses and vacuous, canned exculpations. (pp. 135-135, 156, 200).Let us examine the author's Jewish-wrongdoing denialism. Brian Porter-Szücs cites a study (which I have read), by Kopstein and Wittenberg, on Jewish voting patterns in some 1920's Polish elections. (p. 141). These indicate that ""only"" 7% of Jews voted for the Communists (p. 135). From this, Porter-Szücs draws the completely non sequitur conclusion that Jewish support for Communism was minimal.To begin with, Jewish support for Communism was hardly limited to electoral support for, or open identification with, overtly Communist movements--far from it! Various mainstream Jewish political parties and movements were ALSO infected with Communism to varying degrees, usually in muted or disguised ways. These included the Hashomer Hatzair, the Poalei Zion, the Bund, and various Jewish socialist parties.In addition, Jews commonly switched loyalties to whoever coincided with their immediate interests, or whoever was the stronger. After Poland was Partitioned, Poland's Jews generally supported the empires that ruled over Poland, and few Jews backed Polish national aspirations. By the 1920's, with the resurrected Polish state a fait accompli, and Poland having recently (1920) defeated the Soviet Union, the Polish nation had unambiguously emerged as the stronger. For this reason, it is hardly surprising that relatively few Jews openly supported Communism in the 1920's. In 1939, with Poland on the ropes and the USSR the stronger, it was a different story. [See the first item in the first Comment under this review.]Finally, why waste one's vote on a party that had no chance of winning? Surely the Jews knew that Communists hardly ever come to power through free elections, least of all likely in Poland. They come to power by force. To help make Poland Communist, it is best to wait for renewed Soviet aggression, and then become actively pro-Communist. That is exactly what happened.The Jewish crimes committed by the Zydokomuna, and the harm that they did to Poland, were very real. For example, see the first item in the first Comment under this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W304LGVWTBJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRUMD3I#wasThisHelpful","R1W304LGVWTBJ9","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Historical accuracy for the classroom? Forget it! Art Spiegelman makes no effort to correct the falsifications of history in MAUS in this METAMAUS volume. Instead, Spiegelman advances the following lame exculpations (CAPS) for his anti-Polish bigotry:MAUS IS ONLY SEMI-FICTION AND BIOGRAPHYSo what. Malicious fiction is still malicious! People tend to form their opinions according to what they read, regardless of its genre. The anti-Polish bias, and falsifications in MAUS, make it unacceptable in the classroom--especially in view of the impressionable children and teenagers, and even low-information adults.Merely the fact that MAUS is ""about the Jews"" does not entitle Spiegelman to so grossly falsify the history of other peoples (Poles in this case), especially in view of the low-information of most of his readers.In his MAUS, Spiegelman shows Poles hanging a surviving Jew for coming to reclaim his property. The reader is misled to believe that this was something normative. It was not. The reader is not told that this happened to a small fraction of 1% of Jewish returnees, that Poles were in crushing poverty and in a desperate housing shortage situation, during and immediately after WWII. Nor is the reader told that, during this same time, a civil war was going on in Poland. During this time, in which several hundred Jews were being killed by Poles out of various motives, Jews collaborating with the Soviets were murdering tens of thousands of Poles.NOT ONLY POLES ARE ANIMALS. ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE ANIMALSArt Spiegelman would have us believe that the portrayal of Poles as pigs is innocuous, because, after all, Germans are cats and Jews are mice. Polonophobe Art Spiegelman is speaking with a forked tongue. The pig has an intense and emotional abominable connotation, in Jewish thinking and history, in a way that other non-kosher animals, such as the cat and mouse, and even the horse and camel, do not. Please click on, and read my detailed review, of The Essential Talmud. [In fact, according to the Talmud (BABA KAMA 82b), a Jew is cursed merely for breeding pigs!]Now go beyond Jewish religion. Consider everyday life. As everyone with the most elementary knowledge of English knows, ""You pig!"" is incomparably more pejorative than ""You cat"" or ""You mouse!"" Don't believe me? Ask any child.SPIEGELMAN IS MERELY COPYING NAZI MOTIFS FOR HIS COMICFalse. The Nazis had no singular, fixed image for any particular group that they despised. By Spiegelman's own admission (p. 115), the Nazis also depicted Jews as poison mushrooms. (p. 115). The Nazis seldom, if ever, portrayed themselves as cats. (Did they EVER?)POLES SUFFERED TOO, BUT DID NOT REALLY SUFFERBy Spiegelman's own admission (p. 121, 124, 129), Poles suffered greatly under the Nazis. However, he also acknowledges that he made his choice of Poles-as-pigs in order to put the Poles ""outside the food chain"" relative to the Nazis. (p. 129). The Poles, in Spiegelman's own words, were ""witnesses"". (p. 129)(a variant of the more commonly used term, ""bystanders"".) Clearly, and apart from the strong Judeocentric bias, Spiegelman and his MAUS are functionally in denial about the fact and magnitude of Polish suffering under the Germans. (See first comment). His portrayal of Poles as well-fed pigs is thus a grotesque travesty of historical fact.THE MASS MURDER OF JEWS IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE MASS MURDER OF POLESArt Spiegelman rationalizes the imagery of mice (Jews) and Poles (pigs) on the ""fact"" that Jews were subject to extermination, while Poles were to be exploited and ""worked to death"", but not exterminated. (pp. 121-122). This, too, is contrived. Death is death, whether you are an animal slaughtered for food, or you are an animal killed for eating the farmer's grain. Besides, whether you are a mouse on the farm, or whether you are a pig on the farm, you have no inherent right to live, and you remain alive only as long as the farmer chooses to let you live, or has not yet gotten around to killing you.The experiences of the Poles and Jews, though different, overlapped considerably. The Nazis had utilitarian as well as exterminatory attitudes towards the Jews. Thus, large numbers of Jews were forced laborers in the camps and ghettos, being slowly worked to death in a utilitarian manner. The Jews had no monopoly as victims of genocide. The Germans exterminated the bulk of Poland's intelligentsia, and Poles in general were to be largely exterminated had the Germans won the war. (See first comment).THE CHARACTERS IN MAUS ARE COMPLEX ONESIrrelevant. A pig with lipstick is still a pig, and a complex pig is still a pig!Now consider Spiegelman's own assessment of how readers tend to perceive the main characters of the MAUS comics. He comments, ""Even in the way they're drawn, the cats have the most human of the faces. The mice have the most abstracted and the least physiologically human representation: the nose is at the bottom, the eyes are at the midway point, and there's no room for that mouth. The pigs have those unsightly snouts."" (p. 128). Clearly, by Spiegelman's own tacit admission, the Germans come out more favorably than the Poles, even though the Germans are the ones that had murdered 5-6 million Jews. This smells of the historical revisionism (e. g., the falsehood about ""Polish death camps"") that shifts the blame for the Holocaust away from the Germans--where it belongs--and onto the Poles.""POLES ARE THE PROBLEM""When all else fails, Spiegelman resorts to blame-the-victim tactics by accusing Poles of being the problem--about there being ""something deeply problematic about the Polish ability to assimilate the past."" (p. 124). What if someone were to turn this around by suggesting that there is ""something deeply problematic"" about the arrogance in Jewish thinking and conduct--as exhibited by Spiegelman?SPIEGELMAN AS A HEROIC ICONOCLASTArt Spiegelman thinks himself a hero. He takes delight in offending Poles, fancying himself some kind of hero for being an iconoclast and breaker of taboos (p. 124). To validate the fact that he is a hero, Spiegelman should instead attack a group that, unlike the Poles, has the political power to bite back effectively. Let us see him try that. I am waiting, but not holding my breath.SPIEGELMAN FINALLY ADMITS THE OBVIOUS: HE IS AN UNRECONSTRUCTED POLONOPHOBEFinally, Spiegelman divulges his ACTUAL reasons for calling Poles pigs. It is bashing Poles, pure and simple. With reference to his father's attitude towards Poles, he quips, ""`So my metaphor [mice to be killed outright, and pigs to be exploited and eaten] was somehow able to hold that particular vantage point while still somehow acknowledging my father's dubious opinion of Poles as a group.'"" (p. 122). This is bigoted, collectivist thinking, like saying that it is all right to portray Jews as crooks just because some Jews are crooks.Evidently, bigotry is always wrong--unless, of course, the targets of the bigotry are Christians or Poles.Polonophobe Art Spiegelman adds that, ""`And considering the bad relations between Poles and Jews for the last hundred years in Poland, it seemed right to use a non-Kosher animal.'"" (p. 125). Spiegelman is completely one-sided, with the usual selective memory about past Polish anti-Semitism. He is predictably silent about the privileges Jews also had in Poland, as well as the Jewish share of wrongs in the poisoning of Polish-Jewish relations. (See first comment).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TURNING THE TABLES: A COUNTER-MAUS (I CALL MUNGO, THE GERMAN WORD FOR MONGOOSE)Let us see how Art Spiegelman and his fans, would like my proposed Counter-MAUS cartoon below. How well would it ""fly"" in the American classroom and in Holocaust education?This alternative cartoon of mine is more historically accurate than the original MAUS. If readers find it offensive, then it is no more so than the Poles-as-pigs in the original MAUS.The Counter-MAUS cartoon, MUNGO, features the following characters: clean rats, dirty rats, snakes, mongooses, and bears.The snakes overrun the terrain. The mongooses fight, and manage to kill some of the snakes. The dirty rats help the snakes find and eat clean rats, and then the snakes eat the dirty rats. A few of the clean rats and dirty rats survive, hidden by the mongooses. In time, the bears arrive at the scene, drive out the snakes, and begin to hunt the mongooses. The dirty rats and clean rats come out of hiding, and help the bears catch the mongooses.In this proposed Counter-MAUS cartoon, the snakes are the Germans. The mongooses are the Poles. The dirty rats are those Jews (such as in the JUDENRAETE and part of the Jewish Ghetto Police) that collaborated with the Germans. The clean rats are the multitudes of innocent Jews who became victims of the Germans. The bears are the Soviet second-occupants of Poland.I do not believe in censorship. MAUS should not be removed from the classroom. Instead, my proposed Counter-MAUS cartoon, MUNGO (the German word for mongoose), should be given equal time in the classroom whenever MAUS is used. It is only fair.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DNVULAKEFZQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670916838#wasThisHelpful","R2DNVULAKEFZQT","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, authored by Talmudic scholar Adin Steinsaltz, provides a useful general overview of Jewish beliefs and customs, notably those of the Talmud. However, I agree with those reviewers who feel that the book is too shallow, that it provides insufficient concrete examples to illustrate its main points, and that one of its chief shortcomings is an absence of specific reference to Talmudic verses.Unfortunately, author Adin Steinsaltz repeats the misconception that the Christian view of marriage is that of a necessary evil. (p. 141). This is far from the truth. In fact, in Roman Catholicism, marriage is a sacred act before God (The Sacrament of Matrimony).I now focus on a number of notable themes:THE JEWISH ORAL LAWThe oral law, which eventually became the Talmud, is commonly believed to date back to the time of Moses and the written law (Torah). However, Talmudic scholar Adin Steinsaltz points out that evidence for the existence of a formal Oral Law, for at least the first several centuries after Moses, is tenuous. He comments, (quote) We know very little of the origins and early development of the oral law, since information on cultural and spiritual life in the First Temple era is generally sparse. But from various hints in the Bible, we can ascertain how the oral law evolved to interpret and complement written legislation. (unquote). (pp. 10-11).What about Jews who reject the oral law? Steinsaltz notes that the Sadducees, and—much later—the Karaites, ended up creating their own oral tradition. (p. 21).SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TALMUDBy way of introduction, Steinsaltz comments, (quote) In many ways the Talmud is the most important book in Jewish culture, the backbone of creativity and of national life. (unquote). (p. 3).The author also shows the relevance of ongoing Talmudic scholarship in the revitalizing of Jewish communities. Steinsaltz writes, (quote) Some communities did not produce scholars from their midst because of material poverty, lack of suitable candidates (as the result of the decrees of authorities), or indifference. Whatever the reason, however, the fact is they did not survive for long. In the course of Jewish history, various ethnic communities have tried to maintain their Judaism, sometimes even on a strictly traditional basis, without Talmudic scholarship. The same process occurred in all of them, the components of their Judaism were weakened and began to disintegrate, the deeper significance of issues was no longer fully understood, and inappropriate interpretations were evolved, so that despite sincere efforts to maintain traditions, such communities lost their vitality and died out. Sometimes the process was protracted, with tradition gradually becoming more and more a matter of outward show for lack of sages capable of endowing it with new life, and assimilation inevitably followed. (unquote). (p. 267).The foregoing, of course, has implications for other religions. Much the same revitalizing principles can very much apply to Christian communities—to keep them from drifting into dead orthodoxy, dead formalism, indifferentism, and decline.THE TALMUDIC WORD min CAN APPLY TO CHRISTIANSWe are commonly told that the Talmudic terms for pagans, and other unsavory peoples, do not apply to Christians. In contrast, Steinsaltz points out that, at least sometimes, the word MIN does in fact apply to Christians. He writes, (quote) Wherever the text used the word MIN (heretic, originally applied to Gnostic sects and rarely to Christians), he [the censor] changed it to read Sadducee or Epicurean. (unquote). (p. 84). The next question is, “How rarely?”WHY PORK IS SO ABOMINATED BY JEWS  [IMPLICATIONS FOR maus]Although there are many different TREYF (non-kosher) foods in existence, the pig is especially repulsive to Jews. Steinsaltz suggests some possible reasons for this, (quote) The particular emotional attitude toward the eating of the pig is noted in Talmudic sources. The ban is no stricter than that against the consumption of horse or camel flesh, yet the Talmud says: “Cursed is he who grows pigs.” There was apparently some historical source for this particular interdict, which is not clear to us. It is possible that the peculiarly intense reaction was the result of the Seleucid attempt to force the Jews to eat and sacrifice pigs, and it may be the consequence of the fact that one of the accepted symbols of the Roman legions (especially those that fought in Palestine) was the pig. (unquote). (p. 187). [Not mentioned is the fact that the Talmudic verse, to a Jew being cursed for breeding pigs, is in Tractate BABA KAMA 82b.][The traditional Jewish abomination towards pigs has implications beyond the Laws of Kashrus. In his widely-read Holocaust classic, MAUS, Jewish author Art Spiegelman portrays Poles as pigs. He would have us believe that it is innocuous because, after all, in MAUS, all the characters are animals. Germans are cats and Jews are mice. However, the pig, in Jewish ideation, is especially the object of contempt. Clearly, Polonophobe Art Spiegelman is being very disingenuous.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SOI0RMSV4UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465082734#wasThisHelpful","R30SOI0RMSV4UD","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a wealth of information in this detailed work by Talmudic scholar Abraham Cohen, and I focus on a few items of lasting interest. [In addition, please see the first comment under this review.] My review is based on the original 1949 edition.I have read the verses, in the online Babylonian Talmud (Soncino Edition), that I specifically cite below, in order to familiarize myself with them and to see their proper context. However, not all of the material mentioned below comes from the Talmud itself. Some comes from other Rabbinical sources. Whenever possible, I have read them also.INTERESTING RELIGIOUS INFORMATIONAccording to the Talmud:The Book of Genesis teaches CREATION EX NIHILO. (p. 29). The Earth is several thousand years old. (p. 356).The sins of the fathers may or may not be visited on descendants depending upon whether or not the sinful behavior persists over a number of generations. (p. 115). This resolves an apparent contradiction in the Bible.Women are prone to witchcraft. (p. 161).As in the Old Testament, polygamy is tolerated in the Talmud. (p. 166).LEX TALIONIS refers to financial compensation for wrongs, not a literal ""eye for eye"". For instance, it would be impossible for a blind person, who put out someone else's eye, to be literally punished with the loss of the sight of his own eye. (p. 227).As much as possible, animals are to be treated with compassion. (pp. 235-236).HISTORICALLY-SIGNIFICANT INFORMATIONThere are two main Talmudic schools of thought on the propriety of divorce. One, the School of Shammai, confessedly converges with the teachings of Jesus Christ (Matthew 19:9) on the indissolubility of marriage except in cases of adultery. (p. 167). On the other hand, the School of Hillel allows divorce for even the most trivial of reasons, such as when the man no longer finds his wife attractive, or if she has spoiled his meal while cooking it. (p. 167). [The permissive attitude towards divorce may partly explain why many Catholics thought of Jewish (Talmudic) ethics as inferior to Catholic ethics.]As for Jewish jurisprudence, there were two Sanhedrins. One was political, and the other religious. (p. 299).The author cites Talmudic, and other Rabbinical, passages on shopkeeping and usury being ""thieving occupations"". (pp. 195-196). [This is ironic, as Jews later majored in these occupations, and were, for this very reason, often accused of being cheats and parasites.]Cohen mentions ""The law of the land is law"". (BABA KAMAH 113a). (p. 190). [Not mentioned by Cohen is the fact that this Talmudic passage, DINA DE'MALKHUTA DINA, was used by Poland's Jews to justify Jewish allegiance to the foreign powers ruling over Poland after the Partitions of Poland (1795-1918) and to justify their usual refusal to support Polish independentist efforts. Had Poland's Jews been loyal to Poland, they would have recognized that the REAL ""law of the land"" is Poland's, as the destruction of Poland by the Partitioning Powers had been a criminal act, and the only way that this criminal act can be rectified is the prompt restoration of the Polish nation.]One Rabbinic passage deals with the issue of whether it is ever acceptable for Jews to turn over one of their own, to the gentiles, so that the remainder of the Jews is not put to death. (p. 99). [Not mentioned by Cohen is the fact that these verses came up during the Holocaust. The JUDENRAETE had to decide whether or not to comply with Nazi German orders to ship some Jews to their deaths in the hope that the Nazis would be placated, and would spare the remaining Jews.]The author does not mention Christianity in the Talmud itself. However, he does mention a passage in Numbers Rabbah (xiv, 10). The word ""Ishmaelites"" is identified by Cohen as an obvious code word for Christians, done in order to circumvent the censor. (p. 147).JEWISH UNIVERSALISMIn dealing with controversial passages in the Talmud, I follow a Judeo-realist approach. In doing so, I try my best to avoid the extremes of anti-Semitism (making false or unsubstantiated accusations against Jews) and philo-Semitism (treating Jews as incapable of wrong thinking or action.). That is where I stand. Take it or leave it.The Talmud contains both universal and exclusivist concepts, and one does not negate the other. (See (NV) in the first comment under this review.) Author Abraham Cohen emphasizes the universal aspects of traditional Judaism. However, he realizes that even the universalism taught in the Talmud was not a given. He comments, (quote) On the question whether Gentiles will share in the Hereafter there was not an agreed opinion. ""R. Eliezer declared, `No Gentiles will share in the world to come...'"" (unquote). (p. 369). R. Joshua disagreed, promoting a universalist view of salvation based on ethical living, and not on whether or not one was Jewish. This was later picked up by Maimonides, and became the official Jewish doctrine on this matter. (p. 369).THE ""KILL THE BEST OF THE GENTILES"" VERSESCohen quotes this from Mechilta/Mekhilta. (p. 66). He attributes the verses to R. Simeon b. Jochai, and exonerates the statements based on Jochai's life under the Hadrianic persecutions. Jochai is said to have seen his favorite teacher, R. Akiba, fiendishly tortured by the Romans, after which Jochai hid in a cave for 13 years. (p. 66; See also p. 231).Clearly, Cohen is attributing the verses to personal opinions (OV) and situational events (SV) [See first comment.] In this case, his argument is persuasive. However, he does not explain if these verses have any usage in Jewish life beyond the recollection of onetime historical events.The informed reader realizes that the early Christians were also subject to hideous tortures, and martyrdom, by the Romans. Yet there are no New Testament verses calling upon Christians to kill the best of the Romans or to kill the best of the non-Christians.DIFFERING TRANSLATIONS OF CONTROVERSIAL VERSESCohen writes, (quote) The harsh sayings which are occasionally found in the Talmud with respect to non-Jews often spring from the conviction that ""Gentiles are addicted to licentiousness"" (Jebamoth 98a). The Rabbis were revolted by the low standards of conduct that they saw practiced around them and were thankful for the finer ideals which their religion offered them. (unquote). (p. 66). [The online Babylonian Talmud, for YEVAMOTH 98a, uses different wording.] Cohen tacitly assumes that he can read the minds of, or otherwise deduce the intentions of, the Rabbis.  In any case, his exculpation, even if valid, is hollow. Surely the Rabbis knew that Jews had no monopoly on virtue and the GOYIM had no monopoly on vice. Surely the Rabbis, educated as they were and likely more familiar with various gentiles than the more parochial everyday Jews, knew that not all pagans live in debauchery.Let us make this clearer. Imagine a white commentator, deliberately overlooking the good people who are African-Americans, and feeling revolted by what he considered the low standards of conduct exhibited by other African-Americans, making the blanket generalization, and racist statement, that ""African-Americans are addicted to licentiousness.""On another subject, the author translates MENACHOTH 43b as saying that the man thanks God for making him an Israelite, and for not making him a woman or a boor. (p. 159). However, the online Babylonian Talmud translates the first part of the passage as thankfully saying ""who has not made me a heathen."" The Prayer Book says ""Who has not made me a heathen, a slave, a woman."" (p. 159). Cohen justifies these passages through the Israel-Torah relationship, which is elaborated in the ensuing paragraphs.THE ISRAEL-TORAH RELATIONSHIP: UNLIMITED IMPLICATIONSWith regards to the following quote, Gen. R. [Genesis Rabbah] and Lev. R. [Leviticus Rabbah], refer to the extra-Talmudic (and probably post-Talmudic) Midrash Rabba. On the other hand, the Tractate TAANITH is part of the Talmud. The issues revolve around the implications of Jewish Chosenness, which are not, as often claimed, limited to Jews having extra duties to God.Cohen writes, (quote) The main responsibility of Israel is the guardianship of the Torah, the Divine Revelation. Since the purpose of the world's creation was the glorification of God's name through the medium of the Torah, and Israel was to be its recipient, it follows that ""Israel was in the thought of God before the creation of the Universe"" (Gen. R. 1.4), that ""Heaven and earth were only created through the merit of Israel"" (Lev. R. xxxvi. 4), and ""As the world could not exist without the winds, so is it impossible for the world to exist without Israel"" (TAA'NITH 3b). No self-glorification is here meant, since the sayings refer only to Israel as the guardian of the Torah and therefore state a spiritual fact. (unquote). (pp. 60-61).Oh, no? The religious rationalizations notwithstanding, how could the ancient Jew even IMAGINE that God needed the Jewish people, for the creation of the world, unless he believed, at some level, that Jews are superior to the GOYIM? In addition, the verses confuse the issue. To believe that God wants to favor a particular people, in some general way, as the Chosen People, is one thing. To believe that this presumed Chosenness goes as far as God creating the world, through the fact of, or the merit of, the Chosen People, is quite another! The latter does not logically follow from the former. To believe that there exists a special Torah-Israel relationship is one thing. To believe that the very existence of heaven and earth is dependent upon the existence of Israel is quite another! The latter does not logically follow from the former.Instead, it is evident that Jewish supremacist thinking is riding piggyback on the inferred Torah-Israel relationship. Imagine the white supremacist seriously suggesting that the existence of the Universe, including that of Earth, was dependent upon the existence of white people. Framing it in religious terms would not change its racist essence.Moreover, the expansive Jewish belief that Jews are so special that the world exists and functions because of them, goes beyond the verses mentioned in this book. For an analysis of the teaching that the stars were created for the Jews, and only for the Jews [BERAKOT 32b], please click on, and read my detailed review, of Talmudic scholar Abraham Cohen's The Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Berakot. For an analysis of the teaching that the world would have been ""un-created"" had Israel rejected the Torah [SHABBAT 88a], please click on, and read my analysis, of The Rav: The World of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Vol. 1.Clearly, the Torah-Israel relationship is, or can become, an all-purpose standby explanation (or exculpation) that can be invoked to justify practically any Jewish supremacist assertion in the Talmud or other rabbinical literature.A GENTILE STUDYING THE TORAH DESERVES DEATH. WHY?Author Abraham Cohen cites a series of passages that he contends are universalistic with regards to Jews and non-Jews. He then comments, (quote) On the other hand, it must be admitted that we do occasionally meet with dicta which breathe a very different spirit. Typical examples are: ""A Gentile who occupies himself with the study of the Torah is deserving of death; as it is said, ""Moses commanded us a Torah, an inheritance for the assembly of Israel"" (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 4)--the inheritance is for us, not for them"". (SANHEDRIN 59a)...In all probability such declarations as these were called forth by the rise of the Christian Church whose members also studied the Scriptures and claimed that the Divine Grace rested upon them. (unquote). (p. 63).The tone of Cohen's statement is clearly speculative and exculpatory. In addition, it is a non sequitur. Surely, the justified killing of a Torah-studying gentile does not follow from a concern about what Christians believe. [See also (PV) in the first comment under this review.] It would make sense to execute a GOY for trying to destroy a Torah scroll, or, given the spirit of the times, even for showing disrespect to the Torah. But for studying it? Come on!It has also been argued that the ""deserving of death"" verses are nonliteral, and only mean ""deserving a severe condemnation"". This explanation differs from Cohen's, and the disparity itself illustrates the ad hoc character of Talmudic exculpations. In addition, the ""non-literalness"" argument is a facile one. [See (LV) in the first Comment under this review.]Finally, even if ""deserving of death"" only means ""deserving a severe condemnation"", for a gentile studying the Torah, it is obviously softer. However, the essential Jewish supremacist thinking and antigoyism, communicated by the verse, remain intact.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R677EXUVDRRAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805210326#wasThisHelpful","R677EXUVDRRAA","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I give this work three stars because, while the photos are priceless, the text is of little value. The author comes across as a superficially-minded tourist, and skirts around important issues. He is silent about the Communist terror going on in Poland. In the Introduction, Brian Moore identifies himself, and photographer John Vachon, as left-wingers. (p. xvi). It shows! Vachon expresses support for the Communist puppet government. (p. 51). He repeats egregious falsehoods straight out of Communist propaganda,. He conflates the ARMIA KRAJOWA (A. K.) with bandits (p. 64), and actually believes that General Anders was behind the (so-called) Kielce Pogrom. (p. 82).One photo (p. 94) shows a message board with various Communist-propaganda posters. One poster says “Three Times Yes”, which is an allusion to the so-called Polish People’s Referendum of mid-1946. Another poster warns of the dangers of a return of capitalism.The photos in this work feature the crushing destitute of post-WWII Poles. Many photos show the wartime devastation, notably the ruins of Warsaw. It was staggering.Although Vachon repeats the “Poles are anti-Semites” mantra, he makes it easy to see why Poles were sometimes hostile to Jews who came back to reclaim their properties. Usable property was in short supply. For instance, one of the photos (p. 146, described on p. 155) shows Poles living in the cellars of the ruins of their homes. [This was at a village, and does not count the countless Poles living in the ruins of Warsaw and other large destroyed cities.] No wonder that the new Polish owners were not exactly thrilled when the presumed-dead former owners turned up alive to reclaim the property.Especially sad are the photos which show the abject misery (and disease) of those who had been expelled from the Kresy or returned from Siberia. (p. 41, 114, 115, 116, 117). Obviously, the German expellees, the VERTRIEBENE, were not the only ones who suffered because of the Big-Power-decreed expulsion/resettlement processes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6TX7KOYYZZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560985402#wasThisHelpful","R1K6TX7KOYYZZC","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author surveys the claims of nations and nationalities in some detail. Unfortunately, he treats all the conflicting claims on a more-or-less coeval basis—as if all the claims had equivalent credibility and support.I focus on a few items of lasting interest.THE POLESIANS—A SEPARATE NATIONALITY?In the past, Poles commonly thought of the Belarussian identity as an amorphous one. For example, Roman Catholic Belarussians were, in some way, considered Poles. Russians, on the other hand, tended to treat the Belarussians (and Ukrainians) as just another branch of the Russian peoples. Interestingly, however, some Russians thought of at least the Polesians as a separate nationality. Kolarz comments, (quote) In North-eastern Poland (or South-western White Russia—which term we use entirely depends on our political sympathies) is to be found another linguistic and ethnological curiosity, the “Pinchuki”, who live in the marshy country of Polesia or Pinshchina (around the town of Pinsk) which is one of the areas contested between the Poles and the Soviets. They have a number…Polish statistics record over 700,000 of such Pinchuki who are simply described as “locals”…the “Pinchuki” are not a Polish invention but were recognized by Russian ethnographers long before the first World War. (unquote). (p. 17).JEWS AND CONFLICTED IDENTITYKolarz writes, (quote) Secondly, there were Jews whose assimilation had been complicated by the fact that they lived in a multi-national country or in an area of mixed language. In such cases it very often happened that Jews between two censuses or over a longer period withdrew form one ethnical group and attached themselves to the other. In some towns of Bohemia and Moravia, for instance, from the end of the nineteenth century onward, and ever-growing number of German Jews have changed over to the Czech nation. On a smaller scale the same thing happened in Slovakia, where a part of the Jews gave up their membership in the Magyar ethnical community and became Slovaks…Finally, there were the Jews who were indifferent to the rival claims of nationalities, and these were the majority. (unquote). (p. 23).Now consider the implications. Roman Dmowski, while always realizing that some Polish Jews become genuine patriotic Poles, pointed out that most Jews (of eastern Europe) had no real attachment to the nations in which they lived. Even those that did often did not remain that way. He cited the example of Hungarian Jews as ones whose assimilated status, and patriotic identification with Hungary [including that of the Israelitish Magyars], turned out to be a chameleon-like ephemeral loyalty. He feared that the same could happen with Poland-identifying Polish Jews. Kolarz's statements, quoted above, though not presented as such, indicate that Dmowski's concerns had some foundation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38KFYE25T6RF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TOTJG2#wasThisHelpful","R38KFYE25T6RF9","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, the first 1-2 miles east of the Des Plaines River and Chicago River were woodlands. Interestingly, the area situated between the west branch and east branch of the Chicago River was oak woodland.One shortcoming of this work is the profusion of maps that are too small.

"The events described in this work occurred in a German colony in present-day Namibia in the early 1900's.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDUnlike most indigenous peoples experiencing colonialism, the Nama (Hottentots) and Herero had not retreated into the hinterland or died-off from diseases. (p. 75). Nor were they impoverished in their dealings with the colonists. (p. 116). Despite a severe recent wave of rinderpest and other maladies, most Herrero peoples had bounced back into their pastoralist lifestyle. (p. 101).GERMAN RACISM AND GENOCIDEAs the 20th century began, intermarriages between Germans and locals were increasingly scorned as forms of RASSENSCHANDE (racial shame). (p. 244). Based largely on Social Darwinism, the old idea of ""white man's burden"" was replaced by a concept of ruthless exploitation. The destruction or enslavement of the lower races was converted into an aim, rather than effect, of colonialism. (p. 113).General Lothar von Trotha sought to exterminate the Herrero people by surrounding 50,000 of them, in an area 20 miles by 30 miles, with his military forces. (p. 142). No distinction was to be made between civilians and soldiers. Some of the Herrero survived by breaking out of encirclement and then enduring life in the desert. Others agreed to serve the Germans as laborers.GERMAN EXCULPATIONS: FALSE EQUIVALENCIESIn all the German concentration camps put together, the mortality rate was 40%-60%. (p. 220). For comparison, the death rates in the British concentration camps of the Boer War amounted to about 30% of those incarcerated: 39,000/130,000+ (p. 160)[Other sources indicate 25% or less]. The crucial difference, as the authors call it (p. 194), was that Kitchener's camps functioned to deprive the Boer fighters of support from the civilian population. The German camps were established AFTER the Herrero were already defeated, and had no ability or desire to resume fighting. (pp. 194-195).Shark Island may be considered the world's first death camp. By early 1907, 70% of the German-incarcerated Nama were dead, and a third of the remainder were reckoned close to death. (p. 217). The deaths were deliberate, and not from simple negligence (p. 219), and the closing of the camp was for political, not ethical, considerations. (p. 226). The prisoners' labor was an objective secondary to their extermination. (p. 220).Although Hermann Goering, during the Nuremberg trials, tried to relativize the Nazi camps by equating them with the British concentration camps during the Boer war, the comparison was patently ridiculous. All of the colonial camps were dwarfed by the later Nazi concentration camps, which would result in the death of 11 million people and the enslaving of an additional 6 million. (p. 342).COMPARE WITH GERMAN GENOCIDAL RACISM AGAINST SLAVSExpanding the context beyond South-West Africa, the authors allude to the HAKATA: ""As old antipathies towards the ethnic Polish population of Prussia...became increasingly racialized in the later nineteenth century, schemes to strengthen the `German element' of the population and prevent the `Polonization' of Prussia were proposed."" (p. 89). The eventual Hitlerian dream of a de-Polonized German Poland was seriously considered in the late nineteenth century: ""...the Pan-Germans also breathed new life into old concepts and began privately to debate the idea that Poland and the Baltic states might be `acquired' by Germany and colonized...Extreme as their policies were, the men of the Pan-Germanic League were not figures of the lunatic fringe. The league was a highly respectable, even intellectual organization. Its leading members held seats in the Reichstag; others were academics at the nation's most respected universities."" (p. 90).In contrast, the WWI and WWII German conduct towards eastern Jews was very different: ""The OSTJUDEN, the Eastern Jews who were the main translators for Ludendorff's army, were the same communities who were systematically murdered in their villages and town squares by the Nazi EINSATZGRUPPEN twenty-six years later."" (p. 270). [This confirms Polish complaints that the WWI-era local Jews were active agents of the German enemy.]By the time of WWII, the ""white man's burden"" had become a distant memory: ""In the Nazi East, there were to be no missionaries and no schools. The Russians, Poles, Ukrainians and others permitted to remain would be slaves with no hope of manumission or education. The only technological advances made available to them would be abortion and contraception, in an effort to keep their populations down to acceptable levels."" (pp. 337-338). [How ironic that Polish liberals today are causing a ""self-genocide"" among Poles]. Also, ""By the summer of 1941 the Nazis, and millions of their followers, had come to regard the Jews, Gypsies and Slavic peoples of the East in ways that were little different from how the SCHUTZTRUPPE and settlers of German South-West Africa had regarded the Herrero and Nama four decades earlier."" (p. 328).Actually, and not considered by the authors, German racism against Slavs exceeded that against the Herrero and Nama. Africans guilty of killing whites were hanged; whites guilty of killing blacks were sentenced to only months in prison. (p. 119). In contrast, a German could kill a Pole with complete impunity. In addition, Hitler said that, if forced to choose between them, he would rather rule over Negroes than Poles. Please click on, and read the Peczkis review, of Prelude to the Final Solution: The Nazi Program for Deporting Ethnic Poles, 1939-1941 (Modern War Studies).WHERE DID THE EPITHET ""HUN"" COME FROM?In 1900, the Kaiser travelled to China to exhort the German troops fighting against the Boxer Rebellion. Thinking that no one in the west would learn about it, he incited the German troops to kill mercilessly, take no prisoners, and make themselves a reputation as fearsome as the Huns of long ago. The Germans, though never even facing serious opposition, massacred thousands of innocent Chinese peasants. Word did get out, and thus the term `Hun' became synonymous for German. (pp. 105-10). In 1914, the German Army systematically murdered 6,000 Belgian civilians in reprisal for sniper fire. (p. 273).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57IT2HCCSPE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7G8LQA#wasThisHelpful","R57IT2HCCSPE3","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The obvious theme of this work is Polish-Ukrainian-Jewish coexistence in Lwow (Lviv). This work is full of information, and I focus on a few items of historical--rather than cultural--interest.SOME INTERESTING FACTSLwow (Lviv) was not founded by Danylo, as commonly taught. It long had preceded him. In fact, it is much older than anyone had imagined. Archeological evidence, cited from a Ukrainian-language source, indicates that the site of Lviv has been continuously inhabited since the 5th century A. D. (Yaroslav Hrytsak, p. 48).After the 1908 assassination of the Viceroy of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki, by a Ukrainian, there was a transfer of Greek Catholics to Roman Catholicism. This was because Polish-speaking Greek Catholics did not want to be identified as Ukrainians. (Philipp Ther, p. 276).The most important Jewish political party in interwar Poland, the Bund, had, in the author's words, ""a Marxist orientation."" (Philipp Ther, p. 266). Obviously, Jewish support for Communism had been much broader than membership in the Communist Party and its front organizations.Most of the remainder of my review concerns the assimilation of Lwow's Jews.JEWISH ASSIMILATION: A CONSEQUENCE OF JEWISH MODERNIZATIONThe centuries of Jewish separatism and self-imposed apartheid (my term), based on Talmudism and rabbinism, were becoming increasingly unsustainable. Jews could not effectively function in the modern state while living in medieval-style isolation. Assimilation was an obvious remedy.Assimilationist Polish Jews condemned modern Jewish nationalism (Zionism and Bundism) as a new form of self-imposed isolation---for ""trying to create a modern, national Jewish ghetto"". (p. 237).JEWISH GERMANOPHILIA AND ASSIMILATIONAfter the Partitions, some of the Jews began to assimilate--but to German, not Polish, and they became tools of the Austrian rulers of this part of Poland. Author Waclaw Wierzbieniec quips, (quote) For a Jew in Lviv the route towards emancipation and Haskalah led through Germanization. (unquote). (p. 226). In addition, (quote) One of the most important aims of Austrian officialdom was to assimilate Jews not to the local Polish or Ukrainian communities, but rather to Austrian culture so that they would contribute to the Germanization of Galicia. (unquote). (p. 228).The foregoing Jewish Germanophilia can very much be generalized. The author comments, (quote) Similar tendencies appeared throughout Central Europe, where the popularization of the German language among Jews was concomitant with the emergence of a Jewish renaissance. Almost without exception, emancipated Jews came from educated circles where German was the basic cultural language. (unquote). (p. 228).Until the 1870's, Lwow's assimilated Jews had gravitated to German--not Polish--culture. (p. 243). However, even as Galicia's Jews began to Polonize, only part of them identified with the Polish cause. The rest of them, while outwardly Polish, recast their Jewish identity in this Polish garb, and often became supporters of socialism, Zionism, etc. (p. 236). By the 1920's, Zionism had a greater impact on Polonized Jews than did a pro-Polish orientation. (p. 241).The Polonization of Galician Jews, however infrequent and however usually outward in nature, was a late development. Wierzbieniec comments, (quote) In the 1880s a majority of the Lviv Jews did not know Polish, and it was only at the beginning of the twentieth century that knowledge of that language had so increased that sessions of the religious council could be conducted in Polish. (unquote). (p. 235). Parallel developments occurred, at about the same time, in other Jewish centers in Austrian-ruled Galicia. (p. 235). However, the acculturation of the Jews, to Polish ways, never gained popularity among the mostly-Orthodox Jewish masses. (p. 235).Jews did not turn, in appreciable numbers, to the Polish language until after the resurrected Polish state had become a fait accompli in 1918. Even then, the Polonization did not come from Jewish initiatives. Instead, Jews had largely been driven to Polish by the prevailing circumstances--the use of the Polish language in public schools, the administration, and the armed forces. (p. 243).MOTIVES FOR ASSIMILATIONAlthough Wierzbieniec does not put it in these terms, he makes it obvious that assimilation of Jews to Polish-ness had generally been driven less by some newfound love for Poland and more by a spirit of self-advancement and opportunism. This is obvious as the reason that Galicia's assimilated Jews had increasingly shifted from German to a Polish. He writes, (quote) The Jewish intelligentsia that had previously gravitated to German language and culture in order to participate in the broader cultural, social, and political realms now recognized the Polish language as such as means. (unquote). (p. 233).A utilitarian spirit is also evident in the fact that Jews who assimilated did so to Polish rather than Ukrainian ways. He writes, (quote) The assimilation of Jews to Ukrainian culture had only an occasional or even incidental character, as it did not offer the possibility of social and economic advancement. (unquote). (p. 232).JEWS WHO BECAME POLISH PATRIOTSDuring the 1848 Revolution, some of the maskilim supported the Polish side. However, they were only a small group of Jews, mostly intellectuals, while the Orthodox masses remained indifferent. (p. 230).Movements among Galicia's Jews to identify with the Polish nation, and to support her national aspirations, were even more uncommon than outward Polonization. For instance, the Agudas Akhim [Covenant of Brothers; PRZYMIERZE BRACI], which lasted only from 1882 to the early 1890's, had only 178 members in Lwow in 1884. Attempts to open additional branches in other Galician cities failed, with the exception of Przemysl. (Wierzbieniec, pp. 134-135).Interestingly, Jewish historian Wilhelm Feldman, one of the leaders of Agudas Akhim, tacitly echoed Endek sentiments about Jewish essentialism and its quasi-immutability. He alluded to the difficulty of even Polonophile Jews to fully become Poles, (quote) ""A future scholar will not remain unmoved looking at the image of a handful of young people emerging around 1880 from the mass of half-Germanized and half-Asiatic Jewry, with a white eagle on a banner held in their mighty hands."" (unquote). (p. 235).Wierzbieniec blames Polish disinterest, and continued Polish anti-Semitism, for the marginal status, in Jewish eyes, of the Agudas Akhim, and its demise. Ironic to this, the Agudas Akhim blamed continued Jewish intransigence for Polish anti-Semitism. Please click on, and read the detailed Peczkis review, of Diaspora Nationalism and Jewish Identity in Habsburg Galicia.1930's POLAND: JEWISH ADVANTAGES AND POLISH ANTI-SEMITISMThe pre-WWII period is commonly painted, for Poland's Jews, in hues of black. It was not. Wierzbieniec writes, (quote) In spite of widespread anti-Semitism in Lviv society, Jews were free to open their own schools and participate in the politics and governance of the city. In the early 1930s, 25 Jews sat in a city council of 130 members. They designated their own representative to the city's deputy mayor...Jews constituted a significant group in the secondary schools and academies of Lviv...In the early 1920s, over 40 percent of the student body at the Jan Casimir University was Jewish. (unquote). (p. 242).The latter figure must be kept in perspective. Jews were only 10% of Poland's population.SUFFERINGS OF THE KRESY POLISH EXPELLEESFast-forward to the end of WWII:Much has been said about the privations of the German expellees (VERTRIEBENE) from places such as Silesia, and how this was supposed to be collective retribution against the Germans for losing the war. However, the Poles, who were supposed to be on the winning side of the war, also suffered greatly after Churchill and Roosevelt consented (at 1943 Teheran) to the Soviet grab of Poland's eastern half (Kresy), and the Poles faced expulsion. German historian Phillipp Ther, who wrote about both the German and Polish VERTRIEBENE, described the experiences of the Polish expellees from Lwow, (quote) The journey from Lviv to the areas of resettlement often lasted several weeks. The trains were largely without heat, were not supplied with food, and were often stopped and plundered. Reports from Upper Silesia show that about a quarter of the expellees were so ill upon arrival that they required immediate treatment. (unquote). (pp. 283-284).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYS81YQCJWPFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0916458970#wasThisHelpful","RYS81YQCJWPFT","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ESSAYS ON POLISH-JEWISH RELATIONS, by Joseph Orlitzky, is the English-language citation of this Polish-language work. My review is based on the original 1983 edition.Author Jozef Orlicki covers a broad sweep of Jewish history in Poland. His work was published while Poland was still under Communism, and it reflects this fact in the “class struggle” terminology it sometimes uses.SOME INTERESTING FACTSA significant number of Polish Jews were ennobled, and given the armorial. Orlicki (p. 10) estimates that hundreds of Polish Jews were ennobled during the First Republic.Some Jews supported Poland in her January 1863 Insurrection. Most did not. (pp. 21-23).Zionism and Folkism (Bundism) were forms of 19th- and 20th-century Jewish nationalism. Both were hostile to Polish national aspirations. (e. g, p. 26, 80). In fact, a number of quoted articles in the Litvak (Litwak)/Yiddishist newspapers expressed undisguised enmity towards the prospect of a resurrected Polish state. ((pp. 36-37).In the years leading up to Poland's regaining her independence (1918), Jews constituted 3-4% of the soldiers in Pilsudski's legions. (p. 35). However, they were under-represented in comparison with Jewish levels in Poland's general population (10-15%), and this contrasts with the Jews' over-representation in anti-Polish movements such as Communism.THE MINORITIES TREATYThe so-called Minorities Treaty of circa 1918 would have granted Jews special rights, and effectively made Jews a separate, parallel nation (a Judeopolonia) on Polish soil. In 1919, Wojciech Korfanty asked if the Polish minority in Germany (such as that in Westphalia) could even imagine such special rights and nation-within-nation privileges. (pp. 40-41). Muttermilch, an educated and assimilated Polish Jew, pointed out that the Minorities Treaty had nothing to do with the protection of the rights of Jews as a religious and cultural minority. These were rights that Poland's Jews already freely had. It was all about Jews having a set of special, separatist rights: Of their own political parties, their own government-funded schools, their own government-funded court system, and even their own parliament. (p. 45). [If that is not nation-within-nation privilege, then what is?]THE 1918-ERA POGROMSDuring the Lwow (Lviv) pogrom of 1918, the Austrian newspaper, DER ABEND, gave a fantastic Jewish death toll of 3,000, even though the actual Jewish death toll, from all war-related causes, was 68. (p. 42). Bernard Hausner, a member of the Polish parliament and also member of the religious-Zionist Mizrachi political party, took his fellow Zionists to task for inflaming the situation by (using modern parlance) rushing to judgment on the pogroms, by greatly exaggerating the Jewish death toll, and by otherwise acting disloyally to Poland. (pp. 42-43).In fact, much of the worldwide Jewish press greatly exaggerated the pogroms, and awfulized the situation of Jews in Poland. [Sound familiar?] Orlicki [Orlitsky] provides several examples of this. (pp. 44-45). Muttermilch, an educated and assimilated Polish Jew, condemned the egregious pogrom over-hype in the Jewish press, and exposed this as part of a politicized agenda of furthering Jewish separatism and special-national rights for the Jews in Poland. (p. 45).THE 1937 SCHECHITA LAWIn Poland, nearly 100% of animals were slaughtered in accordance with the dictates of Jewish ritual slaughter. In other European countries, it was 2-4%. (p. 54). The use of schechita in Poland greatly raised the price of veal—by an annual rate of 18 million zlotys. (p. 54).The schechita law of 1937 did NOT, as often mischaracterized, in any way abolish schechita itself. It only restricted ritual slaughter to those towns where the Jewish population was over 3%, and restricted Jewish butchers to selling ritually-slaughtered meat in selected stores. (p. 54). Clearly, the claim that the schechita law was an anti-Semitic affront to the Jewish religion, though often presented as such, was manifestly false. It had a sound economic basis, as elaborated below.The schechita law of 1937 eliminated the jobs of an alleged 100,000 workers. These included schechita butchers, transport personnel, salesmen, etc. (p. 54). Obviously, these occupations had largely been of an economically-superfluous, make-work nature.From all the above descriptions, a number of conclusions are in order. It is evident that ritual slaughter, in Poland, had been very much out of step with the modern animal-slaughtering procedures of other European nations. In addition, it had been a hidden tax that had supported the Jewish religion. Finally, it had supported a chain of unproductive, arguably-parasitic middlemen, and had thus burdened all Poles with unnecessarily high prices for meat.THE SHOAH SUPPRESSED?Author Orlicki has a detailed description of the Nazi German-made Holocaust. He is unambiguous about the fact that Jews were targeted by the Germans, and that they had been targeted because they were Jews. Many modern Holocaust materials would have us believe that the Holocaust had been deliberately forgotten in the first few decades of post-WWII Poland, and that Jewish deaths were merely subsumed under such narratives as ""Polish citizens"" and ""victims of fascism"". Orlicki's work is yet another refutation of that ridiculous canard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SM2AN01DFM45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8303000829#wasThisHelpful","R3SM2AN01DFM45","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This work is much more than biography. It offers a pulse of the state of Judaism in the late 19th and early 20th century. It focuses on the life and the ideas of Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Kook, whom author Mirsky describes as “a colossal figure in the English-speaking world.” (p. ix). Kook was born in tsarist Russia, and then lived in Palestine and England.The author sagely notes that the Litvaks (Litwaks) were as much a marker of Jewish cultural orientation as they were of geography. (p. 16). [Author Mirsky’s reasoning has a parallel in Polish (notably Endek) thinking. In Polish eyes, “Litvak” had a typological, and not solely geographic, meaning. It referred to those Jews who were particularly hostile to Polish ways and/or Polish national aspirations.]The author portrays Rav Kook as an original thinker. Though Orthodox, he had positive responses to the secularist and the Zionist tendencies among many Jews of the time. For example, traditional Judaism’s relationship to modernizing tendencies should not be solely antagonistic, but dialectic. (e. g, p. 39). Instead of rejecting Zionism, Kook wanted to combine it with religion, as exemplified by the Mizrachi. (p. 233). Kook’s “softness” on heresy, and his accommodating spirit to modern trends, earned him the ire of other Orthodox Jews.OLD PEJORATIVE TERMS USED FOR CHRISTIANSRav Kook was antagonistic towards Christianity, particularly its otherworldly aspects, as described by Mirsky, (quote).…(Kook) saw the Christian abandonment of the world as downright demonic, and the gravest heresy of all. “MINUT [the Talmudic term for Christianity] abandoned the law, planted itself in the imagined attribute of mercy and kindness, which destabilizes the world and destroys it…” (unquote). (p. 130). (The content in brackets is the author Mirsky’s).Many Orthodox Jews of 20th-century Palestine dealt with Rav Kook in the harshest terms for his deviations from Orthodoxy, even juxtaposing him with Christians, and doing so in a venomous manner. Mirsky comments, (quote) But the vilification of Rav Kook never let up, especially among members of the Agudat Yisrael youth movement, who heckled him, attacked him in posters, and at times threw buckets of water in his face as he walked down the street…On March 23, 1932, the eve of the holiday of Purim, the Jerusalem chapter of the Agudah youth staged a mock trial in which Rav Kook was tried for heresy. Next, they mutilated him in effigy as the youngsters danced around and sang…the billboard rhetoric against him reached a new pitch, “That man, the MIN (that is, Christian), hypocritical, flattering, like a pig rummaging in trash and raising a stink…” (unquote). (pp. 203-204). I will not complete the quoted sentence because it has pornographic connotations. The explicit definition of MIN as Christian, in the parentheses in the quoted statement above, is in the text of Mirsky’s book, and not something that I had added.Let us examine the implications. Many commentators would have us believe that the references in the Talmud, to idolaters and heretics, do not apply to Christians, at least to modern Christians. From the above quoted statements, it is obvious that they most certainly do—even in the 20th century. Clearly, Polish scholar Feliks Koneczny, in his JEWISH CIVILIZATION, had been correct in identifying MIN as one of the derogatory Talmudic terms that are in fact applied, by Jews, to Christians.HELPING JEWS EVADE MILITARY SERVICERav Kook lived in London during WWI. Here is what he did, (quote) On arrival, he [Rav Kook] became the leading rabbinic figure of England’s eastern European Orthodox community. A stranger to established Anglo Jewry, he found himself bumping up against settled ways. After signing one rabbinic ordination after another to save young men from conscription, he was called in for questioning by Scotland Yard; police investigators had noticed that many of his “rabbis” were in fact not religiously observant. He was let off with a stern warning but kept on, unimpressed by invocations of the moral significance of the British war effort. (unquote). (pp. 140-141).The informed reader may realize that the Jews of Poland frequently attempted to avoid military service in the Polish Army. The reason (or exculpation) was the unwillingness to serve in the army of a state that had anti-Semitism, and which failed to give Jews the rights that they were entitled to (or that they thought that they were entitled to). However, whatever could be said of Poland, this could hardly be said of philo-Semitic England, yet evasion of military service by Jews took place just the same.There is more. The objections of many Poles (notably the Endeks) to the so-called Minorities Treaty included the concern that Jews would be emboldened to evade service in the Polish Army on putative religious grounds. The actions of Rav Kook are one example of this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4632UYU4YH0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300164246#wasThisHelpful","R4632UYU4YH0E","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LED THE BRYGADA SWIETOKRZYSKA OF THE NSZ is the title of this Polish-language work. My review is based on the original 1984 edition.This action-packed memoir covers the prewar period, the 1939 campaign, guerilla actions in the region of Kielce, and the fascinating march across SW Czechoslovakia, ahead of the advancing Red Army, to a meeting with Patton's Third Army.The NSZ (NARODOWE SILY ZBROJNE) considered the Soviets an equal enemy with the Nazis, and opposed any fighting for them. Polish-Soviet cooperation had brought bitter fruits. The disarming of A.K. (ARMIA KRAJOWA) soldiers, the killing of their officers by the NKVD, and the betrayal of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising were taken as self-evident indicators of the folly (even criminality) of existing Soviet-allying Polish policies. (e. g., p. 58). [Barring hindsight, it isn't so simple. Failure to fight the Germans on behalf of the Russians would've played into the hands of Communist propaganda, which insisted that non-Communist Poles aren't really substantive participants in the anti-Nazi alliance, and have no significant standing among Poles. It would probably also have extinguished whatever slim chance there still existed for effective western support for a non-Communist Poland.]Soviet-sponsored Communist GL-AL bands were well-armed, often led by Russians, and of many nationalities (p. 65, 80-81). They regularly murdered AK and NSZ members (pp. 114-116), identified others to the Gestapo (p. 188, 192), robbed, raped, and killed Polish villagers (p. 109, pp. 127-128), and needlessly provoked German reprisals against local Poles. (p. 65). (The large-scale Jewish involvement in the Communist GL-AL, and in bandit bands, clarifies recurrent charges of the NSZ killing Jews).The NSZ strategy was to fight only when it, or surrounding civilian populations, were in immediate danger from Germans, the GL-AL, or bandits. (p. 64, 73, 81). The goal was to conserve its strength, and that of the Polish nation, in anticipation of Brigade participation in a future western-Soviet war. (p. 144, 173).Polish guerillas could successfully attack German units in surprise attacks, but were insufficiently armed for sustained, open combat against them. The Commander correctly predicted that AK units would be unable to break through the German encirclement of Warsaw to aid the Uprising. (p. 79).Ironic to accusations of the NSZ being anti-Semitic, it was singularly responsible for saving a few hundred Jewish women from certain death. This occurred on May 4, 1945 at a small women's concentration camp near Holyszow (Holysov), located about 25 km SSW of Plzen (Pilsen). (It was a sub-camp of Flossenburg concentration camp.) The barracks housing the Jewish women were surrounded by gasoline-filled cans, ready to be torched upon the approach of Allied armies. The Brigade took the camp by surprise (pp. 158-163), taking many Germans prisoner (p. 223), and freeing the 1,000 women of various nationalities (p. 151, 189). Later, the French government rewarded the Brigade for these heroics. (p. 259).General George Patton played a key role in preventing the Brigade from falling into the hands of the Soviets. (p. 225, 260). Fortunately, he didn't share the rosy view of the Soviet Union then held by most Americans.The Communist smear campaign against the NSZ included--surprise--the media charge of it being fascist (p. 172), and this has been picked up by many Jewish memoirs that I have read. Accusations of NSZ-Nazi collaboration are falsehoods. During the westward march, agreements with German forces were purely of the nature of local truces (pp. 141-145), facilitated by the increasing German reluctance to die in a losing war against a non-strategic objective. The Brigade was allowed to march through the Czech Republic, not Germany. Pointedly, the Commander repeatedly refused German enticements for the Brigade to go back and fight behind Soviet lines. (p. 147, 149). In his memoirs, Communist Mieczyslaw Moczar lied about the Commander begging the Germans to stop shooting at him (p. 235, 242).The Reds didn't stop with propaganda. After Germany's defeat, they tried to kidnap or assassinate the Commander at least twice (pp. 178-179). Later, in 1950, they unsuccessfully framed him before a French court, trying to get him extradited as a war criminal merely for having fought against Communists. (p. 185).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11F81FTNSUOW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8364452126#wasThisHelpful","R11F81FTNSUOW5","A3Q04XXGGED746","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q04XXGGED746?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've seen where some people have complained that the little mushroom part is too small, making this difficult to flip pages over without manually pushing them to one side.

"I use these for my two chihuahuas as they have relatively small bladders, and, like many people, I work 8+ hours a day. I had tried regular cat litter but read that a lot of people did not recommend as it might cause unhealthy build-up in their digestive systems if they ate it. Plus, they tend to dig in it (both treat it like beach sand and would try and roll in it as well). Purina's Second Nature was the first litter I tried after the traditional clay stuff fell flat. It wasn't bad, but the pieces were so large that my smallest little chihuahua had trouble with her footing and so would avoid like the plague. I saw the Yesterday's News litter and thought maybe it would be better as it's a good bit thinner than SN (though I kept the Second Nature litter pan since the sides weren't too high, especially at the entrance, and was easier for my dogs to step into...not to mention large enough to prevent missteps). So far so good. Started with the fresh scent, but it's virtually useless at controlling odor, so now I save money by just buying the regular. It's not awful, but it can get a bit ammonia-y. I scoop daily and wash the box once a week. In between, I sprinkle baking soda on the more concentrated areas where my dogs prefer to pee.  The main reason I deducted a star from my rating is that it's a bit wasteful. The pellets are quite thin and easily fall through any scoop size. Once wet, the pellets break apart easily. So scooping and shaking does nothing but redistribute soiled pellets more evenly amongst unsoiled ones. I've since found that using a thinner layer works best as the urine goes all the way to the bottom and scooping the entire section doesn't take away as much unused litter. I'll have to monitor my use more closely and will edit this review to include information on how much litter lasts for how long.Update: I know line the bottom of the pan with a pee pad and scoop a very thin layer of litter on top. Doing this has extended the use of a bag to three times what it use to, though you do have to factor in the additional cost of the pads. However, another positive to using pads under is that it's a LOT easier to clean up. I simply grab each order and lift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HC5ZYQK2BSHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AQ0BQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HC5ZYQK2BSHI","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really afraid that I would have to write a negative review for this pen. I had the hardest time getting it to work when it arrived. Using the bottled ink converter and warm water seemed to finally do the trick. I was very pleased with this pen once I started using it. From a couple of other comments, I was worried that the barrel would be really cheap feelings, but it's actually not. It has a nice matte finish that gives it a sort of carbon fiber feel to it. It's lightweight, but not so much that you don't feel the pen is stable. The ink releases faster than I'd imagined, so I'll have to practice a bit to get the hang of things, but it's a real pleasure to write with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14D2N4TTSMAG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T401Y#wasThisHelpful","R14D2N4TTSMAG5","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this after seeing all of the positive reviews and glowing recommendations on the internet. I'd had a French press, but I was tired of all the unscrewing and cleaning involved...not to mention the fear of cracking the glass either through a careless misstep or extreme temperature fluctuations from pouring hot water into a cold (in the winters we keep the house very chilly) carafe. So the AeroPress seemed perfect. Plastic. Easy to clean. Coffee to go ""whoohoo!!!"" about. Huh...not so much.Is it easy to use? Maybe for most...not for me. Took me forever to align the plunger properly. It would tilt. It would go in crooked. And I felt like I was having to exert a lot of force, which is something I never noticed from all of those demonstrations. Perhaps it would have been better once the Aeropress was ""broken in"" a bit, and I do admit that it seemed the plunger went in easier on the second go, though I still felt like I was having to exert more force than I'd like to that early in the morning. However, the coffee it produced was beyond revolting. Let me be clear: it was NOT the grinds. It's the same stuff I've drunk for the past couple of months. There's nothing ""off"" about them. The only new factor in this equation is the Aeropress. And it made my coffee taste nasty! Some sort of weird fishy taste permeated the brew. I tried it again...same results. It's now in the box to go to Goodwill.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVK814VV6D3ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HBCVX0#wasThisHelpful","RVK814VV6D3ID","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I purchased my Global knife, I was very happy with its performance but noticed that, after a couple of years, it had lost some of its keen edge. I was looking into the idea of shipping it off to sharpen it when I decided to do some research on the issue. A few Youtube videos later, I realized that I didn't need to sharpen it by sending it off and grinding it down. I needed to ""realign"" the edge. I decided on a ceramic sharp stick as I wasn't sure what the hardness of my Global was and figured the ceramic would be fairly all-purpose. Once it arrived, I promptly began honing my knife with a few passes. I thought it would be hard to get the angle, but it really does follow the shape of your knife's edge. I immediately noticed a huge difference. It really is amazing. At the slightest hint of dullness, I pass my knife over the sharp stick and it's instantly transformed into scalpel-like precision. I am very, very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129DU91UKZYAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B8FW0O#wasThisHelpful","R129DU91UKZYAR","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a beige and charcoal toile comforter and when I saw this, I just knew it would be a perfect accent pillow...and it is!I was a bit worried when someone else posted that the material was super rough/coarse. Even though I only plan on using it as an accent pillow, I am sensitive to very scratchy and abrasive surfaces. I'm glad I went ahead and ordered it though b/c I personally don't find it scratchy at all. It's stiff b/c it's some sort of burlap weave, but the material itself is very smooth. It feels like really thick linen, which if anyone has ever held a new linen shirt (real linen...not that linen-like stuff), you'd know that it's no Egyptian cotton.

"Update: Finally figured out how to add those pictures.I have a super tiny kitchen and needed just one or two little pops of color to bring some life into it without also hauling in clutter. Found some beautiful turquoise blue kitchen towels and mitts, so when I spied this on Amazon (combining my love for both turquoise blue AND owls), I had to have it! It's been one of my favorite purchases for my new apartment.It's a little smaller than most utensil crocks, but this is clearly illustrated by picture in which it's holding pencils and by the measurements given. I was aware of the size, but I only really use my wooden utensils, which have very slim handles and a light weight, so it was perfect for that.I just adore this little owl.

"I should have listened to the other reviewers because everything they said was true. Point of fact: if it wasn't a near impossible feat to box this up and return it, I would do so in a heartbeat. I purchased this sofa and its matching loveseat because I needed something that could be delivered without a 1-2,000 dollar minimum purchase, was attractive, and could fit in a small space. I suppose, in hindsight, it did meet all of those criteria. However, comfort was (I thought) a given. Especially since my last sofa was an under 400 purchase and very comfy indeed. Not so, boys and girls. Not so.First, the pros: attractive and easy to assemble. Love the shape. Love the fabric, which is a soft corduroy.Now the cons...actually, only one huge con: it's super uncomfortable! I don't know what kind of springs they have in this, but I can feel them in the seat. Not only that, I can actually HEAR them when I sit and even when I use my hand to exert just a little bit of pressure. My friend was there when I did this and was LoL at how much twanging it was doing. Plus, the seat and back cushions are strangely conjoined so that when you sit, you find that your back curves out...which causes horrible back fatigue. In order to sit without agony, I find that I have to push myself all the way back with some force and wiggle in until I find a position that doesn't hurt. In fact, I'm trying to make this short and sweet b/c my back is still killing me from last night's foray onto Serta sofas. As far as I'm concerned, this couch and loveseat were a 700 dollar mistake. As soon as I save up the money, I'm going to purchase another sofa/loveseat. All I know for sure at this juncture is that it will definitely NOT be a Serta. In fact, considering the main problem with this sofa is the cushions, I think I'll be avoiding anything Serta for the foreseeable future.12-29-14 - It is now five months later, but the cushions are already showing signs of compression.

None of that little-round-sticker nonsense that a lot of the scratch and sniff books have fallen back on. And though I love the Mr. Smith scratch and sniff books, this one blows it away. The scents are much more true...the smog scent literally smelled like gasoline and motor oil, it was fantastic. In the Smith books, some scents are super light (the banana) or just smell like one part of the whole (the spaghetti smelled like plain garlic), but Animal Gas really did capture all of the smells perfectly.

"I can understand if this was for a side salad, but as a main salad container, it's much too small. The design is nicely thought of. I like the fact that the salad ingredients can be stored separately, especially useful if you don't want to get certain ingredients soggy, but the bottom container holds maybe a cup of lettuce and the dressing container barely fits 2 tablespoons of light ranch. Now for pasta salads or salads that have a heavy protein component (such as tuna, chicken, or egg salads which require a smaller bed of lettuce), I think this would be o.k. However, the salads I eat are not meat or carb heavy (maybe 2 oz of protein per salad). The bulk is vegetables, and I need a good sized container in order to get full and stay full for a good 4-5 hours after eating.

"I teach, and I have a hard time organizing papers for efficient grading. With multiple classes and multiple assignments, the paper stack grows and grows until I end up with what looks like a Stephen King manuscript. Tried just using the paperclip method, but papers would escape, or the clips would snag on other assignments. Plus, the papers would shift and become crumpled or unclipped in my tote during the trip from school to home. I then began using a plain accordion file, which worked out well, but the flap was cheaply made (it basically bent the plastic back) and would have to be held back or else pop me in the face and cover the opening, and it didn't hold quite as much because the flap (again with that flap) didn't provide much headway for the papers and would pinch the top of the accordion file when I started filling it. So when I saw the Mead, I knew I had to have it.First of all, it's extremely roomy. Because the zipper allows for a good 1/2 inch of room above the papers, it doesn't pinch them in or become warped/distended. In fact, there's so much room at the top that I'm actually able to insert manila folders inside, which is great because I can ensure that important documents (like tests) are kept completely separate and don't run any risk of getting misplaced. The tabs pop up to be visible over large stacks of work. There's a little clear section in the very front where I can put whatever rubric I'm using for that week. I label a tab for each class and have a section for keys and makeup work/no name papers. It's fantastic. Really well made. No snags with the zipper.

"I had been looking for a casual/unstructured, everyday tote. While I already have a decent selection of handbags, my one black purse is more of an office type of bag, and I just don't feel comfortable slinging it across my arm for a trip to the gym or during dress-down days. Plus, since I've been putting in some extra hours at work, I've had to bring in more items to prep for grueling 10-12 hour days. This tote has tons of room. Admittedly, it's a bit of a rummage to get at everything, but I don't see that as a flaw. I mean, if I want a large, unstructured bag, it sort of comes with the territory.The leather is very supple, which is as functional as it is pretty b/c the straps tend to stay on my shoulders better than leather that has a glossier finish. The hardware is very nice too. I originally had my heart set on the previous model with the gold hardware and zipper, but I'm glad those were sold out. The gunmetal offers more flexibility with regards to my jewelry, and it's not as flashy as the gold, which makes it easier to dress up or down. I had some concerns on whether or not I was actually getting gunmetal (the pictures look sort of silver, especially the O-rings attaching to the straps), but it IS the gunmetal version...which is especially lovely. I didn't quite know what to expect from that description; I thought maybe it was a deeper stainless color, but it's actually a lovely dark metallic grey. Reminds me of hematite or malachite. Eye-catching without overpowering the rest of the purse or whatever accessories you choose to pair with your outfit.All-in-all, I think this is going to be my go-to bag for quite some time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H101XHWIC30G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N8GT8I#wasThisHelpful","R3H101XHWIC30G","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this pitcher as the fast flow system allows not only for a quicker fill-up but more space. Most other pitchers have almost equal space devoted to both the reservoir and a refilling section...obviously b/c most people don't want to sit there for longer periods of time waiting for their pitchers to become full. With the fast flow Filtrete, I can set my faucet to a medium drizzle, walk away, and come back when I see it's almost full. It doesn't take long.I can't say how this filter holds up against heavily chlorinated water. We have a well, and the water it produces is pretty good. I just use this as a finishing touch to clear out any impurities or sediments. I like the slim design, and I like that the spout closes. Some of the Brita filter pitchers do not have a closing spout and, as a result, the water can become tinged with the flavors of the fridge. I'm not a huge water drinker, so it's not like I refill this thing everyday. If you do, then the lingering flavors wouldn't be a problem as it doesn't have time enough to sit and absorb.So why three stars? Because the filter is impossible to find at my local stores and buying online isn't economical. Part of it seems to be that the style of the pitcher has changed. While I cannot find the long/rectangle filters (or even the pitchers) anymore, there's lots of the round filter and round pitchers. One of the few things I liked about Brita was that most filters worked in most pitchers (with only a few exceptions) and the style has mostly stayed the same.If it wasn't for the fickle nature of its design and the subsequent difficulty in getting filters, I'd have easily rated this 4 or even 5 stars, but performance isn't everything. Convenience (especially for regularly replaced parts) is a factor as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VAEQJE4693W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F2H1FA#wasThisHelpful","R36VAEQJE4693W","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the idea of a cordless keyboard and, for the most part, it's lived up to its promise. No more cords getting in the way. No more hogging usb ports. Fairly extensive battery life. However, there is one glaring detractor that, to me, is worth deducting two stars. It doesn't register all of my keystrokes...at least not when I'm typing fast. When I slow it down to around 25-35 words per minute, it registers everything, but I typically type in the 60-65 wpm range. When I do type faster, it skips letters. At first I thought it was me. That perhaps I was making keystroke mistakes, so I tested it by typing out a simple refrain using few keys and that I was positive I was maintaining accuracy on, and it was still skipping letters.

"I've never had luck with lip balms. From the expensive Kiehl's to your average cherry Chapstick, none of them really worked for me. In fact, I'd find that the waxy texture and/or odd taste would keep me from naturally licking my lips and eventually lead to over-drying...quite the opposite of what I bought them for. Well, this year I started noticing that a LOT of my female students were using the EOS lipbalms in class. Sort of hard to miss the egg shaped container. I curiously asked about it and was given rave reviews by them. Not usually one to take fashion and makeup advice from teenagers, I went on a limb and purchased during my next trip to the grocery store. I bought the strawberry sorbet, and while it doesn't exactly taste like strawberries or sorbet, it does have a nice fruity scent and a slightly sweet taste. However, the icing on top is that it works great. The balm is fast absorbing. Unlike others that lay on your skin, this seems to be absorbed, leaving behind slightly moist and dewy lips. Only small downsize is that the dispenser is a rather shape and size, which makes it a bit difficult to fit in some makeup bags. However, on the flip-side, it makes it easy to find one-handed in your purse.

"After finding my beloved Gold Toe was going to el cheapo route and not having any luck with other brands, I'd pretty much resigned myself to socks that I considered wearable but not comfortable. I almost didn't buy these Balega Comfort socks, despite their high price and high number of positive reviews. I'd listened to the same reviews with regards to some Thorlo socks and had been severely disappointed. However, I figured one pair wouldn't break the bank and ordered anyway.So glad I did. They are a bit pricey. Much more than your average mass retail store sock and even pricier than what my beloved Gold Toes use to be, but they're worth it. Some of my love for Balega is based on preference; I love a sock that is very elastic and molds to my foot, especially in my arch. I love it to have some thickness to it, especially in the heel and under the ball. I don't like threading/seam bunches in the corners of my toes. I like socks that are soft but not fuzzy/pilly...more of a well-used cotton type of soft. The Balega Hidden Comfort gave me all of these.Every time I order from Amazon or need a few more dollars to meet the free shipping requirement, I just throw another pair of these in.

"I purchased this not based on the price (which is admittedly very affordable) but b/c of the strength of reviews. Reviews which I had hoped would lead me to the type of bank deposit bags I was used to dealing with when I worked in retail. Nothing fancy...just thick plastic pouches of blue, green, or black. However, while this bag matches them in size, it does not match them in quality. This bag is thin and cheap feeling. I'm no fortune-teller, but I have my doubts as to whether it will last us through my class's multiple fundraiser and dues collection each year.

"I have a wide head. I'm talking basketball-wide. Most hats don't fit. Those cute little terry-cloth bathbands don't fit. Tried using a plastic headband once and had it snap just from trying to fit it around the old noggin. Thing cracked in two and sent pieces flying. I wear eye glasses and always have to purchase ones with hinges on each side that flex out. Yes, my head is that round. So when I'd read that these are a bit roomy, I thought I'd hit the jackpot. I have to say this for these glasses: they are gorgeous. Perfect shade of brown transitioning flawlessly down the lens. Glamorous shape and gorgeous carrying case.However, they were too big.

Years of snapping headbands and not being able to try on cute little horn rimmed glasses and I luck out on a pair of lovely shades that keep falling down my face. Who would have thunk it?

"I wanted a cosmetic case and had my eye on this one by Rebecca Minkoff. I'd seen others online, and I liked the cute little sayings on the bag. I have a RM purse and love the quality of the leather it's made from and was not disappointed to find that this pouch also came in a very soft and supply pebble-grained version. It's also really big. You can't tell too much from this photo, but it's much broader than my hand with fingers splayed and almost as tall. Similar in size to a large makeup bag but not as deep. It easily fit all my makeup (including a rather large compact), my travel sized brush, an EOS lipgloss egg, a small B and BW hand sanitizer, a small bottle of Neutrogena hand lotion and still had some room for more items if I'd wished. One thing though, it's a very loud pink. I'm talking fry-your-retinas HOT pink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYRVWOPBJ1CZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YQ3HYC#wasThisHelpful","R3IYRVWOPBJ1CZ","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the RM Cupid in Sea Green. The picture shows an almost baby-blue color, but in reality the Sea Green is more of a teal that is slightly darker (and more of a peacock-y) color than the photo. Very popular color these days and adds a nice visual pop to almost every outfit.The item design is exactly as pictured, and the leather is very nice. Unlike some other brands, it's very soft and supple and has a nice equestrian leather type of smell. Some leathers smell chemical-y, but not the Cupid. I had horses when I was young, and the feel in my hands and the scent in my nose brings back memories of cleaning bridles and saddles gone soft with wear and oil. The hardware is nice too. It's a unique color...sort of a very light gold. Perfect in that it can look like it goes with either gold or silver without leaning too far in one direction. Little details like the fringe on the main zipper and the push clips on the side to detach the longer strap really add a nice touch. The strap comes notched on the second hole, and I find that it lays perfectly at a little below my waist. The bag contours nicely to my hip, even with it full of items, and the shoulder strap stays in place...very important feature for me as I have sloped shoulders and hate constantly having to push straps up.There are plenty of pockets both inside and out of the purse, and the interior fabric is a nice black/off-white print. Unlike other purses I've seen, the exterior pockets on both the front and sides are actually of a decent size to place items in. The two smaller pockets on the inside (for cellphone and whatever else) are a little too small for me, but that's because I have one of those big, honkin' Otterbox Defender cases, and to be fair, they don't really fit in any purse's cellphone pocket. The zip pocket on the opposite side inside the bag is big enough to fit my glasses or a large phone. And the interior compartment is very large as well. I was a bit worried at first that the top of the bag wouldn't expand enough in either direction to make removal and insertion of items easy (a problem I'd had with a small Speedy 25 bag), but the opening is, in fact, plenty wide enough. There is more vertical space than I really know what to do with, but the plus size is that my ipad (complete with cover) fit easily. There is only one small drawback to this purse and that is that it can get a bit heavy. I put my ipad, my wallet, my makeup case, and a small card case in this morning, and it was pretty weighed down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZ9G7IDGT4HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJCWDHG#wasThisHelpful","R1AZ9G7IDGT4HB","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever go to the salon for one of those cute bobs (long or short) and leave with the softest, lightest, bounciest hair imaginable? Then you try to recreate it at home and end up with a flat mess. That was me. I've been through countless round brushes...each time with whatever sales associate telling me I needed to get the one with the straight plastic bristles b/c of my thick hair or (when that failed) to get the one with tourmaline or 24 kt. gold and any number of odd suggestions. I thought maybe it was the hair dryer I was using and went through three different models with all sorts of diffusers and attachments. Finally, out of desperation, I turned to shampoos and styling products. A sticky, dry, oily while later, I pretty much gave up and decided to grow it out and channel my inner flower child. Then one day I got a haircut and the stylist had a brush that was just amazing. Gripped my thick hair without any problem but instead of pulling hard on any tangles (I'm tender-headed), it softly brushed through them like sheets sliding against each other...leaving behind a slightly billowy and very voluminous result. She couldn't remember the company that made her brush or even what size it was, but I examined it carefully and then came on Amazon to track it (or its closest relative) down. Enter the Nexxus Volume Effexx. Built just like her brush (for all I know it IS the same as hers), this brush has the longer and more rigid plastic bristles paired with a shorter boar-like one. The result is that it grips even the thickest of hair and then ""whips"" it up a bit to create lovely volume.I used it for the first time yesterday, and I received so many compliments at work. Everyone was asking me what I did differently or if I got a new haircut. Just one run-through with this brush gave me a beautiful soft curl (yes, a bonafide wavy curl) at my bang area. And the rest of my hair just felt so smooth and light, capturing perfectly that salon-like bounce and feel. Also, the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.Can't say enough about this brush and would recommend to everyone. Oh, and I purchased the jumbo btw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTAB476D6XELU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KQ0PL6#wasThisHelpful","RTAB476D6XELU","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why oh why did I not find this brush years ago before I plunked down over 100 dollars on a Mason Pearson brush? Because this little punch of bristled power out-performs the Pearson easily. I was worried about using the Phillips because I have very thick hair and must soft bristled brushes cannot go through all the way to the scalp. However, this one did and easily I might add. Also, I have dry scalp and found that the rounded tips of these bristles don't aggravate my skin or cause flaking. It doesn't produce nearly the same amount of flyaways and static as my plain Goody's brush, and does a really good job at smoothing my hair without flattening it. I thought the size was a little too small, but it actually works out just fine and, as a result of its tiny size, fits into my cosmetic bag rather nicely...which is good b/c I hate keeping a brush in the main body of a purse as it tends to deposit hair at the bottom. Nothing like going in to grab a bit of something and coming out with numerous strands of hair sticking to everything you own.Highly, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29D8WR1LVFL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DH0OR8#wasThisHelpful","R29D8WR1LVFL0","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love, love, love Pride and Prejudice. I love the book and especially adore the 1994 BBC miniseries. However, a part of me always wanted to interject a little bit of naughty with all that reserved, Edwardian nice. Enter Mr. Darcy's refuge. A nice little bit of fluff that has our two leads doing a bit more than sharing a brief kiss in a carriage, this story helped fill in some gaps previously attempted only by my imagination. However, it's not a five-star endeavor. For one thing, it's a bit too Barbara Cartland for my tastes. I mean, I want a more visceral response and a lot more passion, but I could have done without that 1960's type of romance novel drivel. Like Darcy musing on several occasions that Elizabeth was now his, his, his... Or when he starts fantasizing about her eyes and the passion he knows is in her as he is trying to rescue a child trapped under a fallen tree branch. I'm sorry, but I just don't see that really fitting in with Darcy's personality. Wool-gathering while saving a little boy and dealing with all manner of disaster? I think not.Still, I don't regret buying it. So three stars it gets. I did think it was o.k. Not really like, not love, but it was well enough to keep me occupied (and with a couple of smiles on my face) for an evening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSHMY8MUQHP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00919X9CW#wasThisHelpful","R3RSHMY8MUQHP2","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful purse. The color is gorgeous: I purchased it in buff. It's the perfect neutral. Leather is soft and has a nice smell. However, the style of it (with the grips being so close to the body of the purse) doesn't allow for much in way of storage. Basically, the upper half section has to remain free of items for it to lie comfortably against your body if you carry it on your shoulder b/c your arm has no choice but to rest on the body of the bag as the straps are so short. And it's pretty heavy. I loaded up two small cosmetic purses, a bi-fold wallet, a small bottle of hand cream, and my kindle; and the purse was already uncomfortable on my shoulder and heavy in my hands when used as a satchel. I think the style of this purse is fantastic and it really adds elegance to any outfit, but it's not really good for actually hauling things around...more an exclusive accessorizing piece than a handbag. Maybe you could tote a few odds and ends, but you don't want to fill it up too much (even if you have the strength of Hercules) b/c the body is not so wide, so putting in a lot of items would cause the sides to bulge and make it lose that sleek/streamlined appeal as the top puckered and gaped.Oh, and I would have at least given it 4 stars, but I was disappointed with craftmanship. There was beige paint smeared on both gold knobs at the top of the purse. One was pretty much halfway covered. Am returning it and will continue my search for something fashionable AND functional.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2407999828CVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OQNSJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2407999828CVG","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice enough wallet. Really nice leather. Hardware is a bit oversized and larger than appears on the website. For example, the zippers are HUGE. The studs are the size of large pearls. The small front pocket does unzip but seems more decorative as the space inside is pretty small. Be warned that despite its luxurious leather and gold rivets, this wallet is very low key. The leather is super supple and floppy. Almost cloth-like. That's what really drove me crazy about this wallet. I didn't like the idea of not being able to open the change department without grabbing some material to keep the zipper from just pulling the material over on itself.  Oh, and the zipper doesn't go all the way around all corners. It stops short at the very last lower right hand corner...not by much but enough that the wallet doesn't lie completely flat when unzipped. The style comes off very laid back and casual. It's a Birkenstock sort of wallet, if that makes sense, and just not what I want.

"I'm so glad to have rediscovered Teresa Medeiros. I'd pretty much given up on the author after I'd read a few of her books that just didn't interest me. Nobody's Darling was my shot in the dark, and it hit the bulls-eye. Reminiscent of the leads in Heather and Velvet, Billy and Esme share a somewhat tempestuous relationship, but there's enough humor and unambiguous love/desire on both of their part that make you eager to turn the page and see where their stubbornness and passion lead them.The prim music teacher who drips civility and Eastern breeding yet yearns for passion. The outlaw who has played the cards his family and lifestyle have dealt him but aches for tenderness and respectability. A misunderstanding brought them together (Esme thought Billy had murdered her brother in cold blood and then hired Billy to track Bart down once she realized her brother was alive), but there was no misunderstanding their attraction for each other...and me for their journey towards love. I tell you, Billy Darling just about makes up my ideal man. If it wasn't for those dissolute brothers of his that is... He is strong, direct, warm, passionate, and he will do just about anything to keep a woman from crying. I loved their story so much that I actually choked up a bit when it ended, in spite of the expected ""happily ever after"" note. Because by the time I got to the epilogue and read about Esme and Billy's great, great granddaughter, I couldn't help but mirror her wistful musings of what it must have felt to be on the receiving end of Billy's love.My Darling indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RAJUK8GSQR6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553575015#wasThisHelpful","R1RAJUK8GSQR6M","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fancy Pants is a bit dated (surprised they didn't harp on shoulder pads), but that's not what turned me off. After all, I can still read Sheldon's Master of the Game and appreciate plot elements without getting bogged down in the 80's culture. However, what really made this book a wall thrower was that the hero was a downright nasty jerk and the heroine was some sort of ninny ruled by her genitals and zero brains yet mysteriously still ends up a millionaire in some sort of pre-Paris Hilton radio act.Since almost the first minute we're let into Francie's internal thought processes, I became disgusted at her shallow perceptions and her bimbo-like naiveté. And the so-called hero? Ugh! When he wasn't feeling sorry for himself, he was treating others like complete crap. I have no idea how these two formed some sort of emotional attachment to each other. It was hinted at in the book, yet I certainly didn't feel it. She seemed to look at him as a meal ticket and he at her like she was a lost kitten and sex toy rolled into one.But what really infuriated me about the novel was what happened after Dallie finds out about Teddy. The man was a cretin. An utter barbarian who lashed out with anger to his own kid, made him afraid of him, and let known his disgust at the boy's lack of athletic skills. It didn't matter that Teddy had a gifted mind and a compassionate heart (both of which he sneered at and chalked up to being a ""sissy""). No, he was a failure as a son b/c he couldn't throw a football around. I mean, for goodness sake, he actually scoffed at and belittled the kid's food allergies. Oh yes, let me emotionally bully my kid into eating food HE'S ALLERGIC TO so he can possibly DIE but I'll feel better b/c he'll be acting like a real man should. Bah! And after all this...after sensing that something horrible happened to her son at the hands of this man...Francie still manages to lust after Dallie and wind up in his bed within a day or so of getting her son back. Sorry, but if someone kidnapped my child and treated them in such a foul manner, I'd be hard pressed to be civil to them, much less sleep with them or (horror of all horrors) decide to enter a relationship with them and just make my child deal with the fact that this guy will be a part of our lives now. I realize that Dallie has rights with regards to Teddy, and I don't approve of Francie keeping the kid a secret, but the words ""supervised visitation"" should have been the first words on her lips after her son was returned to her. Jeez, the first night she sees Teddy, there's a huge scene with Teddy flailing away at Dallie's leg and screaming that he hates him. Her son is in immense distress and yet she stands there and does nothing. Nothing! And not 30 minutes later she's chattering away at how lovely the paintings are in Dallie's cabin. I swear this woman is unfit!So, to chalk things up: If you like a heroine whose only quality is that she's pretty and has an accent, if you enjoy heroes who wallow in self-pity and bully small children (and slap grieving women)...then Fancy Pants is your dream come true.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2IQHRW47K6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671747150#wasThisHelpful","R2V2IQHRW47K6S","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am surprised at the low number of reviews for this book and hope that more people are inspired to read it, as it is one of my favorites. I simply love Prudence and Sebastian. Two characters who seem to have been made for each other. The story begins pretty much in full action, with Prudence surprising (and foiling) a robbery attempt by Sebastian in his guise as a notorious highwayman...by screaming his true Christian name, which happens to be the name of her beloved kitty cat. Sounds corny, but it works. From then on it's witty banter and clever flirtation as Sebastian falls head over heels for Prudence but has to keep away as he is determined to marry for money and the poor girl has none.I love a heroine who stands on her own feet. Passion is well and nice, but it shouldn't eliminate every single brain cell a person has in their body. The fact that Prudence still retained some of her wits even as Sebastian used all of his substantial charm on her was noteworthy. I especially enjoyed her zingers regarding the origins of his name and the condition of his poor pistol. Add to that a charming cast of characters including Prudence's over-sexed aunt (who takes pride in what she mistakenly thinks is Prudence's fall from grace and then ""rewards her"" with a lecture in the art of everything sexual), a sly fox of a man whose own mother mutters prayers and hides the silverware when he's around, and a charming ball of fur who always seems to be in the right place at the right time.Oh, there are faults to be sure. Our hero has a few un-heroic thoughts now and then (not the good, sensual types either). And there are too many red herrings and unimagined conflicts which exasperate the reader (secret formulas, secret heritages, the occasional fainting trollops, a Robin Hood reference or two, and endless misunderstandings and bungling by both H/h etc...). Plus, Mederios has this grating habit of not keeping facts and continuity in check. I've noticed it in the other reviews where readers have brought up plot elements that were simply dropped or contradictory. I didn't notice huge mistakes really...I just became annoyed that a bit of information hinted at with regards to Arlo and Prudence was never brought to light, especially as it directly involved Sebastian and his opinion of her. Plus, there is the fact it takes one character years to understand a huge ""mystery"" without any additional evidence and nothing to indicate to the reader how he came upon this epiphany.Also, Mederios can be a bit hard on her heroes. I'm not sure if all of them are like this, but I've noticed that in a good deal of her books, the hero gets treated a bit harshly from time to time. Sebastian might put Prudence through the ringer, but he comes out of their encounters a bloody and bruised himself and almost shot a time or two.Despite its flaws, I had to give it five stars. Any novel that I have to read in a single sitting, pausing only to adjust seating position and grab something that I can eat while continuing to eat, is a five star novel in my book. I only wish I could recommend Mederios as a writer. While I loved Heather and Velvet, I've tried and rejected all of the other books in her stable. It seems, so far, that this is the only one that really appealed to me with its careful blend of humor and character appeal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT36K2O1V1SVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553294075#wasThisHelpful","RT36K2O1V1SVR","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved, loved, loved Bewitching, and I felt so sorry for the Earl of Downe. I couldn't wait to read where he would find love and healing for whatever horrible thing was casting a shadow over his life. I pretty much knew he was going to be paired with Leticia Hornsby, and I was fine with that. The few glimpses we caught of her in Bewitching had me curious, and the comic relief brought about by the gentle ribbing Downe received for her antics were endearing. I wish I could say these feelings stayed with me as I read their story.To be blunt: Letty was one of the most annoying heroines I've ever come across. The klutziness I could handle; it was even funny at times, though it did get old after a while. But did Barnett have to make her so stupid? In one scenario, they've just been kidnapped by smugglers and thrown into the hold of a ship...all after Letty startled Downe's horse and pretty much caused him to cosh his head and knock him out cold. Within minutes, she's proclaiming her love, closing her eyes and dancing to invisible music (in the hold of this nasty ship with gun-wielding villains on the other side of the door), and trying desperately to get Downe to close his eyes and daydream too. And he finds this bedlam-like behavior endearing? He must have jostled his brain a bit in the fall. And it gets worse. She shoots him. Shoots him! This after she endangers their lives with her big mouth and small brain...and he brushes it off as yet another hair-brained Letty thing. Bullet holes being like mosquito bites, I suppose...with only a resigned sigh to show that he even acknowledged being shot by her. Ugh! I don't know who I was more disgusted with: idiot man or idiot woman. I finally knew this book was unredeemable when I realized that I was cheering Richard on whenever he was cruel to Letty and getting upset when he rambled on about how guilty it made him feel. Honestly, the dog was probably the most likeable (and intelligent) character in this novel.Throw in one of the most disappointing reveals I've come across (Lindsey's The Pursuit coming in a close second) with regards to what is eating Downe up alive so badly that he's killing himself with self-loathing and alcohol (it's so lame a reason that you'll be shaking your head in disbelief), and the finishing touches are put into place for this train wreck of a story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GAI6RB83X8SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671778684#wasThisHelpful","R2GAI6RB83X8SY","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the Bridgerton family that Julia Quinn has created. They're so full of life and love. Readers had been told in other novels that Francesca was from a different cut of cloth than her brothers and sisters, but I hadn't expected her to be quite so...so bland...and for the love of me, I couldn't figure out why Michael was head over heels in love with her. I'd much rather have explored a possible attachment to Eloise (though I did love reading To Sir Phillip, with Love).The premise of Francesca's widowhood (without taking the easy way out and making her marriage to John loveless) was a bold undertaking, and I think Quinn handled most of that aspect well, in terms of the delicacy of such matters. The only part I found distasteful was Francesca's behavior after her miscarriage and her need to lash out at the one person who loved her and her late husband and had been good friends to both. I suppose it can all be chalked up to the horrible weight of grief, but it seemed like a betrayal all the same. The rest of the book was just a snooze-fest. Francesca doesn't have any personality. Even the other Bridgertons were more sedate in this novel than their usual boisterous selves. It's as if there were a pall thrown on everything and everyone. The novel even hosts its conclusion in the rain at a cemetery. A nice little nod to the overall feel of this book, if I do say so myself, as it was a grave error to have read this little piece of unbuttered toast. Quinn should have just let Francesca's story be untold, paired Michael with another Bridgerton sister, or kept this as a very, very short story in one of those seasonal anthologies.If you fell in love with the fire and passions that were present in the other novels, then I suggest you not open the covers of this one. It would be like dousing those flames with a bucket of lukewarm water. Boring Frannie. Boring (though admittedly very sensual) Michael, forever mooning over this little milksop of a woman. I kept waiting for some little firebrand to come along and really throw some passion his way. If it wasn't for some very fine, verbal foreplay, I'd have given this just a single star.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNWBAYLEVHW64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060531231#wasThisHelpful","RNWBAYLEVHW64","A1RJUXDK64O91A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJUXDK64O91A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is one of the most sexual/sensual/hottest novels JD has put into print. The layout isn't perfect. The ending was a bit rushed...with Amanda displaying a chameleon-like turnabout and Hank making declarations that weren't really explored in the previous chapters. Still, there was plenty of humor, and the steamy interludes were worth a rushed ending or two.Amanda Caulden's father owns a large ranch which employs a number of field laborers. Apparently, there is discontent about the way he treats and pays them. Enter Hank Montgomery, an economics professor that happens to despise civil injustices and is determined to establish a union. Seeking to sway Montgomery to his side, Caulden pushes Amanda towards Hank as both a distraction and to keep tabs on Hank's activites. Amanda's life is tightly controlled by her domineering father and tutor/fiancé, and she resents this disruption of her daily routine. As for Hank, after he practically falls for Amanda at first sight, he sets out to wake up his sleeping beauty and show her the truth about world around her...including what goes on between a man and a woman.I loved Amanda's confusion in this. I loved that she struggled and didn't give in quite as fast as JD's other heroines do. I find that Deveraux's women are ruled a little too heavily by their passions and sometimes find myself flabbergasted that they would so quickly forgive things that would have me slamming doors and spitting nails. Amanda even managed to get a few digs in as she pointed out Hank's hypocrisy in a few places. He's not a perfect hero. At times he's un-chivalrous and as domineering as those he's trying to ""rescue"" Amanda from, and despite his intense physical attraction to Amanda, the reader is often left wondering what he truly feels for her. However, their chemistry is undeniable, and their pig-headedness definitely creates some interesting situations. If it wasn't for that rushed ending, I'd have given this five stars.

"I am a coffee addict. I have to have my morning coffee no matter what. So, that means sometimes I have to take my coffee to go with me. I have been on the look out for a good durable coffee mug.

First off, I like that it is sleek enough to fit in my cup holder in my vehicle so I don't have to worry about it spilling. Also, I really like how well made it is. It does take a little effort to twist off top which is good in case it turns over. I thought at first it may be a problem of burning my hands when picking it up but NOPE!

"This has been a great product for me thus far.  I have been using it for several days now mainly for hydration and moisturizing.  The smell and texture of the product is very nice.  I was amazed to find it to be a very light…almost fluffy cream that isn't oily at all.  After washing my face in the morning, it seems like no matter what face wash I use (moisturizing or not), I always end up with red/dry/flaky areas on my skin.  I hate putting on creams that make my face feel and look oily.  This particular product absorbs fast, goes on light, and honestly really has made a difference for me in just that area alone.  The other promises of stretch mark & scar defense are added bonuses but I was happy for the results it has on my dry areas alone.  I've tried other Aloe products in the past but they have always been infused with other products that seem to create a greasy gloss on my skin.  This one, however, has not done that for me.My wife and I have both been sharing this jar and she has been pretty pleased with it as well.  She too has commented on the moisturizing effectiveness of this product.  She also likes that it doesn't have a strong oder.  For me, the product has done quite well over the past several days with helping me control my dry/flakey skin in the morning without the oily effects of other products that I have tried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UGM0F678M51F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LTNAGO#wasThisHelpful","R1UGM0F678M51F","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love tea and coffee.  The debate continues on the pros and cons of drinking tea and coffee but I was excited to try this product because it is formulated specifically for healthy purposes.  According to the label on the bag, this detox tea has been custom created to ""increase the quality of your sleep, remove the unwanted toxins inside your body, and increase your energy level"".  Well, I think most of us would like something that can do that.  I especially like the idea of ""removing unwanted toxins""!  The product is also caffeine free, which is great because I probably get a little too much of that with my regular tea/coffee intake.The package arrived in great condition and the bag that the tea is contained in is designed, obviously, to keep the freshness in.  It kind of reminds me of those bags that coffee comes in at the store.  Upon opening it, the smell of the tea was very pleasant but the look of the contents reminded me of some of my yard work after using a chipper.  There are several photos provided by other reviewers that show the bag…the contents of the bag, multiple angles of the bag, and the product actually in water.  I think these numerous photos do the product plenty of justice that will allow you to understand what your getting here.  Looking closely at the contents, you can actually see the ingredients of herds, fruits, and berries used to create the mixture.  I like this as opposed to grinding it all up into some sort of fine ""mystery powder"".  At least I can see the actual ingredients being used here.  After seeing the one photo of someone dumping it into a cup loosely, however, I decided that I didn't want to strain the product through my teeth as it floats all around in the cup and opted to go find a tea ball instead.Following the directions, I put one tablespoon in a cup of hot tea and let it seep for a few minutes.  The taste was pleasant and I was pleased with the aroma.  I was worried that this stuff would have some weird taste/smell to it because I've tried other teas in the past and just did not like it at all.  Letting it seep longer and adjusting the amount of water will certainly affect the taste so you can certainly experiment.I've tried the product for a few days now and although I can't immediately say that I feel ""detoxed"", I can say that I have felt a bit more energetic during the day when I've had a cup in the morning.  What I really like about this particular product is it's pleasant taste and aroma.  I also like the fact that I can see the ingredients and that they didn't grind everything up into a fine powder.  Using a tea ball helps reduce the amount of floating material in your cup and the healthy properties of the ingredients do look promising.  Used on a regular bases and with proper diet/exercise, I would recommend trying this product to see if it works for you.I was provided a free sample of this product to try for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VANAVUXD615L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S3S63W#wasThisHelpful","R3VANAVUXD615L","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, the Christmas holiday is fast approaching and my family was recently complaining that my ""music for the season"" was seriously lacking.  To be honest, my holiday music has primarily consisted of the Windham Hill Christmas compilations with mostly instrumental tunes and I think everyone is getting a little tired of those.  So, I decided to go about and start getting some of those holiday classics that my family is asking for.  It's quite challenging actually when you are looking for this type of music because there are so many choices/collections to choose from.  In an effort to find the most wanted songs without having to purchase several different albums, I decided to start with this one first.  I actually had my family write down the Christmas songs that they like the best and luckily this one has all of those and a few extra.  I also decided to pick up a 20th Century Masters Bing Crosby holiday CD as well to really round out the festive music for this year.  Luckily, these albums are offered at a real great price here on Amazon.  Most can be found for $5 or less.  You can see from the product's description that this particular album contains some very familiar tunes and the ability to sample them here, at least for this CD, was great too.  I've noticed that you have to be careful when shopping for holiday music because some of these collections do not contain the original versions or the artist that we are familiar with singing them.  This one sounds great to me and I am excited to begin constructing my new Christmas playlist this year and keep the family happy through the holidays!  It may not contain all of the songs that you may be looking for, but it sure can help to get you started like me!  The recordings sound great and it's offered at a fair price too!  I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JX61P0U4A508/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AOF9SE#wasThisHelpful","R3JX61P0U4A508","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a score that I've been waiting to get a CD copy of since the movie was released.  It jumps around in price and it sat in my wish list until it dropped reasonably enough for me.  The album cover looks different from what they are currently showing on Amazon but I actually like the CD cover better which has the silver Terminator skull (with red eye) against a black background.  Call me crazy in this digital age but I still prefer to purchase my music on CD.This is my third score by Lorne Balfe.  I've previously enjoyed his work on ""Blackwood"" and ""Sons of Liberty"".  Balfe is part Hans Zimmer's score production company known as Remote Control Productions.  It is home to quite a few composers who are mentored by Zimmer and he often collaborates with many on various projects.  After hearing the past few Terminator scores and not really finding them that interesting, I had high hopes that this one by Balfe would finally bring the scores back from the past and into this future.  I am happy to say that this one certainly does just that.  Lorne Balfe successfully pays tribute to Fiedel while also developing his own themes and style to the score.  Fiedel's epic themes can be heard in a few cues like ""Better Days"" (track 2), ""It's Really Me"" (track 12), and most prominently in ""Terminated"" (track 22).  Balfe's interpretation of the theme in the last track is really outstanding and it's something that fans have been waiting for.Balfe has created his own original score but you can hear hints of the classic Terminator sound throughout the music.  The composer achieves this through his use of similar keyboard effects, percussion, strings, and heavy brass instrumentation that he spins & weaves into a sound that becomes distinctively familiar to fans of the iconic music from the early films.  To Balfe's credit, he does not merely give us only a repeat of that which has already been done, but he also develops new themes and electronic ""riffs"" of his own that are quite enjoyable.  I really liked the thematic music in track 11, ""John Conner"" and I also enjoyed the new and unusual electronic sounds found in ""Family"" (track 17).  There are few cues that give Balfe a chance to slow things down a bit like ""Sarah & Kyle"" (track 5) and ""Alcove"" (track 13) but this is largely an action heavy score.  Like Fiedel's previous scores, however, I found this one to be full of interesting effects, sounds, rhythms, and ambience that makes for an entertaining listen.  I like scores that allow you to mentally picture a scene and I would say that this one does just that.  Listening to pieces like ""Sacrifice"" (19) does this quite well.  The big swooping crescendos as one character saves another and the almost angelic sounding strings praising the heroic deed can certainly give you the mental images found within the music.I had to wait a long time to finally get a copy of this but it certainly was worth the wait.  The CD contains 22 tracks and runs around 1 hour and 12 minutes.  There is a 12 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, orchestra credits, and a special thanks section from Balfe, Zimmer, and Paramount Pictures.  There are plenty of photos from the movie as well.  Some are two page spreads, full pages, and several smaller photos.  This a great score from Balfe and I appreciate the nod to Fiedel's music, as well as, the excellent original music too.  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PM6MPMK8GLTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KJX9A0#wasThisHelpful","R3PM6MPMK8GLTO","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the opportunity to look over this bracelet offered by Mondaynoon and I must say that my wife really liked this one.  There are quite a few photos provided by other reviewers and I think they do it justice.  The only thing that the photos don't really capture is the sparkle that the crystal and bracelet itself has.  My wife really liked it and found that the combination of ""rope like"" and metallic band gave the bracelet and very unique appearance.  It looked great on her and will also be very complimentarily on several outfits she has.  My wife is really very picky about jewelry and I don't think she would of ever purchased something like this herself but after trying it on (and playing in front of the mirror with it), she has now found something ""pretty"" that she ordinarily would of never considered.I am more into the craftsmanship of things so I really gave this a close inspection.  The large crystal stone is set into place well and I don't see any crooked or ""higher on one side"" problems.  The surrounding ""diamond like"" crystals that surround the edges of the larger stone are all in place and really give this bracelet it's sparkle when it catches the light.  The ""rope"" portion of the band is secure and snug.  It loops over the hook quite well and I even had my wife try to shake it off to see if it would stay on.  She is the expert on wearing jewelry and after several attempts trying to get it to ""fall off"", she seemed pretty confident that it would stay on.  I'm not saying that it will remain faithfully secure to your wrist under all circumstances however!  The silver portion of the band is polished quite nicely and it too does a great job of catching light.  For the price and quality, I think this is a pretty good deal.  I like the way it catches light and the unique (at least to me) design.  I never thought my wife would of liked this one but she does.I received this as a free product from Mondaynoon for an honest review.  It's actually quite nice and I recommend checking out the many photos posted by other reviewers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8I6IQ05WM0O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQAO0V2#wasThisHelpful","R8I6IQ05WM0O3","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the chance to sample two rings from MNH and this one is definitely my favorite.  The other one sent to me was the silver brushed one with the rose colored inner band and it is very attractive but this one is certainly the most unique.  One of the things that I like the most about this particular ring is the really cool 3D looking black decorative band that circles the outside of the ring.  The photos can't really capture the effect it has but it's really neat.  The design reminds me of looking closely at the threads of a rope.  It looks really nice.  This is my first experience with Tungsten Carbide rings and I was surprised at how solid these were.  They certainly don't feel cheap to me and I like the weight of them.  They are not heavy and do feel comfortable to wear.  It's thicker than my previous band and that will take some getting use to.  I was excited to try these out because my current band has been through a lot of abuse over the years.  It's been bent, scratched, and it's very dinged up!  It has fallen off my finger several times as well because of wear and tear.  When putting this side by side with my previous one...this one looks more much more solid and attractive with it's modern look.  It can never replace the memories of the first band however so I am glad that I've found something that will enable me to ""retire"" the old ring before it gets completely destroyed or lost.I am not one who likes to spend a lot of money on jewelry for myself.  My wife has offered to replace my current ring with other expensive ones but I just wasn't interested in doing that.  I think that this is a very attractive, solid, and reasonably priced ring.  I recommend!MNH offered to send this as a free product for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JT2MWVUUNPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BH24YK#wasThisHelpful","R12JT2MWVUUNPN","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice ring.  The first thing I noticed was the weight of it.  It feels pretty solid but not too heavy.  My wedding ring is bent up, scratched up, and doesn't look so great when you compare it next to this.  Now, I'm not one that goes out seeking expensive jewelry for myself and I'd much rather spend the money on other things.  My wife offered to buy me a more pricey ring to replace my current one but I was never really interested in spending that kind of money on one.  I much rather spend the money on the ""upgrades"" that she wants.  Something like this looks really nice, feels really solid, and looks like it can take a beating with the work that I do.  I really like the ""rose"" color on the inside too.  The ring arrived just like the one pictured and I think the photos provided by the other reviewers do it justice.  They've pretty much captured every angle and close up to give you a good look at it.I was pretty impressed by this ring and I think if your looking for something to replace (or retire) you current ring without breaking the bank...then this sure is an attractive and affordable alternative.

"MarlJohns offered the opportunity to sample one of their products and this 22oz shaker bottle is actually pretty good.  For the price, your getting a bottle that has quite a few uses to it.  Use it as a standard water/juice bottle, shaker for protein, and it includes two detachable storage attachments for either protein, snacks, and vitamins.  The two detachable storage attachments come in two different sizes that provides multiple uses to fit your needs.  They are attached by twisting them onto the bottom of the bottle.  You can easily attach one to the bottle and still take the other with you in your gym bag because they provide you with a lid that is interchangeable between the two.The bottle itself is plenty tough because I accidentally ""tested"" it by dropping it on the garage floor.  It didn't break/crack so I was glad to see that.  The bottle looks solid black but if you hold it up to the light, it is actually transparent enough so you can see the liquid inside.  One side of the bottle has a measurement gauge on it and having it to be semi-transparent is helpful when putting your mix in.  I also gave it the shake test and tested for leaks.  Everything worked perfectly and I detected no leaks from the cap or lid.  The orange mouth lid gave me some concerns at first because when I went to shut it, it seemed to pop off too easy.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that this was my fault because I wasn't actually snapping it all the way down.  When you go to shut this particular lid (the orange mouthpiece lid), make sure you push down on it until it snaps shut.  I also recommend not trying to twist the bottle lid too tight.  The bottle and threads are all plastic and doing this could wear down the actual threads themselves.  Twist it tight...but don't go crazy on it!  I also like the fact that the mouth of the bottle is a large size which helps when your drinking your own concoctions of mixed health drinks.  The shaker ball does a good job of mixing the powder up but understand that this isn't an electric blender here.For the price, build, quality, and features of this particular bottle...I would honestly say that this a pretty good deal.  The bottle has multiple uses and the added storage attachments give it even more added benefits.  I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L1EAWMEV1BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OT7J6U#wasThisHelpful","R28L1EAWMEV1BC","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered the opportunity to take a look at one of Mondaynoon's products and my wife choose this particular set.  She really liked the design and color of these items (necklace, earrings, and bracelet).  I also like that Mondaynoon offers this as a set and for the quality/build of the pieces, I think that it is fairly reasonably priced.  They arrived in a black velvet bag with each piece individually wrapped.  The necklace even had an extra piece of plastic wrapping to protect the stone.  All of the pieces were in excellent condition and after inspecting each one very carefully, I am satisfied with the look, feel, and quality for the asking price.  I looked for kinks in the chains, imperfections in the stones, sturdiness of the clasp, and other dents/dings etc.  I couldn't find anything wrong with these.  My wife is pretty picky about jewelry and refuses to wear anything she considers cheap looking.  When this arrived, I basically handed her the package and watched for her reactions.  She was pretty pleased with these...so that is saying a lot!One key feature that my wife and I love about these particular pieces is how the crystals really catch and sparkle in the light.  She loves the gold stone color (which to me, looks like a very light greenish gold color) and wearing this as a set really compliments a particular outfit of hers.  Having three individual pieces to mix and match with other pieces of jewelry of hers is a definite plus too.  She really likes the set and for the price, look, and quality of these, I'd say that they are a pretty good deal.I received this product free or at a discount for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296L7YVDTBGYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGI0AXQ#wasThisHelpful","R296L7YVDTBGYE","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently offered the opportunity to choose a dress from the Azbro collection sold here on Amazon at a discount for a review.  Out of the list of choices, my wife selected this particular one because of it's uniqueness.  The sleeves and style of the dress are very unusual and eye catching.  It kind of reminds me of something you might see a movie star walking the red carpet with.  The dress arrived in great condition and was packaged well.  It's made out of 100% polyester...so don't go expecting silk here.  The seams and stitching are all nicely done.  We felt like the material and build of the dress was nicely done for the asking price and we really liked that this particular outfit came with a necklace to really give it a very dramatic effect.  The necklace is metallic and really makes the dress stand out for sure.  Wearing something like this will certainly catch people's attention because it is so different.  I personally think my wife looks great in it.  We ordered a small size and my wife is 5'1"" and weights 110.  It fit her perfectly.  It wasn't too small, short, or tight.  It has a classic and modern look to it but will probably only work for very special events.

"What kind of score do you give a character who is stuck on Mars...alone, and little chance of survival?  This one.  I read that some say that it rips off Zimmer's ""Interstellar"" score while others complain about it sounding typically ""spacey"".  Well, the film does take place on a distant world and I certainly wouldn't want it to sound like a Saturday morning cartoon.  That's kind of like saying that a western score sounds typically ""western"".  Granted, there are those avant garde scores out there that might take a period piece with vikings battling it out to heavy metal guitars and techno beats, but generally soundtracks tend to musically capture the atmosphere in which they are set.  I personally think that this one by Harry Gregson-Williams is spot on with this particular survival story set on the planet Mars.I haven't seen the movie yet, and to be honest with you, I rarely see the movies before I hear the score.  This is not by choice, because I would love to rush out and see these films first, but it just happens that I usually end up getting the scores for films before I actually see them.  I have found that this has sometimes given me a unique perspective of the story before I actually go to see the visuals on the screen however.  I've seen the movie trailers and I have a pretty good idea about the storyline, but if the score is good...it can tell the story just as well.  This score does just that.  It certainly isn't an action score and you won't find music that has a heroic character fighting off hordes of green little men.  The music is more reflective and lonely.  It's also has a beauty hidden underneath that occasionally appears in tracks like ""Crossing Mars"" (track 11).  This particular piece has a slight hint of a futuristic pioneer crossing a vast empty desert.  A keyboard producing a echoey guitar like sound starts the piece backed with electronic wind like ambience.  A french horn begins to build the orchestra gradually into a mighty landscape sound as I imagine the camera pulls back to show the grand scope of the red planet.  This is what I like.  Music that produces visual images and tell a story on their own.  The entire score is pretty reflective of what the character must be going through.  It's very easy to listen to and I've had it on repeat all day at work.  It isn't bombastic and mostly very soothing.  It's great thinking music for sure!I suppose what gives it a ""spacey"" sound is the composer's use of electronically produced music.  He uses some very old 80's sounds in a few of the cues.  Some of the sounds reminded me of early Patrick O'Hearn music (who's music I also love) and Jack Wall's ""Mass Effect"" score.  Tracks 3 and 5 really have that ""Mass Effect"" vibe to them.  I really liked track 7, ""Sprouting Potatoes"", with it's combination of cello, strings, and really fluid electronic sounds.  ""Hexadecimals"", track 10, has a classic early keyboard/syth sound to it.  I think the composer's choice to bring some of these sounds back is what might have people comparing this score so much with ""Interstellar"".  Zimmer's score used an even older keyboard, the organ, and gave us a very entertaining and interesting ""space"" epic that is truly fascinating to listen to.  That score, in my opinion, was very sharp, intense, and dynamic.  I know it had some ""floaty"" space music too, but the organ definitely had the spotlight and really gave the sense of the grandness, immensity, and mystery of space.  Harry Gregson-Williams uses electronic sounds with a more softer and subtle approach to capture a story of one man's attempt to survive on a distant planet.  At times, the score has such a lonely and sad sound...almost as if someone wants to give up. Tracks like ""Crops are Dead"" (track 13) have choral voices lamenting a requiem like depression.  It would be an awful movie if we just watched the main character give up however, and track 14, ""Work the Problem"" has a more upbeat tech thump to it as the protagonist works to push through the obstacles and survive.  I think this is a fine score by Harry Gregson-Williams and it does a great job of telling the story through music.  It has a ""space"" sound to it and I don't think it's fair to say that it rips off Hans Zimmer.  This score is very easy to listen to and is most certainly enjoyable outside of the film itself.This particular ""Amazon Exclusive"" release is really nice because you are getting two discs for a really good price.  The first disc contains the songs from the film, which can be bought by itself if your not interested in the score, and the second disc appears to be the only place to get the musical score on CD.  I prefer to own my music on CD and transfer it digitally myself.  I see all the complaints from those who bought the digital versions and complain about the sound quality.  Well...not an issue here.  Nothing beats a good ole fashion CD in my opinion!  These ""Deluxe Edition"" soundtracks must have been made popular by the success of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" release.  The songs on disc one are pretty good and have some classic tunes from Vickie Sue Robinson (Turn the Beat Around) to Gloria Gaynor (I Will Survive).  Disc one does contain ""The Martian Score Suite"" which captures some of the highlights from the entire score itself.  There is an 8 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, a few landscape shots of Mars, and a back cover photo of Matt Damon in a scene from the the movie.  There are two pages dedicated to ""notes from the composer"" where Harry Gregson-Williams explains his inspiration for the music of the film was largely based on the poem ""On the Nature of Things"" by Lucretius.  The composer takes select tracks from the score and supports them with lines from the poem and in a sense uses these words for the foundation of his music.  I guess where I listen to the music and see the story, the composer is reading the words of this poem...and hears the music. I've found this to be really enjoyable soundtrack and nicely priced for a CD version that contains 2 discs of music from the film.  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PVG8MUZYYG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01604Z00O#wasThisHelpful","R23PVG8MUZYYG3","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guys get pimples too you know.  Now personally, the case that these tools come in doesn't really work for me but thats alright.  It's what on the inside that counts!  The pictures that the other reviewers have posted do the product justice.  You're getting some pretty well made instruments here that are designed to help you clean/clear out one of life's annoyances...blackheads and pimples.  I will tell you that these are not not little magic wands that you can wave over your face and look as perfect as the girl on the box however.  If, like me, you've never used something like this before...do your research first!  The whole point of these things is to safely clear out your pores without scaring or scratching your skin.  We've all done it before right?  Squeeze a pimple/blackhead so hard that your fingernails dig into your skin and cause a scar?  Well, these tools are designed to help prevent that from happening.Even before this kit arrived, I began looking into how they are actually used.  There are several videos and websites with illustrations that can show you precisely what to do.  The improper use of these things can do just as much or even more scaring to your skin if your not careful.  After studying up on these instruments and learning how to use them properly, I was ""lucky"" enough to have a pimple on my shoulder to test my new found knowledge out on.  Using one of the tools to to encircle the pimple with, I gently rocked it back and forth and presto...cleaned it right out.  You should also note that cleaning your skin before and after can really help with this process as well.  As with any tool, I recommend cleaning them after each use too.The tools themselves seem to be well made.  The box claims that they are 100% hygienic, rust-free, corrosion and stain resistant.  They seem to pretty decent to me.  The case holds them all fairly well but I think I'll just keep them in my shaving kit.  My only concern with this kit is the lack of information about the individual tools themselves and what they are specifically used for.  A small insert that contains information/descriptions of these or maybe links to specific websites that could educate those who are using a product like this for the first time would be beneficial.

"Ever wonder how many steps you take during one day?  After those long days at work, my wife and I have gone into those long debates on ""who's job is harder"" and the ever so popular ""I bet I am on my feet longer than you"".  When presented with the opportunity to try out this particular product, I couldn't help but to think that this little device would finally settle the argument!The SMARTFLY arrived well packaged and included a belt clip, lanyard, instructions, and an extra battery.  The extra battery was a nice little bonus that I wasn't expecting to find in the package.  It's one of those CR2032 batteries, which are easy enough to find in the big box stores, but it was still nice that an extra one was included.  The device itself is very lightweight and when you slide it into the belt clip, you can't even tell your wearing it.  I also liked that it tells the time as well.  I one of those last few people on Earth who actually wear a wrist watch and I don't have my phone permanently attached to my body.  My watch died, so over the past few days, this thing has been my source for time.  Setting the device up, however, left some questions.  Following the instructions, I correctly set the time, weight, and target steps.  I was also able to set the device so that it reads in inches and the stride calculations.  There are two screens, however, that I cannot for the life of me figure out what they are for and/or what they are requesting me to input.  The instructions are not very ""step by step"" clear in this regard.  I searched on line for additional setup instructions and I found a very similar device, Ozeri 4x3 sport, but finding the instructions for that model (which looks exactly like this one) proved to be and endless quest as well.  Oh well, I seem to have the time, weight, preferred measurement reading, and stride set in so now it's time to see if this thing will correctly measure my steps.Walking around the house, I would go for about 30 steps and check to see how well the device was doing.  It was accurate within 1 to 2 steps.  I did this several times with various amounts of steps and it remained consistent throughout the test.  I reset everything and put it on for work the next day.  Throughout the day at work, I would randomly check the device, take 10-30 steps and check for accuracy again.  I would say that I was pretty pleased with how it functioned.  Using the ""mode"" button, I was also able to see the estimated calories burned and the progress to my goal (which I set to 10,000 steps).  I ended up that day with nearly 8000 steps (6am-10:30pm).The device will automatically shut itself off after a few minutes of inactivity and will resume again once movement is detected.  It basically begins to pick up right where it left off.  I also noticed that it doesn't always actively count each step as you are watching the screen.  For example, you might take 10 steps and you won't see it count each step on the screen, but when you stop...it will register 10 steps.  It does seem reasonably accurate, and for this I was pretty pleased with it's performance.  The cost of the device seems to be pretty reasonable compared to others like it and it certainly is interesting in knowing how many steps you take for certain activities.  I'll be interested in knowing the steps taken in future hiking excursions when we go camping.  I haven't given it to my wife to try out yet...I'm almost scared to.  What if she wins?  Then we wouldn't have any complain/compare talks when we get home!The device seems reasonably priced and works well for my purposes.  It also appears to be relatively accurate within 1 to 2 steps and I appreciate the belt clip, lanyard, and extra battery.  I was able to setup the basic functions that I needed to get it working but the instructions are not step by step clear, in my opinion, and need to be clarified.  Some of you who have had experience with these devices might not view this as a problem and might be able to figure it out better than I could however.  I'm sure they make some more expensive and fancy ones out there...but this one seems alright by me.I received this product at a discount or as a free sample to test for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTCFM8111V0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHEPY6I#wasThisHelpful","RRTCFM8111V0A","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone I know, who owns an iPhone, has some sort of tempered glass screen protector.  Like you, I've seen many phones dropped and the glass is completely shattered upon impact (iPhones 4-5).  Supposedly the newer iPhone models (iPhone 6) has a better designed screen to help prevent this?  I'm not sure, but I certainly don't want to take any chances or assume anything.Upon inspecting this particular screen protector, I'd have to say that it was packaged well and arrived without any issues.  It comes in a hard cardboard sleeve and the screen protector itself is wrapped in an additional foam sleeve.  It also comes with a package containing wet and dry wipes to clean and prep the screen.  Also, there are three ""Guide Stickers"" (not sure what those are for) and another sticker that has ""Dust-absorber""  written on it (which states that you use that to clear dust from the screen).  This one has an illustration that demonstrates how to use it.  The screen has a protective film on it that is easily removed by pulling a small tab and it is clearly labeled as the back of the screen protector.The cardboard sleeve that the product arrived in has a series of four pictures that show how to attach the screen protector to your phone.  The process was pretty easy.  The package states that the device has a 9H strength rating, Oleophobic coated, drop protection, fingerprint proof, and blade proof.  It isn't fingerprint proof because I can clearly see my fingerprints on it...but they are easy to wipe off.  I would call it more of a fingerprint resistant application here.  The screen itself is pretty flexible, not fragile, and has a sense of strength to it.  It certainly will provide a first line of defense against a drop on a hard surface.I would say that this is a pretty affordable way to protect your screen on an expensive phone.  It's easy to go on and was packaged well.  I appreciate that it has cleaning materials in the package but I would suggest offering some written instructions for those who may have never used one of these before.  It isn't fingerprint proof but does offer some resistance to excessive prints all over the screen.  I would say that personally, I'd feel confident that this would provide some protection against scratches and hopefully some harsher falls.I received the product free or at a discounted rate for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJFZJ8X5ORI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Y1VJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1VJFZJ8X5ORI8","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a whole lot of iPhone accessories out there and you definitely need to think about what it is that you specifically need that will suit your needs.  Some choose what I call ""battle tank cases"", which are large and bulky.  Many of these offer water protection and major falls.  They are very expensive, obviously, but they also have big drawbacks.  Ever try to plug in an additional accessory only to have the ""battle tank's"" shielding prevent you from doing this?  How about removing this thing from your pocket and having to dang near rip your jeans apart to remove it?  It offers great protection, at a cost, and works well for some people.  There are, of course, plenty of other variations of cases that offer protection and the cheaper they are...the less protection you get.This particular case isn't going to protect your phone from a great fall, nor will it prevent water from seeping into your phone.  It doesn't claim this however, but I do believe that it would protect the phone from a shorter ""shock"" fall.  It's made out of a rubbery material that has the most protective material around the edges.  This also helps to keep the phone snug inside of the case and I can say that it certainly does this.  It fits quite well and when removing it and inserting it into my pants pocket, it didn't slip off or crunch up.  I asked a few buddies of mine at work to take out their phones so we could compare cases.  One guy had a ""battle tank"" and most of the others had something similar to this one except theirs had thicker rubber side walls that made their phones fatter.  When I showed them this one and asked for their opinions they gave me their pros and cons:Pros:1.  Thinner:  Easier to take in and out of pockets.2.  Case makes phone feel secure in hands...won't easily slip out of hands.3.  Liked the transparent look of this particular one.  (Funny how most want a particular phone color only to hide it in their cases)4.  Confident that the case will keep the phone (back) from getting scratched up.5.  Is easy to remove.6.  Buttons and ports are easily accessible.Cons:1.  Concerned about a harsher fall in the parking lot or on other hard surfaces.To be honest...they are concerned about that with their own phone cases too.  None of us really could afford going out in the parking lot and putting all of these to the ultimate test however.  I think when pairing this with a tempered glass screen protector, however, you'd be in a lot better shape.  This case only covers the back and sides of the phone...so getting a protective layer on the front glass is a definite must.I think for the price, your getting a case that will definitely protect from scratches, help reduce the shock of a fall, and gives you the convenience of a thinner, less bulky, phone.  They come in multiple colors, but I like that this particular one is transparent so you can actually see the phone.  I think that when coupled with a screen protector, this can give you a low cost piece of mind.  I would not recommend for those of you who are clumsy and maybe have dropped (destroyed) a phone or two in the past.  You might want to seek out a ""battle tank"" option.I received this product at a discount or free to sample for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKHETQMX334/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015C9DRN0#wasThisHelpful","R3RKHETQMX334","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Rambo collection is finally complete!  There are just some soundtracks that I find myself playing more than others and music from the Rambo movies is certainly one of those.  Jerry Goldsmith created so many memorable themes in his career and the ones found in the Rambo soundtracks have always been some of my favorites.  Unfortunately, the only copy I had of the Rambo movie soundtracks was ""First Blood"" produced by Varese Sarabande in 2000.  It contains only a fraction of the complete score and although I played the heck out of it, I always felt like I was missing so much great music.  I ended up finally getting ""First Blood"" and ""Rambo III"" produced by Intrada Records and ""First Blood Pt. II"" and ""Rambo"" (Brian Tyler) produced by Silva Screen Records.  These seem to be the best made copies of these scores that are available now.This particular score is probably my favorite of the four.  It is during this time in Goldsmith's career that he is tinkering with electronic syth sounds in his scores and he does such a masterful job of blending this ""new sound"" with a large orchestra.  His marriage of this new technology to the classic sound of the orchestra truly gave Rambo an iconic sound that fits the character and the age in which these films were created.  Goldsmith's themes developed for these films were so great that I think that even playing them on a banjo would of been just fine however!  This Silva Screen Records release is an expanded edition of the original soundtrack which contains previously unreleased tracks like ""The Map"" (track 2), ""The Pirates"" (track 6), ""The Camp/Forced Entry"" (track 8), ""River Crash/The Gunboat"" (track 10), ""Bring Him Up/The Eyes"" (track 12), and ""Village Raid/Helicopter Flight"" (track 18).Silva Screen Records has also included an 8 page insert that basically takes each track and describes the scene in which it was created for.  There are a few photos from the film and a brief description of their attempt to squeeze the best possible sound out of the original source tapes in which this was taken.  They say that despite being recorded in 1985, some tape hiss and distortion occurs.  They also go on to say that some of the tapes had to go through a ""slow oven bake"" process to restore the tape.  That sounds really weird and I have no idea what that means but I am just thankful that they took the time to produce a really great sound and rescue these scores from total destruction.  It would be awful to lose wonderful music like this!This particular release was manufactured in 1999 and still seems to be pretty easy to find for now.  There are 21 tracks on the disc with a little over an hour running time.  The last track the vocal track ""Peace in our Life"" sung by Frank Stallone.  If you are looking to build or add on to your Rambo soundtrack collection, then I highly recommend adding this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Q1NR9IS1MML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IWMO#wasThisHelpful","R34Q1NR9IS1MML","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I am always a little skeptical over the claims that makers of vitamins put on their labels.  Nonetheless, I still take a multi-vitamin everyday in an attempt to be proactive about supplementing my diet with some ""good stuff"" for the body.  I've read in places where ""experts"" say that most of us are throwing are money away on many of these products while others claim otherwise.  My wife and mother-in-law are vitamin and heath food gurus who know a lot about this kind of thing and when this arrived my wife quickly inspected the label and began describing the benefits of the various ingredients contained within these tablets.  She seemed to be pretty excited about it and these certainly contain things that my typical vitamins do not.  This particular supplement is more focused on assisting in the development of healthy skin, hair, and nails.  It does contain some of the more familiar things like vitamin C, and E.  Upon inspecting the label, the product is made in the USA and claims to be composed of natural ingredients.  The product does contain Soy however, so please take note of that if you have particular allergies. The packaging was good and the bottle cap was sealed with a plastic wrap like what you find in the store.  There was also that typical cardboard paper cover sealing the top opening of the bottle.  Cotton balls were also inside the bottle.  I did not find the smell of the tablets to be that unpleasant.  I took two of these with my meal and did not notice any bad aftertaste.  There are 60 tablets within this bottle and the directions say to take two of these a day with a meal.The bottle that I received was manufactured on 7/2015 and has an expiration date of 7/2017. The company that makes these has a website that you can visit and they have a YouTube channel with several videos about the products they make.  It appears that many have had some pretty good success with these so I am excited to see if I notice any differences/benefits over the course of time.  Only time will tell of course.  My impressions of this product are good.  My wife says that they've put some good stuff in these tablets and likes the fact that this particular product is geared towards skin, hair, and nails.  I didn't mind the taste or smell of the tablets and I liked the information that I was able to find out about this company through their website and videos.  I like the fact that this item is manufactured in the USA and I feel good about supporting hardworking companies that want to make quality products.

"Picked this up for a costume piece and I am pretty pleased with it.  Searching for one on Amazon can be quite the daunting task because there are so many manufactures, styles, prices, and quality.  I didn't need one for paintball but I wanted it to look fairly authentic, good quality, and at a decent price.  Thankfully, reading the reviews on Amazon eventually brought about the decision to go with this particular one.  It comes exactly as pictured and the other reviewers pictures helped in determining if this was going to work or not as well.  It's made out of a pretty hard thick plastic and I can see why those who participate in paintball activities would like this.  Up close, you can tell that it isn't metal or ballistic grade material, but further away...it looks like the real deal.  Some sort of steel/metal rivets hold the chin strap and head mesh in place.  The straps themselves seem to be the weakest piece of the helmet.  They definitely are not the thickest quality straps out there but I think they will perform well for what I need them for.  The adjustment buckles are made out plastic and this doesn't look too robust either.  Make sure to set the straps correctly so you don't have to keep making adjustments and don't go ripping this off your head in a fit of rage when someone gets the best of you in the game!The helmet is quite comfortable to wear and is light on your head.  It looks great and at the time that I purchased it, the price was $15.  It's going to work great for me as a costume piece, but I think with the proper care, this would be excellent in keeping those paintballs from giving you a headache.  The pictures from the other reviewers and the one in the product window are very accurate.  The high review feedback was also a plus in helping me choose which helmet to go with.

"This is a great collectable CD offered by BSX Records.  I also picked up James Horner's ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" released through their label and both CDs come with plenty of bonuses, nice liner notes, and quality sound recording.  This particular release showcases Horner's music while working with Roger's Corman's studios.  This happens to be Horner's first full science fiction/horror score and it was during this time, early in his career, that his music shows a tremendous amount of influence from the the greats like Laurence Rosenthal, John Williams, and especially Jerry Goldsmith.  It's no secret that Horner was often criticized for ""ripping"" off other composers, and sometimes himself (using his material in other films), and he admitted only to a strong influence from these artist.  The extensive liner notes provided in this release, as well as, ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" touches briefly on this subject.  You can definitely hear similarities to Rosenthal's ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" and Goldsmith's ""Alien"" score here in cues like ""Main Title"" (track 1).There is plenty of originality here to be found in the score as well.  Horner's score gives the Roger Corman movie a big budget sound that is very entertaining to listen to on it's own.  It has that 80's science fiction/horror vibe to it and it's very interesting to see the young composer ""get his feet wet"" with the development of this particular piece.  The score is very ominous, creepy, and atmospheric.  The mood of it really gives you the visualization that monsters are coming for you out of the ocean.  I highly recommend this for fans wanting to hear some of Horner's earliest work because you can really hear the development of a fine composer here.There is some cool bonus material added to the disc. Selections from Christopher Lennertz's score of the 1996 remake are included here as well.  I never knew they even made a remake of this film.  Lennertz's score follows Horner's closely and you wouldn't even know it was from a different composer.  The bonus material blends right in with the original quite nicely.  The last track (19), contains nearly 10 minutes of outtakes ""extracted from the out-of-print Image Entertainment Laser Disc isolated score"" (quote from liner notes).  With great artwork, liner notes, photos, and bonus materials...this becomes a nice little package for Horner fans and those who like to own collectable soundtrack CDs.  I recommend their release of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" which can also be found here on Amazon.  Both releases are limited to 1000 copies and they have been out since 2011 so copies might be getting smaller and may be soon hard to find.  ""Humanoids From the Deep"" contains 19 tracks and runs about 57 minutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLDZ4UAMTQIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066SWSH8#wasThisHelpful","R2DLDZ4UAMTQIB","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most recent Danny Elfman scores that I've picked up are from ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and his collaboration with Brian Tyler in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".  I was glad to see that he was selected to score the ""Goosebumps"" movie because this is the type of film music that Elfman tends to do very well.  His work with Tim Burton, as well as, a host of other similar film projects has certainly allowed him to establish himself as the premier composer for this genre.  Fortunately, Elfman has been able to prove himself as quite the capable composer in other genres as well.  His portfolio is quite extensive with action, animated, romance, comedies, and thrillers.  My personal favorites are the Batman scores and his unforgettable music for Edward Scissorhands.When listening to ""Goosebumps"", Elfman fans can quickly identify the familiar sound the composer incorporates into his scores.  Elfman uses musical tools like bells, chimes, choral voices, ""march like"" percussion and the bass clarinet like a master.  His use of these become a musical fingerprint for the composer and for those who have been listening to his music over the years will recognize his distinctive tone.  Another thing that I've always liked about Elfman is his ability to develop a great theme and not being scared to use it throughout the movie.  The score opens with ""Goosebumps"" (track 1) and it is here that we first hear the Elfman theme.  It isn't the TV show theme...so don't go expecting that one.  This theme really establishes the mood of the score which I would sum up as being spooky, fun, comic, and adventurous.  One very unique instrument that Elfman incorporates into this theme is one that is usually associated with early science fiction movies.  The Theremin, with it's high pitched tones, adds a really cool ""spooky"" sound to the theme and Elfman uses it in various moments throughout the score.  You'll find the main theme decorating the music all along the way and this makes some of the more action oriented pieces a lot more interesting to listen to on their own away from the film.I haven't seen the movie yet, but it must hit the ground running because there is a lot of action music here.  These particular sequences are like musical roller coasters with plenty of big drops, fast turns, and barrel rolls all along the way.  All of the ""stuff"" that Elfman throws into these pieces is what makes them fun to listen to.  There are also so great slower moments in the score as well like ""Camcorder"", ""Confession"", ""Ghost Hannah"", and ""Hannah's Back"".  These are nice little emotional bits that Elfman treats nicely with strings, piano, and woodwinds.  The movie must not have a lot of time for it however because they are quick.Tracks 18-29 are labeled as bonus material and I found these to be some of the most interesting pieces on the album.  A few of these pieces sound more character oriented, lighter, and slightly comic.  Others are more action/escape music like ""Werewolf"" and ""Fun House"" that do a pretty good job of giving you the mental visuals as to what is happening to the characters dealing with these obstacles along the way.The CD contains 29 tracks and runs 1 hour and 5 minutes.  It is released through Sony Classical and contains an 8 page insert that has photos, orchestra credits, production credits, and track listings.  I really like the cover art on this one too.""Goosebumps"" certainly has the Elfman sound to it and fans who have been enjoying his work over the years will appreciate this.  He's developed a great theme for the score and he cleverly uses it, as well as, other unique instrumentation to keep things interesting.  While maybe not as emotionally thematic as a ""Edward Scissorhands"" or sing song like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", this is a score that fits this type of film well and is enjoyable to listen to on it's own.  I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0QJLATS8BMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126DJ14O#wasThisHelpful","R3L0QJLATS8BMI","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all let me say that like many of you, I grew up watching the Charlie Brown cartoons and looked forward to them every Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  I also developed a strong connection with the Peanuts characters and the music of The Vince Guaraldi Trio.  You can't help but to think of the Peanut characters without it.  Can you imagine the enormous pressure Christophe Beck is feeling right now?  Believe me, if there ever is a composer who takes over the scoring for Star Wars...they are going to feel the same thing.  OK...they are probably going to be even more stressed, but this Peanuts score is a pretty big deal too.  I think the producers of this movie/score know this too and thats why we are finding at least 3 of the original tunes inserted here.Now, when I heard they were making this movie and that Beck was going to compose the music, I was extremely curious if he was just going to imitate the ""Trio"" sound or was he going to go into an extremely different direction altogether.  The best that I can describe this score is that Beck has orchestrated a score that fits this particular style of film but there is also plenty of homage to The Vince Guaraldi Trio throughout.  I personally think that animated film music has got to be some of the most difficult to construct for a movie.  It is utterly critical to get it right because it has to reach in and touch the imaginations of both adults and kids.  When it matters, Beck finds ways to connect the classic sound from the TV movies to this score.  You hear the wonderful use of the piano in cues like ""Charlie Brown in Love"" and ""The Library"" (tracks 8 & 10).  We also hear Beck's arrangements of the classic tunes like ""Linus and Lucy"", ""Skating"", and ""Christmas Time is Here/Christmas is Coming"".  In these cues, there is enough Vince in it to keep it cool with a twist of Beck to make it fresh.  ""Carnival Panic/Linus and Lucy"" (track 15) has a more upbeat drum beat (and an organ) while ""Skating"" (18) is done with Xylophones, jazz bass, and drums.  Beck handles the sacred Guaraldi music with care and his interpretation isn't blasphemous...it becomes a celebration of the great musician.Beck also has some wonderful original music here as well.  Please...please listen to ""Pen Pal Partners"" (track 16), ""Good OL' Charlie Brown"" (track 17), and especially ""Linus and Lucy"" (track 20).  Oh...that last track...my goodness...that one alone is worth the CD.  Makes me think more of Charlie Brown than Linus and Lucy however.  It's just absolutely beautiful.I think that a score acts like a music soul for a movie and we as fans have associated this inner energy to characters and stories that we hold dear.  The Vince Guaraldi Trio's music definitely connected us with these glorious hand drawn cartoons of yesteryear.  Beck's music brings a new energy to the Peanuts story but never disregards the foundation that The Vince Guaraldi Trio established.  For me personally, the original music will never grow old and never fade away.  That music fit the TV movies perfectly, but I don't think it would transition completely well with the style and presentation of this particular theatrical release.  I think if Beck would have attempted to regenerate and imitate the sound of the original TV movies, fans would of still been upset.  I'd much rather leave that sound connection with those shows and appreciate Beck's approach with this new 2015 computer animated Peanuts movie.  The score contains some ""action"" music to fit the scenes where it needs it and these action cues is what is throwing everybody into a rage I think.  I've seen the trailers for the movie and this film differs a lot from the old TV shows in this regard. I'm not quite sure if Charlie Brown is as popular in this day of Sponge Bob and Frozen...but this movie looks to reintroduce him to our children.  But as I said before, when it matters...when the familiar ""emotions"" of the characters and ""philosophical"" moments spring up...Beck pays a lot of tribute to Vince.  This is what would of put me in ""outrage mode"" for sure.  I knew when looking at these movie trailers that we weren't going to get another Vince Guaraldi Trio album...but if I at least couldn't hear a connection to it somehow, then I would of been upset.  Take ""The Assembly"" (track 11) for example.  Yeah...your not going to hear much at the beginning except what some might call ""typical animated action music"", especially if your only listening to samples of the score.  But give it a minute...wait for the part where, I assume Charlie Brown sees the little red haired girl? The music takes a slow jazzy turn and it's got a Vince vibe all over it.  It's short and sweet, but that just makes it ever so more powerful when you do catch a glimpse of it.  This is what I can appreciate about this score.  Charlie Brown is a pretty emotional little guy but the great thing is that he handles it so well!  Beck has captured these moments in the music brilliantly.  I strongly suggest checking out this score even if just for those particular pieces because they are just beautiful.The movie looks to be a great one and I am excited to take my young son to go and see it.  I introduced him to the older TV specials and have successfully passed down the tradition.  He likes Snoopy the best, of course.The CD version of this score has 20 tracks and runs for a total of 48 minutes.  There is a 12 page insert that has plenty of photos from the film, song listings, production team credits and the lyrics to Meghan Trainor's ""Better When I'm Dancin"".  The score also contains ""Thats what I Like"" by Flo Rida featuring Fite.  There is also a brief director's note from Steve Martino.  Interestingly enough he states, ""Our challenge, to create a film that shows reverence for this history but does not just repeat what has come before"".  I haven't seen the movie yet...but as for the score, I believe that Christophe Beck has done just this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJ6OYVYO8WKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E7352I#wasThisHelpful","R2MJ6OYVYO8WKN","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised to see that another Hitman movie was released.  I had seen the first one that came out a while back and thought that it was pretty decent and entertaining but wasn't aware that they were attempting to reintroduce Agent 47 to film again.  I haven't seen this newer version yet but it should be interesting to see how it compares to the earlier one.  I played the first two Hitman games years ago and found the game and score to be great.  I purchased the La-La Land Records 2 disc release of the scores for the first two games back in 2005 and really enjoyed those composed by Jesper Kyd.  The one thing I really liked about those is that every track represented the different locales that Agent 47 was currently engaging his target in.  Agent 47 seemed to be everywhere in those two games and the music by Jesper Kyd complimented each of these missions.  I've never acquired the score for the first film that was released in 2007 composed by Geoff Zanelli but looking at the reviews for it on Amazon, it appears that fans liked it.  What interested me the most about this particular release is the fact that Marco Beltrami was putting the score together for this one.  I've enjoyed a lot of his past work and was eager to hear his musical interpretation for this film and it's familiar character to gamers everywhere.Beltrami has dabbled in just about everything.  From action movies like ""Die Hard"", horror films like ""The Woman in Black"" to westerns like ""3:10 to Yuma"", he certainly has built quite a repertoire.  My personal favorites by him are his two western scores ""The Homesman"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"".  So here we find him back in action movie land and the music put together here for this newest version of Agent 47 would satisfy the character well.  I honestly can't imagine any other sound for a movie like this.  I knew exactly the kind of music I was getting here even before I put the disc in.  Electronic drones/buzzes?  Check.  Thumping techno beats?  Check.  Lots of it?  Check.  I mean come on...the guy is a sharp dressed killer going around doing his thing, he certainly deserves music like this.  The beats/rhythms are awesome and you really can picture Agent 47 in action.  Check out track 4, ""Point Blank"".  It's a great piece that could give you a speeding ticket if you listen to it in the car.  ""Tube Tunnel"", track 8, is pretty cool too.  Makes me think of the way I wish I could drive during rush hour!Beltrami does give us a theme here for Agent 47.  He first introduces it slightly in track 1, ""The Agent Program"".  We hear it occasionally throughout the score but it is showcased more in tracks like ""Point Blank"", ""The Powers of an Agent"", and ""Camera Shy"".  It's a great little theme and I guess this is the only problem I have with the score is that I wish it were used a tiny bit more.  Some of the action cues (which there are many) tend to be more forgettable because they sound like they could be in 100 different action movies.  The times in the score where we do get to catch our breath are nice however.  Thankfully, we are introduced to another theme that occurs in these moments.  ""Katia's Theme"", track 3, is where we first hear this and you'll find it again in slower cues like ""Botanical Gardens"" (track 14).  These cues tend to drift off and become more ambient than memorable however and never really have a chance to develop for me.  I don't necessarily fault Beltrami for this however because he is putting the music to the scene and let's face it, people don't go to an action movie expecting Shakespeare!The CD is released through La-La Land Records and contains 20 tracks that give you a running time of about 58 minutes.  There is an 8 page insert that contains quite a few pictures from the film and production team credits.  Beltrami brings in a host of talent to help him with additional music for the score (probably most of the electronic stuff you hear in it).  Additional music is credited to Miles Hankins, Wlad Marhuets, Brandon Roberts, Ceiri Torjussen and Marcus Trumpp.  Beltrami's trusty sidekick, Buck Sanders, is lending a hand too.  The orchestra is the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg (German Film Orchestra) which is based in Potsdam, Germany.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US45I4KQ5CFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013R4QJGY#wasThisHelpful","R1US45I4KQ5CFF","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those scores that I had been wanting to add to my collection for quite some time.  It's one of James Horner's early ones and it's fascinating to listen to knowing now that Horner's career would steadily grow and his skills as a composer would develop over time.  As a young composer just starting off, Horner was finding his identity among those like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith.  He took such liberties with these influences that he was often accused of taking a little too much from their work and incorporating it into his own.  There is no denying that these influences exists in his work and you can also hear him borrowing a lot of material from himself in his early scores.  What makes this particular soundtrack so interesting is that it clearly is a test run for one of my favorite scores by Horner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Battle Beyond The Stars was created in 1980 and two years later Horner would compose Star Trek II which would catapult his career and enable him to do bigger films and become the recognizable composer that he is today.  Listening to Battle Beyond the Stars is kind of like hearing an early demo/remix of what would eventually become Star Trek II (and Star Trek III).  Battle Beyond The Stars is performed with a 62 piece orchestra and doesn't quite have the larger sound of his later bigger budgeted films but Horner demonstrates his talents, even at this young age, in pulling the most out of them.  The score isn't exactly a clone of his future Star Trek score and Horner does develop some original themes and material that remains exclusive to this particular film.  In my opinion, it does seem that Horner cleverly extracts the best moments of this score and reworks them into bigger/better pieces for Star Trek.  Many would probably say that Horner was cheating and not being original, but now knowing that much of this material would be incorporated into the Star Trek score I am thankful because I couldn't imagine that film any other way!  This is definitely material that shows the evolution of James Horner.  It also clearly shows how he was influenced by Jerry Goldsmith when you hear track 2, ""Malmori Rear Guard"", and compare it to the first Star Trek movie.Battle Beyond The Stars is a great score on it's own.  Yes, I find myself often drifting off to Star Trek II when those moments appear in it, but there are some great old school thematic science fiction fun happening here too.  Roger Corman was lucky to have this composer for this film because Horner really pulls out a big sound from this orchestra and gives audiences a great 1980's science fiction adventure score.  The main title for the film can stick in your head very quickly and whenever I wasn't listening to this score today, I found this theme playing on repeat in my head!The CD version of this score is presented and packaged very well by BSX Records.  Not only have they included the score from the film but they also give you Alan Howarth's sound effects that were used in the movie as well.  Tracks 18-51 includes ship fly by sounds, interiors of ships, laser blasts, and computer voices.  They also include Howarth's ""Gelt's Chamber"" juke box music from the film (track 17).  BSX completes the package with a 24 minute piece (track 53) that was released previously for Silva Screen Records.  This is the concert version of the film's main theme that was created in 1998 and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.  There is also a 12 page CD insert that is packed full of photos and detailed liner notes concerning the film's history, James Horner, and Alan Howarth.  This release reminds me a lot of those old GNP Crescendo Star Trek CDs that also contained great liner notes, sound effects, and sometimes stickers!  I also want to note that BSX Records also has Horner's ""Humanoids From the Deep"" score which they also did very well.  Battle Beyond The Stars contains 53 tracks and runs about 1 hour and 11 minutes.  It's a fabulous score to listen to and appreciate.  Horner's career was at it's early stages here and BSX Records does a great job in presenting this material to us a collectable package (which is limited to 1000 copies according to the back of the CD).  This was released in 2011 so I am sure the numbers are dwindling down...so pick this one up!  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6K8DKVWDXVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HAP2OC#wasThisHelpful","R1D6K8DKVWDXVF","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's a score that I didn't think would ever be released on CD.  I preordered it back in August (2015) and after multiple delays, It finally arrived in October.  Bear McCreary, who is a very accomplished and talented composer, seems to be the ""titan"" of TV soundtracks these days.  Some of his work includes ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Black Sails"", ""DaVinci's Demons"", and the ever so popular ""Outlander"".  Steve Kaplan shares the credit of composer for ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" and I am not very familiar with his work.  McCreary has been quite busy and I am sure with his involvement with multiple TV shows going on at the same time that he certainly needs the assistance.To be honest, I've only seen a few of the episodes from this show and while I enjoyed them, I mainly purchased this score because I love to hear Bear McCreary's work.  In the few episodes that I have seen from the show, I immediately began to appreciate the thematic ""hero"" music that McCreary graciously sprinkles along the score.  I love hearing a recognizable theme when I am watching movies or shows like this and that is one thing that this TV soundtrack surely has.  The busy violins and big brass brings a heroic sound worthy for the Marvel universe and it's characters.  Also, when listening to this particular score, you appreciate the composer's desire to bring a big film sound to the small screen.  Looking through the credits found in the CD liner notes, McCreary/Kaplan use a lot of musicians to bring this sound to us.  From instrument soloist like Steve Bartek (guitar) to vocalist like Raya Yarbrough, the composers have taken great care to spice up this score and give it all they can.The composers have selected a variety of pieces throughout the series to include on this release and I am sure that serious fans from the show might be missing some things, but I think they've done a good job at least giving us a variety here.  Thankfully not all the selections here are action oriented sequences.  ""Alien DNA"", track 11, features Raya Yarbrough and is quite a haunting and mesmerizing piece that builds to a hair raising climax.  Yarbrough, who McCreary also uses for the ""Outlander"" series, has a wonderful voice and it's good to see that McCreary use that talent well.  Could we be seeing another Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard partnership here?  ""Helicopter Rescue"", track 15, might sound like an action piece from it's title, but it is a very dreamy/relaxing piece that I find myself playing often.  It begins to pick up in tempo near the end of the piece and closes out with percussion and a big orchestra.  There are a few  upbeat electronic pieces in here as well like ""The Big Bang"" and ""The Rising Tide"" (tracks 17 & 18).  The score seems to have it all...even a cello concerto!  Track 9, ""Cello Concerto"", features soloist Eric Byers and is a great piece to add to this collection.  I think my favorite track from this CD is ""Showdown at Union Station"" (track 2).  This is a rather lengthy cue (nearly 7 minutes) that has a little bit of everything thrown into the mix!The CD contains 18 tracks and runs for a total of 1 hour and 18 minutes.  There is an 8 paneled insert that contains orchestra/production credits, special thanks, and plenty of photos from the show.  The score is very thematic, fun to listen to, and has a variety to keep everything interesting.  The big movie score sound is really awesome and the incorporation of so many different musicians and soloist is a real bonus.  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1MX0R1HP5XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BXFMMS#wasThisHelpful","R1W1MX0R1HP5XV","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me guess, a bad neck while sleeping probably brought you here.  Me too.  Yep, some weeks back I woke up with a painful surprise in my neck.  It isn't the first time it has happened.  Usually, I will just deal with it and over time, maybe a few days, everything will work itself out and I am back to normal again.  This most recent neck ache would not go away however.  I would even wake up at night and find my neck contorted in such a way that I was just making things even worse.  There would be no self healing if I couldn't put my head in a position that would allow it to heal.  So, like many of you are probably doing, I went on a quest to find the holy grail of pillows.  If you have arrived at the end of your journey...or if you are just beginning, I'll tell you that there are many pillows out there and all of them claim something magical by resting your weary head on them.  You wouldn't believe how complicated pillow shopping is.  I can tell you that no review will help you find the right one.  I guess the reason we have so many different pillows out there is because everyone is so different and finicky when it comes to a product like this.  There are pillows that will cost you hundreds of dollars, some are filled with water and some with bamboo.  There are thin ones, fat ones, misshaped ones, feather ones, cotton ones, memory foam and NASA probably has one filled with cloud vapors.  The problem is that you are going to have to try them for yourself and find whats best for you.Being a side and stomach sleeper, I started my quest by narrowing down the search to pillows that claimed support for someone like me.  I tried the ""wavy mountain memory foam pillow"" (that is not the products name...I don't remember what it is called) that cradles your head and I also tried a flat pillow.  Neither one seemed to help.  Looking on Amazon, I stumbled across this one and was intrigued by it's design.  It was definitely something that I had never tried before.  The good thing is that it wasn't too expensive and I was getting desperate.  I tried to find this particular pillows in some of the big box stores to at least put my hands on it but I could not find anything like it anywhere.  So, I guess I was destined to gamble with this thing.Upon arrival, I inspected the quality of the pillow and was pleased with that.  The stitching was well done, it was clean, and I didn't notice any horrible smell.  I wouldn't say this pillow is ""soft"".  Other pillows that I purchased throughout my journey, had a feeling of sinking right down into them and some were like rocks.  This one is firm and it's innards has that stuffing that you find in craft stores.  It feels and looks like that poly-fil fiber.  I found some of it stuck to the pillow fabric when I removed it from it's plastic bag and I can also see it through the white material that holds it all together.  The garment tag also states that it is made out of 100% Polyester Fiber.  Anyway...if it works...I don't care if it is made out of seaweed...I'll try it!  Trying it out for the first time was a little odd.  I tried the ""Larger Neck Support"" side and turned it around to try the ""Smaller Neck Support"" side.  The larger neck side actually seems softer allowing your neck to sink down nearly level with the ""hole"" area.  This also enables the lower areas of the pillow to support the sides of your neck a bit more.  I decided to use this approach as it seemed more comfortable to me.  I also noticed that when I am sleeping on my side that if I angle the pillow a bit that this helps me achieve a more comfortable position as well.  I am trying to avoid sleeping on my stomach because I think that is where a lot of my problems are coming from.  I've been using the pillow for a few weeks now and although I cannot say that I am completely healed, I am doing better.  I can now turn my head to back the car out of the driveway a lot more comfortably!  So is it the pillow or me being a bit more conscientious of how I am sleeping?  Who knows, maybe a combination of both.  I found this pillow to be comfortable for me to sleep on.  The ""hole"" area allows my head to rest down and my neck appears to level out when using it.  I do angle it a bit for comfort.Well, that is my adventure.  There are probably better ones out there but honestly I can't afford to try them all.  This one was more unique than some of the ones that I tried and it seemed to be what I needed.  Waking up in the middle of the night, with massive neck pain, and noticing the positions that I was putting my neck in gave me the idea that I needed something to sink my head and help hold my neck in place.  Of course, when we are sleeping, some of us toss around quite a bit and we are never truly ""settled"" into one place all night.  I can tell you that I am waking up a lot less at night and after a few weeks of use, my neck feels a whole lot better.  I can't say that I'd recommend this pillow...because we are all different sleepers...but I can say that it worked for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFJPOL1JDO57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ET9TXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RFJPOL1JDO57","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a while since I've purchased a Thomas Newman soundtrack.  I think the last one that I picked up by him was ""Skyfall"" (James Bond) and I really didn't care for that one too much.  This, however, is the kind of film that Newman does best.  ""The Green Mile"", ""The Road to Perdition"", and ""Shawshank Redemption"" were truly remarkable scores.  One of my favorites from him is ""Meet Joe Black"" however.  Thomas Newman, who is the son of the great film composer Alfred Newman, has scored many films over the years but this is his first with director Steven Spielberg.  It's well known that John Williams is Spielberg's composer of choice but unfortunately Williams couldn't score this film due to illness.  John Williams, who is 83 years old, has actually composed every Spielberg film except one, ""The Color Purple"" which was scored by Quincy Jones.  I think Spielberg's decision to go with Newman was a great one.  Newman really has a knack for films like this and although I will forever be eternally curious as to what a John Williams score would of sounded like for this film, I am pleased to say that this really is an outstanding soundtrack.I haven't seen the film yet, but I am eager to do so.  The story is based on the true events of Lt. Francis Gary Powers and when the Soviets shot down his U-2 spy plane.  Track one of the score sets the tone with brief old school cold war ""Hunt for Red October"" sounding music.  The Soviet choir is haunting and beautiful.  The next track, ""Sunlit Silence"", sounds heroically American and must be Powers flying high in his U-2 spy plane.  It's a great serene and graceful piece that really musically paints a scene of a high altitude flight.  Newman incorporates plenty of musical references throughout the score to represent the Soviets, Americans, and espionage.  Newman has always composed some fantastic piano music for films. His use of piano and woodwind instruments is a great choice to highlight this sense of spies and espionage throughout the score.  Track 6, ""Lt. Francis Gary Powers"", is one of the most unique in the score.  It sounds like something you'd hear in a horror film.  It's pretty intense and I am guessing that this might be the Soviets interrogating Powers?  The climax of the film is the trading of spies and Newman captures this historical event perfectly with ""Glienicke Bridge"" (track 13).  There is a lot of atmospheric tension music that gets more agitated with piano and Russian vocals about 6 minutes in.  This is the most lengthy cue on the album and it runs for nearly 11 minutes.  The music is really well done here because you can literally close your eyes and see this scene take place.  The track ends in ""victory"" with a fanfare of military drums, big strings, and brass.  The last track, ""Bridge of Spies"" (track 15), basically presents the musical essence of the entire score, so you'll hear many of the themes and sounds established throughout played here as the end credits roll.The CD is released through Hollywood Records and contains 15 tracks that run a total of 49 minutes.  The score seems short to me...I guess they probably use a lot of period music throughout the film as well?  The CD comes with an 8 paneled insert that contains some great pictures from the film, as well as, orchestra/choir credits, and production team credits.  There are also some ""special thanks"" from the composer and interestingly enough...he thanks John Williams!  As I mentioned before, this is the type of score that Newman excels at.  He has done a great job here.  The music really does a great job of expressing the movie well and I love Newman's piano work here...and the cool Cold War Soviet sound too!  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31OYRW28CE275/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WSYGK4#wasThisHelpful","R31OYRW28CE275","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a movie that is high on my ""really want to see"" list.  I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters so I'll have to wait for it to be released on Blu Ray.  It seems to have gotten a lot of mixed reviews with some hating it because they feel it is ""insulting to other cultures"" and those who love it feeling that it is an ""intense action that will keep you on the edge of your seat"".  I guess I'll have to wait and find out for myself.  Owen Wilson plays an American engineer in Southeast Asia who find himself, along with his family, caught up in the middle of a political uprising.  I remember seeing a show on TV that shared the true stories of tourist overseas who were either kidnapped or found themselves in very similar circumstances and it was terrifying to think about.  Judging from the movie trailer and from what I've read about this film, it appears that this movie attempts to bring such a nightmare to audiences.  Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders take on the challenge of pulling at your emotions and forcing you to feel the intensity of the story all through music.  This is definitely a ""run, hide, fight, run, hide, fight"" score that will have you sweating by the time you reach the end.Beltrami and Sanders have shared ""composer"" titles before in films like ""Max Payne"", ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", and ""The Hurt Locker"".  They've actually been working together for quite some time really.  Sanders has collaborated with Beltrami since 1997 and I think they first worked together on the score ""Mimic"".  Sometimes he acts as a producer, musician, or composes additional music.  Their time together, no matter what role Sanders takes, has yielded some fine music over the years.  Nearly every Beltrami score has Sanders somewhere in the credits, so their partnership goes back several years.  For this particular score, the duo has essentially created a horror score.  Instead of monsters/demons however, we find a family in what appears to be a ""no escape"" political rebellion in foreign land.  The action steams along at a brisk pace and the composers capture the sounds of Southeast Asia through traditional instrumentation and percussion.  Track 6, ""Coup Coup Roux"", makes good use of the cultural sounds of the region putting the audience right there in the geography of the story.  The piece starts like a growl and steadily grows in intensity with this steady ""thump, thump, thump"" beat that makes the piece a bit nerve wracking.  You'll hear this steady ""thump, thump, thump"" rhythm used quite a bit throughout the score.  I bet it does a great job of amping up the tension in the movie...the only problem is that when you are trying to sit at home and enjoy this score outside of the film...it can amp up your tension as well!  This is probably not the score to take to the office and play in the background while you work.  You'll be yelling at everyone by the end of the day.  I would reserve this for the treadmill folks or you runners out there.  You will definitely get a workout with this one.  As a matter of fact, the score only takes a few breaks from the action.  It's only when the characters find ""refuge"" that you will also.  Cues like ""Rooftop Refuge"" (track 10), ""Brothel Refuge"" (track 19), and ""Broader Refuge"" (track 25) give you and the characters a chance to catch your breath.  There is nothing thematic about the score.  There really seems to be no time for that in the music as it's main focus is to throw you in this situation with the characters.  You don't really have time to get to know them...just ""run, hide, fight"" alongside!The score is a mix of traditional sounds/instrumentation of the region, electronics, strong percussion, and even some very nice piano (for the slower cues).  The percussion work really stands out in this score and really gives you the sense of trying to escape a bad situation.  The composers provided a score that runs right along with the story given to them.  This unfortunately will make the score probably a little more difficult for listeners to enjoy outside of the film.  I do think that those who appreciate more percussive scores will enjoy this however and those of you looking for some great ""running"" tracks can certainly find plenty here.  The slower, ""take refuge"" cues are more ambient than thematic and I know when I pull this score out again to listen to it, my first thought will be the ""thump, thump, thump, thump"" rhythm that you hear so often throughout the action sequences.  I wish there could of been more time to develop some more thematic sequences and the ""breather"" cues are over too soon.  Beltrami and Sanders have really done an outstanding job of musically capturing this horrible scenario and letting the audience feel the anxiety of the situation for sure.The CD version of the score is released by Lakeshore Records and comes in a digipack with their traditional limited edition ""gold sticker"" of only 1000 copies made.  There is a four page insert in the front cover sleeve with a two paneled picture of Owen Wilson and Pierce Brosman.  The back page contains music production credits.  There are 27 tracks and the total running time is 56 minutes.  The last track on the score is a song entitled ""Take Care of You"" and is sung by Jim James.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEB35CPVDO35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144R8KQU#wasThisHelpful","R3NEB35CPVDO35","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a product that I've been wanting for a long time.  I'm sure many of you, like me, have probably searched online and have read a lot of horror story reviews about these devices.  Some don't last but a few charges, don't work, etc.  I am happy to say that after testing this device, I am confident that it will perform it's intended job.  I've always wanted one of these things mainly for camping trips.  It's one the problems I have to figure out each year.  I don't do any social media stuff...but I do like the convenience of having a phone around for emergencies.  I am also still using an iPhone 4S and over the years the battery life has certainly diminished.  We also live in an area that is prone to power outages due to storms.  We had a tornado hit our area a few years ago and it knocked our electricity out for a week.  Throw in a couple of hurricanes and ice storms too.  We now have a generator, but I don't mind a backup gadget such as the Idaye charger.It came packaged very well with plenty of protective gear to keep it safe on the mail ride over.  It comes with an instruction book and a USB cable that allows you to charge it through your computer or laptop.  When I started charging it, 3 out of 4 lights were on showing that it came shipped with at least 75% of a charge.  I noticed that some other reviewers have mentioned various charge levels when theirs arrived as well.  I ""topped off"" the charge through my computer and the include USB cable, which took about an hour because it was already nearly full.  I first charged my iPhone 4S that had a 50% charge and that took about 1 hour.  I next charged my Kindle, which was completely dead, and that took about 2 hours to charge.  After charging both devices, I still had 50% power left over.  One thing that I did notice is that when you  are charging a device, the blue lights on the Idaye only blinked for a second or two and then they turn off.  They do not blink during the entire charging process.  I kept checking on it every so often (turning my phone on) to see if it was indeed charging my phone and it most certainly was.Charging it back to full capacity takes about 8 and a half hours through my computer.  I tried using old Apple wall chargers on this and they will not charge the device correctly.  All four lights on the unit will start blinking after about 10-15 minutes (which I guess is a signal that something is not charging properly).  I had to use my computer to charge it up correctly.  I guess I'll have to find a non-Apple wall charger and see if that works later.  It does not have pass through capabilities (which allows it to charge both your device and the charger).  It also has a power button on the side that you have to push in order for it to start charging your device.  Pushing the power button when nothing is plugged in will cause the blue lights to come on letting you know how much charge you have in the device.  It also has ""Smart"" capabilities which according to the instructions, ""maximizes compatibility with Android, Apple, and other devices by enabling charge speeds of up to 2.4A amps.  It has a large capacity at 18500mAh and allows for quite a few charges.  The device itself is very sleek, small, and easily portable.  One would have no problem at all with slipping this in a brief case of a backpack.  It isn't that heavy to me and feels pretty solid and well built.  It is functional and the price is really good.  I did not notice any excessive heat build up during any of the charging.Camping, ""out and about"", or for emergencies...I think this is a great little device to have.  As with all batteries, time and frequent use will diminish the life and power of the device so it will be interesting to see how well it holds up.  The instructions state that ""No expense spared - constructed with Li-Polymer Battery"".  I honestly have no idea what that means in the world of batteries...but like my iPhone 4S, all things will eventually come to an end!  Anyway, from what I can tell about this device and the experience that I've had with it so far, I would say that it is a well built little charger with plenty of power, nice design features, and will be great for my needs.  I recommend!I received this device at a discount for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXYEUEOALOD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R40KUO#wasThisHelpful","R1SXYEUEOALOD5","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great hose!  Light weight and flexible.  It comes with the necessary rubber washers to prevent leaks and I really like how Purelux packages their items.  They have plastic protective fittings that go over the ends of the hose and everything comes wrapped inside a cardboard box.

"I am using the Purelux Adjustable Hand Shower Arm Mount in conjunction with their ""Torch"" shower head.  The device was very easy to install and provides adjustment capabilities for my shower head.  It comes with plenty of pipe thread tape and that is definitely a bonus that I wasn't expecting.  I really like how it ""lifts"" my particular shower head up and lets the water fall down on you rather than it aiming directly in your face.  There are rubber washer seals inside to keep the water from leaking.  It works perfectly with the shower head that I have (which is also made by Purelux).  The whole system is really affordable.

"The 12 Monkeys soundtrack is what I would call some great ""thinking & creating"" music.  It's dark, moody, atmospheric and provides some nice mellow down tunes.  The producers of the CD have complied 23 cues of music from the TV series onto one disc and upon sampling some of the tracks I felt that this was very nice working music.  I like having music like this in the background to make life a little less mundane and it helps to get the creative juices flowing too.Trevor Rabin and Paul Linford have collaborated together to give us the soundscape of the time traveling TV show.  The insert that comes with the CD has a note from director Terry Mutalas which he states that he is a long time fan of Rabin's music scores such as ""National Treasure"" and ""Enemy of the State"".  Upon talking with Rabin about the show, he did his best to describe his musical vision that included bells and chimes.  He goes on to say that within two weeks, Rabin had worked out the main theme of the show and it was exactly what the director wanted and it's what you hear on the title sequence on the CD.  The first track, ""I Am the Clock"", is a great piece that really does set up the whole tone of this science fiction conspiracy story.  The score is like a dark investigative crime drama with a slight twist of horror mixed in.  The collaborating composers did a great job incorporating the importance of ""time"" within the music as well.  Many of the cues use instrumentation to simulate a clock's ticking and/or give the sense of time.  Other cues are more echoey, sad, and mediative such as one of my favorite tracks entitled ""Art of War"" (12).  The last track, ""The Cycle is Complete"" is a bit more epic sounding and is accompanied by a choir of voices.  Another great track is entitled ""Katarina (Jones's Theme).  I was out on my back deck playing this with the sun going down...totally awesome.  The great thing is that the score never gets too bombastic and so nonsensical that is becomes a distraction and ultimately a ""noise fest"".  Rabin and Linford have set a musical tone for the show and it remains consistent throughout the score.  There is plenty of tension, atmosphere and some great diversity in instrumentation.Some might be turned off by the score.  Your not going to get this music and say to yourself, ""Hey...I am going to sit down and jam out with the 12 Monkeys score"".  I could probably do that with Jurassic World or Star Wars...but not this one.  This is more of a ""mellow out...replace background noise with something more interesting and possibly fitting"" music.  As I mentioned previously, it can also be some awesome inspirational and ""creating"" music.  Fans of the show will surely enjoy this collection.  I've amassed quite the soundtrack collection over the years and I find myself listening to scores to recount favorite scenes from the movie, play ""arm chair"" director, envision my own scenes, color the background noise of reality with something more interesting, and relaxing.  This particular score will probably go into the later two categories.The CD is produced by Varese Sarabande and contains 23 tracks with a total running time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.  The CD also contains a 4 page insert with pictures from the show and a brief note from the director.  The back cover contains credits for score production, tracks and lists the many instruments performed by the composers themselves.The Perseids meteor shower is tonight, I think I'll take this out with me on the back deck and wonder at the infinity of space & time.  I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZYYGE8EVX27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZ6MY1S#wasThisHelpful","R2AZYYGE8EVX27","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CD insert has a note from composer Jeff Beal where he recounts having visited the ruins of Masada a few months prior to being asked to compose the music for the TV miniseries.  His trip to Masada definitely inspired his creativity because his score for the show paints a musical picture that, as a stand alone piece of work, gives the listener a wonderful soundscape of the story.  Across the two CDs you find wonderful atmospheric and emotionally infused music using traditional and ethnic instrumentation.  The score is accompanied by haunting and beautiful vocals that really brings the culture, time period, and emotions of the story to life.Jeff Beal is certainly no stranger to TV soundtracks.  He has an impressive resume of material and has consistently been able to deliver on a variety of subjects and stories.  Many will know him for his work on ""House of Cards"" but I became familiar with him on his ""Jesse Stone"" TV scores (which they really need to release on CD again).  Once I saw that Beal was doing the score for this series, I went ahead and pre-ordered the CD and I am glad I did.  Beal doesn't disappoint with this one.  The score has a great authentic feel to it and it is what you'd expect from a movie like this.  I am very pleased to say that Varese Sarabande, the record label that produced the CD, did a great job of putting this together.  Although I appreciate this label very much for bringing otherwise unobtainable scores to audiences, they tend to give the ""bare bones"" of scores with little extras.  With this particular release, they give you two CDs packed with music from the show.  The total run time of the score is 2 hours and 29 minutes.  Disc 1 is the more emotional and thematic with the music setting up the characters and the impact of the Romans in their lives.  Disc 2 moves into a slightly more action oriented theme as the Romans grow ever so closer to the besieged Jews at Masada.  The tone of the music in Disc 2 gets more desperate and Beal does an excellent job at musical capturing this part of the story.The score is quite enjoyable to listen to as a stand alone work and I find it to be very relaxing back ground music for work.  Beal has done an excellent job at demonstrating is versatility as a composer and continues to impress.  The CD release of this score is a limited edition with only 1000 copies available.  For those of you who like to truly own your music and want a CD copy, I suggest you move fast.  Like so many of Beal's scores, they are usually released in limited numbers and become expensive to obtain later (wish I had a copy of the ""Stone Cold"" score).  The CD is available currently through the Varese Sarabande website for $16.98 and Amazon third party sellers.  The CD comes with an 8 page insert that contains a note from Jeff Beal and photos from the series.  There are 27 tracks on Disc 1 and 24 on Disc 2.  With a 2 hour and 29 minute runtime, there is plenty of music to enjoy here.  It's a wonderful score and I recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27C9OB7O668Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LS4V3K#wasThisHelpful","R27C9OB7O668Y3","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fun score to listen to!  Christophe Beck has done an amazing job with this one and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite of the Marvel scores.  I just got the CD today and I've been playing it all day.  I really like the very catchy main title theme.  I went out to do some errands today and as I was listening to this in the car, I couldn't help to notice how much this ""heist"" music really fits into the world of ants as well.  I mean think about it.  Ants are always on a heist job!  They are sneaking around and always on some kind of a mission.  The music fits perfectly.  As I am driving around, I couldn't help to notice how this music fits into our own busy world as well.  The busy fast moving pace of life and our own little ""missions"" seem to fit very well within the context of this music.  Beck has given Ant-Man a wonderful main theme and fortunately he plays with it throughout the score.  It is easily recognizable, catchy, and one that I hope is used in future movies and/or appearances of this character.  The Marvel movies rotate composers a lot and sometimes these themes can get very muddled.  Speaking of themes, you do hear the Avengers theme briefly in the score (track 9 - ""First Mission"").I loved Beck's approach to short choppy notes that not only work well with the comic heist bits within the movie but also because they fit so nicely within the insect world as well.  Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's piece ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" is an example of this (there is a track on the CD called Flight of the Bumblebee - it is not the Rimsky-Korsakov piece).  You can't help but to visualize a bee in flight and I find that to be true in some of the cues for the Ant-Man score.  Beck's score is plenty diverse however in that you can find comic movements, heroic fanfares, action, and emotional pieces.  This truly makes this score enjoyable to listen to as a stand alone piece of work.  The variety and nature of the music is what makes it perfect for enjoyable listening throughout the day.The CD contains 31 tracks with the last four being done by Camilo Azuquita, Roy Ayers, The Commodores, and HLM.  Out of the last four tracks, the HLM one entitled ""Pink Gorilla"" is my favorite.  It's a fun techno sounding dance number that sounds really cool.  Another favorite of mine is Beck's ""Tales to Astonish"" (track 27).  A guess the title is a nod to Ant-Man's first appearance in comic books and with this we get a great little Ventures sounding surf music.  It's a great fun way to close out the score portion on the CD.  The total run time on the CD is 1:05:20 so your getting plenty of great music here.  The CD comes with a 8 paneled insert that contains pictures from the film, track listing, and production credits.  The CD is released through Hollywood Records.It's a great score and I love Ant-Man's theme music.  Beck certainly made some great creative choices here and the connection between comic heist music and the insect world really works.  I recommend this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENWS332JQ7S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJKRJ38#wasThisHelpful","R3ENWS332JQ7S0","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Revenge stories have been around for a long time and the movies that are successful in bringing these stories to our screens do so with great presentation, story, and character.  The movie is beautiful with it's locations, sets, props, and costumes.  The story is brilliantly ugly with the unfortunate circumstances that the main character finds himself in.  I thought the set up for the film was perfect.  A good man who has a beautiful wife and son...hasn't seen them in seven years and on the day he is finally reunited with them....wow...TRAGEDY!  I don't want to give any spoilers but as events unfolded, I found myself almost too squeamish to watch.  I couldn't help but to think, ""Man...if that was to happen to me""!  It doesn't stop there because other things follow that drive the character to his ultimate destiny of confrontation to those who have done him wrong.I really enjoyed the film and knew nothing about it until I saw it on Amazon's new releases for Tuesday.  I watched a trailer online and decided to go for it.  I've always loved western films and although this story is a familiar one, I thought the presentation here was excellent.  The setup of the characters at the beginning was very well done.  Seeing these events unfold made me curious as to how the main character was going to handle this.  As he obtains justice for one tragedy, another soon finds it's way into his life and this propels the story further and he eventually meets the ultimate villain in the story....and what a villain he is!  There are some very brutal scenes in the film especially where this bad guy is concerned!The acting was very well done and I am impressed with Eva Green!  What a gorgeous actress.  She doesn't say a word throughout the entire film and has to rely on her eyes, facial expressions, and body language.  Again, I don't want to spoil what part her character plays in all of this, but you'll find her character and Eva Green's performance to be outstanding.I really enjoyed the film and was impressed by the acting, music, setting/scenery, and story.  I thought that the main character was very realistic and not too much of a ""super-hero gunslinger"".  It's a beautiful looking film and it looks amazing on Blu Ray.  For fans of the western genre this is a must see film!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347W9K19030CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0QOHG8#wasThisHelpful","R347W9K19030CQ","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed Henry Jackman's work on ""Big Hero 6"".  It was an amazing score and I was excited to hear what he had in store for ""Pixels"".  Before popping the CD in, I was really expecting the score to reflect the arcade sounds and music from the video game characters in the movie.  I was very surprised to hear otherwise.  The score has the rich full sound of an orchestra and choral vocals.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that because Jackman is a very accomplished composer that has impressed me many times before!  The score is big...almost epic at times.  The choral voices add an extra magical effect to some of the pieces and you can tell that this music is perfect for reflecting the action, comedy, and zaniness of this story's premise.  I haven't seen the movie, but in watching the trailers I can see how this music by Jackman would blend in perfectly.The problem is that the score, while nicely done, becomes a little less interesting to listen to as a stand alone piece.  The score doesn't really delve into any emotional depth or character pieces because it doesn't have to.  It's a score for a big action comedy and the music that Jackman has created here is designed to reflect just this.  There are a few very short emotional pieces that Jackman manages to squeeze in however.  They are very short and hardly have time to develop but this is no fault of the composer.  He's writing music to support the story he is given.  The pieces are ""Unconditional Love"", ""Sweet Spot"", and ""High Score"".  These are some of my favorite tracks from the score but I also enjoy listening to ""Centipede"" as well.  ""Centipede"" is a great action piece that has several movements and is very reflective of Jackman's skill as a composer.  There is a bonus track that is really fun to listen to entitled ""Arcaders '82"".  This last track is what I was really expecting the entire score to be like.  It definitely has that ""80s"" sound to it and is a fun piece to listen to.  It would of been cool if more of this sound could have been used a bit more in the score.The runtime of the score is pretty short at a mere 39 minutes.  I assume this is because other music is probably being used in the movie for certain scenes which reduces the amount of music that Jackman has to score.  The CD comes with an 8 page insert that contains pictures from the film, choir credits, orchestra credits (Hollywood Studio Symphony), and production credits.  The CD is released through Varese Sarabande.  From the look of the pictures and the trailer, it seems like it would be a fun movie.  It hasn't been getting a very good response from some but I'll have to see for myself.It's a big score that is designed to reflect more of the onscreen action only.  It doesn't have time to support some emotional inner turmoil and develop individual thematics.  It's music for a comic science fiction action movie starring Adam Sandler.  Jackman gives what he's suppose to with what he's working with.  Unfortunately this will make it a little more difficult for many to enjoy on it's own.  I do wish something more unique could have been inserted in other areas of the score such as what we find in the bonus track because I think that would of made everything stand out a bit more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNCYHDL8VFE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJKRIJ8#wasThisHelpful","RCNCYHDL8VFE0","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your not familiar with composer Reinhold Heil, chances are you've probably heard his music before.  He  has worked on several TV series such as ""Without a Trace"", ""Legends"" and ""Awake"".  He also contributed on the movie score for ""Cloud Atlas"" with Tom Tykwer and Johnny Klimek.  Heil's specialty is his custom made electronic sounds.  The CD insert for the ""Helix"" soundtrack contains a statement from Heil where he says, ""Some of my weirdest sound creations were a natural fit for this show"".  I'd have to agree because there are unique sounds aplenty within this score.  Heil uses various synthesizers, computer tech, and his own ""homemade sample creations"" to capture the atmospheric and ambient sounds for the show's environments.  I've only seen season one, which takes place in an arctic research station.  The first disc from this CD contains highlights from season 1 with 33 tracks.  The music is very fitting to this eerie and isolated place and the custom sounds that Heil generates contribute greatly to the mood of the story.  You can't help but to picture the long corridors, hidden passageways, minimalistic ""research station decoration"", and cold air when you listen to this first disc.  The second disc focuses on season 2 which takes place in an entirely different location.  I haven't seen this season yet but from what I understand it takes place on some mysterious island.  The music reflects this locale change with slightly more percussion work that almost sounds tribal at times.  Heil continues to explore and expand his imagination with even more crazy random sounds that sneak into the music providing a jolt of surprise, mystery and energy.  How much weirdness can you squeeze out of a synthesizer anyway?  A spooky music box tune makes it's appearance occasionally in some of the cues and this must be of some importance within the story of season 2.I should also point out that Heil implores the talents of other artist to help him achieve his musical tapestry of ""Helix"".  Ayana Haviv provides some very haunting and beautiful vocals for both seasons.  For season one, she lends her voice on ""Find Me"" and for season 2 it's ""Kool Aid"".  Heil also uses cello and viola work on a few cues with my favorite being track 20 from season 2 entitled ""I Can't Believe Michael Did This"".  The musicians for this great music are Marshall McDaniel and Michael Levine.The score for Helix is very successful in creating the atmosphere for the show.  It's moody, creepy, mysterious, and picks up in intensity when needed.  It is not a melodic score and your certainly not going to walk around in the grocery store whistling a tune from this.  Well, I guess you could have that creepy main title music that reminds me of a bad gameshow.  Your probably not going to exercise or jog the neighborhood with this stuff either (unless you want a brand new interpretation of your surroundings).  I'd recommend this score for those of you out there who are writers, painters, poets, or those who just appreciate soundtrack music (like myself).  This music would certainly inspire the next great mystery or horror novel!  The strength in this music is that it excels in creating imagery.  The cool thing is that it isn't a collection of random noise tracks that drone on and on for an hour.  Each cue is unique and interesting in it's own way and Heil has done a fascinating job of sharing his weird custom made sounds within the world of ""Helix"".The CD is a 2 disc set that contains season 1 on the first disc and season 2 on the second.  The first disc runs 69:18 and disc two runs 65:03.  Together, your getting about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  The CD also contains an 8 page insert that includes pictures from both seasons, details about the stories from both seasons, composer comments, and production credits.  The CD is produced by La La Land Records and they always do a great job in bringing soundtracks like this to film score fans.  Those of you that have enjoyed the series will certainly like this collection as well.  I wouldn't wait too long because these CDs are usually only for a limited time and numbers.  Enjoy the music or use it to inspire your own creations....I recommend this score!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4GQS2Z10TLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1DYGWQ#wasThisHelpful","RS4GQS2Z10TLA","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a small acknowledgement in the CD insert from James Horner and in this statement he thanks Antoine Fuqua (director) and John Houlihan (music supervisor) for ""giving me the freedom to try out some pretty modern textures of music"".  Southpaw is the 35th soundtrack that I have by James Horner and although I haven't heard all of his scores, this one is certainly unique when compared to the ones that I have by him.  Horner has certainly had his share of criticism in the past but with scores like Southpaw and The Wolf Totem (which I discovered last month), the 61 year old composer was still full of creative energy and his work was continuing to evolve.I haven't seen the film and I have to admit that when I first opened the CD, I was half expecting to hear something like ""Rocky"" or a sports movie french horn fanfare that shows the underdog working his way to the top.  I later learned (by reading the synopsis of the movie), that this is more of a ""fall from grace"" where a series of tragic events deals a tough blow to the main character.  James Horner's music is very reflective of this and you won't find any fanfares or exercise music here.  The score is reflective, melancholy, and has a subtle tension that grows throughout.  At times, I found the score to be relaxing and having an almost ""meditative"" quality to it.  Horner has always been impressive with his piano arrangements and you will find that he makes good use of that skill throughout this score.  The main theme is so simple, yet truly powerful.  The really amazing thing is that this almost subliminal approach with the theme has different emotional impacts depending on the other instrumentation/sound effects that Horner uses to surround it.  Horner experiments with a more modern electronic sound throughout the score and this combined with his more traditional approach has some very cool emotional effects on the music.Track 1 (The Preparations), introduces you to the theme.  This haunting and simplistic piano appears throughout the score and Horner (as mentioned previously) surrounds it with different emotions as the story unfolds.  The great thing is that Horner, in his experimentation, never tries to let the modern electronic ""textures"" overpower the more traditional sounds we are use to hearing from him.  The elegant piano work and modern tech blend together quite beautifully.  I am sure that some credit needs to go to music arrangers Simon Rhodes and Simon Franglen for this as well.  Horner has worked with these two arrangers on several films and this trio's collaboration has produced some great results.Things get a little different when you listen to track 6 (Suicidal Rampage).  This one is a roller coaster ride that truly reflects this cue's title.  It contains all of the emotions from the first five tracks with the inclusion of some very disturbing and scary fits of energy.  The electronic effects and sounds musically paint a picture of painful emotional instability.  Again, I haven't seen this movie yet but I imagine that this music is symbolic of the intense ""fall from grace"" that the main character endures.The score moves us out of the emotional chaos into track 6 (Empty Showers).  It's a little eerie but then shifts to a peaceful piano (theme) that is calming.  My favorite track is the next one entitled ""Dream Crusher"".  It's a more traditional orchestra piece that is both sad, beautiful, and moving.  I can just hit repeat and daydream all day with this one.The big climatic music for the score can be found in track 13 (Hope vs Escobar).  At 2:27 in, it sounds like the lions have been let loose from their cages and the battle begins!  The 8 minute cue goes through various tempo and rhythmic changes that, I assume, reflect the big confrontation at the end of the film.  From listening to this piece, I get the sense that there is some flashback moments as well.  I guess I'll have to wait and see how it all plays out in the movie.I have been really impressed with Horner's score because it gave me exactly what I didn't expect.  It's a very emotional score that is very fitting for a story like this.  It looks to be a great film and I am excited to hear how the music fits in with the story.  On it's own, I found the score to be very enjoyable and many of the tracks are unwinding/relaxing.  Many have said that this is James Horner's last score, but I've read that he actually finished work on the upcoming film ""Magnificent Seven"" directed by Antoine Fuqua as well.  So, we might be hearing some more music by Horner in the future.  Be sure to check out ""The Wolf Totem"" too.  It's a wonderful score that is quite impressive as well.The CD has 14 tracks with a total running time of 53 minutes.  It comes with a 12 page insert that contains some great pictures from the film and a few credits for score production and a brief word of thanks from James Horner.  The score is released through Sony Classical.  I've noticed that they have also come out with an additional soundtrack for the film that contains the vocal music from the film.  Thank goodness they decided to release two separate soundtracks.  Sometimes they really shortchange the score if they are released together.  I did notice on the other soundtrack that there are two score tracks entitled ""A Cry for Love"" (parts 1 & 2).  They are pretty short and seem to be basically arrangements of ""A Cry for Help"" (track 8) on the score release.James Horner has given us some truly amazing film music over his career.  I became a fan when I first heard Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  He will be missed but he leaves a legacy of wonderful music for generations to enjoy.  I highly recommend this score!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMSIV87K1TW9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0WIU2A#wasThisHelpful","RMSIV87K1TW9F","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A while back when the new Robocop movie came out, Pedro Bromfman scored the film and included some of Basil Poledouris's original Robocop theme briefly within the soundtrack.  I had never been able to find the original score for Robocop as it resurfaces every few years and then disappears because of limited runs.  The prices for the CDs obviously get very high and out of my price point so I was very excited to finally catch a re-release this time around.There are quite a few mixed reviews here listed for various versions of the releases so I wanted to clarify that this is the 2015 re-release done by Milan Records.  A few years ago, Intrada Records released a version that contained four previously unreleased tracks:  Have a Heart (2), O.C.P. Monitors (3), Nukem (10), and Big is Better (20).  Thankfully, this version by Milan has those missing cues as well.  In fact, this version by Milan Records is the exact same version that was released by Intrada a few years ago.  It has the same track listing and run time of about 57 minutes.  The only difference between the two versions is the package presentation.  Intrada is well known for putting together very nice collector editions of the media they release which includes really nice pictures on the disc and 20 plus page CD inserts that contain historical information about the film, scoring, and composer.  This particular release by Milan is pretty bare bones and comes in a digipack with no insert.  It does have a picture of Robocop on the inside cover and the disc itself has no picture on it...just black.  The CD itself, however, sounds great on my system and it is awesome to hear the Robocop score in all of it's 80's action/science fiction wonder!  I've always been a fan of Basil Poledouris and film score junkies and fans of Poledouris need a copy of the original Robocop score in their collections.  I'm glad that Milan records re-released this one because otherwise I'd have to pay a lot more to get a copy of it.  I prefer to own physical CDs rather than having everything digital so this looks quite nice in the collection and sounds great in my system.For those of you new to this particular score, I highly recommend this.  Poledouris was a fine composer who unfortunately left this world all too soon.  My favorite soundtrack of all time was composed by him, ""Lonesome Dove"".  I also am a big fan of the ""Conan"" scores and ""Flesh and Blood"".  Poledouris uses a combination of a full size orchestra mixed with very cool sounding 80's gizmo tech to musically bring Robocop to life.  The Robocop theme is a great one and can really get stuck in your head too.  I have found myself whistling the theme for the past few days now.  The score for this film comes and goes so if your interested in this one, you'd better pick it up now before it disappears again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWADROIX67R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V862H0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2HWADROIX67R6","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually steer away from movies that deal with robots and A.I. because I've never been impressed with how they present the story.  The only reason why I watched this one was out of sheer boredom with nothing else to watch.  Holy cow, I'm glad I did because this was an amazing story.  Without knowing anything about the movie, except for the fact that it deals with a robot/A.I. of some kind, I gave it a chance to hook me and it surely did.  It's not your typical artificial intelligence gone crazy and robots attacking the world movie and it's not an action romp with explosions and flying cars.  This is a story told with just a handful of characters and it hooked me with my own questions of the possibility of creating artificial intelligence such as this.  Other movies of this genre have never really gripped me with some of the questions and believability of this scenario.  It's very well done and I found the filming, pacing, and acting to be quite incredible.  The story kept me guessing throughout and I never really predicted the ending as the way it played out.  The score for the film is also amazing and really does an incredible job of giving this story a tone/mood that is quite fitting.Without spoiling the movie for you, I will say that this film kind of reminded me of ""Frankenstein"" a little bit.  Isn't it funny that movies that have the issue of ""man creating life"" always end pretty bad for ""the creator"".  The movie makes you wonder if we ever will have the capabilities to create robots with advanced intelligence and what repercussions it will have on mankind.  The topic has been explored for a long time in certain movies and it seems like it is the same old story told over and over.  ""Ex Machina"" was done very cleverly however and even though I kind of knew where this was going, there were surprises and I just really enjoyed the presentation of the story for this particular film.I'm glad I went into this movie knowing very little about it.  I love science fiction movies but have never really enjoyed many of them dealing with this particular subject.  ""Ex Machina"" was a great treat for an otherwise boring afternoon and it gave me something to realistically think about when considering the implications of creating robots/artificial intelligence.  I'd recommend giving it a chance and see it for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROYEMJT32QZ0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI057M0#wasThisHelpful","ROYEMJT32QZ0H","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always look forward to the soundtrack scores for the Batman video games.  Nick Arundel's main theme for the Arkham City score is still one of my favorite Batman themes even when compared to the movies.  It's great to hear that theme used again here in various ways in Arkham Knight.  This particular score is listed as Volume 1 and you are getting 27 tracks that run a total of 1 hour and 8 minutes.  The score's last track (27), ""Crowd Control"", does end abruptly and gives the entire thing a very unfinished feel to it.  I'll be looking forward to how it concludes in Volume 2.The score sounds great and contains a blend of action music (mostly done by Arundel) and a blend of ambient ""investigative"" music.  At times, the score tends to get really frightening and you would think that it's from a horror film.  Track 17, ""Dark Skies"", is an example of the more scary side of the score.  The great thing is, the score definitely has the ""Arkham Knight feel"" to it.  The music fits so well with the story and characters that you can't help but visualize this world the music helps to establish.  I haven't played the game yet but I've watched the demos online and it certainly is impressive.  My favorite track is 24, ""All Who Follow You"".  I don't know what is happening here in the game...but I like the theme treatment in this particular piece.This is another great score in the series and if you've been following along, you certainly won't be disappointed.  The score for this particular game does sound a bit darker than the others and you can defiantly tell that it isn't quite finished yet.  I assume that this release covers the music from the first half of the game and maybe Volume 2 will conclude the story?For those of you who like to have a physical copy of the score, Amazon offers a CDR of this release.  I have always been impressed with this program offered by Amazon and have bought a few of these in the past.  Typically, their ""pressings"" of the disc are really quite professional looking.  You'd never tell that it is a CDR burned on demand for you.  They come packaged looking like something you'd buy from a real record company.  However, recently Amazon seems to be getting a little slack in this department and are cutting some corners on how these CDR discs look.  In the past, you'd have a picture stamped on the disc, a back cover with the track listing on it, and better organization of the liner notes etc.  The last two CDRs that I have purchased (San Andreas & Arkham Knight) share the same problems.  You still get a CD insert on the glossy paper, photos from the game (or movie), but no picture on the disc and the back cover on the CD case is basically blank.  The track listing is done in a weird way too.  The track listing begins on page 2 and because there isn't enough room to put the last track on...they insert it on page 7 by itself.  If they continue to look like this, I'll just burn the things myself.  All of my Batman video game scores are CDRs and this one by far is the cheapest looking one.  I just always liked owning physical copies of CDs and I was always impressed with Amazon's packaging of these.  Just wanted to throw those thoughts out there for those of you who have bought these in the past as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18H4DB09GYYBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZXF9PHG#wasThisHelpful","R18H4DB09GYYBW","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for some traditional Bluegrass/Folk music lately and I came upon this particular collection by Craig Duncan.  The album is all instrumental and that was the primary draw for me here.  It's hard to find versions of these songs that uses the traditional instrumentation.  I've sampled a lot of them and many of the ones that I listened to are done by just brass bands.  I wanted to hear these songs performed with the fiddles and banjos that are typically associated with them.Craig Duncan has over 90 albums that range from Polkas, Bluegrass, Folk, and even Celtic music.  He has even done Bluegrass versions of Beatles songs!  He primarily produces music CDs for the gift shop market but also performs with his various musical groups in a wide array of events and galas.  He has a website where you can even book him for weddings!  Duncan is a very accomplished musician and on this particular recording he is credited with playing the Hammered Dulcimer and Fiddles.  He is accompanied by 7 other musicians who play various banjos, guitars, bass, and whistles.  There are 15 tracks here and the running time on the CD is about 45 minutes.  A four page insert is included that contains music credits and additional information concerning other albums by Duncan.The CD sounds great and the music/songs here are some very popular selections from the period.  ""Dixie"", ""Bonnie, Blue Flag"", and ""Lorena"" are all here and played by some great musicians that Duncan has assembled.  The only issue I have with this particular recording is that the songs sound a bit too pretty.  It's as if I where listening to some professional musicians in a concert hall.  Yeah...they are using the traditional instruments of the period but it is missing a bit of the passion behind the music.  I did stumble across another group of musicians who seem to capture that passion that I am speaking of.  The 2nd South Carolina String Band has a few albums with traditional folk music of this period and they sound great.  There is singing in these versions but they are wonderful and really have that ""knee slapping"" vibe to them.  I would say that Duncan's album is more relaxed and has a bit more of a ""sophisticated"" approach to these songs.  My favorite from Duncan's album is the last track entitled ""Shiloh Hill"".  It's a great tune and wonderfully done.  Be sure to check out 2nd South Carolina Band too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376E9GQQGUAYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO7HN4A#wasThisHelpful","R376E9GQQGUAYD","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The other day I was digging through a stack of old vinyl records that I had picked up from a yard sale and found a box set that contained four records and it was entitled ""Great Movie Themes Vol. 1"".  It was released by London ""Phase 4"" records and upon listening to it I was really memorized by some of the old classic scores that it contained.  Among them were selections of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""The Big Country"", and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".  The latter selection was one that I found myself repeating the most.  Now, I've heard ""Moon River"" before but it certainly has been a long time.  I remember watching the movie on VHS tape years ago and loved the moment when Audrey Hepburn sang the tune.  I decided to finally get a copy of the score and was delighted to see that Intrada Records had released a version.  I'd seen the RCA version in used stores and bargain bins for years but never picked it up.  I'm glad I waited.  I've been collecting and listening to soundtrack scores for a long time and I've always been very fond of the Intrada Records label because of their dedication in bringing complete and previously unreleased scores to fans of the genre.The original RCA recording is approximately 30 minutes and it doesn't even contain Hepburn's vocal of ""Moon River"".  This Intrada Records release contains this and gives you the entire musical score from the film.  Other later releases for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" boasted that they had the complete score...but not so.  This particular release contains 1 hour and 19 minutes of music and much of it has never been released before.  This particular version contains the complete ""Where's the Cat"" cue which according to the liner notes by Douglass Fake is the ""most stirring orchestral crescendos and codas in all film music"".  It's pretty powerful indeed.  Remember the scene at near the end of the movie when Hepburn tosses her pet cab out of the taxi and into the rain?  Peppard (Paul) goes out to get the cat and Hepburn (Holly) runs after him.  They find the cat and Hepburn/Peppard embrace (with cat in-between them) and the music explodes with a chorus and big orchestral version of ""Moon River"".  It's here on this release!There is a 24 page insert that gives a lot of historical info about the film and the music.  The two contributors in the liner notes are Douglass Fake and Jeff Bond (author of ""Danse Macabre: 25 Years of Danny Elfman & Tim Burton"").  Both authors provide a wealth of information concerning the movie, score, and Mancini's process for developing the music.  There are plenty of pictures from the movie and publicity photos in the insert as well.  The folks at Intrada have even gone out of their way to include the piano practice pieces that you hear in the background scene where Holly's neighbors ""contribute to the overall ambience of sophisticated apartment life"" (pg. 20, Douglass Fake).It's a great release and Mancini's music sounds wonderful on the CD.  The producers of the CD have really done a great job in bringing to you the best audio possible.  Mancini's music on the score is both fun, comical and even serious.  It's a great party CD and would provide some wonderful ""Cha Cha"" dancing music to entertain with.  I'm just enthralled with the ""Moon River"" melody and love to hear how Mancini tinkers with it throughout the score.  Very impressed with this release and I applaud Intrada again!  Now...that melody from ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was a great one too.  I guess that is what I am on the hunt for next.  I've heard that maybe Varese Sarabande might have a good recording of that one....hmmmm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DMTA8SK8C96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWRDSAE#wasThisHelpful","R23DMTA8SK8C96","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie sure has been getting a beating!  I'd never heard of it until I was checking out whats new for ""New Release Tuesday"".  Pickings were slim for this week and this seemed to be the only promising movie so I went with it and really enjoyed it.  Yeah, it has it's slow moments and I agree that we have seen this story in various iterations before...but it was still fun to watch.  While watching the movie, the score grabbed my attention and I thought that it really fit the film well.  I don't specifically try to pay attention to a film score when I am watching a movie nor do I try to purchase every soundtrack for every film that I watch.  If there are particular moments in the film where the score really starts to stand out to me, I will usually investigate further by sampling tracks and reading reviews.  I was disappointed to see that this score was only being released digitally because I prefer to buy physical CDs instead...but I liked it enough to download it and make my own backup copy.Martin Tillman & Satnam Ramgotra are part of the Hans Zimmer empire known as Remote Control Productions.  Zimmer has amassed quite the collection of very talented composers, arrangers, conductors, and musicians.  Tillman and Ramgotra team up to bring us the music for a tale of revenge and while it isn't as good or as thematic as Hans Zimmer's ""King Arthur"", it still manages to be a worthy listen.  There is a theme here in the music and that is what originally caught my attention when watching the film.  It is ever so slight, only consisting of a few notes, and it's simplicity is what makes it stand out so powerfully within the context of the movie.  You can hear it in the opening track entitled ""Eviction"".  You'll hear variations of it pop in and out on tracks like ""Advantage"", ""Last Knights"" and ""Capital"".  The score is a mix of musical drone, drums, drone and drums, melodic pieces, and haunting vocal tracks featuring Natacha Atlas.  The drone pieces can be the least interesting  but do a great job of building tension in the movie.  Pieces like ""Construction"" and ""Traitor"" are examples of these.  They tend to provide a more ambient effect and can be pretty relaxing to listen to on their own however.  There are times when the score shifts in some really cool percussion movements like track 4 (""Battle"") and track 9 (""Castle"").  I think my favorite tracks are those that feature the mesmerizing vocals of Natacha Atlas.  At times they are soothing and others just hauntingly beautiful.  The composers were smart to use her on a number of pieces throughout the score.  She provides her voice on 7 tracks and each one is great.The score isn't a loud action noise romp and it certainly isn't a thematic epic.  At times it is a menacing growl where the thought of revenge boils deep in the characters.  It also has moments where a slight theme develops showing that heroism hasn't been defeated and the vocals of Natacha Atlas reminds us of the pain throughout it all.  I think it's a good score and worthy of my purchase...even if I did have to get it digitally.  The digital download gives you 18 tracks for a total running time of 1 hour and 4 minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKYE0ATPZBKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3PPQIG#wasThisHelpful","RQKYE0ATPZBKF","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a rather traumatic movie experience as a child courtesy of Old Yellar, Where the Red Fern Grows, and Bambi...I've made it a rule to never watch movies that have animals as the main stars.  That doesn't mean that I won't enjoy the music that comes from these films however!  It's been a while since I've purchased a score for an ""animal movie"".  I think the last one was ""War Horse"" by John Williams.  I won't go see this film, but I do like the premise behind it.  The training that these service dogs go through and their dedication/loyalty to their handlers is something indeed worthy of showcasing in a film.  I did happen to watch the film's trailer and the stand out scene from that was the dog (Max) attending the funeral of his handler who I assume was killed in action.  What a powerful scene indeed.  Seeing this scene and the rest of the trailer got me curious to listen to the soundtrack.Movies that star animals are designed to elicit a very strong emotional response from audiences.  Animals like dogs, cats, dolphins and horses usually have the biggest emotional impact on viewers.  Unfortunately for me, these films are such an emotional roller coaster ride!  You'll be bursting in tears one minute and laughing/crying the next.  I just can't take it.  Movies of this nature require scores that are just as equally powerful as the stories they are trying to tell.  I think that is why I am at least a fan of the music for these films.Travor Rabin takes the helm to bring this particular stories music to us.  Rabin's past work includes ""I Am Number Four"", ""National Treasure"", and ""The Great Raid"".  I really enjoyed his work with ""The Great Raid"" and have been anxiously waiting to hear what he has in store for us with this movie.  When the CD arrived, the first thing I noticed was the release's short length.  There are 17 tracks on the album and the total running time is about 38 minutes.  This was a big disappointment because from past experiences with short releases such as this, they are usually over before they have any real time to develop.  One particular cue that I really like is entitled ""Bike Toss"" (track 4).  It's only 42 seconds long and right when it appears to be going somewhere it abruptly ends.  I'm not sure if this is the actual cut that was used in the film or if this is an edited version for an album release.  This is something that happens quite often when movie scores are released.  They are altered and sometimes hacked up pretty bad.  Not sure if this is what is happening here.The good news is that there is still some great music to enjoy here...even if the entire running time is only 38 minutes.  The stand out scene from the movie trailer where Max attends the funeral naturally gets its own music entitled ""Max Rushes Coffin"" (track 2).  It's short length will make you want more but Rabin's very solemn and soft approach to this scene will definitely squeeze the tears out of the audience for sure.  Other cues for the score are more peppy and adventurous.  One in particular is ""Bike Ride"" (track 5).  It sounds OK but it tends to remind me of something like a main title for a syndicated TV show.  As I mentioned earlier, movies like this are real emotional roller coaster rides and Rabin's score reflects this.  Moving from sentimental, adventurous, and dark within a short amount of time.  Some tracks like ""Realist or Hero"" use a echoey guitar effect like that which can be found in the movies ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Friday Night Lights"" by Explosions in the Sky.  I've noticed a trend to use this guitar effect in a lot of war/battle/fight movies.  Danny Elfman's ""The Kingdom"" is another example.  Two highlight tracks from the score are ""Epilogue"" (track 16) and ""Max's Suite"" (track 17).  You'll find all of the major themes created by Rabin here.  They are put together nicely and really capture the musical essence of the movie.""Fireworks Display"" (Track 6) is another fine piece that is beautifully put together by Rabin.  The first half of this piece plays with the main theme softly and it slowly moves into something a bit darker and sad.  The instrumentation for the ""darker"" section of this piece uses a trumpet to signify a flashback of war effect.  It's well done and plenty powerful for such a scene in the movie.The physical CD itself comes with an 8 page insert that contains pictures from the film, track listing, and orchestra credits.  The CD is released through Sony Classical.  I wish the released score could have been longer.  It has some great music here and it seems over too quickly.  I won't have any problem listening to these however and enjoying them for what they are.  It is a spirited score that contains a great theme, adventurous music, and stirring sentimental moments.  Fans of the movie will no doubt enjoy listening to this and reliving their time with Max or letting their imaginations create their own adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPA2BEPVMD8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU2KUQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CPA2BEPVMD8E","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joesph Bishara's work has always been very unique and intriguing to me.  Hearing his score for the first Insidious movie made me an instant fan largely because of his technique in delivering something different for audiences.  His film scores are very unique indeed and probably not the type of music that you are going to sit down and relax to or play in the background while reading a book (unless it's a horror story).  I usually like to take my film music to work with me and to play in the background while I'm working.  I probably won't be taking this one!  I would hate to see the effect it has on my co-workers!  So what good is music like this outside of watching the movie?  As I listen to it, I can imagine that a writer or artist (of the horror genre) would be inspired by this as they create something from their own imaginations.  I listen to it mostly to appreciate the artistry and technique that went into creating it.  I also like to use certain selections of Bishara's music when creating my ""haunted front porch"" every halloween.  Fans of the Insidious movies will love this music because they can take with them probably one of biggest contributors of their horror experience...the music itself.Hearing Bishara's music from the first Insidious movie made me want to investigate more of this composer's work.  I have enjoyed his work from all of the Insidious films, as well as, ""Dark Skies"", ""The Conjuring"", and ""11-11-11"".  There is no doubt that his expertise is with the horror genre and I am looking forward to hearing his up coming project, ""The Vatican Tapes"".Bishara continues with his experimental soundscape and again impresses with ""Insidious: Chapter 3"".  I have given this particular score the nickname ""Boom Soundtrack"" because of Bishara's very frequent use of surprise moments within the score.  He has done it with his other work, but the frequency seems to be intensified here.  When listening to this score, I would often turn the volume up really loud to hear the almost inaudible things that Bishara is doing in the background within the music.  As I was listening intensely to what was going on in the quiet depths of underscoring, I was often blown back to the other side of the room with the surprise ""booms"" that would occur unexpectedly.  There are a lot of moments like this within the score.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but there is bound to be surprises a plenty throughout the story.What makes Bishara's music so unique is the very unconventional style he uses to submerse the audience in fear.  It's part ambient, electronic, and orchestral.  He uses instrumentation that is very bizarre and quiet frightening to listen to.  Weird sounding violins, random noises, and other things that can be quiet difficult to describe.  The most memorable past composers of the horror genre developed a sound of their own and Bishara has definitely achieved one that distinctly belongs to him.  He may have gained inspiration from ambient artist like Robert Rich but he has pushed further into a musical formula that cooks up the best results for subliminal fear.  Track 17, ""Facing Breathing"", is a highlight track where Bishara seems to take anything that makes sound and throws it together to create chaotic horror.  It's like dragging your nails across a chalkboard and watching everyone squirm.  He also tampers with creating some very nice breathers for the audience like tracks 3 (Tell of Presence) and track 8 (Questions Left Behind).  These begin to show a more melodic, sentimental, and almost relaxing side of Bishara's work.  He doesn't stay there long however.  Once you begin to relax with ""Questions Left Behind"" it slowly starts to drift into creepy land again.  Bishara closes this score out with a chilling cue entitled, ""Void Figure 7 Ch 3"".  I gave it a nickname too.  I call it, ""Violin lesson for the insane"".It will be interesting to see how Joesph Bishara develops as an artist in future projects.  I am always interesting in listening to his work and I have always enjoyed appreciating his skills as an artist with this particular style of music.  Fans of the Insidious movies will love to have this latest chapter of music from Bishara.I waited several weeks to obtain the physical copy of the music.  I'm not sure why it takes so long...but it was worth it because I wanted to add it to the rest of my Bishara collection.  The CD comes packaged like many of Bishara's other releases.  A tri-fold cardboard case that has a sleeve to hold the CD.  The art work from the cover continues throughout the packaging and there is a song list and credits on the CD sleeve.  The CD contains 22 tracks and the total running time for the album is 43 minutes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKDDMJYLAJW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJVLO3E#wasThisHelpful","R1XKDDMJYLAJW4","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While preparing for summer traveling, I thought it might be a good idea to get a good gun safe for the car.  I picked this one up at Cabela's but currently Amazon has it for $10 cheaper.  Anyway, I must say that the safe feels pretty robust and the ""TriPoint"" mechanism works great too.  The safe is large enough to accommodate my Colt 1911 45 and a spare clip.  The key works perfectly and turns smoothly in the keyhole.The only fault I can find with the safe is that the security cable doesn't look like much and the washer lug that is on the cable is much too big for the loop to go through (or maybe the cable openings are too small).  There was no way that it was going to go through the loop end of the cable.  I tried a vice and pliers.  So, time for some modifications!  I took my rotary tool and gave the washer a shave and now it works just fine.  I think Hornady spent to much time making a ""super washer"" and not a better cable.  I've included a picture to show what I did...so be prepared to do same thing.  One more thing that I suggest, when you open the box, mine had a small square piece of black foam (like that on the inside of the safe) that keeps the safe from bouncing around inside of the packaging box.  Keep that piece of foam!  When I shut my safe with the 45 and the extra clip, I noticed that the clip likes to slide around a little inside.  I certainly don't want any extra scratches on my gun.  Taking that extra square piece and placing it over the clip solves that problem and keeps it from moving around.Overall, despite having to do some modifications, I am pretty pleased with the safe.  It certainly isn't a match for some pliers/bolt cutters...but lets just hope the bad guys are not carrying around tool bags with them.  More importantly, it will keep the kids away,  protect the gun while traveling, and appease some states concealed carry laws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R022O4IZ18TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVFD4DI#wasThisHelpful","R3R022O4IZ18TD","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intrada Records works their magic again to bring us a score that has been on my ""most wanted list"" since 1995.  Alan Silvestri's score for Judge Dredd was truly impressive and I was so disappointed with the initial Epic Records release when the movie came out.  It was 40 minutes of score music but I felt that they had left so much out.  This version release by Intrada, however, is the complete actual score with plenty of extras.Alan Silvestri's score for the film is outstanding.  He uses a big orchestra, choir, and has some really cool percussion work in the music.  The Judge Dredd theme and the march like percussion bits are some of the most memorable to me as I was watching the film.  The film itself was OK but there is no question that this music by Silvestri is pretty epic.  He does a great job of mixing heroic action adventure, science fiction grandeur, military marches, and emotional elements all in one.  I know this is the recipe for a lot of movies these days but Silvestir's score really adds the flavor here.  Silvestri's ""Predator"" score and this one are probably my two favorite in this genre by him.The Intrada release was supposed to be out in May 2015 but shipments were stopped due to an error in putting this together.  Apparently the Jerry Goldsmith trailer music on Disc 1 turned out to be a re-recording conducted by Joel McNeely, and not the original version.  Well, you got to hand it to Intrada for getting things done right.  The release was halted while new copies with the corrected track could be placed.  I believe some of the ""incorrect"" versions were shipped out and those lucky enough to have them probably have a nice collectable on their hands.This particular release comes with two discs which total 2 hours and 20 minutes of music.  Disc 1 contains the complete version of the score and ends with the original trailer music which was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith.  Disc 2 contains all of the alternate takes, and the score from the original 1995 Epic Records release.  You also get a 28 page book that contains tons of info about the film, scoring process, and the recording for this release.  Did you know that the original Epic Records release contains 40 minutes of music that went unused in the original film?  The nearly 70 minutes of music on disc 1 is the actual music (in order) that was used in the film.  Also, David Arnold was the director's first choice for the music since they had collaborated together on other projects.  The producers felt that Arnold was too young and untested for the job.  Jerry Goldsmith was then approached but could not do it because of other obligations.  Goldsmith did agree to write the trailer music however and this was released some 4 months before the films' actual release on June 30, 1995.  The 28 page CD insert has a lot of info like this and more.  Intrada records does a fabulous job of bringing film scores like this to fans.  As of now, this title isn't available on Amazon but I expect it to be soon...unless Intrada sells out of them!It's a great Alan Silvestri score and one that I can finally enjoy in it's entirety for the first time.  I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJFMGECGQIYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIRMKS2#wasThisHelpful","RTJFMGECGQIYG","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never had the opportunity to see this movie but I can remember as a kid having the movie version picture book and being fascinated by the story and the look of these characters.  I've had the DVD version of this movie sitting in my Amazon wish list for some time now but I've been waiting for the Blu-Ray version to go down in price.  The soundtrack has eluded me for years as well and it's nice to see that Intrada Records has finally released the most complete version of this score by David Shire to date.  Your going to pay a premium a price for this collector's CD but considering the extras, it is indeed worth it.I'd never heard of David Shire before obtaining this soundtrack.  He has primarily worked on TV shows and only a handful of feature films.  He did the original music for ""2010"" and ""Zodiac"".  He also composed music for ""Saturday Night Fever"" and was nominated for a few Grammy Awards. After listening to the outstanding music from ""Return to Oz"", one might be curious to know why Shire was not offered other feature film projects.  In the liner notes for ""Return to Oz"", it's stated that ""Because of the ill fate suffered by the film, Shire's masterpiece failed to stimulate the global recognition and blockbuster projects he richly deserved"" (pg. 21).  It goes on to say that this was the first time Shire was offered such a project and he thought that it would lead to other films as well.  But unfortunately this wasn't the case.  It's a shame because the music, which I am enjoying for the first time, is just outstanding.  As a kid, I could only see the pictures from the film in a book.  Hearing the music that belongs to these characters and their story for the first time is really cool.  The entire score is very thematic indeed.  I think there is something in the neighborhood of nine different themes here.  Each one represents different characters and they really give the magic of life to their personalities.  The music can simply be described as everything you'd expect for a fantasy adventure.  Intrada Records does a fabulous job of sequencing the cues together and in the order you'd hear them in the story.  The music is so good that it essentially tells the story on it's own.Intrada has packaged this together really nicely and your getting a lot here.  There are two CDs with disc one containing the most complete version of the score which includes all the stuff that other versions never did.  Disc one runs a total of 74:35.  Disc two contains alternate takes, revised versions, and the complete 1985 release version.  Disc two runs 76:54.  The CD insert is a 28 page book that contains pictures from the film and a wealth of historical information concerning the film, director, and composer.  With 2 hours and 32 minutes of music and a wonderful 28 page insert, this is a great soundtrack for fans and collectors alike.  It's easy to see why this is considered to be David Shire's masterpiece because it most certainly is a great score for all to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOT5IAMX36BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIR0G6A#wasThisHelpful","RFOT5IAMX36BJ","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5 year old son loves finding creepy crawlies so I decided to get this for him this summer.  I was lucky to find it on Amazon's ""Deal of the Day"" for a great price so that was a bonus as well.  The bucket itself seems to made pretty well, but I'd be careful with it over concrete.  A good drop would probably crack the clear plastic for sure.  The main lid of the bucket and the latch are nicely done and can be easily opened and closed by my son.  It has an adjustable strap for easy carrying as well.  I was reading the reviews concerning the magnifying lid portion of the bucket and how it doesn't stay closed or breaks off easily.  Upon inspecting this myself, I would probably agree with everyone else that this is probably the bucket's main weakness.  I've decided to leave the little ""Look Inside"" sticker on it because it helps to secure the mag lid down.  If my 5 year old decides to pull it off, I could easily replace it with some clear tape.  The magnifying glass on top is really cool because it really does work.  Unlike some other cheap plastic magnifying glasses that barely ""magnify"", this particular one really does a decent job of making objects larger.  The top of the bucket has small holes to let air inside as well.  Very small insects (ants) could easily get out I suppose, so I wouldn't suggest trying to make this a ""habitat"" for captured specimens.  This is more of a temporary catch and release philosophy here.There are a lot of possibilities with this bucket.  You can collect just about anything and observe it more closely.  Tadpoles in water, rocks, leaves, and insects.  My son should have a lot of fun with this over the summer and it should offer plenty of educational opportunities too.  Let's just hope he doesn't pick up any fire ants and poison ivy!  I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW0D84N9QTWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KTKXAU#wasThisHelpful","REW0D84N9QTWL","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first soundtrack by composer Cody Westheimer.  My brought my attention to this particular soundtrack was the theme of space.  I love ""space"" scores and music like this is great to kick back, close your eyes and dream of exploring the unknown.  This soundtrack was in my Amazon recommendations list and after sampling a few tracks, I decided to give it a try.In doing some research about the composer, he primarily has been working on short films and documentaries.  He will be doing a full feature film this year, ""Iron Will"".  Now, this particular score is for the documentary that was put together by NASA which showcases future deep space exploration programs.  It was an IMAX film presented in 2015 but unfortunately I wasn't able to see it.  It was narrated by Patrick Stewart and received generally good reviews.  The film was only 45 minutes long and the score presented here is 23 tracks with a total runtime of 36 minutes.  So, it is a short score and unfortunately some of the pieces seem to be over before they even have time to develop.  You have to remember however, that this is a score for a documentary and not a full length feature film.  It would of been cool if Westheimer could have developed some of these cues a little longer for a more substantial album release.Another interesting thing to note is that the individual cues themselves can have a lot of variation in them and the score as a whole does not have the consistency of a feature film.  The first 6 tracks are very traditional sounding with full orchestration, for example, and then other more electronic sounds are introduced later in other cues.  Track 7, ""Space Science"", is supported with electronic percussion and guitars.  Another example is track 15, ""How to Build a Spacesuit"", which has a funky groove beat going on.  They seem a bit out of place when listening to this score as a whole but they are enjoyable to listen to nonetheless.Some of the standout pieces for me were:An Eye on the CosmosExtended WeightlessnessMars in my BackyardThe Exploring KindRed Planet ArrivalTwo tracks worth mentioning are Westheimer's arrangements of Holst's ""Mars"" (Track 12) and Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" (Track 23).  Track 23 might be more of an outtake because of it's slight comical ending and the fact that you hearing people talking and laughing at the end.  The two pieces are arranged after some very popular space classical tunes and are very fitting for a documentary score.These are some of the more developed tracks that really can capture the wonder of space.  Overall, it's a great documentary score and fun to listen to.  The short length and inconsistent variation might turn some others away.  I've organized the score a little differently into a play list and plan to take it with me on my next camping trip.  There are some great star gazing tracks here and laying in a hammock with the headphones on listening to this will be an enjoyable experience.The CD comes with a four paneled insert that contains a blurb concerning the possibility of future space travel and a note from the director/writer of the film, Mark Krenzien.  The CD is produced by Phineas Atwood productions and Lake Shore Records.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KQPZJ8769IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8GAVFK#wasThisHelpful","R21KQPZJ8769IY","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We certainly have a fascination with disaster films.  From towering infernos to world wide climate change, we just can't seem to get enough.  Some of these films are better than others and they usually make a pretty decent profit in theaters.  Hollywood continues to push them out and many gladly pay to see them.  We've seen the story before so what is the big draw to see them?  It's probably because they are just fun to watch!  Also, disaster films seduce us with the incredible special effects and you have to admit that Hollywood is getting better with this all the time.  Yes, it's the same story with even better realism.  Now, within those really cool effects we've got to have a story somewhere and with that your going need to support it with music.  Hollywood can spend a lot of money on the effects but the only way to make them ""special"" and truly stand out is with a soundtrack to make them even more emotionally incredible.Looking through my collection of movie scores, I've noticed that the music for these films can be a mixed bag sometimes.  Some reflect the musical tastes of the time in which they were created while others tend to be gigantic filler music pumped with a large brass section of the orchestra.  There are a few that take the interesting approach of having the music take on the characteristic of the impending doom like that of Laurence Rosenthal's ""Meteor"" score.  This particular score, composed by Andrew Lockington, is very similar to what Harald Kloser did for ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012"".  It's a pretty big sound throughout the score that blends a lot of action noise with an occasional developed theme.  I'm leaning towards Lockington's score here however because when the theme comes, it's a pretty good one.  I also enjoy his scoring of the more emotional moments in the movie and instead of rushing through these scenes with only a steady hum of the violins, he puts up an effort to give some really heartfelt moments.  Tracks 12 (Remembering Mallory) and part of 13 (Coit Tower Destroyed)  are example's of this.  There are some really great action themes in the score as well that I am sure do a good job of reflecting some big moments in the movie.  One of my favorites in this score is the very epic sounding ""Skydive"" (track 14).  It's a short cue but a very cool one.  As a matter of fact, the shortest tracks are some of the best in my opinion.  I guess it's because some of the longer ones tend to get a little exhausting to listen to because of the intensity they sometimes reach.  I am sure this has a different feel when watching in context with the movie however.  They can be enjoyed and appreciated on there own but I find myself developing playlist of the shorter cues.  Some of my favorites are ""San Francisco"" (6), ""Main Title"" (1), ""Skydive"" (14), ""Extinction"" (18), and ""I Love You Dad"" (21).  Another cue deserving a mention is number 22, ""Resuscitation"", it's a great combo of theme, action, and emotion that is put together especially well and very fitting for what is probably a big climatic moment at the end of the movie.There are some other interesting facts about this particular score that can be found in the CD's liner notes.  One is that Lockington used seismic wave data from the San Andreas fault and turned it into music.  I just wish there was more of an explanation of this, in the liner notes, and how it was used in specific tracks.  I do appreciate Lockington's desire to create this score in a unique way by using the ""music of an earthquake"".  I just wish this could of been explored more to give this particular music an even more interesting sound.  To me, the score tends to nestle a little too close with the other disaster scores of recent times and doesn't find a way to ""break away"".  By no means does it make it a bad score for the movie, in fact, it's a good score with some awesome moments.  I encourage film music fans to hear for themselves.  One track in particular is really shaking things up and that is Sia's rendition of California Dreamin'.  It's a great song for the film and the interpretation fit's very well.  Oddly, she isn't even mentioned in the credits of the CD insert.I like to own physical CDs so I was upset to see that this was a digital release and the only way to get a physical copy was to go through the CDR route with Amazon.  I've purchased other CDRs from Amazon before and I've always been impressed with their packaging of these.  They include picture discs, liner notes, and everything you'd expect with the ""look"" of a store bought CD.  They sound great and they've been pretty nice to purchase.  This particular CDR was a little more expensive than their other previous offerings however and I was disappointed to see that they skimped a little with this particular package.  They've included some pictures from the movie and recording sessions and there is a note from the composer which is cool but they only have the track listing on the inside of the CD.  The back cover of the CD has nothing.  The listed credits are incomplete and the total package seems a bit plain to me.  It's still a bit better than what I could of done with my CD burner and printer however.The score has a total of 24 tracks and runs about 1 hour and 13 minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBAUJ6UVE7XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKDADH4#wasThisHelpful","R2UBAUJ6UVE7XV","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this battery to replace my Midlands which will no longer hold a charge. I have the GXT series and we mainly use them on camping trips. Well, the summer is here and camping trips are fast approaching so it's off to Amazon to find some replacements. There certainly are a lot of options here on Amazon for these batteries (and most batteries in general) and I was originally going to just buy some more made by Midland. These are higher priced however and the reviews for them are terrible. I was glad to see that there were some others that were offered at a fraction of the cost but after reading reviews for several different ones it seems that purchasing any of these ""cheaper"" batteries is really hit or miss. Well, I took the gamble and decided to go for these.The first thing that I noticed however after inspecting these batteries is that they are not made by Hitech and they are not 800mAh. I had noticed that some of the other more recent reviews had stated this as well but assumed that it had just been a shipping mistake. I wanted to go for the 800mAH batteries because of the battery life increase. The ""mAH"" stands for milli amp hours and moving from a 700 to 800 gives you about 14.29% more battery life. So, I was a little disappointed to see that these are not exactly what was advertised. I need some batteries however, and because of the great price, I just decided to stick with these. They charged up on my Midland charger just fine. Both lights stayed a steady red while charging and both batteries heated up indicating that they something was happening. I charged them for about 14 hours. It says to charge them for 16 hours but I had to leave for work and I didn't want these things sitting in the cradle all day and explode or catch on fire. I've had them for about 3 days and they are holding their charge well. I've been playing around with them around the house with my four year old and everything seems to be working ok so far.  The batteries have a Fenzer label and not Hitech and it is also important to note that they are not 800mAh.  They do work fine so far however and I will be sure to post updates if I encounter a problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10S3S0OVY1XK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DVOUHO#wasThisHelpful","R10S3S0OVY1XK6","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The movie trailers for Mad Max: Fury Road were incredibly intense and it looks like the movie is promising action packed insanity throughout.  A film like this will certainly need the octane boost of a powerful action score to keep it moving and Junkie XL is a great choice.  I have been enjoying other scores by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) such as ""Divergent"" and ""300: Rise of an Empire"" and it seems most fitting to have this composer move over the world of Mad Max.While I agree that sometimes soundtrack music doesn't always have to sound good on it's own and that every film score isn't a John William's fanfare, I do think that successful soundtrack music can evoke emotions and paint a picture all on it's own.  Believe me, there are some bad scores out there that absolutely go no where and are just noise and there are others that are so distracting that I can't even bare to watch the movie.  I certainly don't listen to movie scores hoping to hear the next Mozart symphony.  Give me some great music and I'll make my own movie while I daydream.  So what does Junkie XL give us?  An exciting score infused with action music that will set you onto an imaginary warpath into the apocalyptic future!  Just as an action movie needs explosions and stunts this score is filled with everything you'd expect.  Thumping drums, epic climatic music, orchestrated power ballads (so you can catch your breath), and futuristic electronic gizmo sounds to make it sound cool.  I love those electronic explosion sounds that you hear scattered throughout some of the pieces!The score opens with ""Survive"" and it's like a cover to a book.  It let's you know what's coming.  I dare you to turn this one up loud (like I did when I first popped this CD in) because as it moves into the next track, ""Escape"", it will scare the mess out of you.  I literally jumped...trust me.  There are plenty of great moments throughout and I enjoy listening to how Junkie XL tinkers with electronic and traditional instrumentation to achieve some really cool sounds.  The drum rhythms are marching, war like, and hard hitting throughout much of the score and there is plenty of variety to keep things interesting.  Things do slow down from time to time however.  You've gotta have those moments too in the action movies.  Track 16, ""My Name is Max"", is one such example.  It's a piece that hums along but never really gives me anything but a...piece that just hums along.  I liked tracks 12 (Redemption) and 13 (Many Mothers) better for the slower pieces.  As I said earlier, I like it when music gives me a picture and track 15 (Chapter Doof) does just that.  The last 2 minutes of this piece reminds me of a ""last warrior walking through the battlefield"" music.  Track 17, ""Let Them Up"", is really cool.  It's a great closing piece that is worthy of a hero riding off in the sunset in their four wheeled war machine.  My favorite track for the score would probably be number 10 (Brother's in Arms).  It's a really cool ""rally the troops and go to battle"" track that is just awesome.So, I'm probably not going to be sipping my cappuccino while watching the birds through the window eat out of the feeder with this playing in the background.  I'll save Mozart for that.  I'll let the ""theatre of the mind"" create it's own adventures with this one.  I'll enjoy and appreciate the artistry of Junkie XL.  Tom Holkenborg has done an outstanding job here.  Just be careful not to listen to this while driving.  This would not be safe music to play in a traffic jam!  I heard one reviewer of the film say that this was one of the most insane action movies ever made.  Well, I'll have to wait and see the film for myself to see if that is true.  I do know, however, that this score is a good fit for a movie of that description...and that is a good thing!I am a CD fan and it certainly isn't fun having the mp3 world get the better deal here.  The CD contains 17 tracks and 1 hour and 11 minutes of music.  The digital version has 26 tracks with extended versions and bonus tracks.  Most people are probably going to opt for the digital version and I don't really blame them.  Unfortunately this seems to be a growing trend that I have noticed more and more lately with CDs and digital music.  The CD has an 8 panel insert that contains a photo from the film and 3 lobby card like photos of 3 different characters (one being Mad Max of course).  There are also credits to the orchestra and others involved with the making of the score.  The CD is produced by WaterTower music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X19SMAF1SJER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UART6C6#wasThisHelpful","R1X19SMAF1SJER","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't played Bloodborne and I don't even own an Xbox One or PS4 yet.  I am still enjoying all of the games that the older systems still offer.  I do like soundtracks however and the music used to support the action/story in video games can be equivalent to or even better than some blockbuster movies.  Some of my most treasured and listened to scores come from video games and when big titles come out I am always there to check out the music.  Bloodborne has certainly been met with a lot anticipation from the video game world.  I am not sure if the game has meet those expectations but the score is definitely a big hit with me.The score was composed by in house artist from the company who developed the game, ""From Software"".  They are Tsukas Saitoh, Yuka kitamura, and Nobuyoshi Suzaki.  Cris Velasco also worked on the score but unfortunately his work is not included on the CD release.  There are also two guest composers who worked on the score and they are Ryan Amon and Michael Wandmacher.  There is a digital release that can be found on iTunes that includes Cris Velasco's contributions, as well as, other tracks by Amon and Wandmacher that were not released on this CD.  I think there is a total of four extra songs on the digital version but you'll have to pay for it.  The digital release is priced quite high for these additional songs and the Amazon CD release is a lot cheaper.  The missing songs are:  ""Terror"" (Cris Velasco), Amygdala (Cris Velasco), ""of the Pthumerian Line"" (Michael Wandmacher), and ""Lullaby for Mergo"" (Ryan Amon).  The composers that I am most familiar with on this project are Ryan Amon and Michael Wandmacher.  Ryan Amon composed the music for the film ""Elysium"" and did an outstanding job for that movie.  Michael Wandmacher did the music for ""Piranha 3D"" and ""Punisher"".  The ""Punisher"" soundtrack is just awesome and it still is one of my most played soundtracks.What brought my attention to this particular video game score was sampling the first track entitled, ""Omen"".  This track is a great introduction to the score and pretty much establishes the tone for the entire work as a whole.  What amazes me is that while you have so many different artist working on the same score, they have managed to remain consistent throughout the entire thing.  There are no major stylist differences that sound out of place.  You'd never know it was put together by so many.  The tone and style of the score is very epic horror.  It is a big sound filled with a real orchestra and choir.  The orchestra, in fact, is a 65 piece ensemble with a 32 piece choir.  I did an internet search to learn more about these talented musicians/vocalist and found a really cool video of a recording session.  Check out the bald guy in the white t-shirt rocking out with that cello!  He is definitely getting into the music and it's easy to hear why.  The soundtrack is amazing.  It's incredibly big and lumbers at times like a giant smashing through the woods.  It also becomes quite spiritual (in a creepy way) at times and featured vocalist, Melissa Reese, does a great job singing melodies that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Tracks like ""Cleric Beast"" by Tsukasa Saitoh remind me of a classic requiem infused with horror while others like ""Moonlight Melody"" by Ryan Amon are hauntingly beautiful and yet sad.  It's a great score to listen to but don't expect too many slow reflective moments.  It's all about action of the horror kind and this haunted house score on steroids isn't going to let you close your eyes for long.The score is 1 hour and 12 minutes and contains 21 tracks.  The CD insert is a six paneled trifold that contains information about the artist, song list, and two pictures from the game.  I wish it had included more art work and a list of the musicians/vocalist.  The vocalist are listed as ""Metro Voices"" but there isn't any title for the orchestra.It's a great soundtrack with some powerhouse horror moments captured here for you to enjoy.  The composers have certainly done an excellent job at collaborating together on this project and I highly recommend this fantastic music!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZC3KWGKT6ABT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFHWFDM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZC3KWGKT6ABT","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been quite some time since I've seen this movie.  I was five years old when the movie came out but I remember watching it on TV with my father some years later.  We might of owned a VHS copy of it too.  The film looks great in this Blu-ray release and it is definitely the cleanest version I've ever seen.  I'm no Convoy movie expert, but it appears to be an unedited version as well.  I've read some reviews where people complain that certain scenes are missing from earlier versions (such as the DVD release) and I was looking for those particular scenes and they are in this release.  The movie runs 110 minutes while some of the other releases only ran for 106 minutes.The movie, as stated before, certainly looks nice on my HDTV and the sound quality is great too.  The film isn't perfect looking and it still shows some age in certain scenes but I personally haven't seen anything better when I compare it to the TV and VHS versions that I've watched before.  It was great watching it again and brings me back to the days of being a kid and watching Smokey and the Bandit, Dukes of Hazzard, and Cannonball Run.  As a kid, Convoy (and movies like it) was just comic cool silliness with big trucks (or fast cars) ""taking it to the man"".  Watching it now, I even see an attempt at some sort of heroic message here but the real draw to the film is basically a western using big rigs.  The soundtrack for the movie is just great and I can remember just loving (and singing) the original Convoy song which was the inspiration for the film.  It great fun to see this picture again and it brings back some great memories.This release comes with some great special features too.  The 73 minute documentary entitled ""Passion & Poetry - Sam's Trucker Movie"" is really interesting.  It goes through all of the trials and tribulations all involved went through during the production.  The actors, producers, and techies speak about director Sam Peckinpah's downfall with cocaine and all of the problems it caused during the production.  It's amazing that the film was ever even released.  The documentary shows the eventual success of the film not only in the US but around the world.  They even show a guy in Germany who was so obsessed with the film that he had a replica of Duck's truck made for himself!  The movie turned out to be very profitable but unfortunately marked the end of Sam Peckinpah's career.  It's a great documentary and fans of the film will surely find it very interesting.  Another 3 minute featurette entitled ""Trucker Notes From Norway"" has a fan (from Norway) give us a history of the truck(s) used in the film.  This movie sure has a big following overseas!  The 5 minute feature entitled ""Injokes, Friends & Cameos"" was especially interesting because it contains some great ""fun facts"" that I didn't know about.  I didn't know that Sam Peckinpah was in the film.  You can see him riding in the back of the truck with the TV guy interviewing ""The Duck"".  Also, the names of the companies on the trucks are little salutes to the actor's (driving the trucks) previous roles in other films.  Some of you Convoy fans probably knew all of this but I sure didn't.  There are three deleted scenes, but we can only see production stills and images of the script for these because the original footage was destroyed.  The special features are really great and I enjoyed watching all of these after viewing the film.Kino Lorber has done a great job putting this together.  The movie looks great and the special features are awesome.  Convoy fans should pick this one up for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OMQAG2EALA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZLEL2Y#wasThisHelpful","R27OMQAG2EALA8","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5 year old son has been wanting a Batman cape and trying to find them around at the local stores has proved to be very difficult.  Amazon Prime is here to save the day!  The only problem is that there are so many options and manufacturers that picking the one that will be the best can be challenging.  I wanted something that would withstand the playful wrath of a 5 year old and look cool too.  When looking at the choices here on Amazon, I decided to take a gamble with this one.  It cost a little bit more but I liked the fact that you could reverse it and you get a Superman cape on the other side.  Children tend to change their minds quite often and while today it might be Batman...tomorrow he might want to be Superman.I was a little nervous when the package arrived because I thought that it might just be a cheap rag with a Batman/Superman sticker attached to it.  I was happy to find that it was of pretty decent quality.  The Batman/Superman logos are real patches.  It's made out of some very shiny polyester and all of the stitching is done nicely.  Basically, it is two sheets of polyester fabric (one red and the other black) sewn together.  You attach it around your neck through the use of a velcro strap.  The care instructions state that this is to be washed in cold water, hand wash cycle, and to let it dry flat.  My son is 42 inches tall and I was worried that it would be too long for him.  I didn't want it dragging on the ground and him to be tripping all over it.  It falls down to about the top of his calves.The real test was to see if he would like it.  When you pull it out of the package, it looks like it is just a Batman cape.  He was surprised to find out that the reversed side was also Superman.  Now, he constantly changes back and forth between the two.  I'm glad I went with this one and was satisfied with the quality and fit for my son.  He sure is having fun with it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRA106O0KI0L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077DAK3U#wasThisHelpful","RRA106O0KI0L3","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few friends of mine were talking about this film and recommended it to me.  I pre-ordered the movie and was eager to see it because they were acting like it was the greatest thing ever.  I don't think it was the scariest horror film ever made but it did have eerie moments that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  The film does start a little slow and as I was watching it I was thinking about how miserable these characters are.  I stuck with it and things begin to make more sense.  The film has a long developing exposition that sets up the emotional grind that the two main characters are going through.  Many who watch this movie comment on how annoying the kid is.  I think the clever thing about this movie is that you begin to ""feel"" what the mother goes through and instead of becoming a passive viewer of events unfolding...you essentially become more involved.  The director could of demonstrated annoyances that the mother (Essie Davis) goes through but instead decides to throw the misery in the audience's faces repeatedly.  You can't help but to feel the desperation of the mother and couldn't help but to think what I would do in a situation like this.  Once the creature arrives, you wonder if all of this is sheer insanity but because both characters experience the Babadook, it develops into more of a mystery.  The ending was puzzling at first but if you take a moment, it all becomes very clear.  It is indeed a movie that contains a message but for those just seeking a thrill ride, it might be a little slow in development for you but you'll get there.  I thought the acting was very well done.  Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman certainly know how to evoke reactions from the audience.  I hear people saying, ""I can't stand that woman"" and ""That kid was so annoying...I just couldn't stand it"".  Well, reactions like are the greatest compliments for actors.To me personally, the film leaves me with the thought that stress, conflict, and other weights of the world can manifest into things quite terrible.  These issues can stack up inside of us can certainly do great damage and need to be dealt with.  Although we deal with this stuff with the help of family and friends, these negative experiences will always be a part of us in some way.  We all handle our problems in differently and this film seems to explore this with audiences.  I enjoyed the film and it gave us some interesting lunch break conversations at work.The Blu Ray special edition comes in a red sleeve that can open up to reveal what looks to be a page out of the Babadook book.  The film looks great but I do agree with others that you will be adjusting the volume on this a lot.  It can get really soft sometimes and then super loud.  There are also some great extras like deleted scenes, cast and crew interviews, and Jennifer Kent's short film entitled ""Monster"".  This short film obviously became the inspiration for the movie and it's interesting to watch.  I especially enjoyed the interview with the artist who created the book for the movie as well.  I enjoyed the film for it's developing thrills and the pondering message it leaves us with.  I recommend this one highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2UBZAX2TD4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4YGWD8#wasThisHelpful","R1C2UBZAX2TD4M","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw the trailer for the movie and was impressed enough to pre-order this movie score.  The trailer introduces the audience to a story set during the time of World War II and it is preparing us for a heartfelt story of faith, love, and a child's determination to bring his father back home from the war.  It's a family film that is surely designed to bring out both tears and smiles from movie goers.  With such a powerful premise in a movie, it will certainly need an emotion inducing score to assist with such goals and I was looking forward to hearing what Stephan Altman and Mark Foster had to offer.  So did they succeed?  Well, I'd say that this score is OK.  I'd give it about three and half stars if I could.  It has some really great moments that I get really excited about but just when it is about to sweep me away, a few distracting things happen which I will explain in a bit.I haven't seen the movie yet and I am really excited to watch this one.  The premise of the film is very intriguing and as I said earlier, I was really looking forward to this particular score.  Film music can really make or break a movie.  I've often thought that a great film score is one that you don't really hear while your watching a movie.  It's there working through us almost subconsciously.  I also know that some really powerful scores can give you a story all on their own.  Closing your eyes and listening to one of these can literally give you original stories all by themselves.  The ultimate doom for a score is when it can become distracting.  There are some movies that I've seen where the music becomes so distracting or irrelevant that I just can't even stand to watch it anymore.  When listening to this particular score by Stephan Altman and Mark Foster there is one particular sound that I find extremely distracting and annoying.  It concerns the vocal chorus that comes in from time to time.  They come in with a ""da da"" version of the melody that seems to fit more of a late 60's romantic comedy film.  It seems to me to be very out of place.  I kinda get the sense that the composers are going for a very playful childlike ""imaginative"" feel in the music here but it just isn't working for me.  Granted, I haven't seen the film yet and this ""interesting"" musical choice might work beautifully in the movie but I just have a hard time enjoying the score on it's own with that popping in every now and then.  The melody is beautiful...but when that chorus comes in...I just cringe.  The other musical choices made are great.  I love the use of the various instrumentation such as accordion, guitars, banjo's, and I do love the whistling that comes and goes every now and then.  A good example of this would be track 6, ""The List"".  I really like this one...but I have to cover my ears when the chorus (now with eerie reverb effect) come in to wreak havoc.  I could do without track 7, ""The Fight"", as well.  It sounds like a child's version of a spaghetti western and I just didn't like it's approach either.  There are some really awesome moments in the score too however.  Track 13, ""The War"", and track 14, ""The Funeral"", are especially moving pieces that are well done.  I like the composer's handling of the beautifully constructed theme here and the tracks that follow are quite nice.  Track 15, ""London Learns/Graveyard"", is probably my favorite.I honestly have to say that this particular score isn't exactly what I was expecting.  It has it's moments where I question some of the choices made but I guess I'll have to wait and see if these same ""distractions"" in the music will become annoyances in my viewing of the movie.  Maybe I won't hear them.  Again, the chosen technique may work beautifully within the context of the film and I hope it does.The score also contains two songs.  ""When You Find Love"", performed by Peter Barbee and Mark Pontius, is track 1.  I didn't really care for this song either but I did like the traditional arrangement of ""This Little Light of Mine"" by RT Valine (track 9).  The score contains 19 songs and runs for about 48 minutes.  There is a four page CD insert that contains pictures from the film and credits for the score and movie.  There is also another separate insert which is a small card that is a replica of the list that Father Oliver (played by Tom Wilkinson) gives the ""Little Boy"".  The CD is produced by Milan Records.It's an OK score with some really great moving moments.  At times...it gets a little silly and distracting but maybe it will grow on me.  I might just be singing a ""Da Da"" version of the theme by the end of the week.  I highly recommend sampling it first before buying to see how you take to some of these tracks.  I am looking forward to seeing the movie and certainly appreciate the fact that movies like this are being made.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNV8P5H8QJFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN7FE4W#wasThisHelpful","R3CNV8P5H8QJFD","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been researching possible musicals to do at our school and I decided that I'd give this one a try.  It hasn't been done in our area in a long time and it seems to be just what we are looking for.  ""Destry Rides Again"" was another option, but this one really has some great timeless classics that just stick with you once you start listening to it.  ""Doing What Comes Naturally"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", ""Anything You Can Do"", and my personal favorite ""I Got The Sun in the Morning"" are just phenomenal pieces of American show music that will never be forgotten.  Irving Berlin was surely a master at his craft.  The CD comes with a wonderful 16 page insert that contains the original 1949 LP liner notes, as well as, reissue notes by Max O. Preeo (Editor of Show Music).  The insert gives plenty of trivia and fun facts concerning the musical, it's creation, synopsis of the story and information concerning the major players who brought this show to Broadway.  One interesting fact is that Jerome Kern was originally planned to score the show.  Another interesting thing is that Kern was once asked, ""What is Berlin's place in American music?,"" and Kern responded that ""Berlin has no place in American music...Irving Berlin is American music.""  The insert was an unexpected bonus with this CD and makes this purchase even better.  It even has an alternate CD cover on the back of the insert but I really like the classic look of the one shown.The CD sounds great and the people behind this release have taken the time to make sure it is presented here in the best way possible.  The track listing is in show order and bonus tracks were added from the 1973 London Phase 4 stereo recording with Stanley Black and the London Festival Orchestra & Chorus.  My favorite of the bonus tracks is the ""Overture"" for the show.  The 1973 recording also contains ""An Old Fashioned Wedding"" which is sung by Ethel Merman & Neilson Taylor.  The CD contains a total of 16 tracks and runs about 50 minutes.  Considering the quality of this recording, the well written CD insert, and the great Amazon price...I don't think you can go wrong with this release of the show.  There are a lot of different versions of this particular show and I decided to go with the original.  I am very pleased to add this to my collection and it has become a wonderful resource to assist me while I am shopping around for our next musical.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYN9EONFCY41B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004VVZX#wasThisHelpful","RYN9EONFCY41B","ABOKL9VZUKETS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABOKL9VZUKETS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got mine and they are working great.  I didn't have any problems with them not cutting off and the motion sensitivity works really well.  They are plenty bright and I love the fact that I can aim the three light ""pods"" in different directions.  If you choose not to use the motion sensor, there is an on/off button that you can push to manually turn the light on.  It actually has to different intensity levels where one push is bright and the second push will dim the light down a bit.I was surprised at how much light it produces and it certainly can brighten up a dark safe.

"Featured review of Mistletoe Misconduct by Catherine Gayle:I am a big fan of Catherine Gayle's Portland Storm series so was excited to get Jim Sutter's story. He is the Portland Storm hockey team General Manager. He is a good guy who takes care of his team, treats them like family, and often gives people that need them a second chance to succeed or make something out of their life. We have seen him do that for his assistant Rachel when she really needed it and for some down on their luck players. But Jim has never forgiven himself for a a mistake he made that cost him his family. He's built his own pseudo family with his team and their wives and is well loved, but he has no relationship with his own son and lost his wife.But when his ex, Elaine sees a profile for Jim on a dating site, the years fall away and she decides to take it as her own second chance.Jim was always good at giving others another chance, but not himself. He has a big heart and is kind, but he beats himself up with guilt over one bad choice and feels unworthy. But Elaine is realizing that she could have fought harder for him too. And she has decided to take charge and be brave. Can she convince him that he deserves love and his own second chance?This was a short, sweet, second chance love story. It moved pretty fast due to it's short novella length for this anthology and it was light on drama and details. But the connection between them was established and was heartfelt. The side relationship with their son Dillon also added depth to the story. And it was fun to get some cameos by some of the characters from other books and we met a new player Chris Hammond ""Hammer"".  I really enjoyed getting to know more about Jim and seeing others look out for him for a change.Additional note: This collection offers a variety of authors and types of characters that  will make it a fun anthology to have when you need quick holiday pick me ups to make you smile, swoon, and get you the in the holiday spirit. They are of perfect length for fitting in when you have limited time, and for trying out new authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30E8CKTODBZFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156VKOBW#wasThisHelpful","R30E8CKTODBZFC","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Definitely not anything she expected and it has the potential to get complicated. And what happens to them after their time is up?This was a short, sweet, sexy novella. It moved fast and was engaging, but  I was a bit disappointed in the rushed ending.  I liked getting dual points of view and I really liked them together. Their connection and chemistry was obvious There was the whole forbidden element since she is the little sister of his overprotective best friend and business partner so it had the potential to get messy. And their hidden feelings added confusion. There was not a lot of drama and angst. It was not as snarky, unfiltered, and funny as Screwed. But I think it was because Hudson's personality was more low key than Hayden's, but still had some humor and was sweet.  I was glad she told Hudson and Gracie's story and  did enjoy getting more with Hayden and Emery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36OA1V3MFUOWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X8XL1Y#wasThisHelpful","R36OA1V3MFUOWN","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's everything she wants, but also has the potential to be her worst nightmare repeated. Colin has tried hard to leave his past behind him, but it just keeps coming back to affect his present.But they both know that their sizzling chemistry and attraction is not going away. So they both have their own strategies on how to play it. He takes risks for a living and in his leisure time, and her life is about minimizing them. They both think they can explore the physical and leave out the emotions, but can they really just be friends with benefits?She has more than just herself to worry about. And his family drama is ongoing. Their pasts affect who they are and what decisions they make at times. Some of the past causes more immediate threats in their present. There are secrets and surprises that are gradually also coming to light.I adored Colin. He is such a good, likable guy who is intelligent, sweet, and protective. But he is also sexy, charismatic, and a panty-melter and dirty talker. He's a risk taker, an adventurer, and an adrenaline junkie. He has had a rough past, but faced it and now tries to rise above. He focuses on a healthy lifestyle and giving back. But the new surprises and stresses have the potential to send him for a tailspin and test his coping skills.Elle is caring, devoted, responsible and fearful. She does not trust easily and is used to being let down.  She has to focus on her son's well being and the needs of the community center, as well as her own. She has made promises to herself and her son, but she also has needs, wants, and fantasies. It is hard for her to take risks or believe that she can have what she wants due to past issues.Together they have a chemical reaction. They run scorching hot (if she is not running cold). They are compatible and good as friends, but they also burn up the sheets (or other locations) when they allow themselves. They challenge each other and push boundaries. But they both know the situation is tenuous at best and they can only live in denial so long.But when life gets real, are they strong enough to push for more or will they crumble before they can really have a chance to begin?Each book in this series has a stand alone romance with a  different Sloan sibling, but also a continuing mystery suspense story unraveling about their family's past that we gradually are getting more answers about. The surprises, secrets, and fall out just keeps coming in this intricate, suspenseful story line that has affected all of the siblings in various ways.I adored Colin and Elle. I could understand their challenges, but was rooting for them. They were a truly fun, flirty, and sweet couple with hot chemistry and a strong magnetic pull, but also had significant challenges. This couple had personal demons and past problems that were triggers for the other and not easy to overcome. Their story builds on the background that has come before in the series. I love the fact that the past family history has had layers peeled back more and more each book. It brings all the stories together in a larger framework. I love the relationship between Colin and his siblings and how each of them is making discoveries about themselves, their shared past, and each other. I also enjoyed Colin and Elle's rapport with the kids at the center.This installment was sweet, hot, funny, and serious at the same time. It was full of longing, lust, love, and passion. It also centered around the importance family and friendship. It also had the suspense and danger component adding more stress and drama. It was about self discovery, pushing boundaries, and figuring out what limits can be dealt with. Sometimes changing strategies and taking risks can lead to the greatest rewards.We got more answers about the underlying mystery in the back story, but the biggest surprising revelation also poses more questions. I am looking forward to more answers and their brother Michael finding his match in the fourth book Sinful Love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZNL81BXYGX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142ZNO7E#wasThisHelpful","RPZNL81BXYGX9","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He felt inferior as a younger man, but has worked hard to build a life and take care of those he cares about.Scarlett was wealthy and controlled when younger. But now she is independent minded, starting over, and trying to follow her dreams. But she is fearful of her secrets getting out, hurting Luke further, and of being gossiped about in the small town. She has her own feelings of inferiority and insecurities. And the reason she left still impacts her present and future.Luke wants to come in and save the day and help her recover from some recent questionable choices. It is hard to resist his help and their attraction. They have a connection, history, and chemistry. But she is determined to keep her heart out of it because she is fearful that it cannot lead anywhere permanent. What will happen when all of her secrets come out? Will that be the final thing that will make Luke give up on her?I liked the small town feel and the fun, quirky characters. I could see more stories with some of the side characters like her friends Layla, Shelby, Savannah, local cop Graham and there was even a tease of a mysterious bar owner. Mrs. M was a funny ""Old bitty"" who delivered some great one liners. I liked getting both points of view.I loved Luke even when he did overreact at times. He could be thoughtful, sweet, and swoony, and also had that sexy alpha male vibe. I liked Scarlett too even when she was guarding her heart and I wanted her to spill her truth. She was caring and kind, but also had a lot of worries. They had the potential to be really great together again, but they had some pitfalls to navigate.This was a sweet second chance story with some heartbreak and pain and secrets, but also joy and hope. I had figured out her big secrets, but there were a couple of things that did surprise me. The epilogue was not what I expected, but I loved it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PR8OJ1GLG19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RKOGUM#wasThisHelpful","R30PR8OJ1GLG19","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the conclusion of Logan and Elle's story and begins right after the climactic ending in Blow. They are dealing with the multiple possible threats, issues, and are worried about their safety. They are in the midst of the fall out from various situations.  Logan is trying to figure out what is best for Elle and how to most effectively protect her. Elle is dealing with her constantly changing world and worries about those she cares about. It is hard to know who to trust, who the real enemy is, and what they really want.There are mysteries, secrets, lies, and threats swirling around them. They are immersed in a dangerous world with many variables in play. Not only do they have to protect themselves, but also her young niece who could get caught in the crossfire.It's a race for answers and to try to put together all of the puzzle pieces so they can figure out who is behind everything and how it all fits together. And then to try to figure out a way to end the threats and bring down the antagonists.This book had me guessing trying to put it all together and predict the outcome. But I have to say there were some definite twists and surprises. I was shocked by some events and was wrong about some things. There are so many little connections from the past spilling onto the present as well as multiple parties involved. It was full of tension, danger, and suspense.But at the core of this story is a couple that are broken as individuals, but together have the potential to make each other whole. They have personal demons to face, have to continue to build trust, and deal with some challenging situations. Two people who used to not believe in attachments find themselves desperate to be together, but are afraid that it might never happen or that the possible repercussions might carry too high a price.Logan is strong, fiercely protective, and  possessive. But he is also scared his mistakes will hurt Elle, so has feelings of guilt and wonders if she would be better off without him. He is intelligent, successful,  and also street smart. He is alpha on the outside, but a bit broken on the inside. He has a strong need to be in control and unfortunately his life seems to keep spinning farther out of control. He has made mistakes with far reaching consequences. No matter how far he tries to get ahead of it, his past still seems to catch up with him and affect his present.Elle is tough, smart, independent and loving. She is not afraid to fight for her happiness, but she is also not immune to doubts and fears. She will do anything to protect her niece no matter the sacrifice to herself.I totally adored Logan and thought Elle was a really likable heroine. Their emotional connection was strong, their chemistry was intense, and their passion was undeniable. I was totally invested in their relationship.  They had  a give and take about them that was put to the test as they both dealt with challenging or emotional situations and threats. It was about priorities, faith, hope, and figuring out where they were supposed to be and believing they deserved to have what they wanted. But it was an uphill battle not only with their own personal demons but also with all of the outside influences and hidden threats against them.I liked the side characters of their friends Declan, Miles, Peyton, and also Logan's father and Grandfather. There were some antagonists and shifty characters that were hard to pin down. And there were a a bunch of potentials for who was threatening them. It was fun trying to put all the pieces together and  figure out the motivations and what was really going on.Kim Karr managed to weave a complex, exciting, full, romantic suspense story into these two books. It was multi-layered and had many little connections past and present. It was told in dual points of view that I really appreciated. The characters had depth, complex emotions, flaws, and were likable and passionate, The story line was fast moving despite the intricate details and layers. It was a beautiful and steamy love story layered with mysteries and exciting danger and suspense. I really enjoyed this series and this intense journey with Logan and Elle. This tied up everything I needed it to and even had an extended epilogue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21L9YJZQ8NXG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EBIZMA#wasThisHelpful","R21L9YJZQ8NXG2","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This takes place right after Sultry Groove. Leah, The Reckless Beat manager and Ryan, rhythm guitarist, shared a kiss that shouldn't have happened (or maybe it was finally time). Leah takes off to Vegas to get her head together and for a diversion...back to where she met an intriguing man who gave her a standing invitation to return. She could use a distraction from the mess she is making by crushing on her former best friend and client.And she does succeed in finding one hell of a distraction, pleasure, and an ego boost. But it does not stop the feelings of sadness, guilt, and hopelessness.Leah tries to get away from her feelings for Ryan and all of their inquiring questions, but also knows Reckless Beat is her family.  This is basically a wake up call for her.  Maybe it is time for her to think more about what she needs vs. everyone else. She and Ryan's friendship has already been battered over the past year. Where will they go after this newest challenge?The Reckless Beat guys and girls are back for a bit. And another familiar guy makes an appearance and brings along a friend too. I liked both of them. I love their family type bonds of the group and the fact that they may fuss and fight but also love each other. Leah sent them all into a tailspin and her choices affect everyone.This is short transition novella bridging Sultry Goove and the final Reckless Beat novel. It was a quick, erotic trip for Leah to find ways to try to forget, but also allowed her time to think about what she plans to do about her situation.I am looking forward to more with Leah and Ryan. This has been building a long time and I have been hoping that each of them could find some happiness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151US320DFW3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EWILP0#wasThisHelpful","R151US320DFW3O","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sparks, snark, sexual tension and a bit of danger...Chloe Jacobs and Ryan Douglas were both having a crappy night...then it got worse...much worse...then heated up.When they meet again, Ryan is met by an angry, feisty Chloe again.

Fresh off her most recent rejection, her sarcasm and man hating behaviors are showing. She loves to challenge Ryan. But under her bravado is an insecure woman afraid of rejection.Ryan in turn thinks it is fun to push and needle her. He's big, burly, bossy, cocky, and sexy.

Seeing the good under the sarcasm and sex appeal is a dangerous game for two people afraid of relationships.But their lives are complicated by omissions, lies, and public scrutiny that lead to insecurities, fears, trust issues, and hurt feelings. I liked them both and their witty banter,  but they could be frustrating too. Are these two meant to be together or will they they lose again in the end?This was  fast, funny, sarcastic, sexy and sweet. It was told in dual points of view. I like hockey books so that is always a plus. Her friend Olivia and boss Cole were the subject of the first book in this series Once Upon A Dare and they make appearances in this one, but this one reads easily as a stand alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R83OTH2EMFH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLZ5RE#wasThisHelpful","R3R83OTH2EMFH9","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Benjamin Gale III is considered a beast of a boss. He is a demanding, work-a-holic with no real emotional connections. He is trying to keep his family business intact with his place as CEO despite some serious opposition. He is stubborn, determined, ambitious, but no one really knows him.Maggie Donovan is one of his employees with a good heart, sweet personality, wit, and is not intimidated by him. She sometimes even defends him. When they are caught in a situation that could be misinterpreted and used against them, quick thinking leads to a fake engagement.They are from two different worlds. They have different ideas about their situation and how to proceed. They have limited knowledge of the other one. People out to get them, public scrutiny, private attraction, and fears affect their choices.He's alpha, bossy, and used to control.  But she makes him want to lose control, adds fun to his life, and helps him find missing pieces of himself he had locked away. She manages to see into his vulnerable core and makes him want to be a better man. I enjoyed the peeling back of his layers and him finding himself again.She seems shy and quiet at first, but is independent minded and likes to make her own choices. She has a sassy, strong, and protective side too. She even has rules on how a fake engagement should go in order to protect her heart. She is kind and teaches him more about thoughtfulness and generosity, but also is not a doormat. But she is afraid to trust or let him in. She pushes him away a lot because she is tempted by him and he makes her want to not act logical or rational.There is a lot of chasing, running, differences of opinion, temptation, fear of getting hurt, and trust issues. Both will have to open up, trust, and believe if they want a real chance. But their lives have some complications, outside influences, built in differences, and tough choices that need to be made.Can two people conditioned not to trust really give their hearts away? Or will they end up as just another cause of pain and regret?This was a fun, sweet, sexy modern take on Beauty and the Beast with some Cinderella moments thrown in. I loved that Maggie was the one that saw him for more than he appeared to be. And that he was smart enough to see how special she was early on. I enjoyed their dual points of view and their banter. There was definitely some drama mixed in and some antagonistic people that caused some frustration, but it was a quick, engaging read full of sexual tension, drama, and an unlikely romance.ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2ZCZQFO0VH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151U7WH2#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2ZCZQFO0VH5","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
