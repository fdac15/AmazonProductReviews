"A great thing about knowing someone who recently had a baby is getting to buy them stuff. When I saw this Post-natal Recovery and Support Belly Band I loved it.  I couldnâ€™t wait to get it and give it to my sister-in-law who just had her first! She loved it and couldn't wait to use it! She loves that it doesn't slip, even when she is running around. Not only that, but the band grows with you, so you can use it throughout post-partum. Its triple compression technology it and 2 extra compression is perfect and works so well!This Post-natal Recovery and Support Belly Band is a great product and there is nothing like it that we have found out there!

"Instead of knocking over the entire pile of Melissa & Doug puzzles every time our child wanted to play with one in particular, we though we'd purchase this rack for the puzzles and store them in it for easier access to any puzzle at any time.It's really a mixed bagâ€”it's hard to get puzzles in and out of some of the slots, though once they're all in, they look neatly organized. A toddler will likely get frustrated, though, trying to get puzzles in and out of the rack... and in the end, they'll all end up spilled out on the floor anyways!One other note: 'sound' puzzles (which are slightly thicker than the normal M&D wood puzzles) will NOT fit in most slots in the rack. So we had to set our sound puzzles elsewhere, which is also annoying.All in all, I wouldn't buy again unless I just wanted a semi-permanent rack to organize the puzzles. Too much hassle for the very slight convenience of being able to pull out a puzzle from the bottom more easily.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ZFVK0NTV7VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000088UPW#wasThisHelpful","R17ZFVK0NTV7VE","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've carried a small external USB battery pack with me for the past few years, ever since I started relying on my iPhone as my only camera, phone, reading device, and emergency-backup-Internet device. And there have been many times where I would've been up a creek (or more literally, lost in the middle of an unfamiliar city!) without it.But the little battery pack I tote around is only really for emergenciesâ€”it can barely top off my iPhone when the phone is already at 50% capacity, and if the iPhone gets below 10%, it'll struggle to even maintain the current charge if I have to use the iPhone while charging!Enter the modern 10000+ mAh external battery pack. For review purposes, I was given a Intocircuit® Power Castle 15000mAh 4.8A Dual USB External Battery Portable Charger with Built-in Flashlight (say that three times, fast!). This battery pack provides two USB ports, both of which are capable of charging any modern device at a decent clip with up to 2.4A of power draw per port. My iPhone and iPad both got two full charges before the unit itself needed a recharge, and when using it only with one iPhone 6, I could get between three to five full charges, depending on how much I used the iPhone on a given day.If used conservatively, you could keep a phone going full-tilt for an entire week without any external power access at all!Intocircuit Power Castle - PortsSome of the nice features of this charger:- The LCD on the front gives all the information you need at a glanceâ€”mainly the big ""X%"" charge indicator, that goes up while you charge the unit, and down while you pull charge from the unit. It's easy to see how much charge remains, and the screen is responsive when you plug in a device to charge it or press the 'ON/OFF' button to quickly check remaining capacity.- It's gimmicky, but the LED flashlight did come in handy once or twice. Just double-click the 'ON/OFF' button to activate. It's not too bright, but it's good enough for finding your way in the dark if need be.- The hardware fits together pretty well, and all cables, plugs, ports, etc. feel solid enough to last a few years. It's not Apple-quality, but the thing doesn't cost as much as something similar from Apple would cost, either!Some things I didn't like (but for the price, I'm willing to accept without too much judgement):- It takes a very long time to charge the unit itself; even if you have a 2A+ wall wart to charge the unit, it will take many, many hours to go from 0% to 100%. Typically not a huge deal, but when I'm on longer trips, I don't always have a full day I can let the unit sit and charge somewhere.- The front of the device looks pretty nice, almost elegant, in fact, but is marred by the cheesy 'Intocircuit' logo. Not a major flaw, but sometimes it's the little things...As another fun test, I even plugged in two Raspberry Pi model 2 computers to the Intocircuit, and under light load (they were both running webservers for utilitarian purposes), they ran for over a day with some charge left in the Power Castle!Overall, this is one of the best and most capable battery packs I've used. The LED is mostly a gimmick, but the main purpose of the deviceâ€”charging and recharging your mobile devices over and over without needing a wall plugâ€”is achieved in spades. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to go on long trips, especially when power is a precious commodity!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHBVUNASL7AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSYLXKU#wasThisHelpful","RZHBVUNASL7AX","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have wanted to replace 6 halogen 75W R20L bulbs with LEDs for the past few years; every time I turned on the track light with all those ~500W energy-wasting bulbs, I cringed.After trying a few different dimmable LED R20 and R30 replacements, I settled on these Philips bulbs. They are a pretty decent replacement, and they definitely use less power/generate less heat (my main concern), but there are a few caveats to those going from incandescent/halogen to this generation of LED:1. There is no color temperature shift when dimming the bulbs; with halogens, you could get a nice, warm, fire-like glow if you dimmed them down a bitâ€”the color temperature would shift when the bulbs were dimmer. With these, they stick to about 2700K all the way up and down their brightness range. I'm used to it now, but it was strangely disconcerting at first.2. If you use a standard old incandescent dimmer, be prepared for flickers and other weird behavior. My solution was to buy a modern LED-specific dimmer, which uses a digital circuit to make the dimming and on/off a lot smoother, and prevents weird flickering issues.3. These bulbs, while better than most other LED bulbs I've tried, still have a slightly more defined 'spot' feel to them than my old halogen bulbs. The halogen bulbs would wash the entire wall with some light, with a smooth blend of light to dark on the border of the spot. These bulbs are close, but if you're looking for it, you can see the 'LED spot' for each bulb. Not a big deal, and these are way better than most, but just something to be aware of.These bulbs aren't the perfect incandescent/halogen replacement, but they're close enough to make it worth it to me, for the power and heat savings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQWSVFHYHDJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCX0AIS#wasThisHelpful","RFQWSVFHYHDJR","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given the iClever 6-port USB charging station pictured below so I could review the device on this site and on Amazon.com. I'm no stranger to beefy multi-port USB chargers; I now own three of the things, and use them for charging many devices at night, powering a cluster of six Raspberry Pi computers, and charging USB battery packs for long trips (it's great to not have to worry about finding an outlet for two or three days at a time while on vacation!).I like two things about this particular charging station that are improvements over many of the other solutions (besides the fact that it's priced at about $25, which makes it one of the most inexpensive chargers!):1. All the ports are 2.4A, meaning I don't have to care what port I plug what device intoâ€”all six ports can charge up even my most power-hungry device (e.g. an iPad with retina display) just as fast as the others. Many inexpensive multi-port chargers have some low-power ports, meaning I have to look at the device to figure out into which port I can plug in certain devicesâ€”not so with iClever!2. The hardware itself is unassuming and small. This is a charger. It shouldn't try to look sleek, stylish, or at home on my desktop. I want utilitarian, I want it to stay put, and I want it to look simple and functional. It excels in all these aspects, and I have now stuck it on the underside of my desk so I can just plug and unplug devices all day long.This iClever charging station is now my favorite, and for most people who need to charge and/or power more than two or three devices at a time, I highly recommend it. Charging two batteries, two iPhones, an iPad, and a Raspberry Pi didn't produce any noticeable heat on the device, and everything charged as quickly as possible, with no weird power blips that would affect the running of the Raspberry Pi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXD1HNRSXJ4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PINR91M#wasThisHelpful","R1RXD1HNRSXJ4U","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these bulbs to compare against some 75w Halogen PAR30 bulbs, an LED R20, and another LED PAR30 bulb. For less than ten bucks, it's a no-brainer for certain applications!This light was by far the 'coldest' 3000K bulb I tested. It's CRI is rated 82, and it does seem to put out some good quality lightâ€”not quite 'blue' like a daylight bulb, but not very warm at all. While dimming, the color didn't change at allâ€”just the brightness (both a good and bad thing, depending on your desired use!). Halogens obviously run much more yellow (especially as they're dimmed), and the other 2700K and 3000K LED bulbs I tested were somewhere in-between.This light made no noise whatsoever when dimmed or at full brightness, and worked great with a newish Lutron dimmer in a nice track lighting system. It's a bit more 'spotlighty' than some of the other LEDs, but it actually had the same spread/brightness as the halogens I was replacing (a narrower bright spot in the middle, maybe 30 degrees or so, with a slightly dimmer spot out to 40 degrees or so).Definitely worth trying out if you are okay with a little colder color temperature. For one room, I need a warmer, dimmer light, so I went with some 2700K Philips R20 LED bulbs instead. For an office or public/daytime space, I'd go with these bulbs in a heartbeat. Great price, runs cool, and dims pretty well (not as good as halogen/incandescent, but as good as most modern LED bulbs).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MK4BYZUOUISL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I25NZKM#wasThisHelpful","R1MK4BYZUOUISL","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally had a bunch of Cat5 drops terminated straight into plugs, and plugged them into the back of my gigabit ethernet switch.

The punch-down terminals are well-labeled for each jack, and if you have a typical krone-style punchdown tool (Amazon sells one for $5 or so), terminating all the connections is a quick affair.The panel's metal edges are a little sharp, so make sure you don't snag a corner on your clothing (or your skin!), but other than that, there's really nothing not to like here.

"I mount a 23"" monitor on the wall for my standing desk workstation, and I have had trouble in the past with other cables that stick straight out of the back of the monitor; because of the tight clearance with my mount, I've had to bend the cables pretty severely, meaning they get kinked, and over time, the signal goes away.I was looking for a 90° cable, and finally settled on this one; all the connections are solid, the elbow connector (which I have plugged into the back of my monitor) fits snugly, and gives me an extra inch of clearance (so I can tilt my monitor without smashing the cable), and the signal has been perfect so far.The only real complaint I have is that the monitor is very thick; twice as thick as almost all the other DVI cables I have.

Turning the backflow preventer back on requires a bit of wet fun, since you have to open some valves, build pressure, then close valves, with water squirting out all over the place!I've had the new part installed for three months with pretty high house-side pressure (measured at 85 psi), and I haven't had any leaks or problems!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3LWFY4TQE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GQKOEE#wasThisHelpful","R1L3LWFY4TQE4","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first two Making of Star Wars books by J.W. Rinzler within months of their being published. Both were engrossing works of art containing many rarely-seen photos and anecdotes from cast and crew from Star Wars.Just like the first two books, this book gave so much detail and life to what used to be my favorite movie of the original trilogy, and made me want to watch the entire original trilogy again. Everything from set design to sound design and the soundtrack is explored and related in incredible detail, from pre-production to post-release.Unlike most other 'coffee table' books of similar girth, these books will have any serious Star Wars fan devouring every word, cover-to-cover--you can't repel a book of this magnitude!There are only two complaints I have about this book:1. The text is very small, and the pages are glossy--meaning it can be slightly difficult to read in some light.2. It's the last Making of Star Wars book for the original trilogy. Somehow I don't think reading about Jar-Jar's floppy ears will ever be as enthralling as reading about the countless hours Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhew spent in their iconic costumes.If you love Star Wars, this book is worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAY1NUMENGTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511468#wasThisHelpful","R1CAY1NUMENGTK","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two of these; one for my desk and one for my bag. I've never had a connection issue with either one, and they're about as small as I've seen USB NICs.The only limitation with this USB adapter is that it's USB 2.0, and maxes out at 100 mbps. I wish it were USB 3.0 so it could make better use of my gigabit network's bandwidth. For 99% of my usage, though, I don't saturate the bandwidth, so it's not a big issue.There's a more expensive Thunderbolt adapter that supports gigabit networking, but I don't want to waste my MacBook Air's only TB port with that adapter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XNB0W8YZX6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00486070K#wasThisHelpful","R18XNB0W8YZX6G","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these edge guards to stick to our sharp fireplace brick facade after seeing them installed at a friend's house. The pads are nice, thick foam, and they feel soft and don't look too bad (imo).The included 3M double-sided tape works great if you're sticking these pads to a hard, non-porous surface like glass, wood, or tile. But if, like me, you try sticking the tape to brick, the tape doesn't hold up too well.I've been able to mount the edge guards using the following method:  1. Screw masonry screws through a piece of velcro into some grout, every 6"" or so.  2. Stick a piece of velcro along the edge guard's inside.  3. Stick the edge guards to the screwed-in velcro strips.I'm using a small masonry screw, and the holes that remain are pretty small, so I can patch them up when my children are old enough to not bang their heads on the fireplace corners. But to do this, you need some extra screws, some industrial-strength velcro, and a hammer drill.Ease of installation gets 2/5 stars, but in every other regard, these edge guards are pretty good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QMEVBXS57AL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000056J1U#wasThisHelpful","R2QMEVBXS57AL1","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Along with the stacking ring toy, and maybe Sophie the Giraffe, there are few toys I see in as many houses with babies as these squishy teething rings.Some babies seem to enjoy gnawing on them endlessly, while others (like my own baby boy) likes to hold it, bite it, then throw it off to the side. I give this product a definite five stars for how durable it is, and how easy it is to clean, but four stars for its general utility. If your baby doesn't like it (like mine doesn't), it's almost pointless to have.I still like that I can chill it in the fridge and help my baby get a little cooling action on his gums during times when I can tell a new tooth is cutting in and giving him pain, but this toy is usually sitting in the back of the fridge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2044S0S73GZ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N9G7AM#wasThisHelpful","R2044S0S73GZ0F","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For $9.99, this is a rock-solid adapter that allows you to use any old-style MagSafe power adapter (from the original MagSafe MacBook Pro adapter to the 2011 MacBook Air/Pro adapters) with newer MacBooks (which have a thinner connector).It's a bit of a necessary evil, since the power adapter had to slim down to fit more easily with Apple's ever-thinner laptops. But it works well and doesn't feel like it will ever break.The one gripe I have is that, if you need to use it only sometimes (say, you have an older MacBook and a newer one, and you switch between the two), it's a little clumsy to pop the adapter on and off (it almost always requires two hands).

Not wanting to sacrifice mine, I bought this breaker bar, and am not worried about putting my full body weight down on the bar to pop a bolt loose.Even if your local auto shop decides to tighten every bolt to 100+ ft-lbs pressure with an impact wrench, you'll be able to budge them loose with this breaker bar.

Make sure you use the included plastic clips and long screws to securely attach the vertical hangers to the door--and do this *after* you've installed everything and have it in the position you want it.Once installed, pantry door swings a little more slowly (since we have about 20 more pounds of stuff on the door!), but it closes fine, and the storage rack doesn't swing around or bang on the door, since it's screwed down with the six included plastic straps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYEVHGVVIMWOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VMW0HU#wasThisHelpful","RYEVHGVVIMWOD","A21I1N8JO0LQMO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21I1N8JO0LQMO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't have any pets, so I can't test the ability to not detect small pets, but I do know I was not able to fool the sensor during a walk test.Note that the sensor seems to not come with mounting screws; you'll need two #6 screws to mount this to a wall.

"Since bringing our baby boy home from the hospital, we've tried a variety of pacifiers, to see which ones (if any) he would like; the Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifiers were great for the first 2-3 weeks, but after that, they ended up being spat out almost constantly. So we bought these, a generic brand, and a pack of Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifiers, and noticed that these were the only pacifiers our son seemed to keep in his mouth.The other brands, he just gnawed on them a bit, then spat them out and started crying. These pacifiers are large enough to not be a choking hazard, but discreet enough that his nose never touches the pacifier. Additionally, cleaning is easy; just run the thing under hot water, or boil them if you need to sanitize.Each pacifier comes with a durable and securely-fitting clear plastic cover. For someone who's not a germaphobe, but would rather not toss a pacifier just anywhere, these covers provide peace of mind.

"This iPhone dock (which looks much different than the current pictures on the product page; see my customer pictures to see how it actually looks) is so-so. I wasn't expecting too much for $15, but I wish it were a little better in a few ways: - The plug in the base is slightly thick for the iPhone, so you have to push the iPhone down pretty hard. - Because of this, removing the iPhone is a definite two-hand operation. - The dock is pretty substantial (about 1/2"" wider than the iPhone). - The rubbery bottom is not very grippy, so the dock slides around my wood table easily.However, it does hold the iPhone upright, and has a built-in lightning plug, so you don't have to sacrifice a cable and install it in the base of the dock or anything.I think if the tolerances for the plug were just a little better, this would be a great deal.

"I now have one of these on every external door of my house, as well as a few other internal doors (like the basement door) and a few windows.** In the Box **They're really easy to install, and they come in a box with a plastic mounting plate, a magnet and magnet spacer, the proper screws for mounting everything, some double-sided tape (which is okay for indoor use, but I'd rather use the screws!), and an A123 battery (see my picture above for an overview of all the included bits).** Quality and Installation **The design is pretty minimal, and fits in okay with the white door and window trim in my house. Honeywell also makes a 'slimline' version of this sensor that's much narrower--but also much more expensive!The sensor is easy to maintain--every couple of years (when a battery dies), just push in the tab on the bottom with your fingernail and pop off the front cover (your alarm system will start beeping at this point, since you're 'tampering' with the transmitter... ignore it and reset it when you're done). Pop out the old battery, put in a new one, then replace the cover. Nothing to it.** Function and Battery Life **These sensors use two Loops for sensing door/window open and close states: Loop 2 (most common) is used with a magnetic reed switch (magnet must be within an inch or so of the reed switch sensor), and Loop 4 lets you use a wired contact (installation is more difficult, and probably uncommon).As long as you have a flat surface on the door and on your door casing or wall within an inch or so of each other, you can just mount the magnet to the door, and the transmitter to the wall/door trim, and you're done!I installed my Honeywell L5100PK - LYNX Touch security system a few months ago, and haven't yet had a battery die. A few other people I know have a similar Lynx system, and nobody seems to have any complaints about battery life.** Recommendation **Buy enough of these to cover every entry/exit in your house, and you're set!

If you need an extra lightning cable or two, buy them while the price is low. These Apple cables are nice and thin, and plug and unplug easily (unlike some third party cables).My only complaint is Apple's packaging for these cables--I wish Amazon could offer 'frustration-free' packaging, because it takes some effort to get the sticky cardboard insert off, and that's *after* using some force to open the box the cable comes in!

"This case fits any model of Raspberry Pi very well (with very close tolerances); for the model B, with it's RJ-45 plug and extra USB port, you need to use a screwdriver or pliers to pop off a couple little pieces of protective plastic.Putting it together is easy enough (just put the Pi in the bottom case, and cover it with the top case)--that is, until you screw in the four included metal screws! The screws don't go in very well--and I think it's because the plastic screw standoffs they go into are not pre-tapped. You can feel a ton of resistance the whole time you tighten the screw.I used a phillips #1 driver to carefully, slowly screw in the screws, and was able to screw them in without stripping the heads. Go slow, and hold onto the case tightly!Once the case is on, you don't have access to the GPIO pins, or the camera plug, but you can get to all the 'external' ports, and the LEDs shine through the indicators very clearly.

"I donâ€™t have many USB Type-C devices yet, but when Apple released the new MacBook that charges and syncs data through a single USB Type-C port, that lead me to start looking into products that used USB Type-C. While USB Type-C is not a new cable format, it is becoming more mainstream with the inclusion of the cable type on computers like the MacBook. As a tech reviewer, you never want to be behind the times and since this is a technology that is emerging more and more, I really started to take notice and tried to figure out a way to start incorporating it into my current devices.This USB Type-C to USB 3.0 Adapter is a great solution to this problem. It makes it possible to continue using your current USB cables â€“ like standard Lightning cables, Apple Watch charging cables, and even Micro USB cables â€“ without having to replace them to work with USB Type-C. The adapter has a really nice look to it. It has a aluminum shell with silver edge and is about the size of a small USB flash drive.Even though products like the MacBook are starting to use USB Type-C as its main method of data and power transfer, there are still very few products that have begun to adopt the technology. That being said, I actually do have a couple of battery packs and chargers that use the technology.On a trip I took a few weeks ago, I had to charge my iPhoneâ€™s battery while I was in the car. The problem was that I had a battery that I was testing out that only had a USB Type-C charging port. Since a Lightning-to-USB Type-C cable does not exist yet, I ended up using this adapter to connect the battery and the phone. It works beautifully. I was able to plug the USB end into the adapter and the USB Type-C end into my battery allowing me to be a happy camper with a full iPhone charge.If you are interested in keeping up with technology and making sure your devices can be compatible with the newest emerging devices with USB Type-C, consider giving this adapter a try. Itâ€™s affordable and works like magic.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"Home automation has become like a small obsession with me. From turning on/off my lights and opening my garage door to just saying, â€œHey Siri,â€ and asking it to turn the heat up in my home, I am really hooked on the technology. One item lacking in the HomeKit area are wifi enabled cameras. Having the option to have Siri pan or tilt my cameras would be really nice, but since I donâ€™t have that option yet Iâ€™ll stick to the next best thing â€“ an app controlled, WiFi camera like this one from Inspira Technologies, LLC.The Astro View HD 360 Wi-Fi Camera is a product that was introduced to me off of Amazon and I love it. With this little camera I can pan and tilt to grab the right viewing angle with ease. It has really been a great camera to use. The camera provides 720P HD resolution and has six infrared lights and a cut-off filter for nighttime video. This allows you to view black & white images in complete darkness up to 25 feet away from the camera. This camera also features a 2-way audio feature so that you can essentially incorporate the Astro View as an intercom in your home.Astro View HD 360 comes with a one month free trial subscription to iSecurity+ cloud recording service. This is regularly priced at $10 per month or $100 per year per camera. Recordings are accessible for 14 days after they are initially stored. This isnâ€™t something that you necessarily need as you can still view real-time video once you receive a notification, but itâ€™s a nice option should you ever need to refer back to a historical event â€“ like a break-in.I think one of the most impressive things about the Astro View HD 360 is the fact that it can be told to remotely pan and tilt so that you have the best viewing angle possible. This is a wonderful feature that none of my other cameras have.First Impressions & SetupI was instantly impressed with this little camera from the moment I took it out of the box. Sometimes, you donâ€™t know what to expect from products you find on Amazon, but this was a very pleasant surprise. When you first open the box, the camera is laying inside of a plastic mold that separates the camera from the accessories. The camera itself looks like a little robot (we actually nicknamed it â€œBB-8â€ on our network). Included in the package with the camera is its power supply, a user manual, and some mounting supplies for installation.Connecting to my WiFi was simple. I opened the app (available for iOS or Android) and followed the basic instructions to connect to my home WiFi. Within a few minutes, I was connected. Iâ€™ve not experienced any issues with it disconnecting randomly or not being available when I call it up on the app.One thing Iâ€™m always nervous about is being able to connect to my cameras when Iâ€™m away from home. What sort of quality will I get? Will I be able to connect at all? These are very good questions as the most important part of having network security cameras is being able to pull the video feed up at anytime from anywhere. I can happily say the Astro View 360 does not disappoint. In fact, my experience with this camera has been even better than my Dropcam Pro.You can mount this camera on a wall or even ceiling if you wish, but it also have a flat bottom, which makes it conducive to acting as a table top camera, too. I really like that Inspira Technologies designed this camera to have an easy wall installation. It has a bottom plate that you can remove and mount it to the wall. Then, you can affix the camera to that plate with a simple twist. I definitely prefer this method to the guess and measure option that some manufacturers force you to do. For testing purposes, I decided to use the Astro View HD 360 as a desktop camera, but very much appreciated that those supplies were included.TestingBecause I was so excited about the condition of the Astro View, I immediately set it up on my home network and starting looking at video. My office is actually a major thoroughfare in our home. From my desk you have a view of our front door and so this area was the ideal testing ground for the Astro View. Once the camera was on, I just let it go. My fiancÃ© and I went out to dinner and while we were out, I received real-time notifications of movement and was able to pull up the video feed very quickly. I do have some pre-existing experience with network cameras and accessing them remotely. Every time Iâ€™ve done this process with other cameras, Iâ€™ve had issues with connection or video quality. This time, the video was crystal clear and even though we were looking at the cameraâ€™s night vision, it was very easy to tell what the images were.The video does operate off of a delay. It seems to be less than 5 seconds, which wasnâ€™t a problem for me. We also tested out the pan and tilt function via remote and found that it worked flawlessly.ConclusionsThe Astro View 360 HD is a wonderful choice for home security camera. I canâ€™t say enough good things about this little camera. Itâ€™s easy to set-up and use. It is actually my personal camera of choice at this given time. I love that you can change its viewing angle so easily and the quality of the video overshadows all of my other home WiFi cameras. This is a very affordable camera and even though it may be a bit larger than other WiFi cameras, itâ€™s well worth the extra space it takes up.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"When Apple announced the release of the new Apple TV in September, I knew I would be among the first in line to pick one (or two) up. It had a faster processor, better hardware, and just offered a better experience than the previous generations of the device. One of the features I was most looking forward to was the promise that the Apple TV would be a premier gaming system as well as a media player. Even though the Siri Remote is a great accessory for the Apple TV, itâ€™s not a gaming controller. The SteelSeries Nimbus, however, is a gaming controller and itâ€™s designed specifically for the Apple TV (and other Apple devices).FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe very first thing I noticed about this controller was how much it reminded me of an Xbox controller. Side-by-side, you almost wouldnâ€™t be able to tell the two apart except that the analog sticks have placement similar to the PlayStation controller. The designers of the Nimbus really looked at what worked with both of those systemsâ€™ controllers and pulled them into this device.In addition to the two analog sticks that Iâ€™ve already mentioned, Nimbus also features a standard D-Pad on the left-hand side of the controller, a menu button (more like a multi-function button) in the center, A/B/X/Y buttons on the right-hand side, Right & Left triggers, Right & Left bumpers, and a Bluetooth pairing button. All buttons and control functions operate as you would expect them to and if you have any experience with a gaming controller, you wonâ€™t have any â€˜translationâ€™ issues carrying over to the Nimbus.While the main body of the controller is made primarily of plastic, it doesnâ€™t feel that way. Itâ€™s got some great weight to it and it feels solid. The packaging for the controller is pretty nice, too. The only thing in the box with the controller is a manual so you will have to supply your own charging cable.TESTINGEven though I enjoy product testing, the trial run of the Nimbus was definitely a highlight of my testing year. After all, testing meant that I got to play games. Even though this is a Bluetooth controller and compatible with many different devices, it was designed for the Apple TV. And, as such, I did the majority of my testing with the new Apple TV. Pairing was very easy with the Apple TV and you donâ€™t have to keep re-pairing it. The controller and Apple TV remember each other.Once the controller was paired, I was off to the races. First, I played a few rounds of Rayman Adventures. Not having any previous experience with the game, I felt like this was a good test of how well I would understand the controller and how well it would communicate with the Apple TV. I can say that it was a flawless test. I was able to learn the commands quickly and found that holding and using the Nimbus wasnâ€™t much different than holding my Xbox controller. I also did not have any communication or connection problems between the Apple TV and the Nimbus. Playing Rayman Adventures felt very much like a standard gaming console experience. Movements were fluid and the controller had a great response with the Apple TV.One of the other games I tried out was Beach Buggy Racing. This game has a Mario Kart feel to it and is really a lot of fun. The Nimbus performed beautifully and had great options for controlling the beach buggy. Again, this was a very fluid action/reaction between the Nimbus and the Apple TV.After taking some time with the Nimbus, I found that really the only place it fell short was with the activity-based games that call for a more Wii-like control. Thatâ€™s where the Siri Remote really shines.CONCLUSIONSI used to consider the Xbox the best gaming controller, but now I find myself wishing I could use the Nimbus for all gaming. This controller is allowing me to enjoy playing games on the Apple TV and because it works with other Apple products, I might find myself liking the iPad Pro as a gaming machine, too.Playing games using the Nimbus really feels great and takes you back into childhood. While I was playing, I found myself feeling more like a kid playing those colorful games I grew up with â€“ except that those games never looked as clean and crisp as they do on the new Apple TV.One additional feature that is very cool is the iOS app from SteelSeries that allows you to update your controller when itâ€™s paired to your iPhone or iPad. The app also gives you a wonderful list of compatible games you can install and use with the Nimbus.I really feel that in order to get the best possible experience with the Apple TV, users should invest in a good Bluetooth controller and the Nimbus is probably the best one in the market. Nimbus has a superior build to it and fantastic design that gamers will cling to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2LH290QDKCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0724S0#wasThisHelpful","R2A2LH290QDKCW","A1TKPYCOI1IZVL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TKPYCOI1IZVL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Sentey Artix Gaming Headset. It is a over-the-ear, USB headset with microphone suitable for use on Windows or Mac.Initial ImpressionsThis thing is big. It reminds me of a big set of cans you might find in a recording studio. It has a nice plastic coated braided USB cord with a simple USB connection to your computer. It is self adjusting with a spring loaded headband, which I found perfectly comfortable. I had no trouble connecting it to my Windows 10 PC, and there were no drivers to install. It was effortless to select it for use in Steam for voice use.FeaturesOn the headset you will find a volume control, LED switch to make the headphones light up bright blue, and a mysterious â€œVâ€ switch which I could find no mention of in the documentation. The â€œVâ€ switch seemed to do nothing as far as I could tell. Testing with Audacity, there was no effect on the microphone. The manual mentions a special microphone control, but there wasnâ€™t one anywhere to be found. The microphone has a sturdy retractable boom that swings out of the left ear piece.The USB connection provides all that is needed for interfacing this to your computer. Having an on-board audio adapter means that you donâ€™t have to fiddle with plugging in separate cables for sound and mic in. To me, the audio quality is good, if just a little heavy on the bass side which many will find a positive.You will find it very comfortable to wear, and very effective at isolating outside sounds thanks to its comfortable ear pieces with rubberized foam pads.QualityThe fit is pretty impressive. I found the spring loaded headband to be perfect for my head, and I had no problem wearing it for a couple of hours at a time while playing games or listening to music.The major disappointment for me was its very weak microphone gain. Even with all my levels at full, it was difficult for anyone to hear me unless I was almost yelling. Evaluating in Audacity, I was unable to get it to register at more than half level without speaking very loudly. I tried setting gains in the application, Windows, and even fiddling with the volume control and â€œVâ€ switch on the unit, but to no improvement.Final ThoughtsThis is a decent set of headphones that are very comfortable to use, easy to install, and sound great. Poor microphone performance and its rather large size might make you think twice about this particular set.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"My iPhone has inserted itself into my everyday life. Itâ€™s always no more than an arms reach away at all times. I can drain the battery very quickly just with regular use of the phone. Iâ€™m not the type to have bulky battery case, so I am left with the traditional method of plugging it up constantly. Than being said, the one thing that Apple hasnâ€™t managed to knock out of the ballpark is the lightning cable.Cacoy solves this with a pretty rugged design. Unlike Appleâ€™s Lightning Cable, you can tell that Cacoyâ€™s Apple MFi certified cable is gonna get the job done without any of the problems from the factory cable. Cacoy ditched the plastic and rubber design and went for a tougher material. They used a material that feels just like paracord, so you have piece of mind that itâ€™s not going to crack or stretch. Which lets face it, happens a lot more than we would like. I personally have gone through four separate Lightning cables in just three years. Whether it be from everyday wear and tear or temperature issues, I know that my standard Lightning cable will fail. I tried stretching the Cacoy cable, coiling it, and bending it. The cable just took it with stride. The heavier gauge cable is tough.One of the big drawbacks of Appleâ€™s cable is that it just isnâ€™t long enough. I canâ€™t count how many times I plug my phone in and it just seems to barely reach where I want it or not at all. With 2 meters in length, Cacoy made my life with my phone bearable and easier at the same time.The biggest failure I have seen with other cables is that they separate from the USB and lightning connections from being used or yanked out. No need to worry. Just like the heavier gauge cable, Cacoy beefed up the connections while still keeping the profile very slim.A lot of knock off cables will only charge your iPhone and not let you sync with them, which is frustrating to no end. No worries. Cacoyâ€™s cable is MFi certified and will charge and sync with out any problems. Now, my only problem is that I have to get one for my car and office as well.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"Not so long ago, I didnâ€™t care so much for car mounts. I remember about 10 years ago that I added my first car mount and it was for my GPS. The small baseball-sized device mounted via ball joint to a suction cup designed for the windshield. It heldâ€¦most of the time. When conditions were too hot or too cold, sometimes the suction would dissipate and the mount would fall. Fortunately, car mounts have come quite a long way since then.Until I was introduced to this latest mount from TYLT, I was primarily using a vent mount for my phone. Itâ€™s a simple design concept and doesnâ€™t take up much space. This was something that turned me off from larger mounts and why Iâ€™ve stayed away from them for so long. The Capio 2 Universal Car Mount from TYLT has really had a strong impact on me and my daily commute to and from work.So, whatâ€™s so great about this mount? First of all, it uses micro-gel suction as itâ€™s method of attachment to the interior of your car. This was immediately a selling point in my mind because it doesnâ€™t limit you to adhering it just to your windshield. That was, of course, the first test I did. I stuck the mount to my windshield and found it adequate, but not exceptional. It actually wasnâ€™t until I moved the mount to my control console (where all the knobs are for my climate control) that I really took a liking to the Capio Universal Mount.The mount is â€˜universalâ€™ and fits phone up to 6 inches in width. That means even the larger â€˜phabletâ€™ style phones will rest easy within Capio. It also works well with smaller phones that are housed inside cases. Capio is designed so that a user can remove or place the phone into it with one hand. At first, I didnâ€™t think I believed that would be possible, but sure enough, with the quick release button on the back of the mount plate, you can easily grab your phone at a momentâ€™s notice.One other great feature of this mount is the very gentle, fluid rotation that it provides for adjusting your viewing angle. Again, with one hand you can easily move your phone so that itâ€™s easiest for you to use while in your vehicle (note â€“ we donâ€™t recommend using your phone while the car is in motion).Capio has really impressed me at every turn. The most impressive point to this device is actually how sturdy it is. After installing it on the console, Iâ€™ve not noticed any and I mean ANY jiggling or shaking of the mount while the car is in motion. This is truly remarkable in my opinion.I really wasnâ€™t sure how I would like the Capio Universal Car Mount, but Iâ€™m so glad that I have it now as a part of my car traveling system. One other really nice feature of this device is because itâ€™s â€˜universalâ€™, I can also use it for my new GPS device while is about the size of my iPhone 6.This is a great car mount and I look forward to using it for many days to come.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"This is one of the other exclusive HermÃ¨s bands introduced by Apple earlier this year. Itâ€™s made from genuine leather and is designed to elegantly wrap around your wrist twice. Cara also makes a version of this band and does it very well. It, too, is made from genuine leather and has the same double wrap design. I was equally as impressed with this replica band of the Apple/HermÃ¨s original.I must admit that when I first saw this band design, I wasnâ€™t thrilled with it. I enjoy a beautifully designed leather band and really think the stitch work and little touches like the unique buckle design set this band apart â€“ not the fact that it wraps around your wrist twice.That being said, wearing the band is a much different story than just seeing the concept online. As I mentioned above, Iâ€™m used to wearing a 38mm Apple Watch and had to switch to a 42mm in order to test out this band. Because of its design, I do not notice the weight difference between the two watch bodies.The Double Tour is a unique design and I feel that it probably speaks to those who are used to wearing high-fashion styles. While I do appreciate the craftsmanship that went into this band, I feel as though itâ€™s style is not for me. That being said, itâ€™s very comfortable and didnâ€™t seem to really get in the way much while I was typing.The Cara Double Tour is available for approximately 3% of what Apple and HermÃ¨s charges ($1,250). It seems to be made very well and I think it will hold up nicely over time.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"One of the fastest growing product markets out there seems to be the third party Apple Watch band space. There is a lot of room for improvement and innovation here as watches have been around for hundreds of years. I have been fortunate enough to be able to test out several replica bands of the Apple originals and have been incredibly impressed by them.This review will focus on two of the newest additions to the Apple Watch band line â€“ the HermÃ¨s Cuff and Double Tour. When Apple announced these new bands in September, I wasnâ€™t sure what to think of them since they were so pricey and you could only buy them with a special HermÃ¨s Apple Watch, but thankfully, there are now third party versions of them for everyone to enjoy.CUFFApple worked with HermÃ¨s to design this equestrian inspired band. It wraps around your wrist in one fluid motion and buckles using a standard, but light metal clasp. This is only available for 42mm sized Apple Watch body. The designers at Cara took great care in making their version of the Cuff as close to the original Apple/HermÃ¨s version as possible. The biggest difference â€“ other than price of course â€“ the availability of different colors. Cara offers the standard brown leather that Apple does and they also have a blue leather version that I was able to test out.It is surprisingly comfortable. Just to look at the design I really didnâ€™t think that this would be the band for me, but the more I wear it, the more I like it. It does get a little cumbersome as I type on my computer, but for other times, the Cuff is a great option for wearing your Apple Watch. I typically wear a 38mm Apple Watch, but switched over to a 42mm in order to test this band. I could not tell the weight difference. The band really evens out the weight distribution and since itâ€™s designed to completely wrap around your wrist, it doesnâ€™t slip around at all.This band is made from genuine leather and has some beautiful stitching around the it to show the high-quality craftsmanship. I am very impressed with the Cuff Leather Watch Band from Cara. In my opinion, there isnâ€™t a reason to shell out the $1500 requested from Apple for this band when this version is available for a fraction (2%) of that retail cost.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"I enjoy music in every facet of my life. So, Iâ€™m always on the hunt for a great set of speakers. I have tried various shapes and sizes â€“ high end and low end â€“ and Iâ€™m always left with a lingering disappointment about some aspect of the speakers, whether it be sound quality or just not loud enough for me. This is where the Music Box Studio Wireless Speaker comes in.From the start, the packaging impressed me. Itâ€™s sounds crazy that Iâ€™m impressed by a box, but one of the first things that influence my purchases is how sturdy and visually appealing the packaging is. Right out of the box the look and the feel of the speaker is great. The speaker is deceptively heavy, which is a good thing considering that Iâ€™ll be setting it in crazy places and need it to stay put. The body of the whole speaker feels like a decent gauge of metal. I really wanted to try out the durability and stood on the speaker. No give or any sign that it wouldnâ€™t stand up the everyday wear and tear that I will subject it to. The rubber bumpers on the top and bottom are a nice little touch, no need to worry about the speaker slipping.  The speaker isnâ€™t obtrusive and blends into pretty much wherever I put it.Pairing the speaker was easy, and unlike some other wireless speakers, it would pair with my phone even after powering off without any problems. I have a smaller house so testing the range was simple and I didnâ€™t lose any signal as I walked to every room with my phone.  The power supply included with the speaker is a run of the mill power brick. Now the the plug in the speaker for the power supply is hidden seamlessly by a rubber flap on the side of the speaker. In the same hidden space is a auxiliary port to plug in your media player. I tried it out just to make sure it worked, but to be honest, I donâ€™t see many people using it.The sound was quite surprising and powerful out of a small unit. While I didnâ€™t expect much out of the Music Box Studio Wireless Speaker, I was mistaken. I played a wide variety of music styles and it managed to make every single one of them sound great. It does get a little scratchy on sound turned all the way up with high frequency music, but to most people it wonâ€™t really hinder their enjoyment. I will be packing the speaker on all of my trips or parties.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"One of the struggles that I deal with daily is desktop clutter that is caused by charging multiple electronic devices. Sometimes this issue can be dealt with by the addition of a charging dock that neatly tucks away cables and provides you with one option for storing  your devices on your desktop. One such product that offers this kind of freedom from clutter is the Basecamp Charging Dock from INZeyo Labs.First ImpressionsThe very first thing I noticed about this dock was the assembly required to get it up and running. Assembly doesnâ€™t typically scare me off of a product, but this was a bit more than I expected. Itâ€™s got a nice weight to it â€“ heavy enough not to tip over, but light enough to carry from place to place if need be.One of the unique features of this dock is that you can use any cables you prefer along with it. There are two standard USB docks built into the power station of the dock (on the inside), and you can use your preferred cables with the dock. The productâ€™s website claims the following devices are compatible with the Basecamp charging dock:iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6, 6+, 6s, 6s+Apple Watch 38mm/42mm, all bandsiPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air and iPad MiniIn addition to these products, the website also indicates that you can use non-Apple tablets, e-readers, and smartphones with it as well. I found while assembling the dock and installing the cables that only the Apple Lightning cable will slide through the smartphone/tablet charging port. There is a USB port on the back that can be used to charge other non-Apple devices, but just know that you may not be able to set your device on the dock. There might be some small form Micro USB cables that can fit, but the form of the standard Apple Lightning cable is a bit small. I tried using a third party Lightning cable and it would not fit. This is just something to take into consideration when thinking about whether or not this dock will suite your needs. I would also hesitate to charge the larger iPads on it if they are not in a case. The dock provides minimal protection for devices that are charging, but they will still rest their backs on the aluminum finish of the dock. I am using my iPhone 6 in the charging dock and itâ€™s got the Apple Silicone case protecting it. The phone fits very well.InstallationWhen I first took the Basecamp charging dock out of the box, I was surprised to find that there were not instructions included. Itâ€™s pretty self-explanatory, but I thought there might at least be a Quick Start Guide. The first hurdle I had to clear was routing the cables. While that in itself isnâ€™t a monumental task, wrapping up the longer Apple Watch charging cable is. If you have the shorter Lightning and Apple Watch charging cables available, then I would highly suggest you dedicate them to this cause.Once the cables were plugged in and wrapped, I screwed the bottom plate onto the dock base. Helpful hint: If you are having trouble with the correct size of Phillips head screwdriver, try a flat head screwdriver. I found that two of the screws were a little tougher to attach than the others, but when I tried using the flat head screwdriver, it worked very easily and the best part was that I didnâ€™t end up with a stripped screw.The other part of the assembly is determining which dock guide to use with your smartphone or tablet. You can go through trial and error, but this is one of those pieces that would be great to include in a Quick Start Guide. Both the Apple Watch puck dock and the backing to the dock guide for the smartphone are adhesive to secure those pieces in place.Once all the basic pieces were completed, all I had to do was plug in the power supply and I was off to the races. The nightlight doesnâ€™t require anything specific for operation or installation. It operates by touch and you can dim it by tapping and holding your finger in place until the desired light level is reached.Testing & ConclusionsEven though I found some room for improvement in certain areas, the Basecamp dock is a wonderful piece of technology and is a great option for any desktop or nightstand. Currently, I have the dock resting on my desk at work so that my watch and phone both have a place to live during the day. I quickly found that I didnâ€™t have any problems with my phone charging â€“ sometimes a connection isnâ€™t made due to the case thatâ€™s on the phone â€“ and the watch rests comfortably on its charging puck. The nightlight is a really nice touch and offers a soft, abundant light. Something thatâ€™s really nice about the way this dock is designed is that the smartphone docking station has enough space for your phone to rest in either portrait or landscape mode without having to be plugged in.Basecamp offers a really nice option for charging multiple devices at once. Itâ€™s a stylish, functional charging dock that reduces desktop clutter. Itâ€™s priced competitively with other docks in its market space.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"This Mini Power Bank from Oripow packs a mighty punch and is comfortably portable. The first thing you will notice about this battery is its size. Itâ€™s perfect for sliding in your pocket and being on the go. It comes with a carrying pouch and a short (1.5ft) Micro USB cable for recharging. The Mini Power Bank has a 6400mAh battery inside it. That means you can comfortably charge an iPhone 6 2 times and save a tablet for a few hours. For a small package, the Mini Power Bank sure packs a lot inside. Power is distributed intelligently as the battery identifies the type of device plugged into it. There is only one USB port for output. The bonus feature to this battery pack is the built-in emergency light. There is an â€˜ultra strongâ€™ LED torch that provides a very bright flashlight for emergency times. That LED lamp also has an SOS function to it. If you find yourself caught in a situation where you need a light beacon, this could really help out. Since LEDs feature low power consumption, I would assume that you could turn on the SOS flash and it could be on for hours. This is one feature that I didnâ€™t test to its full extent. The light is very bright. The Oripow 6400mAh Mini Power Bank has an exterior aluminum casing with hidden LED indicator lights. Itâ€™s very reliable and travels easily.

"Iâ€™ve given many presentations using tools like PowerPoint. Every time, I used the keyboard or mouse as my method of controlling the presentation. This can present its own set of problems because you end up having to stay behind a podium and canâ€™t move around. In my opinion, a presentation is most effective as a means of presenting speaking points - not novels of text. As such, the presenter is much more dynamic when they donâ€™t have to seem like they are using the podium as a crutch. That means either you need a second person to control the computer, or a remote like this one. This remote actually works very well. It takes one AAA battery, which is included. Set-up was quite easy and even though the instructions state that it is only compatible with Windows-based machines, I tested it out with an Apple MacBook Pro and it worked just fine. Itâ€™s quite responsive and there was no hesitation between when I clicked a button on the remote and when the slides advanced on the computer. This is a very useful tool.Â ""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews.

"With a pretty good season of video game releases upon us, Iâ€™m trying to get all of my gaming gear together. One of the most basic gaming needs is a headset. I have tried many different styles and sizes.  I tend to stay away from wireless headsets because of interference.Sades SA-928 headset was where I started. Itâ€™s advertised for PS3, XBox, and PC, but worked amazingly with the PS4. Before I even plugged everything up I had to try the actual fit of the headset. I wear glasses and most headsets are pretty uncomfortable after a few hours of continuous gameplay. Sades must have had this in mind. The fit of the large cups are firm, but still loose enough to not crush your skull. The padding for the cups also lends a helping hand to comfort.The installation is straightforward. Plug in to the RCA out jacks from the TV and into the PS4â€™s USB slot. The cable is plenty long enough to sit away from the tv during gameplay. There are inline controls for the game volume, chat volume, and microphone mute button. What sets this headset apart is the fact that the actual headset plugs into the volume control box. This is very handy when you get up to run to the fridge and donâ€™t want to take off your gear. As a bonus you can just plug the headset directly into the controller for a chat only capability.My only complaint is the microphone placement and design. I like to have a microphone on my right side and the SA-928â€™s microphone is on the left without the ability to flip front to back. The microphone is flexible, but not quite to my liking.As far as audio quality goes, it loud enough and crisp enough to make any game play enjoyable while drowning out most of the pesky background noises of people telling you that there are more important things than playing video games.The SADES SA928 Stereo Gaming Headset are an affordable, decent pair of headphones.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"While this is a particularly interesting case for the iPhone 6 Plus, there was something that was off for me. When I installed the case on the iPhone, it didnâ€™t seem to provide enough of a â€˜lipâ€™ for the screen. This type of design lends itself to some protection for the screen, but this case is lacking that. Other than that, I found the slim design to be desirable well made. It does have an open style bottom, so all itâ€™s ports are exposed. All in all, not a bad wallet style case.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"Several years ago, we decided to mount the flatscreen TVs in our home. There was one that we wanted as an articulating mount, but the one in our bedroom could be stationary since we didnâ€™t plan on our bed moving. We ended up with a mount very similar to this one. Itâ€™s easy to install and has not faltered in its duty of holding the TV on the wall. The pieces of this wall mount are very sturdy and heavyweight.

"This case is one of my favorite styles of cases. For starters, itâ€™s a wallet, which is convenient because it allows you to carry your essentials and your phone with you at all times. What really makes it unique - and the reason I like it so much - is because the inner bumper case is detectable. It connects to the outer wallet case through magnets. his made this 'nice' case and exceptional one in my book. The problem I have had with wallet cases is that it's hard to have phone conversations with a wallet attached to your phone and some wallet cases don't allow you to use charging docks for the phone.

This case also includes labels and a cleaning cloth as an added benefit. This is a very good buy for anyone who uses multiple memory cards. Plus, it zips up and can be placed into your pocket.

"Iâ€™ve recently become enamored with wireless charging. Itâ€™s not something that I really felt I needed until I actually had it available to me. Now that I do, I canâ€™t get enough of the accessories that are available for Qi wireless charging devices. I recently acquired a charging case for my iPhone that operates through Qi wireless charging. If I didnâ€™t have it, I wouldnâ€™t be able to use these really cool wireless charging devices â€“ like the Mo.Mat Wireless Charger.The Mo.Mat Wireless Charger a bit smaller than my iPhone 6, but about twice as thick. Also, itâ€™s a bit on the heavy side. Iâ€™m not saying that the charger isnâ€™t portable, but there are definitely other Qi chargers in the market that are a little less portly. The Mo.Mat charger gets itâ€™s power via Micro USB. The manufacturer was nice enough to provide two Micro USB cables â€“ one long and one short â€“ in the box with the charger.So, how does it work? Through my testing, I have found it to be a successful charger. I do have a couple of issue with it though. First, the energy exchange between the charger and the device itâ€™s charging seems to create a large amount of heat. Iâ€™ve noticed this with other Qi chargers Iâ€™ve used, but it wasnâ€™t to this great of an extent. The heat does dissipate once the device is removed from the charger, but itâ€™s still concerning as I donâ€™t want any damage to be cause to my device because of it. Because there is an exchange of energy, I would expect some heat, but not as much as I experienced with the Mo.Mat Wireless Charger.The other issue I had with it was the resting platform for the mobile phone. When the Mo.Mat is unfolded and being used as a vertical stand, there is a small trap door that I refer to as the resting platform. The platform has a groove in it to help with stability for your device, but because I have my device in a special case that is rounded, I did have a few issues with it rocking off the platform and falling onto my desk.Overall, I like the concept of this charger, but have some personal concerns with it. It is built well and charges correctly. I feel that the price might be a little on the high end for what this is.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

The handle mounts are very strong and easy to place brooms and mops into. The specs state that the rack can hold up to 70lbs, but I really think that it has a lot to do with where and how itâ€™s mounted to your wall. It seems to be a solid rack and its price is comparable to others in its category.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"For years itâ€™s been my job to decorate my family home for the holidays. That means I unwrap the ornaments when they come out of storage and then wrap them back up for attic storage afterwards. For a long time, I have just been putting them into rubbermaid storage containers wrapped in newspaper and paper towels. I know itâ€™s not the best way to store, but it has worked. Now, I have this awesome ornament storage box. Itâ€™s flexible, but comes equipped with several layers and collapsible dividers that make it an even better organizational tool. It only takes up a space of about 2 square feet, but has space for approximately 27 ornaments depending on size and shape.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve had codes come up in my dashboard and been bewildered by them. This handy little device allows drivers to view diagnostic reports directly from their carâ€™s computer. Itâ€™s easy enough to install. You simply plug it into your ECU port located under your steering wheel. Then, you use an app on your smartphone to connect to it. As it turns out, this was easier said than done. For iOS smartphones, there are a couple of freemium apps available, but in order to have any sort of functionality/control over the ELM327 Interface, you have to spend an significant amount of money to unlock those features. So, even though I was able to plug it into my truck and connect to it through my iPhone, I wasnâ€™t able to actually use the deviceâ€™s features due to the lack of app support.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"This Notebook Computer Lock is a nice theft deterrent system. While it doesnâ€™t completely protect your computer from being stolen, it does make a thief think twice. The lock is actually quite heavy for what it is. Some locks are key locks, but this one is a simple combination lock. The cable measures at 6.2 feet in length, just as advertised. On one end is a silver lock, fitting into a Kensington or â€œK slotâ€ security port. The other end has a fixed wire loop, which allows you to feed the lock end through and tether the device to a fixed structure. It is important to note that this lock will not work if your device does not have a Kensington security slot. This rules out most tablets and newer iMac computers and MacBooks. As Apple has made ever smaller devices, the traditional T lock mechanism for Kensington security locks has been left behind. However, they do make adhesive Kensington ports which would work with many of these devices. At first glance someone may feel uneasy about trusting this as anti-theft, as it seems a hard tug would just pull it out. That is where I was surprised. This is not simply a plastic hole in the laptop, but is in fact metal reinforced. The lock has sufficient swivel and will rotate 360 degrees (the power cable on my laptop blocks some of this range of motion). The cable attaches to the lock perpendicularly and can swivel 180 degrees. This provides a good number of options to sit with this Device comfortably and not find an awkward position. Another concern that I felt was that the cable may be too thin. The cable is twisted giving it more strength and it is approximately 1/4 inch wide with charcoal semi translucent coating. It would take bolt cutters or a saw of some type and time to get through this wire. Time is the deterrent as nobody can snatch the device and run, no grab-and-go. If you have the slot, you will not find a more cost effective, intuitive, theft deterrent system.""This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"The editor of ""Hitler is Alive"" Steven Westlake has collected over 400 pages of stories about Hitler published in the National Police Gazette during the 1950s and the 1960s.  We learn that Hitler fled Germany before the fall of the Third Reich and then found refuge in Argentina, where he and his fellow Nazi's plotted to regain power.It is easy to dismiss the claims made in the Gazette, but how plausible could the stories be.  We know that in today's Internet-connected world, where US security agencies can read and store every tweet, every e-mail, and record every phone call, today's most-wanted evil doer was able to hide out for over a decade.  Could Hitler have done the same in a pre-Internet world?  Don't even get me started on the pyramids as grain silos.Actually, I am not sure that Hitler's escape justifies the 400 pages of this book. The Gazette covered a wide variety of subject matter.  The introductory pages mention other headlines including ""Battle with Corpse-Eating Cats.""

"This Solid Gold Fit as a Fiddle Holistic Dry Cat Food, Pollock flavor, gets five stars because Willy really likes it just as well as his regular dry cat food. Willy loves to do taste tests.

He ate that. I move him back and forth several times. He ate from the bowl that was in front of him. Willy seems to like everything that I give him, but he was certainly pleased by the new food.Willy is a large gray tabby, who now weighs around 13 pounds. When I adopted him, he was a skinny 11 pounds. He had been living on the streets of New York City. After several months of eating only dry food, he became a round 16 pounds.

"As a longtime reader of National Geographic, I am happy to be able to review ""The Old West.""  The over four hundred page work, about 10 x 11 x 1 inch, covers the time period from the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to the end of the frontier, characterized by the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, in 1912.  Today, Buffalo Bill's grave is nearby the Denver-owned Buffalo Herd.  I am happy to say that the buffaloes (really bison) get top billing on the I-70 exit sign.The themes of  exploration, discovery, and settlement are offset by continual conflict: between pro and anti slavery factions, cattle people and homesteaders, and throughout, between Native Americans and those who were taking their land and their ability to survive. National Geographic does not omit key episodes like the massacre at Wounded Knee or the deliberate slaughter of the buffalo, but it is all presented in a glossy once-removed manner. Native Americans are referred to as Indians.  The word genocide is not used. This all appears to rest in the long-gone past, certainly not related to the present..The illustrations are excellent, starting with drawings and paintings for the first half of the nineteenth century, giving way to photographs as that technology came into use in the latter half of that century.  I liked the classic photo of Judge Roy Bean's saloon and courthouse in Langtry, Texas.  The two-page wide prints of Bierstadt's paintings were beautiful.As is obvious, The Old West is a great coffee table book.  However, I think that it is also an educational book that a young person might enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJJDX4FYW5G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142621555X#wasThisHelpful","R1DJJDX4FYW5G5","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The 2016 Fourteeners calendar has some impressive photographs.

I think that the most interesting was the north ridge on Mount Lindsey.  The Wetterhorn is ok if you do not look down.This calendar provides a standard presentation of each month divided into a grid of five weeks. There is also a page for November/December 2015.

"Willy, a grey feline, is my primary focus group for testing Amazon products.  He took an immediate interest in the rug as soon as I rolled it out in front of couch.  He soon decided that it was good for stretching, playing, and then sleeping.  It also matches his color fairly well,The rug provides protection for the floor in a heavy-traffic area. I also find that the rug looks good with my wood floor as a background. It is a nice addition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U1EBY3AWTHBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VXSWTU#wasThisHelpful","R3U1EBY3AWTHBO","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In order to appreciate the beauty that is France, all that you have to do is to watch the Tour de France on TV when it is on in July. You can spend a week or two in any of a dozen regions. I was fortunate to have lived in the Alps for two years doing atomic physics at the University of Grenoble, and, of course, skiing.In my two years in France, I did get to tour the Rhone Valley, Provence, and the Mediterranean coast, first by train, then by bicycle, and then by car.  This is a region well worth visiting.If anything, this Road Trip tries to cover too much territory. In doing so, it leaves out some places of interest that I would have included.  For instance, there is the town of Grasse, north of Nice, which is famous for perfume.Although the road tour passes a few miles from Avignon, it is not mentioned.  In Avignon, there is the Palais des Papes, the old walled city, and Le Pont dâ€™Avignon made famous by the song: â€Sur le Pont d'Avignon, L'on y danse, l'on y danse.â€I recommend starting with this Road Trip book as an introduction. It contains the basics: sights, hotels, and restaurants. Decide what is the most appealing and then get a more detailed guide book for that particular region. It is all good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDB54DE3MRI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607083#wasThisHelpful","RRDB54DE3MRI7","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This toy appears to be well designed with a nice surface for scratching.  It even looks good as furniture. First, I tried this new toy out with my Cat Amazon Focus Group A, Willy.  He is a large grey tabby, around three years old.  Willy is very aggressive when it comes to play. He has liked all of the cat toys that I have given him to test.  At first, this toy got a less than enthusiastic reaction.I put the sphere on the floor for Willy. He circled it once cautiously.  He then smacked it with his paw and ran away.  Next,  I wiggled the tassel for him.  He was willing to chew on it for a few seconds. (First Photo) He then walked away. Last chance: I draped Willy's favorite shoelace over the sphere.  Willy attacked it, even sinking his claws into the sphere for a few seconds.  He then walked away and ignored the sphere after that.Thinking that Focus Group A may have been a too small sample size, I turned to Focus Group B.  This group consists of three cats, Lucca, Honey, and Tilda, who are a few years older then Willy.  They live just down the street. The results with Group B were the same as for Group A.  They were not interested.  Catnip was added to the sphere.  Group B was still not interested. I took the sphere home.Several hours after I got home, Willy rediscovered the catnip-covered sphere.  He actually played with it for a while. (Second Photo)  He seems to come back to the sphere to play.  So, with the catnip, the sphere is a viable toy for Willy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOHGE9WNA687/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO6MKXS#wasThisHelpful","REOHGE9WNA687","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Taken purely as science fiction, The ""War of the Worlds"" strikes a resonance as a story of an alien invasion that comes to a bad end.  The theme is one that has been copied repeatedly in other media.  The radio broadcast by Orson Welles, no relation, is said to have caused listeners to panic. In motion pictures, in addition to remakes of ""War of the Worlds,"" there is ""Interdependence Day,"" where the aliens are defeated by a computer virus.

"The Lonely Planet Route 66 Road Trips Travel Guide is a concise 120-page pocket guide to Route 66.  It has the basics that can be expected from a Lonely Planet book: places to stay, restaurants, local sites, and a map.  There is not a lot of detail past the basics, but it is sufficient for the reader to decide whether to make the trip.  The guide book does intersperse the text with many photographs.Route 66 stretched for over 2000 miles from Chicago to Los Angeles. There is no way that a compact 120 pages is going to have everything  along those 2000 miles, but it is a good way to decide if you want to do the Route, and which regions are the more appealing.I have done only small sections of Route 66.  For instance, we rolled into Winslow, Arizona to look for the park where my friend camped out over forty years ago when he was hitchhiking from Colorado to the Grand Canyon.  We drove around town for a while until we discovered the Monument.  The people of Winslow had erected a  wall of false store fronts with false reflections in the windows dedicated to the Eagles hit â€œTake it Easy,â€ which contains the line  â€œStanding on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.â€  The Monument sits along the old Route 66.At the advice of a local, we walked over to the Posada for lunch. It is one of the Harvey Hotels, like the Bright Angel Hotel in the Grand Canyon.  We also stopped to see Meteor Crater nearby, and then on to Flagstaff.  All of this is in the Lonely Planet Route 66 guide.  Sometimes the best discoveries are the ones that you happen on accidentally, but this guide will point you in the right direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G2GQQBZXZ6GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607067#wasThisHelpful","R1G2GQQBZXZ6GX","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new Hill's Science Diet Cat Food cat food gets five stars because Willy loves it. Willy really likes to do taste tests. My plan was to put samples of his old cat food and the new Hill's Science Diet Cat Food in bowls next to each other for the taste test. As I filled the bowls on the kitchen counter, I accidentally dropped one piece of the Hills on the floor.  Willy scooped it up and then got really excited. He meowed for more.When I placed the bowls on the floor, he went for the Hill's first. I moved him back to the old food.  He ate that. I moved him back and forth several times.  He ate from the bowl that was in front of him. Willy seems to like everything that I give him, but he was certainly pleased by the Hill's. Besides, he looks like the photo on the bag.Willy is a large gray tabby, who now weighs around 13 pounds. When I adopted him, he was a skinny 11 pounds. He had been living on the streets of New York City. After several months of eating only dry food, he became a round 16 pounds. I switched to mostly canned food and some dry food for treats. After a while, he slimmed down to his present 13 pounds.  I intend to keep giving him mostly canned food, but also the new Hill's Science Diet for treats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHX9DCRZXUCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQYGSU6#wasThisHelpful","R2BHX9DCRZXUCG","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I got used to that. There is some aroma, but not too much.  What I found is that the conditioner leaves my hair soft and smooth.  It really fells nice and looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2H3ASPVDU6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UK878#wasThisHelpful","R2A2H3ASPVDU6V","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new Hill's Science Diet Cat Food  gets five stars because Willy likes it just as well as his regular canned cat food. Willy loves to do taste tests. I put samples of his old cat food and the new Hill's Science Diet Cat Food in bowls next to each other. He went for the Hill's first. I moved him back to the old food.  He ate that. I move him back and forth several times.  He ate from the bowl that was in front of him. Willy seems to like everything that I give him, but he was certainly pleased by the Hill's. Besides, he looks like the photo on the can.Willy is a large gray tabby, who now weighs around 13 pounds. When I adopted him, he was a skinny 11 pounds. He had been living on the streets of New York City. After several months of eating only dry food, he became a round 16 pounds. I switched to mostly canned food and some dry food for treats. After a while, he slimmed down to his present 13 pounds.  I intend to keep giving him mostly canned food, including the new Hill's canned food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSLBVKJ8H2MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQYGSRO#wasThisHelpful","R1NSLBVKJ8H2MU","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My primary use for this cup has been to keep my coffee warm.  If I microwave my coffee at the office and leave it in my ceramic cup, it stays warm for about an hour.  Pouring the coffee into the AVEX after microwaving keeps it warm for two hours. Unlike the ceramic, it does not feel hot on the outside even when boiling hot coffee is poured into it. This is also a good indication that it is keeping the coffee warm.Of course, I did try the AVEX with a cold drink with ice added.  It does fulfill its advertised purpose of keeping drinks cold.  So, if it keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, how does it know which is which?As to the blurb ""enjoy every ounce of your favorite beer when you top your favorite '14er,"" I regard this as so much hype. You would not want to lug the AVEX and a beer to the top of a 14,000 foot peak. I did see someone once pop the top of a beer on the summit of Mt. Oxford.  The stuff gushed 20 feet into the air. There was little left to drink, but maybe that was a good thing since alcohol adds to the dehydrating effect of the thin air.Altogether, I like the AVEX for keeping my coffee warm at the office, but I will leave it behind when I go to Colorado in a few weeks to work on my 14er total.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y4MN79QPFA9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT3BHXU#wasThisHelpful","R1Y4MN79QPFA9O","A3FKGKUCI3DG9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FKGKUCI3DG9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Forever Christmas"" is the first full-length collaboration by pianist/composer David Lanz and singer/songwriter Kristin Amarie. Conceived during one of the coldest and snowiest East Coast winters on record (2013/2014), the fourteen tracks feature twelve original Christmas songs plus new arrangements of â€œSilent Nightâ€ and â€œO Holy Nightâ€ that the artists dedicated to their mothers. Only three tracks are all solo piano, but two others are mostly piano with some wordless vocals and a little bit of additional instrumentation. Most of the solos are quite short, much like the â€œangel interludesâ€ on Lanzâ€™s 1994 Christmas Eve. Six are vocals with lyrics and three are instrumental ensemble pieces. David Lanz has been one of my favorite artists since the early 1980â€™s (I still have several of his early albums on vinyl!!!), so Iâ€™m disappointed that there isnâ€™t more of his solo work on this album, but itâ€™s certainly a very pleasant addition to the Christmas music repertoire. The piano and vocals are supported by Grammy winning duo Eric Tingstad and Nancy Rumbel (colleagues from the Narada days) on guitar and woodwinds, cellist Walter Gray, bassist Keith Lowe, and co-producer Gary Lanz.""Forever Christmas"" begins with â€œWinterâ€™s Prelude,â€ a lovely instrumental piece with the full ensemble plus Amarieâ€™s haunting vocals. The title track is a sweet love song that also reflects on the meaning of Christmas. â€œSnow Danceâ€ is one of the piano solos. Spare and very free, itâ€™s a lovely meditation for a cold winterâ€™s day. Amarieâ€™s passionate, crystalline voice really soars on â€œO Holy Nightâ€ - a gorgeous arrangement of one of my favorites. â€œJubilateâ€ is the longest of the piano solos at just over 2 1/2 minutes and is pure Lanz in one of his more celebratory moods. â€œSweet Winter Loveâ€ appears as both a vocal and a shorter instrumental version. The lyrics refer to many holiday festivities as well as to the gift of each otherâ€™s hearts on Christmas Day. â€œWhat Is Christmasâ€ also has vocal and instrumental versions, and this time itâ€™s the instrumental thatâ€™s a bit longer. The melody is wistful and reflective and the lyrics are poignant and kind of sad. â€œWinter Starâ€ is mostly piano, but has wordless vocals here and there for â€œangelicâ€ embellishment. This is my favorite track and shows Lanz at his gentle, introspective best. â€œA Thousand Lightsâ€ features lyrics in both English and Norwegian and some lovely English horn by Nancy Rumbel. This peaceful, flowing arrangement of â€œSilent Nightâ€ is a sung in English and the original German - also a favorite. Tranquil and ambient, â€œHeavenly Peaceâ€ is arranged for piano and wordless vocals and brings the album to a quiet close.

"This is a really nice area heater. My office is in an added-on room in our house, and keeping it warm back there is very difficult. The floor is not insulated and there are big windows, so while it's a beautiful room, it gets very cold during the winter months. I have tried a variety of different portable heaters, but this is by far my favorite. It warms up quickly and is very quiet. (It makes a sound, but it's easy to ignore.) I really like that it has a built-in thermostat as well as a digital thermometer so you know what the temperature is in the room you are trying to heat. It has a full-speed fan setting and a half-speed which is really convenient once you approach the target temperature and don't need it to be operating full-blast. I like to keep the heater either to the side of my desk or under it (it is not a confined area) to keep my feet and legs warm (I hate shoes when I'm home!), and this seems to be working well. The casing remains cool to the touch and doesn't heat up the floor or any rugs that it's sitting on. The carrying handle doesn't get hot, either, so if you need to move it during operation, no problem. I had a little trouble getting the included batteries to work in the remote, but once I got them into exactly the right position, the remote works great. It allows you to turn the unit on and off, adjust the temperature, and to select the fan speed. The compartment in the back of the heater for the cord and remote will be great once the weather warms up again and the heater can be stored. The unit is small enough that storage won't be a problem. This is a great little heater and I've very pleased with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQKZS44LQKOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVUPHMM#wasThisHelpful","R1VQKZS44LQKOX","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that these kinds of gifts are expensive, but for $33 I thought we'd get something REALLY special. Don't get me wrong - this is a very tasty treat, but it's just popcorn, pretzels, yummy caramel, and some Hershey's milk chocolate. Nice combination, but is it worth $33? Hmmmmm. The tin was packaged incredibly well for being non-breakable, but I guess the extra care was so the popcorn brittle didn't get bounced around too much during shipment . I could see this if all of the pieces were of a fairly uniform size, but they vary from BIG hunks to crumbs with a variety of sizes in between. It doesn't appear that there was any attempt at uniform sizes at all. With that in mind, I don't have a clue about how a ""serving size"" is determined to know how many calories you are getting with each piece. There are about 13 200-calorie servings per container, but that doesn't help much. The brittle comes in a tightly-sealed plastic bag inside the tin, but pieces are not individually wrapped, so if the tin is open for any length of time, the rest of the product will get stale. So, to summarize: Is it tasty? Yes. Does it appear to be a gift that would cost $33. I don't think so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242OP46NFGNIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DT06FI#wasThisHelpful","R242OP46NFGNIW","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""All Is Calm, All Is Bright"" is a collection of thirteen familiar and not-so-familiar Christmas carols arranged for solo piano and performed by Jeremy Yowell. â€œFor this project, I have purposefully chosen to arrange with a meditative, reflective quality. Amidst the busyness of the season, it seems like we need a reprieve.... this collection will hopefully offer some much-needed solitude and inner renewal.â€ (quoted from the CD liner notes) This is Yowellâ€™s third album, and as the pastor of a small church in Illinois, it is not surprising that this collection focuses on the traditional sacred songs of the holidays. A masterful and very expressive pianist, Yowell imbues each of these songs with warmth and a clear message of love. Yowell recorded the album at Joe Bongiornoâ€™s Piano Haven Studio on Joeâ€™s wonderful Shigeru Kawai grand, so the piano sound is smooth, clear and beautiful.""All Is Calm, All Is Bright"" begins with a wonderful arrangement of â€œSilent Night, Holy Nightâ€ that is played somewhat slower and more thoughtfully than we usually hear it, focusing on the message of peace and hope within the melody. â€œThe Coventry Carolâ€ refers to the Massacre of the Innocents, in which King Herod ordered all male infants under the age of two in Bethlehem to be killed, and takes the form of a lullaby sung by the mothers of the doomed children. One of the darker Christmas carols, Yowellâ€™s arrangement is both hauntingly beautiful and mournfully sad. â€œThe Holly and the Ivyâ€ is almost unrecognizable, so Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a very different arrangement or an alternate melody. Either way, it overflows with emotion - a favorite. â€œIn the Bleak Mid-Winterâ€ is an  exceptional duet with Melissa Yowell, Jeremyâ€™s wife. I wasnâ€™t familiar with â€œRise Up, Shepherd, And Follow,â€ but it is an African-American spiritual first published in Slave Songs of the United States in 1867. Yowellâ€™s arrangement is sweet and gentle. On the more unusual side, Yowell created a medley of â€œO Little Town of Bethlehemâ€ and Debussyâ€™s â€œReverie.â€ Iâ€™ve heard some interesting combinations of pieces, but this stands out as a favorite - the two pieces fit together seamlessly. The album closes with a heartfelt and very effective arrangement of â€œO Holy Night.â€ Yowell takes the less commanding approach that has become popular the past decade or so, relying on the beauty of the melody to convey the message rather than drama - a peaceful and poignant end to an excellent album.There are some exceptionally good new solo piano Christmas albums this year, and this one is definitely in that category!

"""Myths and Fairy Tales"" is a solo piano album freely improvised in a cabin in the woods near Ash Fork, AZ by pianist/composer/double-bassist Glenn Stallcop. The music was recorded over a three-day period in October 2009, but was only recently released (9/1/15). The five pieces are about the â€œlovely and fanciful Little White Lies we tell our children and ourselves. They fuel our dreams and aspirations, our passions and fantasies. Some become an inspiration; some become an impediment. Many are beautiful; none are real.â€ The titles are fanciful, reflecting their inspiration, and the music is very free and unstructured, sounding and feeling more classical than jazz.Glenn Stallcop is an active and versatile composer who has published more than seventy-five compositions. Originally from Seattle, WA, he earned his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Music from the University of Washington in 1976 and a Masterâ€™s degree in Music from Arizona State University in 1993. The Phoenix Symphony Orchestra has performed nine of his orchestral works and his music is performed by symphonies, festivals, chamber musicians, and youth orchestras around the country. At the keyboard, Stallcop has been active in classical music, jazz, free improvisation and the performance of his own music. After playing classical piano and rock music in his teens, he turned to improv in the 1970â€™s and has performed almost exclusively in free improvisation, both as a soloist and in groups, ever since. Dreamcatcher, his 1998 CD of solo piano improvisation, was nominated for a Grammy in two categories.Appropriately enough, ""Myths and Fairy Tales"" begins with â€œOnce Upon a Time.â€ Sometimes dreamy, sometimes darker and full of longing, the harmonies are complex and often dense, but Stallcopâ€™s expressive playing communicates well. â€œLong, Long Agoâ€ is nostalgic and bittersweet, and quite a bit of it is played in the lower half of the piano. â€œHappily Ever After,â€ perhaps the biggest fairy tale of all, is very open, free, and exploratory. It is also the longest of the five pieces at over 11 minutes, giving it plenty of time to evolve and tell its story. â€œMyth of Self, Myth of Sameâ€ is also quite lengthy at 10 1/2 minutes, taking the initial musical idea in several different directions that are sometimes quietly introspective and sometimes more turbulent. The last track is called â€œRapunzel Turns Ninety,â€ a title that initially seems humorous. However, the piece is not lighthearted, but more serious and reflective, perhaps depicting Rapunzel sitting in her tower thinking about her life and how long it has been since someone has come to visit her. Not so funny at all!If you are looking for some moderately challenging solo piano music, this is a good choice. If it is melodic and soothing that you seek, I suggest listening to some samples first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LARRKQBDNJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014M854LA#wasThisHelpful","R24LARRKQBDNJ7","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Butterfly Rapture"" is SF Bay Area jazz pianist/composer Brian Kellyâ€™s first album since his 2008 ""Afterplay"" and his first solo piano album ever - something Iâ€™ve been looking forward to for a very long time. When I lived in the Bay Area, I had the opportunity to see Kelly play live several times and he became one of my favorite live performers. Iâ€™ve also worked with him by proofing some of his sheet music, so Iâ€™ve gotten to know his music quite intimately and love it. Overall, the music on ""Butterfly Rapture"" has an intoxicating energy but also has many quieter, more reflective moments. Kelly started playing the piano at eight years old, so his composing reflects a lifetime in music and feels as natural as speaking. The twelve pieces on ""Butterfly Rapture"" are a fascinating combination of classical, jazz and new age influences intertwined to give Brian Kelly a unique and original voice.""Butterfly Rapture"" begins with â€œPiano Escapade,â€ a bright and lively piece that (for me) expresses the joy and freedom of getting â€œlostâ€ in the music. It also clearly indicates that this is someone who really knows his way around a piano! â€œRoom For Skyâ€ has a beautiful flowing quality and combines elements of classical, jazz, and new age piano - a favorite. I also really like â€œLilac Horizon,â€ a lyrical beauty with just the right touch of mystery to make it compelling. â€œChasing a Breezeâ€ has a carefree energy that goes in different directions like its namesake breeze would do. Lovely images of an abundance of wildflowers and new grasses gently caressed by a soft wind are evoked by â€œHills in Bloomâ€ - warm and soothing. â€œNikoâ€™s Delightâ€ is a multi-movement piece with a more classical structure that begins with a sweet and simple melody accompanied mostly by blocked chords. The second theme is somewhat more agitated yet beautifully flowing - I really like this one, too! As its title implies, â€œPlaying My Heartâ€ is poignant and sincere, a deeply personal expression - and a very beautiful one. â€œWinter Auraâ€ goes darker to capture the feeling of winterâ€™s chill. Much of the first half of this piece is played in the bass of the piano, becoming livelier and more percussive and then returning to the original theme - cool! Kelly saved the elegant title track for the end of the album. The various runs throughout the piece are crystal clear and intricate while the smoother and more lyrical passages flow effortlessly. Itâ€™s a great ending to a great album!""Butterfly Rapture"" was worth the long wait between albums and is sure to inspire and delight! Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKD1BKN8UUYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167ADWYC#wasThisHelpful","R2BKD1BKN8UUYW","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lights are really pretty and usable all year. I really like the crackle effect inside the bulbs. They have two modes - steady and flashing. The lights are bright, so the flashing isn't for everyone (including me!), but the steady mode is gorgeous. The battery case isn't waterproof, so these lights would be best on a porch or indoors. I plan to put them on the Christmas tree in a few weeks, but they are on my fireplace for now - they're just too pretty to put away! The box they came in is a little confusing, as it says ""length 175.19 Inches (4.6ft)"" - um, no! - and the other side says ""Saffe, power-saving and aco-friendly."" I get the idea, but I don't think these are an American brand as stated on the Amazon page. Anyway, that's a small complaint and doesn't detract from the beauty and convenience of the lights.

"I just recently discovered solar powered lights, and LOVE THEM! I live on the coast, so the star fish lights will be appropriate around the house and yard all year. I do plan to put them on the Christmas tree in a few weeks, but they won't be put away with the other decorations after the holidays. Right now, I have them on my mantel and they look so nice! I have the solar battery in a window, and if I want the lights to turn on before dark or when the lights are on in the room, I just turn the sensor face-down, and they light right up. There are eight different modes from flashing quickly to dimming and coming back up to steady (no flashing), and they are all beautiful. I've had them on all evening the past several nights, and they haven't dimmed at all. I will definitely be buying some more strings of these lights!ONE WEEK LATER: I hate to say it, but these lights are not working very well after a couple of weeks. I have the lights indoors and have been putting the solar battery on the window sill to recharge, but when the lights do come on, they are very dim and don't last long. I either turn the sensor face-down so it ""thinks"" it's dark or put something over it, so it isn't that the room isn't dark enough. I had hoped to buy several more strings of these starfish lights, but must instead lower the star rating. Very disappointed!","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHUX9DV6VCJ0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX7HARA#wasThisHelpful","RHUX9DV6VCJ0U","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these hoses despite the fact that they don't always last very long. They are lightweight and don't kink, and as long as I handle them carefully, they seem to last fine. I bought three this spring for the three faucets around my yards and only one popped. For that particular location, the hole waters an area I would water anyway, so I just get a little wet getting to the faucet to turn it off. The other two hoses have been fine, and I used them daily throughout the summer and early fall. I really like the convenience of not having to unkink them all the time, and they don't take up as much space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A44JCN3RR5V0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPULY5Y#wasThisHelpful","R3A44JCN3RR5V0","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very happy with my new iMac, but the one I bought was brand new, not ""like new."" I've been using Mac's since the little 7"" SE back in the late '80's and have never considered buying anything else. I am currently using three iMacs and a MacBook Pro in my business and am very happy with them. The new one doesn't have an internal disk drive, but I bought external drive for playing CDs and DVDs and am very happy with that. Without that internal hardware, the new iMac is much lighter and easier to move around when necessary. The internal speakers seem to be improved a bit and the screen resolution is gorgeous.

"I have to admit that a garden hose nozzle isn't something I'm going to get all excited about, but this one is REALLY good! It has a heavier construction than the last several nozzles that I've bought and seems MUCH sturdier. The eight settings are not that different from other nozzles, but with this one, the various sprays are much more powerful and distinctive. What I'm the most excited about is the ""jet"" setting which is powerful enough to do a light power-washing that is very effective. I've used it on my windows that are hard to reach by hand, and they come out much cleaner than with my old nozzle. I've used it on the wood siding on the house to remove cobwebs, pine needles, and just plain old dirt. I'm also using it to power wash my wood deck, and it is looking MUCH better. I really like the feel of the nozzle, too. It is coated with a baked-enamel finish that doesn't get slippery when wet. It will also prevent rust. You just can't go wrong with this nozzle!

"I have been drinking Matcha green tea every morning for the past year or so as a supplement and cancer preventative (as recommended in a book I read). I'm not crazy about the flavor of hot Matcha tea, so I've been mixing it with some iced tea mix and drinking it cold. Before I received this Matcha Whisk to review (I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review), I was stirring like crazy as I mixed the ingredients, but had to have a spoon handy when I drank it because so much of the Matcha filtered down to the bottom of the glass. I tried starting with warm water and the Matcha and that worked a little better, but this whisk fixes the problem and with a lot less effort. I still mix the Matcha in a small amount of warm to hot water with the whisk and then add the tea mix, cold water and some ice. The tea gets nice and frothy with the whisk, and I'm sure it would work great with other beverages, both hot and cold. The whisk itself seems like a fairly simple spring-loaded device that should last a long time even with regular usage. The bamboo handle is attractive and feels good in the hand. This is a great gift either for yourself or someone else, and the cardboard tube that it comes in would be sturdy in the mail and easy to wrap.

"""Eight Winds"" is the third release from Canadian finger-style guitarist Bob Ardern. Although I have thoroughly enjoyed the all three of his albums, ""Eight Winds"" is my favorite (so far!). All twelve tracks are original compositions, and three are guitar duets played and co-written with Ardernâ€™s longtime friend Duncan Woodcock. Additional instrumentation is spare, but brings out the very best in the music and lets the guitars (and guitarists) shine in the spotlight. The overall feel of the album is very warm, genuine, and relaxed, although several of the pieces have a wonderful energy. The music is simple enough to provide easy-going background music, but it is also complex and interesting enough to listen to with full attention (and enjoyment) many, many times. A variety of influences are heard in Ardernâ€™s music, blended together to create a unique musical voice that is rich and very satisfying.""Eight Winds"" begins with â€œZephyr,â€ a piece that immediately grabbed my attention. It features Ardern on 12-string guitar and producer David Findlay on bass and piano. Upbeat and light-hearted, it gives the album a buoyant start. â€œMatildaâ€™s Danceâ€ features Ardern on six-string guitar and Findlay on bass and accordion. This one feels a bit more like a folk song with a ballad-style melody that tells an interesting tale of your own choosing. â€œCrusaders and Jestersâ€ is the first of the duets. Originally written in 1973, it was the first piece the two guitarists wrote together. Both play six-string guitars and create the kind of musical magic that can happen when kindred spirits play together. â€œCascadingâ€ is a gently rhythmic and spirited piece that has Findlay adding colorful touches with piano, bass, percussion, cello, and synthesizer - wow! howâ€™d he do dat??? There are two versions of â€œ50 Not Outâ€ - a duet for two six-string guitars and the closing track that features the â€œfull band.â€ Although it is a cricketing term, the title relates to how long the two friends have known each other. The quiet energy of this piece expresses the joy of making music. â€œAnother Time Maybeâ€ is upbeat with a slightly bittersweet flavor. â€œThree Years Onâ€ is the third duet, but is actually a trio with Findlay adding bass, percussion, and glockenspiel to the guitars. Gently rhythmic and a little bit melancholy, itâ€™s a favorite. I also really like the much darker â€œMatushka,â€ which has Ardern on guitar and bouzouki and Findlay on bass, cello, and percussion. Mysterious and poignant, itâ€™s a beauty! The ending version of â€œ50 Not Outâ€ adds bass, piano, and percussion to the two guitars, upping the energy level and leaving us with a great big grin.""Eight Winds"" is a delight from the first note to the last and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2ER4PFN9BEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YXQAC0#wasThisHelpful","R3O2ER4PFN9BEP","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Om Land"" is award-winning producer/guitarist/multi-instrumentalist David Vito Gregoliâ€™s musical meditation on the divine sound. In collaboration with Grammy-winning artist and producer Ricky Kej, percussionist and sound healer Christo Pellani, and singer/songwriter Kimberly Haynes, the project was started with the Om sound as its core, then adding the ambient bed and percussion. From there, Gregoli said, â€œSoloing over it was effortless because the resonance of Om is a calming inspiration. It all flowed very easily.â€The recording is in three parts: â€œSaguna,â€ â€œNirguna,â€ and â€œPranava,â€ with each segment running about twenty-two minutes. The music is intended for yoga, meditation, massage, healing and relaxation and really wasnâ€™t created as musical entertainment. Gregoli, a Buddhist who has practiced yoga and meditation for many years, appears on a variety of guitars, dobro, esraj, keyboards, voice, bass, piano, and percussion (impressive!). Ricky Kej adds strings, keyboard, and the Om chants; Kimberly Haynes provides vocals on â€œNirgunaâ€; and Christo Pellani plays percussion.""Om Land"" was inspired by both the Om mantra and the yantra symbol and has its roots in the artistsâ€™ own spiritual philosophy. Gregoli explains: â€œWithout beginning or end, Om embraces all that exists.... We started with that very personal and yet universal sound and then layered on our musical interpretations.â€""Om Land"" begins with â€œSaguna,â€ which means â€œwith attributes.â€ â€œSaguna Brahmanâ€ implies that God has a name, form and other attributes. For this track, Gregoli chose a nylon-string guitar for its soft and gentle tone. Combined with the light percussion, strings, and Om chanting, this track is quietly hypnotic and very peaceful.â€œNirgunaâ€ translates as â€œwithout attributesâ€ and â€œNirguna Brahmanâ€ implies that God as the Absolute Spirit and Pure Consciousness has no name, form or attributes. For this track, Gregoli chose a dobro, an instrument often used in country music and similar to the Indian lap-steel guitar. The piece is a bit darker in tone and somewhat mysterious, and Haynesâ€™ voice adds an exotic contrast to Kejâ€™s earthy chants.â€œPranavaâ€ means â€œcosmic soundâ€ or â€œOmâ€ - the sound that everything in all of existence makes if one hears it all at once. It is said that Om comes the closest of all sounds to what this hum of the universe is. For this piece, Gregoli uses a finger-style acoustic guitar that gives the music a special voice that is both grounding and ethereal.""Om Land"" is both beautiful and extremely well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJP6PXPCNMJ0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G1ZFF2#wasThisHelpful","RJP6PXPCNMJ0N","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill Leslie returns with the follow-up to his 2013 ZMR Album of the Year - ""Scotland: Grace of the Wild"" - with the equally-enchanting ""Across the Water."" Inspired by a trip to Ireland, Leslie and his talented crew of instrumentalists take us on a magical tour of the Irish countryside and the land of his familyâ€™s ancestry. As an award-winning television news journalist, Bill Leslie has spent much of his professional life arranging and communicating with words, but as a composer/musician, he again demonstrates that he is just as adept at telling vivid and colorful stories without any words at all. The twelve pieces celebrate the places that deeply touched Leslieâ€™s heart as well as his two sisters. Ten of the pieces are original compositions, three of which are new interpretations of songs Leslie wrote and recorded fifteen years ago with the Celtic fusion band Bragh Adair. The band of â€œmerry minstrelsâ€ who accompany Leslie includes pianist/composer Joseph Akins - one of my favorite artists - who plays on nine of the tracks; Leslie very competently fills in on piano on the other three. Other instrumentation includes guitar, Celtic whistles and keyboard (Bill Leslie), bass, accordion, violin, cello, oboe, flute, harp and pipes - all performed by living, breathing musicians who do an exceptionally soulful and heartfelt performance on every track.""Across the Water"" begins with the title track, a wonderful piece that evokes picturesque images of a peaceful yet rugged countryside. Music is often very visual, but I havenâ€™t run across many pieces that are as vivid as this one. â€œThe Boatmanâ€ is a traditional Irish song with a very sad story to tell, and Nancy Greenâ€™s cello just about breaks your heart.  â€œConnemaraâ€ lifts the mood to dreamy and misty. â€œLoricaâ€ is one of the older pieces given a refreshing new makeover. This one is also very visual and seems like it would be perfect in a film soundtrack. â€œGaelic Ghostâ€ tells a â€œhauntingâ€ story without words that becomes more lively and upbeat as the story progresses. â€œCloud of Witnessesâ€ is another older piece given a new treatment. Strings, piano, accordion, guitar and whistles give this a light touch that almost dances - pure musical sunshine and contentment! â€œGougane Barraâ€ goes a bit darker, but expresses a gentle sense of tranquility. Bill Leslie and company close this excellent album with a heartfelt â€œIrish Blessing.â€""Across the Water"" is very likely to win another round of awards for Bill Leslie and I guarantee that it will be on my list of Favorites for the year as well. I give it my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKKBRZ0RDAQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161NDOCK#wasThisHelpful","R2NKKBRZ0RDAQ5","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Elders & Ancestors"" is the first full-length album by Agreliaâ€™s Castle and chronicles their love story and cancer journey. Husband and wife duo, Paul and April Brown, started composing and recording together to create a meditation and relaxation CD for Wind River Cancer Wellness Retreats and discovered that their music spoke to others in a very soothing and calming way. This excerpt from the liner notes explains it best, written by April Brown: â€œThe songs on this CD are very meaningful to me. They have grown from our journey through the cancer landscape. They come from a desire to create peace, joy, and hope in our lives. When I listen to our music, I feel soothed and uplifted. It is my hope that other people, people living with chronic illness or those in caregiver positions, will experience the same soothing, uplifting feelings when they listen to our music. ... This is our humble offering to the world; and for me, itâ€™s a way to give back for all of the help and guidance I have received along the way.â€ The album consists of seven tracks - six originals and a wonderful arrangement of the traditional folk song, â€œWayfaring Stranger,â€ that features the vocals of Grammy-winning Mike Farris. Paul Brown is a Grammy-nominated producer and keyboardist who appears on the album as composer, percussionist and drummer. April Brown co-composed the original tracks and appears on Native American-style flutes, drums, percussion, and vocals. Tom Shinness appears on guitars and cello and Richard Cushing plays sitar on one track.""Elders & Ancestors"" begins with the title track, a 14 1/2 minute instrumental piece with a strong Native American influence. Native flutes, hand percussion instruments, wordless vocals, and keyboards create a peaceful and calming atmosphere with a rhythmic pulse that is both infectious and hypnotic. â€œAdriftâ€ is more ambient and a bit darker. Very sparse and understated, the simple keyboard lines and occasional wordless vocals are mysterious yet soothing. â€œBreatheâ€ begins with the sounds of birds, wind chimes, and the ocean - all very relaxing. When the music starts, it is lightly rhythmic and sometimes playful. Aprilâ€™s lyrics and vocals send the piece soaring, as do Paulâ€™s keyboards and Cushingâ€™s sitar. At almost 12 1/2 minutes, the piece has plenty of time to unfold at a leisurely pace. â€œSpirit Dreamingâ€ features Aprilâ€™s haunting Native flutes and vocals surrounded by beautiful keyboard washes and enhancements. â€œSonnetâ€ begins as a beautiful piece for Native flute and keyboards, gradually evolving into a love song to both life and a beloved person. Tom Shinnessâ€™ poignant cello adds to the deep emotions expressed in the piece. â€œWayfaring Strangerâ€ has always been one of my favorite folk songs, and this 10+ minute version is one of my favorites. â€œAgreliaâ€™s Lullabyâ€ brings the album to a close with a beautiful instrumental piece enhanced by the sound of thunder and rain in the background.Very best wishes to April Brown and many thanks to Agreliaâ€™s Castle for sharing their journey with the world. Iâ€™m sure many will be very positively affected by this music.

"""Fall Into Winter"" is Bryan Carriganâ€™s sixth solo album of original electronic music and is quite possibly his most compelling recording to date. Two years in the making, the album could be described as seasonal (winter), but is NOT a holiday album per se. Carrigan says: â€œNo jingle bells or Christmas covers were harmed in the making of this CD.â€ Capturing the feeling of winter rather than the events that take place during that time period, Carriganâ€™s music provides what could be considered the ultimate â€œchillâ€ album! He expresses the cold and darker tones of that time of year, but also the stillness, beauty, and quiet reflection that seem to come with the slower pace of the season. Well, except for the holiday part, but this music can provide an antidote to the frantic pace that the holidays can bring. The album consists of eleven tracks that range from 3 - 6 1/4 minutes plus a 22 1/2 closing track. Carrigan has worked on the music for a very large number of films, television programs, and recordings in a variety of roles, so this isnâ€™t the kid down the street who bought a new keyboard and proclaimed himself a musician. Carrigan is a master of electronic music and of creating moods and atmospheric qualities. The sound quality is crystal clear but never harsh, and the individual instrumental â€œvoicesâ€ are rich and distinctive.I really donâ€™t have a favorite track on ""Fall Into Winter."" I love the whole album and think it needs to be listened to in its entirety. It begins with â€œThe Calm Before,â€ a haunting yet very beautiful piece that chills to the bone. I can almost feel an icy wind on my face as I imagine standing in the midst of the profound quiet of snow all around. This is NOT a winter scene out of Southern CA! â€œTellings From the Ravenâ€ is a bit more melodic, but just a bit. The rhythm is lively and gently propels the piece as layers of instrumentation flow over the top of it. â€œDeepest of Nightâ€ goes very dark and still with occasional sparks of light that I would assume represent stars. There is a mysterious cast to the piece that isnâ€™t at all threatening or frightening - just dark and intense. â€œA Hundred Winters Oldâ€ expresses majesty and awe while creating feelings of bitter cold and pristine beauty. â€œSnow Dayâ€ is much lighter and more magical, and includes the infectious sound of childrenâ€™s laughter. â€œAfter the Rainâ€ is very still and peaceful - guitar with atmospheric sounds. The playful rhythm that runs through all of â€œBehind the Wallâ€ lightens the mood and counters the darker instrumentation - a magical mix! The epic â€œComparing Snowflakesâ€ is a study in subtlety and stillness, sustaining a mood of quiet chilliness for well over twenty-two minutes.Bryan Carrigan has created a classic masterpiece in the ambient/ new age genres, one that Iâ€™m sure will garner him many â€œBest Ofâ€ awards for the year!  Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIQVTSLXWV9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JXV41M#wasThisHelpful","RPIQVTSLXWV9D","AF74UAKV3Q3W0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF74UAKV3Q3W0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never had mulberries before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I have to say that they were and are a very happy surprise! I'm not a big snacker, but quite often around 10 PM I just want something sweet before bed, so these are great. They are kind of like a raisin, but a little bigger, crunchier, and not as sweet - and look more like a berry. In addition to eating them right out of the resealable bag, I have sprinkled them on top of fruit and vanilla yogurt, and that's REALLY good for breakfast. I love that there are no additives and that these are sun-dried without chemicals. The list of ingredients is quite simple: ""certified organic mulberries (morus alba)."" That's it.

"I LOVE CINNAMON! It's probably my favorite spice, but I had no idea what I was missing until I tried this Kazu Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder. I didn't know there were various kinds of cinnamon, but this one is amazing. It is much richer and deeper in flavor than the spices in a can at the supermarket and is also a much finer powder. It is lighter in color than the usual cinnamon, but it is the flavor that makes such a difference. I have used it on toast with some sugar, sprinkled on fruit and yogurt for breakfast, and baked it into bread pudding, and I am truly ""wowed"" by the flavor. Yum!

"What I liked most about Hyacinth Girls is that it's a more complicated novel than it appears to be at first blush. Yes, it is a story about bullying, but it's a story that treats the issue in a subtler manner, which I think is to its advantage. Bullying is a far more complex issue than it's sometimes given credit for being, and I think this book poses some deeper questions that have a great deal or relevance even to those of us whose teenage years are in the rearview mirror. Some spoilers to follow.One big thing to this novel's credit is that it doesn't strive to make any of its characters entirely likable. This doesn't mean that they're sympathetic, but I admire when authors make their characters flawed and even downright unlikable, because there seems to be a trend today in publishing that demands that we love all characters all the time--unless they're the bad guys of course. How does this have any resonance with the real world, and how does this make literature interesting? Human beings are complicated and often contradictory, so I tend to be far more invested in books that reflect this side of human nature.Both Callie and Rebecca fall under this umbrella. There were times when I felt sorry for them and wanted to them to overcome their obstacles, and there were times when I was disgusted with them. Rebecca suffers from a serious case of willful blindness throughout much of the novel, but isn't this a danger with most parents? It's hard to see your own children objectively, especially when you've known them since the moment they were born and, therefore, tend to think you know everything that's on their minds. I liked that Rebecca sometimes hadn't the faintest clue what was really going on with Callie, especially because I find this very realistic. It's not just that parents will see what they want to see, it's also that, as in Rebecca's case, parents are sometimes so stressed about doing the right thing and being the best parent they can be that to face up to any shortcomings in their children would mean they would have to face their own failures. That's painful, to say the least.As for Callie, though she isn't a perfect person, I did feel sorry for her. It was easy to understand why she felt as trapped as she did, and even why she reacted as she did--not that it made her behavior excusable. Adults tend to acknowledge that children feel intense pressure to conform, but they often fail to understand that they face a lot of the same pressures. After all, how many of us tend to tailor our behaviors because we know that if we act otherwise we'll upset someone we don't want to upset. In some ways, we're all pretending, and I think the strength of the book is that it explores this theme. It's not just children who bully, but adults as well, and I think that's a very important point. There are many times when adults tell children one thing and then act in a manner that's contrary, and I think it would behoove us all as a society if we thought deeply about that.Unfortunately, for me, the book slipped on a downward slope toward the end. It's not so much that I wanted a worst-case scenario ending, but the ending that I did get felt a little too sitcom for me, wrapping everything up in a neat box. Yes, the characters suffer and there are consequences, but the ending seemed to me to be stretching a bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZI69J6N3333/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341805X#wasThisHelpful","R2EZI69J6N3333","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Absolutely, scorchingly phenomenal. Easily one of the best young adult books I have ever read.""...men have the necessary experience and intelligence to choose better for you than you could choose for yourself.""And that, dear reader, will be the jumping-off point for my entire review, which will contain spoilers because there is so much about this book that begs for discussion. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a searing, brilliant depiction of what it means to grow up female, but don't read any further if you don't want the details of this brilliant book revealed to you.If you're still with me, buckle up. This is going to be a very long, bumpy ride.First off, I think it's important to note that I read a ton on the subject of feminism. I am a proud feminist, and I'm open about that--I don't shy away from ""feminist"" as a label. The reason I mention this is not so much because this is a feminist novel (which it most certainly is), it's because, given that I've read many books on feminism, coupled with endless articles on feminist issues, this book was, for me, like a distillation of everything I've read about feminism. Trying to shove this book into a genre box might result in it being called dystopian or some other variation of sci-fi, but in my opinion this book isn't that at all. It's something of a satire, holding a mirror up to society and relaying what the mirror depicts with some embellishment. Yet while this book does exaggerate things, it also doesn't. Maybe all the women in the world aren't designer babies, and maybe they aren't being raised in schools where they're explicitly taught that their only worth lies in what they can provide to a man, yet, in many ways, that is exactly what's happening in our society today.There are so many themes that run throughout this book, but the strongest one centers on the girls' physical experience. Their school isn't a school so much as it is a factory churning out designer sex objects. The girls at this school can't read, and why should they? Their only real purpose is to be ornamental. They're weighed on a daily basis, subject themselves to painful and uncomfortable ""beauty"" procedures, agonize over their clothing and makeup choices, and constantly compare themselves to other women, wondering how they measure up. That doesn't sound all that far-fetched, does it? The women of the present day routinely wax themselves, use copious amounts of beauty products, get plastic surgery, and bleach unspeakable areas in order to meet an undefined standard of beauty. As the Father (who I think is basically patriarchy personified) reminds the girls in a video they are shown in class, ""...you may be perfectly designed, but there is always room for Improvement.""This relentless pursuit of an unattainable ideal of perfection seeps into every facet of the girls' lives, including how they interact with one another. Every time the girls would gather to do one of their tear-down sessions, in which they insulted themselves and then waited for the others to protest, I couldn't help but think of the searingly hilarious Inside Amy Schumer skit ""Compliments"", in which a group of female friends literally cannot cope when one of their fellow friends accepts a compliment on her jacket with a simple, ""Thank you!"" That skit got so much attention because it, like this book, is tapping into something that's a regular, everyday occurrence for many women.And yet, even though the women in this book are supposedly perfect, genetically engineered and produced to be beautiful, thin, and free of any ""undesirable"" traits, they are never quite good enough. Girls and women deemed defective are sent Underground, where they serve as lab rats for male scientists who are always working to continue to refine their techniques, always attempting to create better models. Again, I see so many parallels here between the book's world and our world. Cosmetic companies are multi-billion dollar industries, and if women didn't feel they had ""flaws"" they needed to ""correct"", would those industries make anywhere near as much money as they now do? At younger and younger ages, girls are being coached in ""self-care"" in the form of using a variety of beauty products. Fashion magazines and TV shows are awash in advice about how women can improve their looks, what exercises they can do to fix their ""problem"" areas, what clothing they can wear that will highlight or camouflage their thighs, hips, bust. There's nothing wrong with wanting to care for yourself, with enjoying cosmetics or other enhancements, and with dressing in a way that makes you feel attractive. What is wrong is the way the conversation is framed, the underlying messages that ""there is always room for Improvement.""Is it any wonder that the girls in the book have such unhealthy attitudes about their own bodies? Eating disorders have been normalized to the extent that the girls are given medication to help them throw up if they've ingested foods from the ""Fatgirl buffet"". They take other drugs to help them regulate their caloric intake, and if they gain weight they are sentenced to exercise on machines that scream abuse at them to ""encourage"" them to work harder. Sound like any TV shows you can think of? How about ""fitspo""? The message that fat is bad is relentlessly drummed into the girls, in the form of movies (The Eternal Fat girl), songs (""Big girls...don't get the guy-yi-yi""--by a group called ""the slutz"", no less), and social media. The girls constantly take pictures of themselves and upload them to their ""MyFace"" pages. In class, they step into glass boxes while the other girls examine their bodies and deliver advice and criticism, their voices scrambled to ensure anonymity. They're encouraged to use sites in which they pit themselves against one another to figure out who's hotter, who wears an outfit better. Again, sound like something you could easily find on the internet nowadays?The book's tackling of sex is brilliant as well, because it makes so little sense. Divided into three tiers, every girl will ultimately become a companion (read: wife and mother), a concubine (essentially a sex slave), or a chastity. Girls aspiring to companion status are supposed to be beautiful and have flawless figures, but they're also supposed to be ""good girls"". They're never supposed to refuse the whims of the men they serve, but they aren't supposed to make themselves available to anyone but the man who chooses them, and they are certainly not supposed to express any of their own desires or wishes. Concubines are expected to fulfill the every whim of the men who hire them, but they have no agency over their own bodies or their own desires. And the chastities are just that, chaste, responsible for schooling the younger girls and taking care of other background tasks. When you think about the mixed messages we send both young girls and boys about sex, is it any wonder it's so confusing to them?TV doesn't get a pass here either. One of the girls' favorite shows is Chilling with the Carmichaels, a show that chronicles the adventures of cassie and carrie (an aside: the lack of capitalization when it comes to female names is another brilliant device, yet another reminder of how little these individual girls matter). When Charles, carrie's Inheritant, feels she's being too chummy with a friend of his, he breaks her nose and two ribs on a live broadcast, an event about which the girls are incredibly blasÃ©. ""He's yummy. I'd let him beat me any day,"" one of them remarks. If that doesn't disturb you, I don't know what will. On another show, two companions rip into women who choose to bottle feed rather than breastfeed. They're quick to add that, while breastfeeding is best, women should be sure to do it in private. kate, who received a number one ranking seven years prior, is rewarded with her own show, What kate Did Next. And, of course, the girls are exposed to pornography, because they're expected to know how to please their men, after all. Everything they watch centers around women tearing one another down, or submitting to brutality at men's hands, or ostentatious displays of wealth, all the better to encourage them to work hard to become number one, so that they'll be chosen by a man with high social standing.Lest it seem that this book is one-sided, life isn't a picnic for all of the men either. (And LGBTQ people don't exist, because they're labelled ""Aberrant"", and the geneticists ruthlessly work to engineer them right out of existence.) We don't see as much of what non-conforming men go through because the book takes place in a closed environment in which men are prohibited, but it is there. Darwin, the choicest Inheritant, chafes against his father's strictures, yet laps up his father's praise like a kitten would a bowl of cream. He suffers several injuries throughout the course of the book, all of which are implicitly attributed to his father, and yet Darwin would stop at nothing to please the man. Even so, he never quite measures up, even when he does exactly as his father wants him to do, destroying freida, about whom he seems to care. As he and his father leave, his father feigns fondness for his son by tousling his hair, pulling away in disgust and saying, ""Hair gel? You can be such a girl at times, Darwin."" Boys are constantly fed the message that to be feminine is the worst of all insults, that they should strive to attain a hyper-masculine standard. Even boys, the book shows, suffer at the hands of patriarchy.I'm astounded by all this book manages to pack into its pages. It is not an easy or pleasant read, but it is wholly compelling, and I think it's a necessary. I read a lot of YA lit, and so much of it contains messages that I find so damaging, messages about girls rescuing ""broken"" boys, tacitly accepting their abuse. Messages that the sexiest men are hyper-masculine bad boys, not the soulful, thoughtful guy living next door. Books like Only Ever Yours are so necessary precisely because myths about girlhood and boyhood continue to be perpetuated, even though every day there is mounting evidence of the damage it does to boys and girls alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUOS5SJ28FTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7X62DU#wasThisHelpful","R2BUOS5SJ28FTI","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it kept me turning pages, needing to uncover the layers of mystery buried within it. It was suspenseful at times, but it also had some lovely descriptive passages about the setting, and I enjoyed its contemplative moments. However, in the end, it just didn't come together for me the way I would have liked it to. Spoilers to follow as some major plot points are relevant to why the book didn't work as well as I felt it should have.This book is really a combination of two things: a suspense novel and a novel about the difficult intricacy of a romantic relationship. This sort of makes it sound like romantic suspense, which it definitely isn't. Both the suspense element and the psychology of the romance worked for me, but they didn't mesh together. In a lot of ways, the suspense part of the book is more there to propel the necessary revelations that will test the strength of Liz's and Dante's bond, and I felt the book was the lesser for it.I liked Liz's character. She's made some serious missteps in her past, and it's left her with a good case of neurosis, something I thought was understandable. I liked the way the book wove together all the complex threads of her life, from her difficult upbringing to her strained marriage to her ambivalence about her relationship with Dante. The weight of Liz's emotions was very real to me, and she felt like a human being, one who was flawed, who had missteps, who did stupid, self-sabotaging things, all while kind of knowing she was sabotaging herself. I thought her portrayal was very complete and felt very authentic, which was definitely the novel's strong point.The weak point was the Root brothers. As I read, I kept waiting for some big revelation, for something to happen that would tie them to Liz's life. A lot of times I felt like maybe the author intended them to be symbolic, like their presence was meant to represent the savagery of the wilderness, a savagery that's meant to force Liz to strip aside all of her justifications and petty self-deceptions, face up to the truth, and let everything out rather than continue to spin webs of lies and omissions. I think that could have worked, but because they were real and not a figment of Liz's imagination, they needed some reason for being where they were and doing what they were doing. I could have bought the randomness of their presence, could have accepted that coincidence was what had led Liz to cross their paths, but their presence feels far too necessary to the narrative for that. Were they not there, would Liz have done the self-examination she did? Would she have been honest with Dante? I'm not convinced she would have, and so in that way the Roots felt more to me like the heavy hand of the author than like characters who made sense in the story. They're like a bridge, stringing together the scenes where Liz stop lying and evading and forces herself to face the music. This robbed something from the book because it made the sense or urgency feel like a plot device rather than something organic to the book.It's a shame because I thought the writing was otherwise strong. I really like novels like this, where I get deep into the psychology of the characters. Liz's story would have been compelling to me without the Roots' presence, and this made the novel feel like it was awkwardly straddling two genres. I think I would have liked it better had the author chosen to let Liz's story shine, had Liz's journey not been so fraught with physical danger, since the mental danger seemed more than enough to carry the story.I didn't dislike this book, but it wasn't everything I wanted it to be either. Still, I do like seeing authors take risks, and I'm also a fan of genre blending and bending. I'd be interested in reading more from this author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSNZIEZYOOCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472144#wasThisHelpful","R1CSNZIEZYOOCQ","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure most parents can identify with this dilemma: the endless quest to get your kids to eat better. It takes time, patience, and some more patience. One of my biggest tools is involving the kids in menu planning and meal prep, so I am always on the lookout for good children's cookbooks. It's not that they can't use adult cookbooks. They do, but the children's cookbooks we own are laid out in a way that appeals to kids, and they provide additional details and information that can be very helpful to budding chefs.This book is divided into the following sections: Before you Begin, Breakfast, Soups and Salads, Light Bites, Main Meals, Desserts, Cakes and Muffins, Cookies and Bars, Bread, and Party Time. Naturally, my kids always race right to the dessert sections, and I let them indulge in that. Then we start planning dinners, which diverts their attention to sections like Main Meals or Light Bites, and I let them choose a recipe that they want to try. So far, we've tried three recipes from the book:- Lamb Kebabs - We subbed chicken here because we didn't have lamb, and we omitted the apricots from the couscous because we didn't have those either, but otherwise we followed the recipe. The chicken and vegetables were delicious. The marinade gave them a nice, light citrusy flavor with a subtle hint of spice. The kids initially balked at the idea of raisins, nuts, and onion in their couscous, but after explaining to them that it was like a couscous salad, my five-year-old announced that it was a really good. And it was. The sweetness of the raisins and crunch of the nuts added a nice contrast to the chicken and vegetables.- Bruschetta - My eleven-year-old likes tomatoes and mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, so this recipe caught her eye. She flipped the page and found the ""Four ways with bruchetta"" section, realized we had everything we needed for the crisscross ham version and asked if she could make them. She handled all of the prep herself, and then I popped them under the broiler. They were delicious, and she asked if she could make them again the next day. We've since eaten them one other time. The quality of ham and cheese that you use will make a big difference in the outcome, but what I really liked about this recipe was that it got my daughter interested in and motivated to make her own meal.- Sausage hotpot - My husband and I loved this. My five-year-old chose it, and he did give it a fair go, though he mostly stuck to the sausage. My daughter wasn't happy about the beans, but my husband and I pretty much vacuumed it up. I used Granny Smith apples, which gave the dish nice flavor, and by the time they came out, they were soft, tender, and not too sweet, an excellent substitute for something like potatoes. The combination of ingredients sounded a bit strange, but the end result spoke for itself. As we ate the leftovers the next day, I told my husband that the next time I make this dish I'll double the recipe, that way we'll have more leftovers next time around.There are still many other recipes I want to try, and the kids enjoy looking through these. There are lots of bright, appealing pictures of the dishes. This isn't necessary for me, but it does work nicely for the kids because it gets them looking at the end product, observing how all the ingredients work together. In addition to the pictures of the finished dish, each recipe includes pictures of each step, illustrating for children how to chop strawberries for a smoothie, and how to pour marinade over shrimp kebabs. All of the photos are bright, appealing, and pleasing to look at, which makes this book a real pleasure to browse through--just don't do it on an empty stomach, unless you enjoy torturing yourself.The opening section of the book is very nice. Rather than just listing common kitchen tools and gadgets, it has pictures of each, so that kids can see what a whisk or a plastic spatula looks like. The book also includes an explanation of different ways to cook, everything from frying to broiling to grilling, and there's a picture of each method to give kids an idea of what that method looks like in action. There are also illustrations of how to prepare ingredients (chopping, peeling, etc.) and of baking techniques (whisking egg whites, making a piping bake, etc.)This book makes a very welcome addition to our library of kids' cookbook titles, and I think it would make an excellent gift for young chefs-to-be or kids that need a little coaxing to get them more interested in food prep and nutrition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NEEP6MEVZ840/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465435468#wasThisHelpful","R1NEEP6MEVZ840","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you read a book like this, you need to plan on being angry by the time you finish. I thought I was prepared for that. Reading the book description alone was enough to tell me that I was going to be very outraged over the atrocity committed, but it didn't prepare me for the weird legal labyrinth later chapters would describe. Given the current climate as far as police abuse goes in modern-day America, it's becoming increasingly difficult to be convinced that the justice system works. Were it not for events in Cleveland, Ferguson, and New York, I might have thought a crime like that described in this book was an isolated incident. I would say ""would that it were"", but what happened in New Orleans should never have happened, just as what's happened elsewhere in the U.S. should never have happened. By journalists bringing these events into the light of day, I can only hope that vast changes and improvements are on the horizon.This book is very difficult to read at times, as it should be. Some serious discomfort is what people need to feel in order to be compelled to demand change. There's nothing lurid in this book, but reading the matter-of-fact account of what happened to the victims of the Danziger Bridge assault is stomach-turning. It's the sort of thing you could imagine happening in a warzone, not in a supposedly civilized country with a rule of law. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances, but I don't find them to be an excuse in any way. While I admire those law enforcement officers who stayed behind to help the citizens even as their chain of command collapsed, there is simply no excuse for what happened on the Danziger Bridge. I understand why the officers' defense attorneys took the tack they did, emphasizing how their clients had risked their lives in staying to help out, and describing the trauma and chaos they experienced in the wake of the hurricane, but what they suffered was no different from what the victims suffered, yet none of these innocent people seized assault weapons and opened fire on innocent civilians.And what does it say about our police forces that they are wielding assault weapons, regardless of circumstance? Isn't that a job for the National Guard? Had the officers not had such weapons, maybe at the very least they would have caused a whole lot less pain, suffering, and trauma to the Bartholmew family, to the Madison family, to JJ Brissette. Had they not felt they had such overwhelming firepower at their disposal, maybe they would have taken the time to assess the situation, to shout out a warning to the innocent victims, to do anything but what they did do. Police officers may receive weapons training, but they are nowhere near equipped to be patrolling with assault weapons. That is a job for those with military training, and even they have been known to forget their training and commit horrible acts in the heat of the moment. The NOPD officers had no business whatsoever being armed as they were. It doesn't matter that the department didn't provide them with those weapons. They may as well have, given that they provided the officers with the tactic approval to carry them.Race cannot be taken out of the equation either. The fact is, there is no way of knowing what the officers might have done had a group of white people been crossing the bridge after they received the shots fired call. But the U.S. does need to do some serious soul-searching and does need to vigorously question why members of minorities are so very disproportionately represented in prisons and in prosecution. Greene offers some statistics as to the number of people arrested in the hurricane's aftermath, and the numbers speak for themselves. What does it say about our country when the people who are responsible for large-scale murder on American soil (what happens overseas is a whole other matter that needs a great deal of consideration) fall into one of two categories: mass murderers or police officers? What does it say about our country when whites and minorities use drugs at about the same rates, but prisoners imprisoned on drug-related charges are far and away more likely to be members of a minority?Egregious as what these law enforcement officers did was, what happened in the courts was a massive failure of epic proportions. The fact that one judge could have such enormous power is frankly scary. We love to tout our legal system, to blather on about how great it is that we're judged by a jury of our peers, yet what's the point when a judge can just go right ahead and set aside a jury's verdict? I know those checks are supposed to be there to protect against abuse, but who protects victims against judicial abuse? What Judge Englehardt did comes across as his personal vendetta against the Justice Department, which led to a one-man crusade to right what he saw as DOJ's wrongs. Yet what about the victims of the crime? It's as if their suffering mattered a whole lot less to the judge than did the sweet plea deals some of the offenders received, as if the judge would rather free convicted murderers than stomach the idea that some of those murderers got off with lesser sentences. While I agree that this is a serious flaw in our legal system, it's unconscionable that the victims should have been so repeatedly denied the justice they fought so hard to try to win.This book left me feeling nothing but disgust and fury toward the legal system as a whole. On behalf of the victims, I feel a hopeless sense of desolation. How many times can people be victimized by the very system that purports to protect them? I find it exceedingly hard not to lose faith in our democracy when such undemocratic acts occur. They're an offense against our very country and against the basic ideals of human justice and dignity. If there is any good at all that can come out of these situations it's that maybe, just maybe, Americans will care enough to demand better, that maybe they will decide that ALL human life is worthy of dignity, and that they will fight to ensure that atrocities like this never again happen to another person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34L5E6D4B0E3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807033502#wasThisHelpful","R34L5E6D4B0E3N","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of microfiber clothes in general and like using them for household cleaning and dishwashing. I'd never tried using microfiber dishtowels before, though, so I was eager to see how these would stack up.Laundering them was easy. I did them in hot water along with my other dishtowels and cloths, and dried them on high using the towels setting. They came out looking perfect, and didn't bleed onto my old towels at all. The stripes are nice, and the colors are a little more vivid than the pictures suggests, especially the one with the turquoise/teal stripe running down it. I especially like the look of the charcoal and gray towel.The one thing to know about microfiber if you've never used it before is that it has a tendency to stick to dry skin, which can make it feel strange to handle. These towels are no exception. It's not a major complaint, but they do cling a bit to any rough areas on your hands.I don't plan on using these to scrub as I have smaller, designated microfiber cloths for that, but the thing to know is that the microfibers give cloth very good scrubbing power. I've had my dishcloths for quite some time, and when my mom used them while at my house once, she asked where I got them so she could go out and buy some of her own.Most impressive for me was how nicely these dried my dishes. My other towels are mostly the typical thin, sack towels. While I like them because they don't leave any lint behind, they're not very absorbent. These towels are also lint-free, but they're much more absorbent, which meant I could dry more dishes with a single towel, and they dried my dishes nicely without leaving streaks. I'm very pleased with these and will reach for them first whenever I have a particularly large load of dishes to do as it's nice not to go through two or more towels in a single marathon session.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NGZD7Y6RBA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQYFQES#wasThisHelpful","R19NGZD7Y6RBA5","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this stickvac. My house has very little carpeting as most of its flooring is laminate, tile, etc., and for a long time I spent far, far too much time trying to keep my floors clean with regular old brooms and Swiffers. Brooms are always a hassle, but were necessary for crumbs, bits of playground wood chips, etc. The Swiffer did a great job of getting up dust and hair but was useless when it came to larger debris. Since I had to use both in concert, it meant I was spending twice as much time taking care of my floors.Finally, I clued in on the stickvacs, but I wasn't sure what the differences were and didn't want to invest a lot of money in one, so I bought a fairly cheap corded model. I quickly found it worked far better than the broom and Swiffer combo, was faster, and generally streamlined things for me. However, it didn't have a detachable unit, so I couldn't use it to vacuum crumbs off tables, chairs, etc., and the cord meant I had to plug and unplug as I moved from room to room in the house.Not anymore, thanks to this beauty. I charged it up and then zipped around my entire house without having to stop. Since the head swivels, it's far easier to maneuver than my old one, with its straight head, and it gets into some of the harder-to-reach areas I couldn't get to with the old unit. Plus, since I have no cord to trip over or move around while vacuuming, it's much easier and much more convenient to get it where I want it to go. As far as suction goes, it's very good and easily pulls up large crumbs and the aforementioned playground chip debris. As long as whatever I'm trying to get at isn't sticky, this stickvac works like a dream. It's not just the large pieces it gets, either. It grabs the small bits with ease, even when they're up against the baseboards.And now when I need to get at couch cushions, tables, etc., all I have to do is detach the hand unit, which makes this two tools in one. It also comes with an extension you can attach to the handvac to make the nozzle longer, and has a brush that can be used on upholstery, stairs, etc. The only downside to the handvac is that it is a bit heavy and the head is so large that it can't fit, say, in the space between the bottoms of my cabinets and the floor. However, with the extender, I can get at this area, and the head of the stickvac is also compact enough to fit into this space.The convenience and power of this vac can't be beat. It's a bagless unit, which means things can get pretty gross and dusty when you empty the canister out, so you may want to consider doing that outside, but it also saves time, money, and waste because you don't have to deal with bags. The sides of the canister are clear, and I was amazed--and pretty disgusted--by what I saw in there the first time I used it on my seemingly not-too-dirty floors.

"Major spoilers ahead, folks. Read at your own risk.What is it with these YA books that cause me so much cognitive dissonance? I find it so bizarre when I read a book, adore it, eagerly anticipate the sequels, and am ultimately left dazed and confused, wondering how the heck I got here in the first place. It's like I got on a plane to go on a trip to Paris but when I disembark I find myself slogging through sewers. I'm very sorry to say that Penryn and the End of Days fits this bill. The first book was so amazing, and I loved it and gushed over it so much that I keep wondering if I was hallucinating or something, because I sure don't want to gush over this book. Where the second book was disappointing, this one was a complete letdown.What happened to Penryn? When did her personality transplant occur? I don't remember too much about the second book, other than that I didn't like it much and was afraid it was going in a bad direction, so I can't speak to her character in that book. I do remember, though, that the character in this book bears very little resemblance to the character in that first book. Penryn goes from hard and kick ass, responsible for protecting her family, to a self-absorbed lovesick teenager. What gives? I could totally understand her feeling some ambivalence about the drastic change her sister has gone through, and this book gives some lip service to Penryn's wanting to save her, but mostly she doesn't worry about it because she's too busy mooning over Raffe.Why? Why do YA novels do this constantly? Yes, we're idiots in love, and, yes, love can make us do stupid things, but when young women are dedicated to something and committed to it, falling in love is not going to make them chuck everything else away with both hands. I really hate when authors sell female characters short like this. I really hate when they continue to reinforce the message that the most important thing in a woman's life is to be loved by a really, really hot guy. I'm not saying that people don't make sacrifices for love, because they do, and sometimes women do give up everything for someone they love. What I am saying is, does it occur to YA authors ever that it's possible for women to find a balance? To be in a meaningful, passionate relationship yet still manage to be focused on other goals? If you read YA, you wouldn't think so, and yet real world examples are plentiful.I was so frustrated and sometimes angry with certain aspects of this novel. The biggest, most egregious example comes about when Penryn manipulates Raffe's hand so he's fondling her while he sleeps. This is not okay. Ever. Under no circumstances is this behavior okay. Period. Ever. She does not have the right to willfully violate him by having him do something he's made clear he doesn't want to do. If the situation were reversed and she woke up to his having manipulated her into fondling him, I can imagine the uproar. Yet this book makes it sound like it's okay because she's a woman and he's a man and men always want it? No. No, no, no, no, no. No.Eventually, though, she somehow manages to wear Raffe down because, again, apparently people in books are never ever able to sacrifice their romantic inclinations for their larger ambitions or beliefs. Whatever. That aside, I could not get over how insane I thought it was when, trapped in a hellscape from which they must escape or face eternal torment and torture depicted in very graphic terms, Penryn and Raffe take advantage of being alone to make out. What? In what reality would anyone facing mortal peril decide to get frisky rather than trying to figure out how to save their own skin? If you're going to add romance to a book like this, it needs to be done in quiet moments, when the characters have a breather from the constant danger in their lives, not when they're in the middle of a dire situation. It's nonsensical.So many other elements of the book take a backseat to Penryn's annoying swooning over Raffe. She does feel twinges of conscience here and there, but they never stop her from doing idiotic things, nor do they instill in her a sense of urgency to actually act. The plot basically consists of Penryn and co rushing from one disaster scenario to another all while Penryn thinks about how great Raffe's abs are. It gets old very quickly because I never once had the sense that I ought to worry about any of it. I don't need to worry when locust husks burst out from the ground during the show Uriel puts on, because Penryn is more concerned with how magnificent Raffe looks. I don't need to worry about Penryn, Raffe, and his warriors being trapped by Pit bosses because Raffe is just so darn hot. I don't need to worry about Penryn's sister possibly starving to death because Raffe's wings really need to get sewn onto his back before they wither completely. Yes, secondary characters are there, but they exist on the periphery of Penryn's consciousness because her main concern is always Raffe. What happened to the girl in the first book, the one who was willing to face off against an angel so that she could save her sister? Oh, right, she's now busy swooning over that angel and so has no time to be as concerned about Paige's condition as she should be.It's so obvious that this book has shifted from a post-apocalyptic narrative to a romance novel, which makes so many other elements feel forced. Tweedledum and Tweedledee really got on my nerves because their ""banter"" never comes close to feeling organic. They're there to add color, to help smooth the edges of the unrelentingly graphic and grotesque nature of what's happening in the book--not that any of that matters because, again, Raffe is hot. The twins felt so stereotypical to me, and their behavior was flat-out annoying.I won't go into the ending. I just can't. I was consumed with disbelief when I read it. I tried really hard to ignore that, to look at the talent show as being an out-of-the-box plan, but I just really failed. There were many opportunities for humanity to shine at other stages in the book, but it never does. Instead, it puts on a talent show at zero hour. How this was a legitimate battle plan, I'll never understand. Humanity makes its last stand courtesy of ballet and acoustical guitar performances, with a little help from stage lighting and really loud rock music. Yeah, that happened.So why two stars instead of one? Well, there are some things I think this book did right, which makes everything wrong with it all that much more disappointing. For one, I like that the humans in the book don't all get along and band together. I like that Penryn is still capable of looking unflinchingly at humanity, knowing it's often bad and selfish and mean, but still doesn't deserve total annihilation. I like that she understands that Raffe's objectives might not mesh with hers, and that she gets why he feels that way. I just don't like that it leads to her doing stupid, stupid things. I like that the ending isn't all unicorns and rainbows, that the world is crappy and has a long way to go. There's an intense realism to these books that I admire, especially when plenty of other YA airbrushes the bad, pulling things back just enough that it doesn't get too scary or bleak for its characters.This series had so much potential that it's especially painful to see it all wasted. It's not that the romance shouldn't have happened, it's that the romance was poorly done within the world's context. It's that, while the book does go into some interesting moral questions, none of that is given any real page space or substance because it's quickly pushed aside in favor of standard, run-of-the-mill teen romantic angst. This series could have been so much more, but instead it's relegated itself to the realm of the forgettable and generic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IBV1SD112M5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ26CQY#wasThisHelpful","R29IBV1SD112M5","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find this book very perplexing. If memory serves me, I felt many of the same emotions when I finished The Fault in Our Stars, and so it leads me to wonder if maybe I just don't fully get John Green. On the one hand, this book was fantastic and so engrossing I had trouble putting it down. On the other, it was banal and far-fetched, and kind of cliched. Green's storytelling powers are quite strong, but ultimately, as with TFIOS, this book deflated like a disappointing souffle. Some spoilers to follow.In one respect I did think this book was superior to TFIOS: the dialog between the characters sounded a lot more feasible to me. There's something about the way Green does the dialog in this book that just sounds right. The teens in TFIOS sometimes sounded weirdly pretentious and overly adult, but in this book, I bought their interactions. Their conversations sounded like conversations, complete with run-ons and genuinely hilarious moments, in which characters concoct elaborate sentences just for the sake of amusing one another. Quentin is something of a pedant, but Margo points this out to him, and it goes a long way toward humanizing him.The characters in general were well done--except for Margo. Because Q is so level-headed and focused on his future, I found it very difficult to imagine he would go to the lengths he goes to in order to try to unravel the mystery of what has become of Margo. The two have so little interaction for a stretch of nine whole years that I really couldn't buy into his sudden overwhelming obsession with her. Yes, he has always nursed a crush on her, but it didn't seem all that powerful to me. After all, he still managed to do really well in school and maintain a good relationship with his friends. Had Margo not left Orlando, I could have bought him falling under her spell after spending some more time with him, but it seemed to me that someone who seems as put together as him would have enjoyed his wild night with her and regretted her loss, but who would have accepted her flitting out of his life in the end.And in saying I thought the characters were strong, this doesn't mean that I always found all of them likeable, but for me that was part of the book's attraction. Q was really obnoxious for a good stretch, getting angry with his friends for not being as obsessed with Margo as he was, and holding grudges because they dared to have other things going on in their lives. Yet I could also understand what it's like to be in that tunnel vision sort of state, and it made his character feel authentic to me. I was especially happy when Radar called him on his behavior as that made it even more clear that Q had failed to spot his own hypocrisy up to that point.However, Margo was the exception to this rule for me. I found her entirely stock. There was nothing about her that made her all that interesting to me. I thought maybe she was experiencing some growth, as her behavior on prank night makes it seem like she's gaining some insight, but it didn't turn out that way in the end. She struck me as highly selfish, dramatic, and thoughtless. It's hard for me to imagine why anyone might find a person like this appealing, let alone why Q does. Many of Margo's problems seemed to me to be of her own making, that if she'd decided to eschew her phoniness she could have found more fulfillment. Instead, she effectively quits her problems by disappearing. It seems like the book tries to justify her disappearance by making her parents jerks, but that felt off to me. And were they really jerks? I would have liked the dynamic between Margo and her parents to have been more than one dimensional.Plot-wise, I really enjoyed the psychological mystery feel to this book. I like books like this, where characters try to unravel the mysterious inner workings of the minds of other characters. It's the sort of thing that appeals to me, trying to imagine what spurs someone to behave the way they do. Though I did enjoy the road trip, my ardor for the book cooled a bit by that point, as the mystery of Margo's disappearance was inherently more interesting to me. To be honest, I think I'd have preferred the book to take a darker turn, as it seemed to be heading in that direction. I found the resolution kind of a letdown.Ultimately, I feel ambivalent about this book. I enjoyed a lot of it while reading it, but in the end it didn't feel like a really good book to me. I think this may be because the events in this book didn't feel organic, and once I feel like things are happening in a book because the plot demands it, that book automatically loses something fundamental.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FK84AV2436PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241493X#wasThisHelpful","R1FK84AV2436PL","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a lifelong mystery novel nut, from my first taste of the genre thanks to Nancy Drew to all the variety that has been offered as of late thanks to translations. In general, while I like a good mystery novel set in the U.S., I really enjoy reading translations because I like the varied moods conveyed by Scandinavian fiction or Japanese fiction, so I was eager to read this book. However, it never really clicked with me, due mainly to my disconnect with the characters. Some spoilers to follow.Neither Van In nor Hannelore did much for me. They both had very volatile mood swings that I found difficult to keep up with, and I'm never a fan of the stereotypical male character who's always on the edge of violence. At times their relationship smacked a little too much of a tendency toward domestic violence, and that made me uncomfortable, particularly as Hannelore is pregnant. I do want to stress I don't remember any particular incidents, but there is the sense that the two are right on the edge of Van In hitting his wife and Hannelore throwing things at him. Couple this with Hannelore's and Van In's rather excessive drinking and smoking, and the whole thing pretty much fell apart for me. I found it especially ridiculous that one subplot has to do with Hannelore's fears that something will go wrong with her pregnancy, yet there are a few incidents where she drinks a questionable amount, and she smokes quite often. Since science has known for a fact for some time that smoking is detrimental to fetal health, I found it very strange that a woman who has amniocentesis because she's concerned about the health of her baby nevertheless smokes plenty of cigarettes.On the plus side, I did like that there was a gay character and that his being gay wasn't an issue for Van In. This is my first experience with Belgian literature, so I'm viewing this through an American lens, which means I have no idea how common this is in Belgian literature. From my American perspective, though, it's nice to see that kind of diversity in a book. Plus, the fact that Versavel is gay isn't the thing that defines him, it's just an aspect of him, much like Van In's being heterosexual is simply a part of who he is. Van In's friendship with Versavel is strong and nicely conveyed, even to the extent of Van In going out of his way to be there for Versavel when he sinks into a depression due to a traumatic event in his life. I really liked the dynamic between these two characters because I did get a strong vibe of friendship between the two.Yet for as strong as that aspect of the book is, its exploration of sex crimes is far more problematic. I was especially displeased with the way Carine is treated. She's portrayed as being overenthusiastic to the point that she defies her bosses orders and ends up getting in over her head. Everyone is very concerned about her, but when the extreme trauma she's suffered has been revealed, the book doesn't give it the weight it should. It also seems that the only reason Carine does suffer is to prove a point: that she should have listened to her boss. Never mind that fact that the reason she ends up where she does is because he breaks police protocols. Her fate also serves to raise the stakes for her fellow police officers, and is used as a device to show the depths of depravity and evil of the villains the police are dealing with. In other words, her trials serve more as plot devices than as any real exploration of the impact of the sex trade on its victims. Of course, mysteries do tend to treat terrible crimes as plot devices--what else would you center a mystery around, after all--but it disturbed me that Carine's plight was shrugged off and the ending had something of a ""all's well that ends well"" feel to it. All is certainly not going to be well for Carine.The mystery itself is interesting, but the books has a tendency to meander. Van In spends a lot of time drinking beer, which bogs things down. I do like a good literary mystery in which we learn a lot about the characters and their surroundings, but something about this book struck me as kind of cavalier at times. The characters seem to go through cycles where they feel a sense of urgency about the crimes, then don't seem to worry about them as much, then feel a sense of urgency again. I found this very strange. It might be due to the fact that this book packs a lot of social and cultural issues into it, along with the personal issues the characters face, which means it doesn't end up dealing with any of them with a great deal of depth.In the end, I didn't dislike this book, but it didn't do much for me either. It certainly won't stop me from picking up other translated novels in the future, but I have no plans to continue with this particular series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UNOYVSSRAO07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497678897#wasThisHelpful","R1UNOYVSSRAO07","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Graeme Simsion's first Don Tillman book, The Rosie Project, was almost irresistible. I was immediately drawn into Don's inner dialog, even though his way of viewing the world is so different from mine. Knowing what was actually going on in his head, I felt so sorry for him whenever he experienced one of the many misunderstandings caused by his inability to understand social nuances. Let's face it: grasping those nuances is complicated even for those of us with finely honed interpersonal skills. The book made me think a lot about the way humans tend to assume their worldview is the standard when, in fact, there's really no such thing as a ""standard"" way of viewing anything. It was a great book for helping me to develop my empathy skills.So why the low rating for this second book? Well, the problem lies not with Don, who is the same character I loved from the first book, but with Rosie. And for as much as I do love Don as a character, this book also felt more contrived to me than the previous book, which was another thing working against it. Both books are at their most interesting when Don's inability to read social cues leads to problems that could be quickly and easily resolved. Both books are at their weakest when the standard madcap romantic comedy-type situations are thrown into them. This book seems to have more of those situations than the previous.Rosie wasn't all that well developed in the first book, but developing secondary characters in a book told from a first-person point of view is always a tricky business. In that book she came across as somewhat flighty but as someone who seemed a good match for Don because she appeared able to see past his flaws to his assets. While she seemed frequently (and understandably) exasperated with Don's missteps in the first book, in this book she just comes across as downright mean. She fell in love with Don and married him, so I would think it's safe to assume that she's ready for their partnership to be different than other partnerships. Once Rosie's pregnancy is revealed, though, it's as if it's the perfect excuse to mistreat Don she's been waiting for. Suddenly, every last one of Don's idiosyncrasies become glaring flaws that she must do her best to expose. She doesn't give him the benefit of the doubt once, instead jumping all over his every mistake and magnifying them to make them even worse. I thought she was quirky in the first book, but in this book I downright disliked her. You know it's bad when you're kind of rooting against the distraught character reconciling with his wife because you can't stand his wife.As for the central tension of the story, Don's fears about being a parent, it was problematic as well. I think it makes sense for a character to feel this way, but I also thought they were overblown and something of a weak thing to hang the entire story on. Rosie takes every minute thing Don does and uses it as evidence that he'll be a bad father, and he believes her. But what about all the things Rosie does wrong? I think the book would have been better served had the focus been more on Don's trying to deal with the idea of impending parenthood, something with which many a father-to-be--and mother-to-be--has struggled. The thought of being responsible for another human being's well being is terrifying for most of us, and I think this would have been a better book had it stayed away from the plot contrivances and focused more on Don and Rosie trying to come to an understanding. The whole subplot with Don's exploits on the playground, while not feeling out of character, was the bad kind of absurd, not the hilarious type that can be played to great effect.Disappointed as I am in this book, I would read another Don Tillman novel just because I love him so much. I read many, many books each year, but I rarely come across characters like Don. I'm glad to see diversity like this in literature but am sorry it's so underserved by this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OFKBX2TKZYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476767319#wasThisHelpful","R4OFKBX2TKZYF","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a ridiculous number of pillows. I've tried about every foam pillow imaginable, from foam pillows shaped like regular pillows to contour pillows to pillows with a layer of cooling gel. Something about each type has frustrated me, the most annoying problem of all being foam pillows that offer great support to my neck but cause me to wake up with a sore ear because they're too firm.This is about the most perfect pillow I've ever used. I love the gusseted sides because, unlike pillows that are higher in the middle and taped down on the sides, this pillow doesn't leave me feeling like my head is cushioned but my neck is inches above the surface of the pillow. I also find the gusseted sides superior to contour pillows, because those form a barrier where my neck meets my shoulder. This pillow has more give, so I feel like me entire head and neck are being cradled by it.The density of the foam is the most perfect density I've ever experienced as well. One of my other pillows feels like my head is bouncing off it, which doesn't allow my head to sink enough into it to provide support for my neck. As I mentioned, other foam pillows have been so dense that I'd wake up with an aching ear after sleeping on that side. This pillow is just squishy enough that my head sinks into it, but not so squishy that my head sinks straight down to the mattress. Since it's got a lower profile, I can also slide my arm under the pillow when I'm on my side, a position that knocks contour pillows off-kilter.The surface of the pillow is perforated to improve air flow, but I've never had an issue with my head overheating on any of my foam pillows, so I don't find this feature too noticeable. It may also be due to that fact that I always use a pillowcase on my pillows, which I'm sure impedes the airflow.Like other foam pillows, mattresses, and toppers, this one gives off some off smells when you first take it out and put it on your bed. If you've never used foam in your bed, a good rule of thumb is to take it out of the package and let it air for several hours so that the smell dissipates. I did notice a bit of a lingering smell even after a couple of days, but it wasn't anything I found bothersome. I'm cautiously optimistic now that my long, long search for the right pillow may finally be over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DWMJ3IYIHV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLM47AG#wasThisHelpful","R8DWMJ3IYIHV5","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I read so avidly, it's not an unusual occurrence for a book to affect me. Most of the time, though, books affect me in sort of abstract ways, like crying for a character who's experiencing serious emotional or physical pain. Every so often, a book comes along where the emotion I feel is very real because it's rooted in my everyday world. Paper Things is one such book. By shining a light on the problem of homelessness in the U.S., the author has crafted a thought-provoking novel that will make you both sad and angry, and that highlights the gaping holes in our system to cause so many of our most vulnerable, along with those to whom we owe the most, to fall through our cracks. Some minor spoilers to follow.The biggest downside to this book, for me, was the voice. I had trouble buying that the character was an elementary-aged girl as her voice just came across as too mature to me. While I have a daughter around the same age and know from personal experience that kids around 11-12 years old can be full of startling maturity and wisdom at times, they're still essentially kids. Ari is a gifted student, so it makes sense that she would be a little more mature for her age, but the voice prevented me from being able to see the book as entirely authentic.That aside, this book touched me very deeply. At times I was so furious with Gage that I wanted to throw my books across the room. I think it's fair to make the argument that most of his and Ari's problems stem from his impulsiveness, his pride, and his immaturity, and his inability to plan ahead. Had Gage not run out of Janna's house in a snit, he and Ari wouldn't have found themselves in the situation they were in. By the end of the book, more about Janna's and Gage's relationship is revealed, but some more illumination would have gone a long way toward making me better understand why Gage acted the way he did. While I think he had a sincere desire to take care of his sister, that desire was often at odds with his actions. However, I did think this aspect of the book made a very good point about how difficult it can be for homeless people to break out of the cycle of homelessness. Even when Gage ends up in a position where he can pay rent, he's up against a lot of red tape with very little time.The whole incident helps highlight a major theme of this book: there's simply not much support in the U.S. for the homeless. Most Americans are probably a lot closer to homelessness than they realize or care to think about, and I had such a hard time making it through this book, trying to imagine what I would do in the characters' shoes. On the one hand, there's Ari, who has nowhere to live and not enough to eat but is afraid to tell anyone because she doesn't want to be taken away from her brother. On the other, there's Reggie, a disabled veteran whose benefits checks don't provide him with enough to live on, but whose heart is so full of kindness and concern for others that he'll sacrifice his own comfort and safety to help out fellow homeless people. What does it say about our society when innocents and those who were willing to give their lives for their country are the ones who end up living on the streets?The educational aspects of this book really struck me as well. Ari is an excellent, highly motivated student, but her circumstances make it all but impossible for her to keep up with her work. Poverty is a very real problem in our schools today, and is a huge contributing factor to things like low test scores and low graduation rates. I thought the author did an excellent job of showing how Ari's homeless had far-reaching implications, not just when it came to her physical safety, but also to her future possibilities. Once children start to fall behind, it can become increasingly hard for them to catch up. Since this is supposedly the land of opportunity, I can't help but question a system that stacks the deck against so many.Even as Ari is struggling with homelessness, she still has to face the normal problems of a girl her age. Jacobson writes convincingly about Ari's trying to maintain her friendship with Sasha, which is further complicated by the fact that she can't tell Sasha the truth about her situation. Ari is also bullied by some of the other girls, who tease her about her hygiene and her clothes. They don't know the cause of this problem, but I think this book does a good job of teaching a lesson about empathy. None of us knows what others are going through, and there may be terrible reasons behind whatever aspects of their personality we want to pick on. Thinking about that is a valuable lesson for children and adults alike.Yet this book isn't hopeless. Ari perseveres despite her adversity, and there's a lovely friendship/light romance embedded in the book with Daniel, a boy in her class who dares Ari to keep, well, daring. I thought this relationship was nicely done, and Daniel was one of my favorite characters in the book. Reggie is another character who does obvious good, but there are small interactions throughout the book, little moments of grace that show how generous and thoughtful people can be.Nothing about this book is preachy, but it has important lessons to impart. Both my daughter and I enjoyed reading it, and it provided me with very fertile ground for discussion with her. My kids are lucky in that they've never known what it's like to lead the kind of life Ari leads, and it's sometimes hard to help them see how lucky they are. Books like this make for excellent learning opportunities, not just for my daughter, but also for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOK23DD5SLLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663239#wasThisHelpful","R2YOK23DD5SLLO","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-drawn, scenic book that really made me think. It didn't quite have the impact I had thought it would, probably because Cameron's personality is so different from mine that I didn't connect with her as much as I would have liked, even though I did sympathize with her. Some spoilers to follow.Cameron is a complicated character who engages in a lot of risky behavior (drugs, alcohol, stealing, etc.). While I admired the complexity of her character and the fact that she was so human, I didn't really get the impression that she'd learned much from her own mistakes. She certainly doesn't deserve what happens to her, but I would have liked to see more introspection on her part.I thought many of the characters were well done, especially Jane and  Adam. I really liked Cameron's grandma, even though I was disappointed in her. Aunt Ruth was also well developed, but I completely despised her. Less interesting to me were the characters in Cameron's hometown, maybe because they felt more superficial. They weren't bad, but mostly they felt like they were there to move the plot along.In an interesting twist, it's fascinating to see how Jane and, later, Cameron have more compassion and understanding for the perspectives of others than do the supposedly good characters. Both understand that Ruth and others like her are convinced that they're doing the right thing--but that didn't make me feel sympathetic toward them. Evil acts committed with good intentions are still evil acts.And what happens in this book is evil, one of the most sinister kinds of evil, because people who do these things are often so deluded that they can't see the harm they're doing. They're causing psychological damage to young people who are already struggling with discrimination and hostility, all in the name of ""curing"" them.This is what makes the portions of the book that take place in Promise the most powerful, especially with regard to what happens to Mark. In some ways, though, Mark's tragedy isn't even the worst of it, when the chilling disregard of the state investigators, of Lydia, and even Reverend Rick, are taken into account.Really, this is a beautifully written and compelling novel. Had I identified with Cameron a bit more it would have been perfect. Still, I'd love to read more literary, thoughtful YA books like this in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQ8C5A87E7EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HFHXBM#wasThisHelpful","R1HQ8C5A87E7EV","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara Gruen is an author whose books I want to like, but they just don't seem to work out for me. The potential is there, but they don't quite get to where I want them to be. At the Water's Edge is my second of Gruen's books, the other being Ape House, and though I did like this newest book better than Ape House, it still kind of missed the mark for me. Some spoilers to follow.I think what killed a lot of the novel for me was the way it descended into an awkwardly steamy romance. The book's description notes that this is a book about a character who experiences an awakening, but that part felt so out of place for me because, for the most part, this novel isn't a steamy romance. The love scenes just felt off to me, and I thought they were unnecessary to the plot as well. Love scenes are okay in books as long as they're done well and fit with the book, but that wasn't the case here. One minute I was reading a historical fiction novel and the next I was reading a bodice-ripper. It was odd and jarring.It's a shame because I thought the historical fiction aspects of it were interesting--with the exception of how the book deals with World War II, which I'll get into later. Gruen excels at settings. Maddie's life in the U.S. had a distinct, gilded feel to it that reminded me a lot of The Great Gatsby, though this book takes place in a different era. I could picture the privileged lifestyle of the few, and thought Gruen did a nice job of portraying their indifference and the pettiness and meanness of the lives they led, the way they squandered fortunes and didn't do much of anything worth doing. Juxtaposed against the war, this contrast was particularly striking. Maddie's life in Scotland is also vividly portrayed, and I had an excellent sense of the look of the town, its culture, and the impact the war had on its inhabitants.As for the characters, they're kind of a mixed bag. I really liked Meg, but it took me a while to figure her out because I initially thought that she and Anna had a tendency to blend into one another, so that early on I couldn't keep track of which was which. Angus was an interesting study of a very developed character drawn in a minimalistic way. Much of what we learn about him comes from observing how he behaves relative to the other characters, which is an indicator of strong writing. Angus's story is sad and tragic, and it's portrayed without the mawkishness that happens later in the novel, when the war suddenly makes a larger appearance.The three main characters, Maddie, Hank, and Ellis are the most well-drawn, though I thought Ellis was somewhat inconsistent. I was almost sympathetic to him in the beginning, but then when the three went to Scotland, he became completely unlikable and unsympathetic. It seemed like an abrupt shift, even given all the reasons for it: his wanting to prove something to his father, his addictive personality, his immaturity and self-centeredness, etc., etc. Still, I thought the parallel stories of women being abused were well done, and it was sad and horrifying to watch Maddie's marriage's descent. There was a great deal of tension to this plot line, and it really kept me reading.Yet for a novel set during World War II, the war feels like an afterthought. It is interesting to read about how people might have gone about their daily lives, trying to find some semblance of normalcy in a world gone mad, but I never felt like Maddie progressed from detachment to a real understanding of what was going on. Yes, the book states that she does, but I just wasn't feeling it. I'd be all caught up in the drama of Maddie's marriage and her blossoming relationship with Angus, and then suddenly the book would throw several paragraphs of synopsis of what was happening with the war. The writing didn't feel as strong in these parts to me, either, because I could tell the author wanted me to feel that Maddie felt anxious and sad and incensed about the war, but I never really believed Maddie woke up and got a clue about the horrors of the war. It was more telling than showing me how it affected Maddie, and it just didn't work.It's a shame this is such an uneven novel. It's such a mixture of poorly done and well done that I think it a shame for readers to miss the strong parts, but it's not such a good book that I would really recommend it. If you're looking for a compelling story about people struggling to deal with World War II, skip past this book. If you're looking for a compelling story about a marriage gone awry and the indifference and ignorance of the privileged, go ahead and give this book a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKXMVZN2MUU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385523238#wasThisHelpful","RQKXMVZN2MUU9","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hardest thing about reviewing a book like this is how raw it left me feeling, so raw that the words just want to explode out of me faster than I could possibly type them. This is a book that will rip you apart from the inside out, a book that will definitely make you feel all the rage. So many lines from this book resonate with me, but in so many ways this one encapsulates everything this book is about: ""Because it was easier."" Because it's easier to blame the victim than it is to face up to the fact that we, as a society, have a serious problem that's devastating about one out of every five women. Because it's easier to throw words like ""legitimate"" in front of one of the most heinous crimes one human being can commit against another than it is to accept that humans are capable of committing such crimes. Because it's easier to lament the ""promising"" young man whose life is ruined by such accusations than it is to think about the lasting psychological damage done to his victim. This is a book that everyone who's taken the easier route need to read, because maybe if they put themselves in the shoes of the victim, they might learn what empathy and compassion look like. This is not an easy book to read, and it shouldn't be. This is not an easy topic to discuss, but it must be discussed. Some spoilers to follow.What impresses me most about this book is the virtuosity of Summers's prose. This book is nothing short of visceral. I could feel everything Romy felt, and Summers does a terrifyingly convincing job of portraying Romy's struggles to move on in the aftermath of her assault. She portrays with brutal detail the ways in which Romy is spiraling downward. It hurt me on two levels. One, because I'm a woman, and like every woman I know, there are few things I fear more than the thought of being violated the way Romy was violated. The second is because I am a mother, and throughout my reading I never ceased to be horrified at the thought of Romy suffering without telling her mother, without letting her mother try to help her. I think this book could do a lot of good, but it would be especially good if it could convince even one reader not to keep a crime like this to herself, not to suffer in silence without reaching out to others for help. Our justice system fails girls like Romy far too frequently, but no one should have to go through something like this alone, and if a girl or a woman doesn't have friends or family members who will help, there are organizations that will.There's an undeniable strain of feminism that runs through this novel. In some ways it's confrontational, but not in a sensational way. It's confrontational in the way that the reality of a sexist world is confrontational to the women who must maneuver through it every single day. Summers deftly touches on a range of issues, from the everyday harassment so many girls face while simply walking through the halls of their school, to the men who just won't take no for an answer, to the indignity of the many, many forms of judgement women face--not only from men, but from other women too. Not every woman's experience will have been like Romy's. I wish no woman's experience would be like hers. But plenty of women will find a great deal of truth in this novel, will find themselves nodding and thinking of times they've faced similar situations.The imagery in this book is so powerful. Romy's careful descriptions of the minutiae of how she applies her nail polish, her philosophy of how lipstick should properly be applied, has all the resonance of any scene of men putting on war paint before heading off to battle. This is one image that's sure to stick with me for a very long time. Everyone wears masks at times, that's true, but women head out into the world without their armor at their own peril. It's excruciatingly painful to watch Romy try to maintain an image, try to split off the various parts of herself, stuff them in boxes and lock them up so that she can simply survive. Her world may not be an actual battlefield, but it's a literal battlefield, and I found myself wondering how she found the strength to go on, to get up every day and have crimes committed against her again and again, as if the first crime hadn't been far more punishment than anyone deserves.I cried when I finished this book. I read a great deal and I enjoy many books, but very few of them deeply affect me. Very few of them fill me with the sense of anger that this book did. And yet I don't think it ends on a completely depressing note. What Romy wants more than anything is for someone to look at her. What women need more than perhaps anything else is for someone to look at them. By writing this book, Summers is contributing to a conversation it's imperative that we have, a conversation that has started to gain more and more attention in both the media and the collective social consciousness. It is this fact that gives me hope that someday we may never need books like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33X5HMGIRO813/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125002191X#wasThisHelpful","R33X5HMGIRO813","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good, but imperfect book. At times it's repetitive, and there are some instances of name-dropping and a few whiffs of self-importance. I found the beginning portions of the book somewhat off-putting because of this. Some portions of the book walk a fine, thin line between sensible advice and victim-blaming, and I didn't like that much. For instance, de Becker contends that women who are victims of domestic abuse are victims only the first time, and volunteers thereafter. Um, no. While he does have a point that it makes sense to take reasonable precautions with our own safety, I also thought this book gave the impression that the onus is on all of us to ensure we're not victims of crime. Actually, the onus is on criminals not to commit crimes. I think there's something to de Becker's idea that we might be better served spending more money on crime prevention and less on incarceration, but I think it's critical not to swing into the camp of making people feel as if they're responsible for the crimes committed against them. Still, I think the benefits of reading it outweigh some of its low points, and it's a book I'd recommend to pretty much anyone.For instance, while I didn't care for de Becker's claiming people suffering from domestic abuse might be ""volunteers"", he does make a lot of excellent points about the importance of really analyzing our relationships. He states that choosing a romantic partner because of their potential rather than their substance is a bad idea, and I strongly agree with that. Culture tends to glorify the bad girl/bad boy types with no regard for how seriously damaging such relationships can be, and I thought de Becker's chapter on domestic violence was especially important for that reason. He debunks the idea that violence or the threat of it is sexy and lays out in plain terms what's likely to result from such a relationship. I'd love to see more people heed his words and stop promoting people with violent tendencies as the ultimate partner, as well as put an end to pop culture's hammering away at the message that it's perfectly acceptable to get into a relationship in which a person feels they must/can/should ""fix"" their partner. I think de Becker also does a good job of breaking domestic violence down into stark terms so that people who've never been in a violent relationship can come to a better understanding of what a relationship like that looks like. Moreover, this chapter may very well convince some people they'd be better off if they got out of their destructive relationships.De Becker also makes some very valuable points about the nature of fear and learning how to separate real fears from random anxieties. I agree with his view that most Americans live in a heightened and perpetual state of fear that prevents us from seeing the forest for the trees. He doesn't get deeply into the science of it, but there's an underlying message in the book that it's most constructive for us to worry about the things we really need to worry about and ignore the irrational things. As he points out, people worry about being struck by lightning but will light up a cigarette without thinking. Guess which one is more likely to kill you.Despite this book's title, I don't think de Becker is trying to convince people that they ought to feel afraid all the time. Instead, he illustrates situations in which fear is merited and provides an outline for understanding when we may be better served in listening to our inner alarm, even if it means we might risk social censure. I know I can think of times when I ignored the warnings going off in my head, when I rationalized them away. Fortunately for me, I've never found myself in some of the life-threatening scenarios he describes here, but this book did make me think I should pay more attention to those bursts of real fear. Maybe they'll turn out to be nothing and I'll suffer a bit of embarrassment. Then again, maybe they will be something and paying attention to them just may save my life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAQPFK61PPCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036Z9U2A#wasThisHelpful","R1UAQPFK61PPCN","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These crunchy little snacks have a total of three ingredients: organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, and organic cinnamon. This is a plus for me as I've moved my family away from processed foods as much as I can, and try to buy only those with a simple, short list of ingredients. Organics are also important to me, so I like that everything in these is organic and that they're Non GMO-Project certified. That symbol and the USDA Organic symbol are my gold standards when I do buy processed foods.However, my reservation with these is the apple juice concentrate. I've made a concerted effort to kick added sugars from our diet, and apple juice concentrate is an added sugar. Because of that, I knocked one star off the rating and wouldn't use these as an everyday snack for my kids. I think they're better off eating unsweetened apple sauce or, best of all, an actual apple.As an occasional treat, though, I think these are a pretty great choice. The clusters are bite-sized balls that are very crispy and taste great. That makes them a much better alternative to most crispy snacks, and it's nice that they hit both the sweet and crunchy buttons at the same time. The cinnamon is just right as well, not overwhelming but adding a good level of flavor to the snacks. Everyone in my family liked them, including my eleven-year-old and my five-year-old, and both kids wanted to know if they could take some in their lunches as snacks. If you're looking for a good alternative to the artificial color, artificial flavor, and high fructose corn syrup-laden snacks usually marketed toward kids, these will fit the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCW6HJN44IXU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00934WBNI#wasThisHelpful","RCW6HJN44IXU3","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of years ago, Benjamin Rubenstein asked if I would read his book and give an honest review. In the two years that had passed since that request, I hadn't forgotten about Rubenstein's story, so when he reached out to me again to ask if I would read this book, I didn't hesitate.Though I was already familiar with his story after having read his previous book, I still found this one utterly gripping. This book is a more streamlined version of his previous book, one that makes for a short read more geared toward teens, but that by no means lessens his story's impact. I read it in one sitting, completely engrossed once more in Rubenstein's tale of survival.What I like best about both of his books is that he's very unflinching when he writes about his battles with his cancers. I think sometimes cancer fiction ventures into the realm of the maudlin, with weepy tales of the characters' heroic suffering. By no means do I want to minimize what people battling cancer go through. Unfortunately, I've watched multiple family members battle forms of cancer, and chronic diseases are more familiar to me and my family than they are to most people. Yes, it takes a lot of strength and courage to battle a chronic disease, but fictional depictions often gloss over the gritty details of what that battle involves. Rubenstein writes in plain, unadorned terms about what his treatment involved, something I think is key for those with no experience with chronic illness to understand. Battling a chronic illness is a very personal experience, even as it affects friends and family members, and Rubenstein's memoir brings home how personal that battle is.Chronic illnesses can take over a person's life and come to define them, and I think that's why Rubenstein is so explicit about his refusal to become what he calls a ""Sick Kid"". The sympathy is well meaning, but to have your whole life reduced to your illness can be a frustrating experience. I understood where Rubenstein was coming from in his absolute refusal to see himself that way. Everyone experiences the fight against a disease like cancer differently, and it's telling that Rubenstein refused to see himself as a victim. Instead, he was determined to be the conqueror, to show his cancer once and for all who was in charge.Along with that is Rubenstein's decision not to stay in touch with any of the other cancer victims hospitalized at the same time as him. His fond recollections prove that he wasn't indifferent to them, but that maintaining a distance from the ""Sick Kid"" identity was an important aspect of his survival strategy. That he deeply cared about them and admired their will is obvious to me. Rubenstein's approach might not work for others in his position, but it worked for him. His ability to clearly reflect on his thoughts and feelings and to lay them out in such a way that they're easy to understand goes a very long way toward making this book such a compulsive read. His story is no less compelling the second time around.Rubenstein also details how frustrating he sometimes found it when his well-meaning parents and caregivers took on tasks he would rather have handled himself. One of the worst aspects of chronic illnesses is how they can rob people of their autonomy, and I'm certain many teens who have cancer would identify with those feelings.This is an excellent, compact tale, one I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an honest book about cancer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AB3OOH85NVT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJ3204S#wasThisHelpful","R3AB3OOH85NVT6","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love these books, and I love the embedded message about the ridiculous things that are happening in the current educational system. This book has a lot to say about how little sense it makes to kill programs that nurture and encourage students' creativity, like art, music, drama, etc. in favor of endless test prep that does nothing to prepare our students for the future. The author also skewers the notion that these companies are doing a good thing by pointing out their embedded self-interest. It's no fluke that the same companies that make the tests are the ones selling the absurd prep programs from those tests. As one of the characters in the books says: ""Your parents' tax dollars at work"".Think I'm overstating things? Companies that make educational materials are billion-dollar industries so, as with any industry, they're more than happy to cook up more and more unnecessary programs and sell them to schools, who are under constant pressure from lawmakers to improve.I think the author is really tapping into the zeitgeist with these books. The series started out as a fairly typical middle grade series, dealing with the confusing problems of early adolescence, and continued on to explore how a soul-sucking educational experience makes school a misery for students, who spend the vast majority of their time in a classroom. How can anyone expect to foster a love of learning in kids when they're being implicitly told that the only thing that really matters are those little circles they bubble in with their number 2 pencils?The book's dealing with the debate about whether graphic novels are ""real"" books is interesting as well. It dovetails with them overall theme that students are being shoved into boxes, expected to conform to the norms that adults have decided constitute the ""educational experience"". It makes sense that adults should be the ones establishing the overall parameters since we know what skills are necessary to acquire, but shouldn't students have some say as well? Is it more important for them to be forced to read Moby Dick at the expense of their love of reading, or are they better served if their instruction includes carefully chosen works of various forms that will appeal to a wider array of students and encourage a love of literature in its many forms? As with the student rebellion against test prep, this particular aspect of the book is another example of the old clashing with the new, and of a paternal attitude that insists that someone totally removed from a classroom knows better than someone who spends their time in a classroom each and every day.Bravo to Principal Rabbski, even if her whole subplot is unbelievable. It's a fantasy that I imagine many teachers and administrators have entertained and would have loved to carry out themselves.This is a great series, and I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3GA6EPZCC3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRBSU7O#wasThisHelpful","R1O3GA6EPZCC3B","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a sea of YA sameness, this book promised something truly unique: a look inside a military boarding school from one of the biggest outsiders imaginable--one of four girls being admitted to the school for the first time in its history. For the most part, the book delivered, but what kept it from being a five-star read for me was the sense that the author held back a bit at times, and there were a few parts that felt a little contrived. Some spoilers to follow.I usually do like books set in boarding schools because it's so interesting to get a look into such a closed world. This book doesn't fail in that respect. I thought Hensley did an excellent job of portraying the atmosphere of the military school setting. For someone like me, who has zero familiarity with the military, it was fascinating to read about the various exercises the students engaged in, to get a glimpse into what their classes were like, and to get a feel for the routine and rhythms of their day-to-day lives. This aspect of the book gives it a very strong sense of setting, which is always a plus for me, allowing me to feel drawn into the book.When the harassment starts to come into play, the author handles it adeptly, but at times it felt like it was given too light a touch. As a reader, I felt like I was being held apart from the girls at the school, as if I were being presented with a more sanitized version of what they'd been through. It wasn't that I wanted gory details, just that I didn't get the sense that I was feeling the full brunt of what the girls suffered. I have no doubt that what actual young women in this position went through was a lot worse than what's portrayed in this book. Judging from the emerging stories about the sexual abuse and harassment suffered by full-fledged members of the military, it's become pretty obvious that sexism and sometimes outright misogyny forms part of the dark side of military culture. This is a serious issue, and the book hints at it while blunting the stark reality of it, something I didn't think was necessary in a YA novel. It's a book that deals with a gritty topic but doesn't seem to want to get too gritty.A lot of this has to do with Sam having a buffer in Stamm. I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, it is important for male members to stand up for equal treatment for their female counterparts, but on the other I felt this aspect of the book came a bit too uncomfortably close to Sam having a savior. Granted, she couldn't have faced the opposition she was on her own, but Sam is capable in her own right, and savior narratives become a dangerous thing. It's not so much that women need men to shield them from sexual violence or harassment, it's that they need men to help change the culture, to make that kind of behavior unacceptable, period. This does happen with some of the male characters, and while I did like Stamm, he just felt dangerously close to that edge and it didn't quite sit right with me.However, I did think Hensley did a convincing job of portraying the struggle a lot of the male candidates went through, especially with Kelly. Hensley does an excellent job of showing how difficult it can be for males in the military to stand up and do the right thing. Though the situation is obviously different in the larger culture, the same kinds of invisible pressures apply to men in the world outside the military. This book shows how the pressure to conform to a patriarchal standard not only has damaging effects on the female cadets, but also on the male cadets, forcing them to betray their innate moral compasses in order to conform. I really liked Kelly's evolution in this book and found it very convincing. I got what was going on with Jonathan as well, but found his part a little less convincing, probably because I felt like he was given too much of an out at the end. I had no trouble understanding what was motivating him, but it felt a bit like Hensley didn't want to make him *too* much of a bad guy.This was a very thought-provoking book about a subject that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should. By talking openly about these things, we crack open Pandora's box, bringing this kind of problematic behavior to light. Once it's out in the open it's much harder to pretend it doesn't exist or justify its continued existence. I'm glad to see YA lit tackling such serious topics and doing it in a way that is honest and disturbing. This is the kind of book that gets under your skin and makes you really think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQ1I5S4JAKI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062295195#wasThisHelpful","R3KQ1I5S4JAKI6","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Thousand Pieces of You is like a thousand other YA sci-fi novels: a romance wearing the thin veneer of an intriguing concept. If that's the sort of book you enjoy, you may well like this one. But while I don't mind some romance in my books, I prefer the intriguing sci-fi concept to be the driver of the action rather than the romance, so this book felt like so much good premise wasted. Some spoilers to follow.There are some moments when the premise and setting are allowed to shine, particularly when Marguerite finds herself in an alternate universe in which Russia is still ruled by a tsar. There's a particularly lovely description of the Winter Palace's Easter Room, in which Marguerite encounters a room full of glimmering Faberge eggs, including one that has special significance to her alternate self. This passage gave me that amazing sensation that's the marker of a good book: it drew me into its pages and enfolded me in the lush realism of its settings. Unfortunately, this was the one time where the book had this effect on me.Another portion of the book takes place in a similar version of our reality, only with slightly more advanced technology. I was very interested in this setting, but its depiction is superficial in favor of--you guessed it--setting up this book's love triangle, with Marguerite angsting over whether or not she ought to make out with Theo. I'm giving up descriptions of this fascinating alternate universe for this?My other big problem with the book is Marguerite's extreme lack of perspective. By the end of the book, she starts to get it, but for the vast majority of the book she's jumping in and out of other Marguerites' skins with little thought to the effects her decisions and actions will have on those Marguerites once she's left them behind. It put me in mind of Neal Shusterman's Skinjacker Trilogy, with which this novel contrasts unfavorably. Most of Marguerite's actions are extremely selfish, and she attempts to justify them by telling herself that the other Marguerite would have wanted it, something with which I had a serious problem, particularly when it came to a pivotal event in the Russian tsar universe. What Marguerite does is chillingly thoughtless, but it doesn't matter to her because she won't be around long enough to deal with the consequences. In Shusterman's trilogy, the characters jump into other people's skins, while Marguerite is jumping into the skin of alternate versions of herself, but the outcome is essentially the same: these characters are highjacking someone other than themselves, making decisions they have no right to make. Just because the person you're inhabiting looks like you doesn't make doing that okay. Shusterman does a far, far better job of digging deeply into the implications of this than Gray does.I also didn't buy the love story, which is the central tentpole to the novel, because I'm not convinced that Marguerite actually has feelings for either Theo or Paul. It doesn't help that a significant portion of the romantic encounters take place between real!Marguerite and the alternate versions of Paul and Theo. Is she really attracted to the actual Paul and Theo from her own universe, or does she like the alternate versions better? Or is it that the boys she's crushing on are amalgamations, bits and pieces of all the various Pauls and Theos smashed together? Marguerite doesn't really know, but it doesn't stop her from doing things that could have serious consequences.Have I mentioned that the premise of this book is that she needs to go chasing after Paul because she thinks he killed her father? No? Well, that's probably because this becomes secondary very, very quickly. Mostly this book is about her leaping through universes searching for Paul while having romantic encounters with Paul and Theo. Yes, she does think about her poor father, but it doesn't seem to be what's driving her. Instead, the driving force behind her actions is more romantic, and I had a problem with that. I can understand that she felt betrayed, but I wasn't convinced by her sense of betrayal. The author truly lost me there. Instead, it felt like her father's death was just the excuse to create a story about universe-jumping teens caught in the throes of angsty love and lust. What I wanted to read was the book about the girl trying to track down her father's killer and exact revenge.Lately I just find YA sci-fi and fantasy novels so disappointing because so many of them are really romance novels with sci-fi and fantasy settings. Publishers, can I please get more truth in advertising when it comes to these books? If they're primarily romances, please say so, because I don't want to pan books for being something other than what I felt I was promised they would be. I wouldn't have read a book like this in the first place had I known the emphasis would be more on the romance and less on what was a very fascinating premise to me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97UU210FXIXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062278967#wasThisHelpful","R97UU210FXIXV","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a frequent flyer, but every time I travel, I wonder if these pillows are worth the price. I also wondered if they had further implications rather than just being good for use on a plane. I do sometimes spend a fair chunk of time in the car, and I thought it would be nice to have something so my kids' heads won't be flopping around when they nod off while I'm driving.I haven't had a chance to test the pillow in the car, but I have used it at home multiple times. I have a great couch that I love, but the back is low and it's caused me to experience neck strain while watching TV. I started using this pillow while watching TV and it's improved my neck discomfort considerably. At first it felt awkward because the pillow is fairly big and restricts how far I can turn my head, but it keeps my neck in alignment and is comfortable whether I keep my neck straight up or if I tilt my head to the side and rest it on the pillow.I also tested the pillow at my desk as I often spend long hours working at the computer. It doesn't work unless you have a high-back chair, but if you have something the pillow can rest against, it can also help with neck strain due to computer use.I think another good home application for this pillow will be using it while reading in bed.Given these practical applications and the reasonable price for the pillow, I think it's a good investment. The pillow is good-quality foam, stiff but not so hard that it causes discomfort. The cover fabric is nice, and I like the elastic strap on the back. It'll come in handy when I do travel with the pillow and can strap it to the handle of my carry-on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22TK444JSO2FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1XCT6G#wasThisHelpful","R22TK444JSO2FI","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Sighs. Hitches up ranty pants.*Settle in, friends, this is going to be a long one, and there will be spoilers.I'm feeling it now, the part where I'm too old for this sort of thing. Oh, I remember what it was like to be a teenager. I was involved in a very tempestuous relationship at the time, and I felt all the things Isla feels here, but now I see it for what it was: melodramatic wangst. My reasons for disliking this book are numerous, but the never-ending, self-indulgent, relentless wangst of the whole book was by far the most painful part.In this book, two privileged teenagers mope and fret and fall into a deep depression because they can't have what they want: each other. And why can't they have each other? Why, because of reasons, of course! Reasons, reasons, and more horribly contrived reasons. I'll break it down: none of it makes sense. They aren't together because the story demands that they feel all kinds of torment during a good stretch when, really, all they needed to do was talk to one another and straighten everything out. It could have been over in the matter of an hour, but then the book wouldn't have that long stretch of mopey misunderstanding, would it?The thing is, I might have cared about all this moping had I cared about the characters, but I didn't. Not one bit. I absolutely adore the previous two novels in this series, which are admittedly just as melodramatic at times. But the characters in those books felt like real, three-dimensional characters with thoughts, feelings, and dreams. By contrast, Isla is THE most annoying female YA character since Bella Swan. She has no personality of her own, no dreams, no drive, no desire. As she dramatically tells us, she is a blank slate. You know what? Blank slates might be full of promise for artists, but for the rest of us they're just boring because they're blank. All we know about Isla by the end of the book is that she reads comics, like adventure novels, has two sisters, and is utterly obsessed with Josh--and, like Bella's, hers is not a healthy obsession. She cyberstalks the guy and moons over him for three years before they start dating. She tells him she's loved him for all those years. What? She doesn't even know him, so how can she possibly love him? What she has is an unhealthy fixation on him, which is made all the more evident by the downward spiral her life takes when he leaves after they've been dating for a grand total of one month. One month, and she's basically ready to chuck her entire life away, but I guess that's a symptom of her nauseating privilege too. She can afford to throw her life away because her parents have all kinds of money, so she'll be fine. Cry me a river. Can I read about a character with real problems now?Josh is no better. He's an artist. He resents his parents, especially during his father's run for Senator, because they don't pay enough attention to him. Snore. In many ways, he's very similar to St. Clair, but the difference is that St. Clair felt like a real person while Josh felt like a cardboard representation of one. And don't even get me started on his giving Isla his manuscript to read. Huge spoiler alert here: there are panels of his naked ex-girlfriend in them, and panels of him having sex with said girlfriend. And he wonders why Isla is upset. Since she's also been sexually active in the past, I found her reaction a bit hypocritical, but she definitely shouldn't have been exposed to something like that. Who in their right mind would think showing their new girlfriend something like that would be a good idea? I get that it's his opus and all that, but doesn't it occur to him that maybe he ought not to show her graphic depictions of what he's done with his ex, especially since he knows she's crazy jealous of his ex? It's so messed up I don't even know where to begin with it. Then he has the audacity to be angry with her when she offers some constructive criticism? True, her timing sucks, but it should hardly have come as surprise to him that she wouldn't be head over heels for it.Worse yet, their relationship is all kinds of unhealthy. The minute they start dating, neither of them cares about anything else anymore. They engage in all sorts of reckless behavior that results in his getting booted from their spoiled kid prep school, and they have the nerve to be angry with her sister and with Kurt. What? Sure, later in the book Isla comes to the realization that, guess what, she and Josh are responsible for what's happened, but I vehemently disliked her when her illicit trip to Spain with Josh was first discovered. Even when she has him, Isla can't do anything more than obsess about Josh. She combs the Internet looking for more detail on him, she stops caring about her grades, and she can't be bothered to figure out on her own where she should go to college. Again, these are horrible, privilege-soaked problems. She all but throws away her entire future for a boy she's dated for four whole weeks.I hate that message. I hate that these books, in many ways, promote the idea that young love like this is the be all and end all. It's not healthy. I know it feels that way at the time--I really, really remember how viscerally I felt it when I was seventeen--but that doesn't make the way it's portrayed here right. Now that I think about it, in every book in this series, the couples end up building their whole future around one another. Instead of pursuing the things they want in the best places to pursue them, they make compromises. Yes, compromises are necessary in love, but NOT when it's your whole future you're talking about. And while it's sweet that St. Clair and Anna get engaged in a significant spot in Paris, they are NINETEEN. Nineteen. No. I'm tired of YA authors equating young love with destiny. I know this is hardly a new thing, but that makes it even worse. Shouldn't we be more enlightened by this point? Shouldn't we be emphasizing to young people that, while their relationships are important, so are their futures? Shouldn't we encourage them to explore, to set goals to try to get all they want out of life? Shouldn't we tell them that if the love is real, it will wait until those important goals are met? Instead, books like this gloss over the fact that permanently altering the course of your life for someone will have lifelong consequences and may lead to lifelong regrets.I'm sure by now it's obvious how vehemently I dislike this book. I'm sorry that I read it. It's left a bad taste in my mouth for the entire series. I keep returning to a blurb from another YA author, Tahereh Mafi, who calls Perkins the ""Jane Austen of our generation"". Are you for serious? You must not be reading the same Austen novels I've read, because in those books Austen's heroines are firmly and always true to themselves. They make mistakes, they act badly, but never do they compromise their own hopes, dreams, and beliefs. Elizabeth Bennet would shudder at the thought of being compared to a character like Isla because, unlike Isla, Elizabeth knows that believing in her own convictions, in staying true to her own character, is the most important thing a person can do. I think I need to go read Jane Eyre to purge myself of this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0496X9VXCIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VMBPX4#wasThisHelpful","RV0496X9VXCIH","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled on the Marley Coffee Talkin' Blues one day while browsing K-cups on Amazon, and was so impressed with it that I was eager to try this one. I like chocolate spiced with some chili, so I figured this coffee would be right up my alley, but I was a little disappointed with the results, mainly because this one contains natural flavors, something I generally try to avoid.This is a light roast, so you don't get the deep, toasty and complex notes that you get with the Talkin' Blues. I have mixed feelings about the chili. On the one hand, I like that it lends just a hit of spice that you feel in the back of your throat, but on the other it doesn't add flavor, just a little kick of heat. There are some subtle chocolate notes too, but they're not as good as the chocolate notes that are typical of a good dark roast coffee.If you're looking for something to kick up your day and don't mind the natural flavors, this one ought to fit the bill for you. It was a fun experiment for me, but not a coffee I plan to buy, though I am interested in exploring more of the Marley coffees that aren't adulterated with natural flavorings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXE957L0QJFC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK874P2#wasThisHelpful","RXE957L0QJFC6","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read several of Gudenkauf's previous books and tend to like her writing style. However, this one didn't have the same effect for me. It started off strong and dealt with a topic I found very thought-provoking, putting me in the shoes of the main character, Ellen, but I thought later sections delved a bit too much into sentimentality. Some spoilers to follow.The book starts with a simple premise that really made me think. On a harried day, a series of misunderstandings leads to Ellen inadvertently leaving her baby locked in a car on a hot day, resulting in serious medical consequences for her daughter and serious legal consequences for Ellen. I thought the author handled this issue with great sensitivity, and the parallel nature of the accident--it occurs while Ellen, a social worker, is intervening in a client's domestic issue that threatens the children's safety--was an interesting setup. I think that anyone who's a working parent knows what a blur the morning rush can be, as you're hurrying about getting yourself ready for work and your kids ready for school or daycare. Stay-at-home parents, too, can identify with the general craziness that comes from being a parent of multiple children, trying to keep everything organized and coordinated while often feeling as if you're barely keeping your head above water.Ellen's excruciating guilt and the self-doubt she experiences are very convincing. She knows she didn't do anything wrong, but like most parents when something goes wrong with their child, she can't quite absolve herself of the conviction that she really is at fault. The accident also gives her a new perspective on some of her clients and what they've suffered as a result of their situations, and the times when she's had to have children removed from their custody.What I most liked about this book is that I think it provides a pretty nuanced, though somewhat superficial view of a complex issue. Obviously abuse and neglect are unacceptable, but looking at things from a strictly black-and-white perspective allows us to ignore the pervasive and pernicious problems caused by things like substance abuse, poverty, relationship violence, etc. Ellen is good at what she does, but she comes to see that her perspective has sometimes been far too narrow. Yes, she wants to protect her juvenile clients, but she's sometimes done so at the expense of ignoring their parents' humanity.The more problematic elements, I think, lie with Jenny. I liked her as a character, and I thought Gudenkauf did a good job of portraying a kid from a troubled background, but I found the plot surrounding her too contrived. I can't say much specific about it without giving away some major elements of the book, but I think I would have liked it better had Jenny's story not coincided with Ellen's as it did. In a way I thought this diminished the importance of Jenny's tale because it made it seem like no more than another aspect of Ellen's struggles to strike a balance between her family life and a job that understandably threatens to consume her.The value of a book like this is in the new perspective a reader can gain. It does lack nuance when it comes to racial and religious elements, but it does give the reader a taste of what a social worker does. This is a job that I think is severely undervalued in society, and social workers make scandalously little money for what they do. Having to carry the psychological weight of their work is a burden, and what they do is so important to the fabric of society that it deserves more attention and more respect. Conversely, the book also puts readers in the shoes of people on the margins, though not to the same extent as it puts them in Ellen's shoes. Still, it provides some insight into what it's like for people for whom survival is a daily struggle, something that can be very easy to forget it you live in a solidly middle-class or upper-class neighborhood. Ellen goes through a process of recognizing that she brings her views into her work, views that aren't grounded in the same reality as that of the people she serves.Finally, I found the resolution of the book a bit too pat. Things are tied up with a very neat bow, which does make for a satisfying ending, but far too often people in Jenny's or Ellen's position don't get the just, happy ending they deserve. It's a decent book about a very sensitive topic, but it doesn't do the topic quite enough justice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSN3VK1NREDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316335#wasThisHelpful","R2TSN3VK1NREDA","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned multiple French presses from a variety of companies over the years. I don't use them for coffee, but as infusers when I make tea. I prefer them to tea pots because they allow so much room for whole-leaf tea to unfurl as it steeps, and the press and screens keep most of the sediment out of the cup. Cleanup has always been something of a pain as I either have to use a spoon or a spatula to scrape the tea leaves out of the bottom of the press, so when I saw this one, I couldn't believe how ingenious the design was.The metal cradle is a separate piece from the glass beaker, which is nice for cleaning purposes. The metal surface generally stays pretty cool to the touch. I've used both glass and metal presses in the past, and this is the first one where I didn't have to worry so much about someone burning their fingers if they touch it. It's a bit hard to tell from the picture, but the plunger and screen are a separate piece from the silicone insert on which the grounds or tea leaves sit.I do have a few gripes about the design. I own a lot of OXO products and generally like them, but there's some room for improvement with this one. For one, it's not dishwasher safe, so you have to balance the convenience of the insert for the grounds against having to hand wash the press. This is the first once I've owned that I haven't been able to put in the dishwasher, and in general I much, much prefer that things be dishwasher safe. I'm also not very happy with the screen as it's all welded together, which means you can't separate the plastic part from the mesh. Again, this is unlike my other presses. The hole that the arm of the plunger screws into is plastic, which makes me wonder how long-lasting the product will prove to be. The press also loses points for this as I try to avoid plastic in general, and all my other presses have all metal parts for the plunger and screen.I really like the insert for the grounds. It does make cleanup much, much easier. Once everything is fully cool, I pull the insert out and dump my used tea leaves into the trash. No more scraping the bottoms and sides of my press. I haven't had any problems with the insert forming a vacuum with the glass beaker, which may be because I never try to remove the insert while it's still hot. When it's cold, it slides right out easily without any resistance.This is a nice press, but it would be a lot better if it were redesigned to eliminate some of what I noted above. Still, I find myself using it again and again, ignoring the other three presses sitting in my cabinet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI50H3YLJM6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYL4MOA#wasThisHelpful","R1QI50H3YLJM6K","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"YA fantasy, you have let me down yet again. The more of you I read, the more I start to suspect you're taking YA dystopian's place. Rather than creating interesting and engaging worlds and telling fascinating stories, you're becoming window dressing for so much bad romance. It's not that I'm opposed to romance, but I'm tired of books being flimsy because so much time is spent on giddy feelings, and I'm also tired of just plain poorly done romances.Also, publishers, please take note: stop comparing every single fantasy novel to Game of Thrones. They're not Game of Thrones. Only Game of Thrones is Game of Thrones--and that's not even the series's real name either.We now return you to your regularly scheduled review. Spoilers to follow.First off, I'm going to start with my biggest rant of all: I hated Niklaas. I don't just mean that I disliked him or had a problem with his character. No, I despised him with such vehemence that I had trouble dragging myself through the initial parts of the book, even though I was intrigued by Aurora and the plot and wanted to know what would happen. Niklaas suffers from that annoying, pointless, and maddening syndrome to which so many YA hero/love interests succumb: the sexist jerk who's really a ""nice"" guy. No. A man who treats half the population with disdain and who uses women like tissue is not a desirable love interest. As with most heroes of his ilk, he's given a few outs: messed up life, mean daddy, and beloved sister. Still, no. Having had a bad upbringing and an evil father is not an excuse for treating women like garbage. Oh, but he doesn't hate women because he loves his sister, right? To me, this is the biggest load of dung that authors who use this trope heap on their readers. I don't care how much he loves his sister, it doesn't undo the disdain and scorn he heaps on every other woman. What I find more irritating and egregious about this particular character type, though, is that his jerkishness is meant to show how ""special"" the heroine is. She's so special that her specialness opens his eyes and makes him see that not all women are the same. Her specialness makes him want to be a better person. Again, no. Niklaas was obnoxious, abrasive, and off-putting. I could have sympathized with him and his plight if he'd been a decent person, but he isn't. Having a hard life doesn't give you a pass to act like a jerk.Aurora isn't all that much better, though, really. I found her more interesting as a character, but she does a multitude of things that are just plain unacceptable. I'm of two minds about the princess/prince character torn between personal interest and their kingdom. I get where Aurora was coming from with regard to her brother, but she knows she's the last hope of her kingdom and she still puts herself in unspeakable danger? I think exploring the territory of what it means to have to put aside your personal desires and wants and needs in favor of all those you have to protect is interesting, but there's none of that here. Aurora thinks about it, but her behavior contradicts her every thought. The one thing I agreed with Niklaas about was this. I kept wondering what the fairies had done with her all those years because it seemed like they should have been preparing her for this role. She can fight, but she doesn't use her brains. Ever. She goes with her gut every time, and fortunately the plot works out for her. In reality, anyone who acted with so little forethought would likely have been dead ten pages into the novel. Her behavior with Niklaas also made no sense other than that she acted that way because the plot demanded it. Intellectually, she got that his behavior was abhorrent. That added to her own personal inability to love someone should have ensured that she would have closed herself off to him entirely--but that wouldn't have made for much of a romance, would it? Little as I liked Niklaas, she absolutely should have told him the truth about her curse, and I was repulsed by the way the book handled her treatment of him in the end. She did a whole lot of self-justifying, but there was no justification for what she did.Other characters suffer from convenience syndrome, in that they exist simply because it's convenient for the plot. This is nowhere more obvious than with Crimsin and Haanah. Crimsin swoops in to serve as a sort of deus ex machina as well as the obligatory pretty girl that our bold heroine feels justified in hating. But, wait, for once Niklaas is able to look past her bust and realize he doesn't like her. What a hero! Haanah exists just to make her brother's behavior palatable because he loves her ever so much, so he can't be a bad guy. Not a whole lot happens with Jor either. He could have been replaced with any object of monetary value and given Aurora just as much reason to risk herself. He at least gets some page time at the end of the novel, but not enough to make him feel fully formed. Ekeeta is superfluous, and her brother's actions are inexplicable.Really, that's the biggest problem with the structure of the book. A LOT is happening here, and none of it is as fleshed out as it should be, nor is it resolved to any sense of satisfaction. The ending is particularly bad, effectively a comic book panel with the word ""boom"" in white smoke, followed by a neat picture of how nice everything is when the dust settles.While YA has a tendency to drag things out and create series where none really need to exist, this book had the opposite problem. There was a lot of plot that was poorly developed and that would have been better served had this been a series. Then it could have explored the ogres, Niklaas's family, Aurora's past, etc. I give this book two stars instead of one because I admire its ambition, and the plot was a very interesting concept. It's a shame that it didn't reach its full potential. This isn't so much a fairy tale retelling as it is a complete reboot/mash-up, but that didn't bother me. Done well, I enjoy books like this, but this book just didn't make the cut.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2LREEBQC0KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574322X#wasThisHelpful","R1V2LREEBQC0KM","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of Scandinavian crime fiction, so I was eager to read this book. While I enjoy psychological tension, this book started too slowly for me, and it took quite a while for me to get into it because I was waiting for the plot to happen. Once it did, I was much more engrossed in the book, but it didn't grab me as much as some similar books I've read. Some minor spoilers to follow.Part of my problem may be that I picked this book up before reading the first. I felt lost every now and then as the book referenced the case solved in the previous book. Normally I don't start a series anywhere but with the first book, and this is exactly why. The fact that I didn't read the first book first may be part of what tempered my enjoyment of this one, so that's definitely a personal reaction and not a technical flaw with the book. Had I been invested in these characters after having read the first, I would probably have found the beginning sections of the book more compelling.As it was, I thought it took too long to get to the case itself. Once the case comes to the fore, the book gets a lot more interesting. The aspect that struck me the most was the social commentary. As an American reading this, it's pretty eye-opening to get a view on what non-Americans think about our culture and its effects on the world. I don't want to give the plot away, so it's hard to address this aspect specifically. Suffice it to say I was interested in what this book had to say about serial killers and about violence in the U.S. in general.The characters are good, but I sometimes had trouble keeping track of who was whom. Again, this may be partially due to my not having read the first book. They felt like distinct people to me, it was just that I had trouble connecting the name with the particular character's attributes. Perhaps most interesting of all to me was Jorge Chavez because I found it enlightening to gain some insight into race relations in other countries. I also found Nyberg's story compelling as it deals with his facing up to his past sins and trying to find a way forward. The conclusion to it felt realistic to me without being pat or trite.As for the central mystery, it's a little hard to discuss without giving too much away. I liked how the book took my presumption of what it would be about and turned it. It really made me think about the way the U.S. interacts with our allies and how those allies view us and our behavior. There are some gruesome scenes that do an excellent job of making the reader examine and weigh the costs of U.S. policies.One of the reasons why I enjoy Scandinavian crime fiction is that it's reflective and tends to ruminate on a lot of big themes as opposed to just offering flashy action. This book was no exception, but it didn't suck me under. Overall, it was a good read, but not one I'd place high on my list of great fiction of the genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPKJPN1QONN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375425365#wasThisHelpful","R1PPKJPN1QONN2","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For several years now, I've been aware of research showing that teenagers' brains are wired differently than adult brains. This research shows that teenagers don't process risk the same way adult brains do, and that teenagers' sleep cycles work differently. As a former teacher, I found this information important, a means of better understanding my students. As a parent I find it critical. Better understanding what's going on in my kids' heads will help me to respond in a more effective manner--and that's the crux of the matter, for me.Despite this evidence, little has changed about the way we treat teenagers, to the detriment of everyone. Since teenagers are our future leaders, it's imperative that we use what we've learned about brain functioning to better provide the tools teenagers need to be successful. We have enormous respect for child development studies and use them to inform many of our views and policies, yet we ignore what we've learned about adolescent development. If you're a parent looking for a place to start, this book is an excellent resource.My one real critique of this book is that it's repetitive at times, and the author tends to be more emphatic than is strictly necessary. The information she provides is eye-opening without needing to be repeated. It's also a pretty dense book. That was okay for me as I'm interested in the hard science behind studies. I wouldn't say the book is incomprehensible to a layperson like me, but I can see how it would be a bit thick if someone was just looking for some explanation and advice without wanting to dive into the complicated science of the brain.That aside, this book is one that anyone who deals with teenagers would benefit from reading. If I can summarize in one sentence, it would be this: the actions of teenagers often seem so inexplicable to adults because they are--teenagers don't think the way adults do. Instead of blaming this on their hormones, we need to understand that it's due to the way their brains work, as Jensen points out. I don't mean to suggest that teenagers shouldn't be held accountable for their actions, and I didn't get the impression this is what Jensen is saying either, but it is important to understand that we tend to blame them for things that are physically beyond their control. How can you penalize someone for failing to assess risk when their brain function makes it extremely difficult for them to assess that risk? Punishing teenagers as we punish adults simply doesn't make sense because we're dealing with two distinctly different situations. Jensen doesn't get a lot into the law side of things, but she does point out that legal standards are different for people with mental impairments, yet teenagers, whose brains are different from adult brains, are expected to behave as a responsible and law-abiding adult would. It's not a realistic expectation.Jensen also delves into the topic of sleep, something I think doesn't get nearly enough attention. Because of the changes adolescents undergo as they transition from childhood, their sleep cycles become vastly different from those of children or adults. This is why teenagers tend to stay up so late. The science behind it, Jensen explains, has to do with brain chemistry. Melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone, isn't released in a teenager's brain until two hours later than in an adult's brain, and it lasts longer, making it harder for teenagers to wake up.I've long been interested in this research because, as a former high school teacher, I was a first-hand witness to how difficult it was for my students to stay awake during those early classes. I can't overstate the effect this has on education. The CDC recommends that teenagers get 8.5 to 9 hours of sleep a night, but they can't get to sleep until late. Then they're forced to rise sometime around 6 to prepare for the typical American school day. This means that American teens are suffering from chronic sleep deprivation. As Jensen says, only about 15 percent of teens get the amount of sleep they need each night. Sleep is essential to learning because the brain uses that time to strengthen memories and to organize them in order of emotional performance. Jensen cites experiments in Minnesota, where pushing the start time of the school day back by 70 minutes led to a statistically significant effect on grades. In Jessamine County, Kentucky, moving the start of the school day back by an hour improved attendance and standardized test scores. In this day and age, when we're so obsessed with student performance and test scores, altering the school day seems like a no-brainer (pun intended), and yet there continues to be stubborn resistance to the idea.Especially scary for me, as a parents, were the sections in which Jensen delves into why risky sexual behaviors and the use of alcohol and drugs are particularly appealing and dangerous for teenagers. Again, it has to do with brain chemistry and the effects addictive substances have on a teenager's brain. Early use of alcohol and drugs has been linked with a quicker descent into addiction and life-long brain effects. Since a teenager's brain is wired in such a way that makes the effects of these substances stronger on them, their use of drugs and alcohol is far different from an adult's use. Jensen also cites studies that show that these substances may rewire a teenager's brain, permanently altering its pathways. Obviously it's not a good thing for a person of any age to become a substance abuser, but I think it's important for people to understand how much more pernicious the effects are on teenagers.I would recommend this book to any parent because it will help you to become both more informed and better prepared to help your child through the struggles of the teenage years. Educators would definitely benefit from reading it as well, along with anyone who has regular contact with teenagers. I think Jensen has done a great thing by publishing this book. Hopefully, as more and more scientists speak out and raise public awareness, we'll start looking at adolescence as a distinct developmental age, just as we do with childhood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMZTNLEQ7FPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062067842#wasThisHelpful","RQMZTNLEQ7FPA","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this book alone got me, as did the cover image. I mean, who can resist that picture of a little boy hugging a mail box?The rest of the book doesn't disappoint. The friendly hug machine spends his day wandering throughout his neighborhood hugging everyone and everything he sees--with only a pizza break for refueling. Told through a very simple story, this is a fun and sweet tale of a little boy spreading the love one hug at a time. Especially sweet are the pages where he hugs a crying baby and a porcupine who laments that no one ever hugs him. I think there's a subtle message there, that everyone needs love and benefits from kindness. The book also offers a good springboard for discussing the importance of kindness and compassion with your little ones. However, the message isn't heavy-handed and it isn't preachy. The book is very sweet without being treacly, and the added dimension of silliness--with the boy hugging such diverse objects as ice cream trucks and drinking fountains--keeps the book light.The illustrations are lots of fun too. Our appealing hero has extra long arms, all the better for hugging everything he sees--including the reader, in one nicely done spread. The details in the illustrations are one of the funnest parts of the book, and repeat reads are sure to reveal additional overlooked details. My little guy and I enjoyed looking at the expressions on the hugees' faces, as well as bystanders watching rather nonplussed while the hug machine shows a little love to a park bench. Towards the end of the book, there's an especially fun two-page spread with the hug machine forging a path through the neighborhood hugging squirrels, joggers, and construction workers, amongst others. You could spend several minutes just looking at this spread alone.This made for a fun book that both my five-year-old and I enjoyed reading. For a real treat, make sure to read the author bio on the flap. It's easily one of the funniest I've read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZL8QDAGLLDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442459352#wasThisHelpful","RXZL8QDAGLLDM","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I love about my Keurig is the ability to try lots of different coffees. I have some particular tastes, but I like everything from light roast to dark, depending on the brand and the quality. Sumatra is typically one of my favorite types of coffee, so I was eager to give this one a try.After drinking several cups made on a variety of settings, I'm not all that impressed with this one. It's not bad coffee, but it's not outstanding either. I find the flavor mild regardless of which setting I use, which is disappointing as I usually find Sumatra to be one of those deep, rich coffees with all kinds of interesting notes. I tend to think of coffee in two terms: coffee that tastes like, well, coffee, and coffee that is deep, roasty, and full of complex flavor notes. This coffee falls into the coffee category, which was a disappointment.If you like your coffee on the milder side, this might be a good choice for you, but if you prefer a robust, bold roast, I wouldn't recommend this one. There are several other K-cup brands that provide a much fuller flavor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZIUATO91LMWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNAMBXW#wasThisHelpful","R1ZIUATO91LMWK","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scrabble lovers and aficionados run rampant in my family. I've been playing the game for decades, and before getting this version, I already had three others: a travel version, Super Scrabble, and a more expensive set that includes a raised board on a rotating stand with edges around each space to keep the letters in place. Both the travel and the last set are my preferred boards as they eliminate the annoying problem of the letter tiles shuffling around.When it comes to this version, the board is really run-of-the-mill. It's flat, and while I do like the design of the new red tiles, they're prone to shuffling whenever the board is jostled or whenever some puts new tiles down, so there's really nothing special to be said about the board.The scorer is the real gem here. Calculating things the old-fashioned way isn't particularly difficult, but if you're not quick with mental math (me), it's great not to have to do the calculations. At the beginning of the game, you set up the number of players and begin. Each time a player makes a word, you use the wheel at the bottom of the scoring unit to enter the number of points they scored. The scorer then moves on to the next player, and you follow the same process once they've scored. The scorer takes each input and calculates each player's overall score, so the only thing you have to do is put in the number each turn and the scorer takes care of the calculations for you. The wheel is easy enough to use, and if you turn the wheel too fast and have too high a number, you just turn it back in the opposite direction to decrease the number. The only drawback to it is that you have to be careful to enter the correct number before pushing the button to calculate.Overall, the price of the set is inexpensive enough that I don't want to quibble too much with it. However, as I noted, we already owned multiple boards, so it would have been nice to have the option to purchase the scorer separately.If you're a fan of Scrabble but hate having to do the math, the scorer makes for a nice addition to your game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPI9USXNV38U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFWSOZI#wasThisHelpful","R2NPI9USXNV38U","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this product, I was skeptical. How could sticking the end with the dot in it really affect the taste of a wine? It seemed like a fun thing to play around with, though, so I eagerly awaited its arrival.I bought a couple of bottles of inexpensive wine, one white and one red. The instructions specifically state that the tool can't make bad wine good, so I wasn't expecting it to bring out incredible subtle complexities or anything, but I was very surprised by the outcome. My husband and I took out multiple glasses, set them in a line, and proceeded to age each of the wines for one, two, and three seconds. With one second, we typically didn't notice much of a change, though the wine did seem to have less bite. With each progressive glass, though, the changes became more noticeable. Not sure if this was happening just because I thought it should, I would go back and taste the unaged glass and find that, indeed, the aged glasses were different.While I wouldn't say that the key changes the taste of the wine, it definitely changes its character. Encouraged, I bought a moderately-priced bottle, and we tried it with that one to find that a sweet spot of aging made us enjoy the wine far more than we would have had we not aged it. The key smooths the edges, making the tang of alcohol less apparent and softening the wine in a way I find extremely enjoyable. Plus, the best thing about it is you can taste, adjust, and taste again until you get the wine to the right point, which means each glass can be adjusted to the specific preferences of whoever is drinking it.Cleanup of the tool is easy. You just run the end under some hot water and slip it into the protective plastic sleeve that's included. The key also comes with an instructional booklet that offers tasting notes for each level of aging attached to a pretty comprehensive variety of wines. It didn't include Tempranillo, which was the moderately-priced bottle I bought, so we kind of winged it based on the other red varietals mentioned, and it really enhanced out enjoyment of the bottle.The key isn't for use with wines meant to be drunk young, so you wouldn't want to play with it when it comes to something like a bottle of beaujolais nouveau. And, as I said, it doesn't make bad wine good, but it does soften some of the rough edges of more economically-priced bottles. If you enjoy wine, using it makes for a fun experiment, and I look forward to bringing it out the next time we have guests over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCNNLKDGVY8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0BOAD2#wasThisHelpful","R2JCNNLKDGVY8I","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always on the lookout for creative toys that encourage experimentation, critical thinking, and open-ended play. Lego has more or less exploded all over my house, as between my ten-year-old and my five-year-old we have thousands and thousands of pieces. They're my gold standard when it comes to building toys, but it didn't take me long to see that K'Nex belong right up there with them. K'Nex have an added advantage in that, while Lego is good for pretty much any age, I think K'Nex may be more challenging and more suited to older kids.My daughter still plays with her Lego but isn't as interested in them as she used to be. When this set arrived, she opened it right away and spent hours putting the Ferris wheel and spin ride together. I honestly can't remember the last time I've seen her so engaged with a toy for such a considerable length of time. She hit some rough spots and needed a little help here and there, but one of the things I liked most about this set was that it required her to do some analysis to figure out where she went wrong whenever pieces didn't fit together as they should. She built the bulk of both toys herself, even finding a way around two pieces that were missing when she put the spin ride together, and it was an excellent opportunity for her to see that improvisation can pair off. I think she felt a good sense of accomplishment once the set was constructed. Shortly after finishing it, she asked me if she could browse for some more K'Nex sets, so now I have plenty of ideas for her for gifts.If there is a downside to this toy, it's that it's HUGE. The spin ride is closer to a standard-sized toy, but the Ferris wheel is around three feet tall when completed. It makes it a bit of a challenge to find a good spot for it to stay as it takes up a considerable amount of room. It looks really impressive, though, and both she and her five-year-old brother enjoy turning the motors on and watching the rides go.The set also makes for a great physics lesson. My daughter tried putting a couple of different figures on the Ferris wheel. She noticed that the wheel slows down quite a bit when the figures are heading upward and then speeds up when they're heading down, so when she told me this, we had a mini physics discussion. Science can seem so unapproachable that I love that there are toys like this, which make it hands-on and fun to learn about basic physics concepts.This set offers an additional advantage in that the two smaller rides can be broken down and the parts used to create another theme park ride. My daughter hasn't tried it yet but is looking forward to giving that one a whirl. She'll also be able to assemble the pieces however the whim takes her, making this a very versatile toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBQK2IUNHS7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRGVD90#wasThisHelpful","R1NBQK2IUNHS7Q","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the type of book I don't have strong feelings about either way, which makes it difficult to review--after all, it's always easier to find things to rant about when you hate a book, or things to gush about when you love one. This one took me a long time to get through, mainly because I was never all that invested in it. This was a disappointment for me because I loved Not a Drop to Drink, and it was a little confusing because, though this book contains a lot of the same elements that made that book great, it doesn't have the same resonance. If you haven't read Not a Drop to Drink, it is possible to read this one, though you'll probably find yourself a little lost when it comes to the frequently referenced back story. Some spoilers to follow.This time around, the book is told mainly from Lucy's perspective, though Lynn is also a major character. I think this is part of what made the book not work for me. I liked Lynn a lot and was very engrossed in her story, anxious for what would happen to her, but I never warmed to Lucy the way I did Lynn. For one, Lucy feels too naive for the world in which she lives. There's a strong theme about Lynn protecting her, but I don't think it did her much benefit. The end result is that when they found themselves in sticky situations I was exasperated by the often foolish ways in which Lucy reacts. I admired the cold practicality of Not a Drop to Drink precisely because it was so different from most YA post-apocalyptic novels, and while that realism is still present, it never seems to register with Lucy, despite the many hardships she and Lynn face.Another shortcoming of the novel for me was the road trip element to it. I didn't think much about how closed a world the reader was presented with in Not a Drop, but the difference between that book and this one is rather stark. Much of the trip felt too plodding and meandering for me. Yes, it's harrowing, and yes there are interesting ruminations on the nature of existence, but long sections of the book just seemed to drag. It would have benefited from better pacing, or at least a more present sense of danger. For all that Lucy finds herself in peril more than once, it doesn't seem to make much of an impression on her.I was also disappointed in the nature of Lucy's relationship with Lynn. There's a lot of affection and appreciation there, but there is a major event in the novel to which Lucy's reaction just really rubbed me the wrong way. I could understand where she was coming from and the vehemence of her emotions, but that section reinforced for me the sense that Lucy lives more in a dream world than in the real world. I wasn't surprised by the revelation, and it seemed to me that if Lucy had been paying attention she wouldn't have been either, nor would she have reacted to it the way she did. Her reaction shows a blatant refusal to understand the motivations and feelings of two of the most important people in her world. For a good portion of the book I had no idea how Lucy was, but even when I found out, her behavior and the other characters' tendency to refer to her as ""little one"" made her seem younger than she was supposed to be.While I don't want to give away too much of the ending, it also disappointed me and didn't seem to make much sense. In a way, it's kind of characteristic of the whole book, as the characters all seem to invite misfortune upon themselves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMLD8C723WCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006219853X#wasThisHelpful","R3GMLD8C723WCA","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With two comic book/graphic novel lovers in the house, my son was excited about the idea of having a graphic novel of his own. He's five, but a very good reader already, and the text is simple enough for him to be able to handle, but I was disappointed to find that the story is even simpler. Having read many, many books to my kids over the years, I know it's possible for books for kids five and under to convey a lot of emotion and plot in simple ways, but I didn't think that was the case here.The story is pretty straight forward, typical superhero-type fare. Ricky is bullied and wishes for a friend of his own, so when a robot comes along, it's like all Ricky's wishes have been fulfilled. I'm sure I'm not spoiling much by revealing that once the robot shows up, a villain must be dealt with. Though I didn't think the story was particularly strong up to that point, this was where it really started to decline. There are a lot of instances of plot convenience, where the action ends simply because that's where the action ends. Given the style of the book, I expected some twists but didn't find any.This book is also rather violent. Bullies attack Ricky, leaving the poor mouse crying, and the robot bashes and crashes into a lot of things. This rubbed me the wrong way because I didn't think it was dealt with in a sensitive manner. In general, violence without context in kids' books isn't something I see as a good thing, particularly when the books are targeted at such young kids. This is especially apparent in the back pages, where the Flip-O-Rama section takes over. My son liked this feature a lot, and it is pretty cool to see how the artwork in the book seems to come alive when the pages are flipped, but the whole section consists of close-up shots of the robot and the bad guy punching each other.I'm giving this book three stars because my son does like it, but I was pretty unimpressed. I didn't outright dislike the book, but since there are so many excellent, funny, endearing, and engaging kids' books out there, I found this one pretty lackluster.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3XXNSGUZU8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545630096#wasThisHelpful","R1D3XXNSGUZU8R","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been purchasing Playmobil products for years, ever since my ten-year-old daughter was about four, and one thing has remained consistent: the quality of the products is high, the attention to detail is impressive, and the possibilities for creative play are endless.My five-year-old son loves city-oriented toys, and he's especially interested in things like fire fighters and police officers. This truck is good-sized, perfect for him to roll around the floor, and it has some very nice features. The ladder extends so that the firefighters can reach high places, and the basket is wide enough to accommodate a figure, with a hose mounted to the top that the figure can grip. The cab of the truck comes off so that the firefighter figures can easily be put inside or taken out, and there are two buttons on the top, one that causes lights and a siren and one that turns on the flashing lights only. There's a seat near the ladder for the firefighter who's operating the ladder extension controls, and a spool around which the enclosed hose can be wound. There's also a fire extinguisher that snaps into the cab of the truck.The kit comes with two figures, both male, but one with dark skin and one with light. The figures' arms can be moved up and down independent of one another, and their hands form a u-shape, which allows your child to snap them to the ladder controls, to snap the hose into their hand, etc. The legs bend, but not independent of one another, so the figure is restricted to sitting or standing. Both figures come with hats that snap off. The figures stand around three inches tall, including their hats.My favorite thing about Playmobil products is that they do encourage creative play. My son likes to make the firefighters talk to one another as they zoom off to fight the next fire. If you have more than one set, the figures are interchangeable, which expands play possibilities. Truth be told, if I had a lot of money to burn, I could get dangerous with ordering Playmobil sets. They stand up to a lot of beating and will last for years--my son now plays with sets my daughter got six years ago. These are thoughtful, well-made toys rather than the cheap, flashy stuff that populates the aisles of most toy stores.

"My five-year-old son has recently become very interested in writing stories, and he fills little notebooks with pictures and stories, along with typing out stories on the computer. When we received this package, he was very eager to jump in. He's a little young for the kit, and I'm not sure he got everything out of it that an older kid would, but he's had a lot of fun illustrating and writing his picture book. For older kids, there's a lot of educational value to this set, along with the creative value.The box contains a set of 10 washable markers, an envelope for sending in the completed book, a sheet for drawing the front cover, a sheet for the back cover, sheets for all the pages, and materials to help the child plan his or her story. There's a double-sided sheet giving kids advice on how to write and plan fiction, non-fiction, biographies, and autobiographies. The sheet walks kids through what they might want to write, as well as explaining the differences between each type of story. The sheet then tells kids which additional planning sheets they'll need, depending on the type of story they want to write. From there, they can proceed through a brainstorming sheet to help them come up with ideas, and a story web to help them plan the book. The nuts and bolts approach here has a great deal of value, teaching kids about the elements of a story and what makes a cohesive whole. As I said, it's too sophisticated for younger children, but it's definitely beneficial for older grade-school aged children. Children also have the option of designing their book online rather than using the enclosed materials in the kit.Unfortunately, the time constraints placed on me mean that I must review this product before we receive the final book, but I will update my review once we've received the book so that I can comment on its quality as well. It's helpful to know that the instructions state that the book is usually printed less than two weeks from the date it's received, and once it's printed an additional 3-5 business days are required for shipping. The turnaround sounds very good, so the bulk of the project will consist of the time it takes a child to plan and create the book.As a former teacher, I think this is a great product. It teaches kids valuable skills in a fun way, and it provide them with tangible proof of their work, which is very important. On the parent side of things, I think this will make for an excellent keepsake. I'm impressed with the design of the kit itself and look forward to seeing the finished book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12BKYO3HGUXT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUAAJY4#wasThisHelpful","R12BKYO3HGUXT8","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me a while to get into this book. A lot of that is due, I think, to the long stretch of time between my reading of the previous book and this one; I had to bring myself back up to speed about the events in the previous books, which is always the downside to reading a series as it's coming out. I'm starting to think I might hold off on starting any new series until all the books are out, as this drives me nuts every time.Some spoilers ahead.Anyway, that's neither here nor there with this novel. The one downside to this series that I can think of is that it sometimes gets so technical that it slows the narrative and makes some sections a chore to get through. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to read a YA post-apocalyptic novel where the characters actually use some form of science, but sometimes I think it's used to excess in these books, getting more technical than it needs to and at times getting repetitive.My fondness for the characters is unsurpassed. I have a fierce love for Samm, which certainly didn't go away while reading this book. I'm impressed by the nuances with which Wells paints him. It certainly helps that we get to be inside his head at times, but I like how Samm's behavior sometimes alienates him from others--Kira chief amongst them--and how the books have always explored that drawback. The idea of having emotions but not being able to express them is an interesting one, and I like the nuanced portrait of Samm and of the Partials as a whole. Even as humans and Partials are killing one another, I could feel my sympathies swinging back and forth between them.That's one of the most impressive things about this series, really. In so many ways, it's an allegory for the conflicts that affect the world on a daily basis. Fear and a need for vengeance lead to so many of the conflicts in these books, just as they do in the real world. Wells's exploration of this is interesting to read, and through the use of his large cast of characters, he's able to explore the various degrees of people's need to control, to exact revenge, and to strive for peace. The inclusion of the Blood Man in this book added another nuance to this aspect of the book, as did the conflict between Ariel and Nandita.What ultimately made me well up about this book was Heron. I didn't much like her at first because she seemed like a one-dimensional psychopath--and then I read Isolation, Wells's novella that explores Heron's background. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. It gave me a whole new perspective on Heron that influenced how I saw her for the rest of the series, including with this book. She's a complex character whose motivations are sometimes unknowable. I don't want to give anything away, so suffice it to say that I found the completion of her story arc to be one of the most satisfying in the series.The only real downside for me, aside from sometimes finding the technical aspects of the novel tedious, was Marcus. That guy drives me nuts. He starts off with a spectacularly boneheaded move in this book and just goes on from there. I found myself wondering if I'd disliked him so strongly in the previous books, but I'm not sure. I know I didn't care for him much, but there were many times when he did things in this book that made me think he was the biggest moron of all the survivors. I like snark, but Marcus is so over the top that he delves into the realm of idiocy. I remember wondering earlier in the series what Kira saw in him, and that question definitely wasn't resolved by his behavior in this book.In all, I was very satisfied with the ending of this book and of the series as a whole.

"We own two Quercetti marble runs, one of which we've had for years, and my kids love them. As soon as I saw this product, I thought it would be right up their alley. Though my son is 5 and this is recommended for ages 8+, I figured he could play with it and my 10-year-old could both play with it and tinker with the assembly. The thing about our old marble runs is that they can be assembled in multiple configurations. There are no instructions in the Quercetti box, but there is a picture of several different setups, and part of the fun and challenge of them is figuring out how to assemble them to match the picture--or you can choose not to match the picture at all and come up with your own configuration. In addition, you can use multiple sets to increase the size of the marble run. I figured this marble run would work the same way. I was wrong.Construction:The first thing you need to know is that you want to pay attention to the number of pieces in the set. For this particular one, you receive a 46-page instruction book. Yep, 46 pages. My daughter wasn't home, so I assembled it for my son and it took me around an hour. Putting the pieces together isn't particularly hard, but it is a bit painful as you're jamming one plastic edge into another the whole time you're assembling the thing. Taking them apart will be interesting as I suspect that over time the plastic bumps that hold the purple and gray pieces together will likely weaken and break off. Also worth noting is that none of the half-pipes are connected. Instead, you link them together with gray plastic u-shaped pieces. I got frustrated pretty early on because, even though I followed the instructions to a T, some of the supports ended up being slightly different heights, which made it hard at times to get the half-pipe pieces where they were meant to go.Play time:You're going to need 3 AA batteries to power the launcher. Without it, the marbles go down the run then slip out the holes in the launcher. No fun.This thing is loud and I mean LOUD, even on the quieter setting. The Quercetti runs aren't quiet either, but the noise all comes from the clattering of marbles. For this one, the noise comes from the marbles clattering, the engine running on the launcher, and the annoying space invaders-type noises the machine makes when it launches the marbles, along with the sound of marbles clattering to the floor (I put the toy on wide window ledge, so it's around a foot or so off the floor).The marbles fall off a lot. Sometimes the launcher doesn't suck them in as it should, sometimes they fly off the half-pipes. This may be because none of the half pipes are actually connected. Instead, they sit on top of one another, which creates ledges that impede the flow of the marbles. The blue funnel also doesn't work well as the blue pipe above it juts out so much the marbles clip the edge of the pipe, knocking them straight into the center of the funnel instead of them circling the hole until they finally fall in. Marbles also get hung up in the orange pieces with the dip as sometimes they don't have the velocity required to send them back up the dip once they've gone down.My other gripe with this toy is the fact that it's not reconfigurable makes it far less educational than the Quercetti runs. With those, you assemble some pieces, give the run a whirl, and then tinker around with the pieces until you correct whatever holds your marbles up. The Quercetti runs we have also include tubes that can be used as supports, but through which the marbles can also pass, along with the half-pipes and funnels. Not so with this toy. The marbles go through the half-pipes only.I give this three stars only because my little guy was having a lot of fun with it. But he also likes the other runs, and he can put those together himself, unlike this one. If it were up to me, this would be a two-star product at most. I can think off the top of my head of two other companies besides Quercetti that have marble runs on the market, and all of them strike me as more educational, sturdier, and better made than this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4KFDHWDNHY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB36A7W#wasThisHelpful","R2F4KFDHWDNHY1","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those books that's not only fascinating, it's extremely helpful. By delving into what goes on in the brain when we experience information that's contrary to our deeply held and cherished beliefs, or when faced with evidence of our own failures and mistakes,--dissonance--this book offers valuable ways we can all become more self-aware and avoid falling into the trap of self-justification.Written in layman's terms, by highlighting this one simple concept, the authors show how our need to correct dissonance leads to prejudice, revisionist histories, bad science, serious problems within the legal system, and disharmony in marriages and other relationships. Taken on their own, each of these problems seem enormous--and they are. However, the first step to finding solutions for all of them is for people to learn to take a step back, suppress their defensive urges, analyze the situation, and question whether they might have done something wrong, or whether they might nurse mistaken beliefs. It's simple to become blinded by our confirmation bias (i.e. only accepting as evidence information that proves our own viewpoint while dismissing evidence that challenges that viewpoint), but by avoiding that trap, it's possible to come to a better understanding of ourselves and the world we live in, as well as devise ways of righting wrongs. We've all come up against that stubborn person who just won't listen, who clings to their beliefs against all contrary evidence, and who refuses to believe they could possibly be wrong. Guess what? We're ALL that person at some point or another. Self-awareness comes more easily to some people than others, but we can all train ourselves to be better at it, and if we did, we'd alleviate many of our own problems. Admitting that we've made mistakes or done something wrong is tough because of our need to insulate ourselves from humiliation and to maintain our self-image, but this book shows how dangerous that impulse is.The book isn't all doom and gloom, though. The authors offer suggestions for how we can each tackle our own biases, and they provide evidence that shows how learning to overcome them can lead to better outcomes. To offer just one example, they explore how the increased focus on standardized testing has further institutionalized students' fear of failure, creating a serious impediment to students' ability to learn. No one likes to feel stupid, so rather than risk trying something and failing to succeed at it, we tend to adopt the attitude that certain things, like math skills, are innate. But the authors cite research showing that when students learn to put their mistakes in perspective by reminding themselves that mistakes are learning opportunities, and that making a mistake does not make them less of a person, they're likely to be more willing to tackle tasks they'd otherwise shy away from.Accepting and learning from our mistakes also forges closer bonds with others. The authors cite evidence that shows that people want their pain to be validated, so when a doctor or lover admits they've made a mistake, we tend to have warmer feelings than if they deny or assign the blame to someone else. At heart, what most of us want is not so much to rage against the person who screwed up, but to hear that person admit it and promise to remedy it.Reading this book is an enriching experience because it helps the reader to learn to analyze the behavior of others rather than washing our hands of them and saying, ""S/He is so irrational."" When we understand that the other person is likely engaging in a fair bit of self-justification, we can arrive at better methods to reach that person. We can also learn to put ourselves under the same microscope, so that we can overcome our own tendencies to self-justify.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DNFSG6R731RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K15IOE#wasThisHelpful","R2DNFSG6R731RP","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this novel. It was so nice to read a fantasy novel that wasn't set in a standard Western fantasy universe with standard Western fantasy creatures and humans. Hooray for diversity in literature!More than that, though, this book is a well-written tale. I enjoyed the characters and Zayele in particular was strong because she was so flawed but still so relatable.The pacing is excellent. There are two love stories here, but both felt like they were built from the ground-up and had substance to them instead of the eye rolling instalove based on nothing that seems to happen so often in YA novels.In truth, I have started to lose faith with YA novels in general, and then a gem like this comes along and reminds me of what I enjoyed about the genre in the first place. We need more YA novels like this and fewer of the generic clones that have been spawned with wild abandon since YA started to become such a popular and lucrative genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DJ10SZZWXEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1ZJIZO#wasThisHelpful","R23DJ10SZZWXEE","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Torn about this one. I love Rowell's writing, but I just did not like Neal, which was a shock. One of the things that I love about Rowell's writing and that made me devour her previous three books in rapid succession was my joy at her ability to create male romantic interests that are sweet and worth caring for, rather than the broody bad boy who treats the woman who loves him like crap.And then Neal. Ouch.He's definitely the worst male love interest in any of Rowell's books. To be honest, I was hoping Georgie would figure out she was better off without him and sail off into a life of the career fulfillment that Neal seemed to spitefully want to deny her.In fairness, though, I thought Georgie was rather infantile, so I had trouble getting behind her too, but, really. Neal was miserable from day one, couldn't figure out what the heck he wanted out of his life, and Georgie is the bad guy because she has the audacity to want to stick with a career she loves? It makes me hurt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5FB19IFHYNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HP1JYZE#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5FB19IFHYNO","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a lot of one gallon bags for a variety of purposes: to pack toiletries when traveling, to freeze bread for future use, etc. Sometimes, the one gallon size just doesn't cut it and I end up using multiple bags of squishing things together, which results in their being frozen together and difficult to separate.Cue the two gallon bag. It's large enough to store and entire loaf of bread without squashing it in, and it can definitely accommodate more full-size shampoo bottles and other such necessities when going on a lengthy trip. Because it is such a large size, though, it's not practical for most everyday uses and the plastic feels thinner to me than it does with the one gallon bags. If you're not planning on packing a lot or freezing large quantities, stick with smaller bags.If, however, you need the room, these are great. I'll still need to keep one gallon bags on hand, but I will definitely purchase more of these in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNF1FCCFEAZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXCNNN4#wasThisHelpful","R2FNF1FCCFEAZM","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I didn't make it past page 88 of this book. Despite my best efforts, I simply could not continue it beyond that point. The biggest reason for this is that I feel the book's description misrepresents the books in some respects, and that set me up with certain expectations that the book did not fulfill.First and most significant was the fact that Willie's work with the refugee girls plays a very small part in the book. My whole reason for picking the book up in the first place was because I expected this to be a major plot element, so when it's treated as just another aspect of her everyday life, I kept turning pages wondering where the plot went. There's nothing wrong with a book that's about someone's life, but I mistakenly thought this book centered around Willie's work with the refugee girls, which it did not. Because I didn't find Willie particularly compelling as a character, I couldn't get interested in the book once I realized this.Another of my gripes is with the excessively long descriptions of how Willie gets from point A to point B. Now, I love Paris. It's my favorite city in the world and it never fails to suck me in when I'm there. However, even I don't love it so much that I care to read about how Willie walks up one street, arrives at another, turns left, hops on the Metro and takes it to X stop--and on and on. Really, the book does this. More than once. Reading it is as exciting as it sounds. I've been more scintillating when reading the directions provided by Google maps.The subplot with Willie's brother, Luke, is so obvious it's as if there's a sign with huge letters hanging over it spelling out where it's going. I didn't even need to read beyond those 88 pages to know what the revelation about Luke was going to be. It's that spelled out. It might have made for an interesting plot point if it weren't so obvious, but either way Willie's rather co-dependent relationship with her brother didn't do much for me. I understand she's feeling rather adrift because she's so caught up in her grief, but it feels like she trails after him like a puppy.As for the romance, it was only just getting started but already didn't work for me. Macon doesn't talk like an actual human being and is given to weird asides that have little relevance to what he and Willie are talking about. Some of these are obviously included to provide some more detail for readers who aren't familiar with Paris, which would be okay if they weren't direct quotes. I kept wondering why Willie didn't think it was weird that he explained things she wouldn't need to have explained.This was a disappointing book considering how promising the setup sounded.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6ABHST5ZY5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594076#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6ABHST5ZY5F","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who went a long stretch with reading primarily young adult novels, it's surprising how many parallels there are between young adult books and adults books, the major difference being the tone. I mention this because, in so many ways, Taz, the main character in the story, doesn't differ all that much from YA characters. At heart, her primary goal is to feel accepted and validated by others. Some spoilers to follow.One of the strong threads running through this book is the struggle for self-determination and the liberation travel offers as it provides people with the sent that they can be someone other than who they are. Taz chafes against her own definition, reaching for a life that's something different from what she's always known. She's so desperate to feel alive, like part of something bigger, that she engages in a lot of just plain stupid behavior. This aspect may make the novel difficult for some readers to enjoy, but even though I wasn't very fond of Taz and often wanted to shake my head at the foolishness of her actions, I could still understand where she was coming from. What Taz wants most is to shake her sense of dissatisfaction, and she's eager to grab hold of and cling to whatever she thinks may help her rid herself of it.At heart, this novel is a study of the human character. The strength of it lies in the diversity of its characters and their varied motivations for what they're doing. Each of them struggles to define him or herself, and most of the tension in the novel comes about when the varying wants of the characters collide. This is obvious when Taz's and Jenny's wants are incompatible with those of their professor, when Claire's wants cause a rift between her and Colin, when Taz's wants collide with Colin's, etc. None of the characters are particularly good at looking outside of themselves and empathizing with others, and it is this that ultimately leads to tragedy for some while others come out relatively unscathed.I'm a big fan of the atmospheric book, and this one certainly qualifies. Grifonia felt vaguely threatening to me throughout the course of the novel, maybe because it represents that dark side of those conflicting human wishes. Even as Taz is exploring this wonderful, ancient, and amazing new place, something about it feels ominous. Like Taz's relationship with many of the other characters, on the surface Grifonia seems promising and beautiful, but underneath are buried many terrible secrets.Though this isn't what I'd call a traditional mystery novel, there is some mystery to it. It's pretty obvious early on what's going to happen to Taz, so most of the plot of the novel revolves on the convergence of events that lead to the ending. This isn't a whodunit, it's a character study, which means most of the drama lies not in action scenes but in what the characters do and say. It's a solid literary work that stuck with me, drawing me into its pages and not letting go, even after I'd finished reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PYWQJNMCRQEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374100365#wasThisHelpful","R3PYWQJNMCRQEW","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really beautiful book, and I found if a profound and moving interpretation of both the transition from childhood and adulthood and of the journey from blindness, through suffering, and back out to wisdom. My only gripe was that I found it a little slow in the beginning, when there was a lot of exposition to establish the world in which Jonas lives. Jonas's time with The Giver, though, is really quite stunning.The edition I read contained the text of the speech Lowry gave when she accepted the Newberry Medal for this book, and that speech touched me perhaps even more than the book did. It's a candid, startling, beautiful speech full of glimpses at failures that led to better understanding, experiences that shine through in the book itself. I could only dream of giving such an eloquent speech.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1NT41EOZ2VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EEZ64Y#wasThisHelpful","RZ1NT41EOZ2VZ","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"History was one of my least favorite subjects in school. With one notable exception, it seemed like my teachers excelled at taking the material and making it as dry and boring as possible, distilling what should have been thrilling events and interesting characters into a checklist of names and dates. In other words, all of the context was removed. As an adult, I now suspect my dislike for history had less to do with my teachers and more to do with textbooks and the way education tries to cram in as much as possible at the expense of robbing the subject of all relevance and interest.I bring this up because Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy is the kind of book that, as a kid, I wouldn't have believed could have existed (because history couldn't possibly be interesting) and that, as an adult, blows me away. Compulsively readable, this book is a page-turner like any good work of fiction, bringing to life four fascinating and extraordinary women, and the perilous times in which they lived.We meet Emma Edmondson, AKA Frank Thompson, who fled the restrictions of life as a woman by posing as a man, going door-to-door selling Bibles before enlisting with a Michigan regiments. Then there's Elizabeth Van Lew, the wealthy socialite living in Richmond who uses her family funds as she risks not only her good standing in society but her very life to spy for the Union army. On the Confederate side is the bold, brash (and often outrageous) Belle Boyd, who at seventeen defies a Union soldier in order to protect her mother, and Rose Greenhow, who goes as far as Europe to plead the Confederate case.By the time I finished reading, I couldn't believe I had never heard of these three women, and that all I knew of Belle Boyd was that she had been a spy. School history does an excellent job of erasing the contributions of women and minorities that it's jarring to realize they played their roles. Though I was by no means disappointed by the four women on whom Abbott chose to focus, I was sorry not to learn more about Mary Jane Bowser, a former slave Rose had emancipated, and who infiltrated Jefferson Davis's house, posing as a servant while collecting invaluable intelligence. I wonder how anyone could find such story anything less than compelling.The book is rich in detail, both about the lives of these women and the time in which they lived. Abbott does an excellent job of painting a portrait of all four, giving details about their lives, passions, and interests outside of the war so that each feels three-dimensional. Belle Boyd in particular was endlessly fascinating to me, her behavior sometimes so brash and outrageous that it was hard to believe she wasn't a work of fiction. I was also shocked to read about Emma Edmondson and the extraordinary women like her, whose desire to serve their country was so strong it inspired them to place themselves in great personal danger--not just on the battlefield, but also from their fellow soldiers, who could never know the truth about their comrades-at-arms.I've always been interesting in the Civil War, but this book presented an entirely different perspective on the conflict. This is history brought to life in all its drama, intrigue, and suspense. Had I learned history the way Abbott presents it in this book, I'd have paid a lot more attention in school.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPUHRT1ZME10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062092898#wasThisHelpful","R1CPUHRT1ZME10","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The more I think about Conversion, the more I like it. Since I'm an adult reader who reads YA almost exclusively, I have a lot of exposure to the different types and sci-fi/fantasy/paranormal YA tends to be more commercial and less literary, which I think is to its detriment. I really enjoyed reading something with a paranormal flavor that was also quite literary and that avoided a lot of the cliches and pitfalls that seem to be plaguing YA lit lately. Some spoilers to follow.I think the thing I admired most about Conversion was its ambiguity. Set in an exclusive girls' private school, a series of strange events earns the school the limelight as everyone tries to figure out just what's wrong with the girls. Complicating things, none of them are manifesting the same symptoms, so it's unclear what the nature of the illness is and what's causing it. It's possible to draw several conclusions from the evidence given, and I really enjoyed that about this novel. Most of the YA books I read that have similar themes tend to want to wrap things up in a neat bow, which sometimes happens to the detriment of the narrative.The other thing I very much liked about this novel was the characterization of the main character, Colleen. She felt very authentic to me. Gradually the book peels back the complicated layers of her life. She's driven and hard-working, which seems like good traits, but Howe does an excellent job of pointing out how stressful and just plain awful Colleen's high stress environment can be. Friendships are necessarily complicated by the fact that Colleen's peers are also her competition, and I found it very realistic how she uses this lens to view just about everything that happens, even her relationship with Spence. Colleen doesn't want to do this, but because she has devoted so much of her time and sweat to her achievements, she has little choice in the matter. I admired the honesty of this aspect of the narrative. I think a lot of books pay lip service to how difficult it can be to be a teenager, but I think the actual toll it takes it one that adults don't always appreciate. I felt sorry for Colleen. Her ability to trust and just be herself with her friends was no better than if she had been a character in some oppressive dystopian regime.Interspersed with Colleen's story is that of Ann Putnam, set in 1706 after the Salem Witch Trials. Ann goes to see the local reverend to lay her confession at his feet: she and her friends were lying about the extraordinary illness they suffered and that led to the condemnation and death of several supposed witches. Howe does an excellent job of weaving these two narratives together, exploring the concept of hysteria and questioning what it means to truly have a voice. Though things have certainly changed with regard to technology and the social status of women, the books still finds a lot of similarity between the plights of the 17th and 18th century girls and that of girls today.This aspect of the book leads to its underlying theme that sometimes things are more than they seem. The Salem Witch Trials can be dismissed as the cruel actions of a set of thoughtless girls, but that doesn't fully explore what was going on with those girls' lives and why they chose to do what they did. Similarly, the modern setting of this novel explores a lot of the pressures facing the girls. They are expected to be exemplary models of teenaged girlhood, with all its attendant pressures and expectations about their sexual activities, their achievements, etc.And this is what I think sets this book apart from a lot of the YA fiction I've been reading lately. There's nothing wrong with books that exist for sheer entertainment value, but I've been longing for some of the meatier subjects that drew me into YA lit in the first place, and this book fit the bill. I also very much liked the fact that, while Colleen does angst some over the boy she likes, this book didn't follow the route of the soapy romance in which a gifted girl seemingly forgets everything that was important to her because of a cute boy. It was nice to read about a girl who compulsively checks her phone looking for texts from the boy she likes, yet still has her eye on the ultimate prize: her future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWUHIQXTGCBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167773#wasThisHelpful","RYWUHIQXTGCBU","A1HBC0NBQJHT7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HBC0NBQJHT7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this spare song, Keith Richards isn't rocking. That's OK. It is laid-back, with an easy piano, guitar, drums and vocals.

"I'm sitting in a Panera Bread as I write, drinking a Light Roast coffee. The K-cups are no different than the coffee they sell in the shops. Bland.There's no real flavor profile and the scent is modest. As a light roast, you'll get plenty of caffeine, but this is a light light roast. I often spike mine with their dark roast (which isn't especially dark).Although it is bland, it is also mild and goes down easily. There's no challenge to the taste buds, but there's nothing bad either. If you drink coffee out regularly, you've had worse. This is safe.If taste is important to you, move on.

"Batman and Robin reaches a level of bad that makes the campy 1966 TV series look like serious cinema. At least whoever wrote the TV episodes made no pretense a budget was involved. Everything you heard about how bad this movie is was an understatement.Who was the casting director? Hopefully no one who has a job today. Rowan Atkinson could have played a better Batman than George Clooney. Arnold as Mr. Freeze? He makes a Terminator, but let's never forget, he's not a real actor. They made that mistake including him.The various film iterations of the Fantastic Four are looking pretty good in light of this one. Or the 1970s Spiderman movies.How bad is it?

"These are delicious. They remind me of some other cracker or similar snack, then marketed as pizza crackers.First of all, these are Ritz crackers. The flavor is basically attached to them.

"The De'Longhi Dolce Gusto Esperta is a step above the other Dolce Gusto. Like Nespresso, it tries to redefine the single-serve market by lifting up the production value of each up.Unlike Keurig, which really is just a tiny drip coffee machine (like a Mr. Coffee), the Dolce Gusto series has pressure as part of the process. No one will be fooled into thinking the espresso made is on the same level as that made fresh on an equally priced espresso maker, but you can enjoy prepackaged coffee convenience.As to this model, it has two features, aside from the aesthetic design, that I prefer.1) The water basin holds a lot more water. Thank the designer some Monday morning when you squeeze out an extra cup.2) Safety turn-off is 5:00. It was previously 10:00. Those few minutes mean I save a few cents on electricity and reduce burning out the machine too early.To use it, turn it on, wait less than a minute for it to warm up, slip a capsule into the little drawer, and spin the wheel to the right amount of bars (it equals how much water goes through). For the lattes, you'll use two capsules. One for some milk-like foam, and the other for the coffee (with or without the flavor).Other than that, it seems to be no different than the rest, but that's not a bad thing.Note: this is a review of the machine, not the coffee itself. For that, see the individual flavors. In short, though, these aren't premium beans. They are Arabica, but not the freshness or quality found at your local cafe.

"By the time I was watching baseball in the early 1970s, most of what Willard Mullin's legacy is all about was over. His impact, however, has lasted far beyond the years he worked.This book covers his greatest period, between the 1930s and 1970s. Crammed with his drawings, we see why he was great -- his drawings gave baseball that personality we still hold to in 2015.Gritty, every joes, with the Brooklyn Bum as the key character, Mullin pulled from all the major figures of the game. Whether a drawing of the legendary (and personal friend) Babe Ruth capturing Ruth the human, not just the Sultan of Swat, or Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, or numerous players abd coaches long forgotten -- all of it is filled with a love for baseball.The illustrations are sometimes keenly detailed, and sometimes cartoonish. Some are single images and some are one-sheet stories.There are more than the drawings, though. Aside from the magnificent descriptions of each picture, there are essays from his daughter, his lawyer, and Bill Gallo (a colleague and noted cartoonist himself).Read this and learn the history of baseball.

"The idea of this is simple: it sweeps up particles while grabbing dust, all without electricity. It is a good idea, but it is not well-executed in design.Set-up was quick. All that's needed is to put a few pieces together. There are instructions, but you'll find them unnecessary. It is that easy.The problem is in using it.* The swivel at the base is unpredictable and difficult to control. If you want to go left, you can try and it might. Or it might not. It might wiggle the wrong way.* The particle trapper isn't good. When I lifted up the base to see how things were going, particles I had trapped fell out.The dust sheet itself does a good job grabbing dust, and the sweeper grabbed tiny pieces of cereal and other debris well.

"There's something visceral about grinding coffee by hand. I likewise use a mortar and pestle when I grind black pepper.Directions aren't really important here. Pour in beans. Grind. Take out ground coffee. The only thing you really need to know is how to adjust the grind (how coarse).It is easy to use, as I've said. That's technically. Like my dear mortar and pestle, you will get tired. It took two minutes to get enough grounds for one espresso. There are good reasons people have electric grinders.Meanwhile, it doesn't hold many beans. That just the nature of beans; they take up space. This means if you are looking to grind a full pot of eight cups, you'll need to portion off some time. If you are camping, this is your only choice.The trick is to hold the grinder with your left hand (I'm a righty), crank with your right, while wedging the grinder in your gut. I tried positioning it on my counter, but that was more difficult.Consider adding this to your morning routine, or bring it along when traveling. It's less expensive than a fancy electric burr grinder, but only the most discerning taste buds will notice a difference in quality.

"Where do I begin? This is not an ordinary book. One of America's greatest novelists chose to only publish one book, ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" No one knew why and we all wanted more. Wasn't gonna happen. But it did. Here is that book we wanted. Or not.Then there was the yet unsatisfying suspicion that the brilliant Harper Lee may not have approved publication of, ""Go Set a Watchman."" Or she approved it, but not fully aware. Legally, it has been cleared, and so whatever the motivations and manipulations existed or didn't exist, all of which is acceptible by law. Either way, the book is here.I have one of the two million first copies. Many more will no doubt will be printed. After the initial buzz dies down, we will find out if this will be the classic ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is.Lee's writing is similarly toned as her other book. It has the same feel but misses the urgency. Occasionally, Lee draws us in casually, but poetically, as when describing Maycomb:""New people rarely went there to live. The same families married the same families until relationships were hopeless entangled and the members of the community looked monotonously alike.""There's so much said in those few words. She describes then small-town Alabama in the 1950s, but it could be small-town Iowa or Massachusetts in the 2010s.Other times, as during a major trial, a tighter edit would serve well.""Go Set a Watchman"" precedes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in its writing, but its plotline takes us years later. It has been 20 years, and Scout, now an adult, is off to visit Atticus, her dad. She discovers her dad isn't the hero she thought.""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" as I've reviewed, is a love story between Scout and her father as she admired his heroics and love for all.""Go Set a Watchman"" is like that, but Atticus is more complex than the Atticus she, and we, thought we knew.How so? Take a look at this from chapter 12:  Atticus turned to her. ""Scout, you probably don't know it, but the NAACP-paid lawyers are standing around like buzzards down here waiting for things like this to happen.----""  ""You mean colored lawyers?""  Atticus nodded...It goes on to examine the state of ""Negroes"" in the legal world.Atticus tries to educate Scout who is less naive than he thinks. Mind you, he's no Archie Bunker. He's fairer-minded that that, but he's no Meathead either.We also learn about Jem, Calpurnia, and others from ""Mockingbird,"" but this is all about Scout and Atticus, who they were, who they thought each other was, and who they are discovering the other really is. It is extremely honest.Like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Go Set a Watchman"" is forcing discussions of racial conflict, racism, and the context of real life ""Go Set a Watchman."" While ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" came out in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. In fact, it can be argued it was part of move forward.This isn't ""Mockingbird."" Don't be fooled. Lee created a legendary book there. This is just very, very good. I give it five stars because of how it matters in continuing the national racial dialogue.""Go Set a Watchman"" was written then but remains relevant now. Racism is racism and people aren't simple good and bad cartoons. Not one of us is pure minded. Not Atticus, not Scout, not Harper Lee and not this reviewer.I fully recommend ""Go Set a Watchman"" by Harper Lee. Once again, she has changed the landscape of modern American literature.

"There are a few books writers need. Writer's Digest publishes a few. There's a good dictionary and thesaurus, of course. And if they intend to publish in a Christian market, they need this one, ""The Christian Writer's Market Guide 2015-2016: Everything You Need to Get Published.""I've long been a customer, going back to when Sally Stuart was publishing it. Now, under the direction of Jerry B. Jenkins, it is better than ever.Jenkins' authority in the matter far extends his massively popular ""Left Behind"" series. In fact, it precludes it. By then, he had established a bit of a name for himself, and publishing was a little easier. (Note, not ""easy,"" as good writing never is, nor is getting it published, ever.) He had written numerous articles, as-told-tos, and even penned a sports themed comic strip. His bio says 186 books, 21 of which have been NYT bestsellers. He's seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of it all, and that experience informs this book. In other words, be glad that Jenkins is on the job. He's poured his career into writing for and about Christians, and now, he's giving back to the next generation.So, the book? What's it all about?The reason I bought it is the huge directory of places to publish. I love short literary fiction and am looking to sell my stuff. Where? I don't know yet, but in this book are 930 listings. This includes book publishers, agents, and periodicals. There's more, but you get the idea.With each periodical entry, for example, you'll learn where to send what, how much they pay, and other helpful details. You'll see similar entries for book publishers, subsidy publishers, and so on. It is all neatly organized and cross-referenced. Topical listings will help you sort through the 488 pages of gold.There's a large collection of articles like, ""Do You Need a Literary Agent,"" by Dennis E. Hensley. Some appeal to newer writers, and some to more seasoned folks. There's even a glossary to catch you up on the myriad of industry terms. And when you've decided to learn more, there's a thorough bibliography. Whew!The short of it is you need this book. It has no peer.

"I carried an early edition of ""Butterflies and Moths"" around with my as I traipsed about fields near my home, butterfly hunting. I'd find a butterfly (or moth, as the case may be) and approximate which one it was through this guide.The pictures are accurate. Not only will you see the butterfly, but a close up of various parts. There are maps showing where it can be found, a very useful tool when the picture doesn't seem to match. It can help you determine if you have a certain variation, or a very lost butterfly.Though a picture is worth a thousand words, the text found here is equally helpful. There are Latin names, pupae descriptions, eating habits and more. They've been careful not to overwhelm the reader, but there's plenty to whet the reading appetite of any young butterfly hunter.It isn't just for children. Anyone with a garden would be happy to have this as a reference or as curious reading to learn just who has been munching the lettuce.I fully recommend ""Butterflies and Moths.""Anthony Trendltreefortbooks.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFLYI6MHBE54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CCVQ2U#wasThisHelpful","R1WFLYI6MHBE54","A3FVAWZNKW9GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FVAWZNKW9GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a speechwriter, I'm asked to include quotes from noteworthy people. Invariably, my clients see something on Facebook and are convinced it is accurate. It might be, but we all know Albert Einstein didn't say everything attributed to him.That's where Bartlett's Familiar Quotations kicks in. I've been using this since childhood, and now, as it is continually updated, it searches for the balances of classical and new quotes.Among the things Bartlett's does better than some former Star Trek star posting quotable memes on social media is that these are vetted. They are sourced. You know who really said them. Don't speak at a fundraiser and say, ""J. K. Rowling said..."" when, in fact, it was actually in the Bible, Shakespeare or Bob Dylan. Bartlett's will help you there.Can it be better? Yes. It can be thicker. Make it comprehensive, not merely portable.While for me, this is a tool of the trade, it is also wildly entertaining, inspiring and challenging.

"Barq's remains one of the few (only?) national root beers with caffeine. For me, that's a plus. It is on the sweeter side, with a vanilla emphasis.

Goes well with hot dogs.Because of the vanilla, it goes well with classic root beer floats.

"Hopkins is one of those poets hidden from so many because of his subject matter, yet is considered one of the most influential Victorian poets for his use of word combinations, meter and image.Added to the delicious and poignant poetry is the contemplative nature of it. You'll read about his humility and submission to God, his genuine faith, his desire that his poetry exalt God and not Hopkins himself.Most his work was published posthumously, as late as 1920 or so, and immediately influenced the likes of T.S. Elliot (AKA, the guy who wrote the poem ""Cats"" is based on and ""Wasteland"") and his contemporaries.While Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde were exalting in themselves, and just after Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were helping us see creation, Hopkins demonstrated prowess in pointing readers to see the Creator in the creation.Atheists won't agree with him, of course, but he says it so well, they will at least go, ""Hmm... if I believed, I could see that... yeah, wow, well put."" The Catholics will cheer him on, ""Atta boy... yep, that guy's a Jesuit!"" Not undone are the Protestants who will be so impressed in agreement they'll be happy he was a Christian.Check out this snippet from ""Pied Beauty"":Glory be to God for dappled things--For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches wings;Landscape plotted and pieced--fold, fallow, and plough;And 'all tra'des, their gear and tackle and trim.""Those accents are in the original.Delicious to say aloud?

"In ""Feral Cities: Adventures with Animals in the Urban Jungle"" Tristan Donovan looks at the range of animals that have come to reside in cities where they aren't native.  He looks at the animal's behavior -- why it does what it does and how it can survive in places we might at first think unlikely.An immediate thought I had when I saw the title, ""Feral Cities"" was of cities with an abundance of cats. Largo di Torre Argentina in Rome came to mind, as did perhaps some random ghost town which might have had cats overtake whatever was left. But, cats are one animal. And there are a lot of cities which are abandoned or which simply cannot handle the multitude of creatures. He broadens the usual definition of feral, and includes any animal making a new home in an area where we might not expect.Meanwhile, there are famously infested cities, like New York City, with arguably more rats than people.In my own community, in a suburb 35 miles west of Chicago, coyotes and red foxes have started showing up with greater frequency. The city is trying to sort out humane ways of managing this, of course, but small pets, like dogs, have been lost.Coyotes, for example, Donovan points out, are not just showing up in suburbs relatively close to the woods. They are in Chicago itself, as well as Miami (and elsewhere).Donovan's writing style is part documentary and part feature journalist, with a storytelling bent. This makes it an easy read, grabbing your curiosity while you learn something interesting.I fully recommend ""Feral Cities: Adventures with Animals in the Urban Jungle"" by Tristan Donovan.Anthony Trendl","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSWJTOF3VY2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569760675#wasThisHelpful","R1FSWJTOF3VY2U","A3FVAWZNKW9GX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FVAWZNKW9GX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use Figaro Hickory Liquid Smoke at home when I'm in a pinch, like when I'm unexpectedly out of wood, or cooking in the kitchen. It works well enough, although it has a salty-vinegary over-taste if you use a lot.When I need just a dash, this works well, but any recipe needs less salt accordingly. Because it is liquid, compensate by reducing other liquids when possible. The liquid is mostly water and can leave your burgers sloppy.Your best choice is real hickory wood.

"Anyone remotely serious about BBQ has invariably watched one of those PBS series on grilling and BBQing and has learned a little of the history. This is particularly true of Steven Raichlen's shows. But when it comes to feeding that curiosity through books, mostly we consume tomes on technique and recipes. That's great -- gotta know the best way to smoke a large roast without drying it out or how to keep fish from falling apart.Until now. Until Tim Miller's ""Barbecue: A History (The Meals Series)."" Miller's a historian, not a chef. While he obviously loves 'Q, he knows what a proper history is as well.Miller gets through the types of barbecue, the American culture of it, and what BBQ is like globally. But he also has a strong focus on barbecue from the 1800s onward, when the American culture and industry really took off, from random stands to complete restaurants emphasizing some nuance of this great cuisine.Particularly interesting are the stories behind known brands, like KC Masterpiece. A sauce was developed by a physician who sold it in Kansas City. The success led to a small, but growing chain of restaurants.

"I'm upgrading from the Johnston & Murphy Melton Oxford (see my review there) which I enjoyed thoroughly. These Greenwich Oxfords are fantastic, albeit slightly large at the same size as the Meltons.As a slightly flamboyant wingtip, these are stylish yet conservative. As I see clients, I'm pleased knowing that I've taken care to look professional. The stitching and cuts are consistent -- I'm confident they'll hold despite me knocking them around.As these are better quality shoes, there's a break-in period. For me, this matters as these are slightly larger than my Meltons (maybe a quarter size), and I'll need them to fit well over long periods of time.They are comfortable and, as the description says, there's an insert to absorb moisture.Overall, I'm pleased.

"To coincide with the release of Superman's 75th anniversary in 2013, DC wanted to make a grand spectacle story of the Man of Steel in comics by using an epic team to coincide with that idea.  Look no further than DC's biggest names in comics currently than Batman writer Scott Snyder and mega-hyper-superstar artist/co-publisher Jim Lee to do the trick.  With a team this massive and a massive story to tell in 9 issues does it live up to the hype?  No, but it's still a fun read.  This review will be a little bit spoiler-ish to explain the general plot, but nothing too major.Collecting all 9 issues, SUPERMAN UNCHAINED begins in a flashback to 1945 where we see the bombing on Nagasaki and notice the nuclear bomb in the history books isn't really a bomb but something else entirely.  Fast forward to modern day where Superman is trying in all his power to stop eight falling satellites from plummeting to Earth's atmosphere and killing people from the debris.  It appears a cyber terrorists group called Ascension might be responsible for the satellites falling, but Superman thinks Lex Luthor might be the real culprit.  Looking into who or what really brought down the satellites, Superman finds out another party might be in on the incident called the Machine, a secret black ops division of the government lead by general Lane that has been defending and controlling events throughout America since the 1930s.  And one of the Machines greatest weapons is Wraith, an alien similar and more powerful than Superman who's been working for the American government for 70+ years including the one reasonable for the Nagasaki bomb.  Who really brought down the satellites?  Ascension?  The Machine?  Lex Luthor?  Maybe all three?  Either way, Superman will give it his all to fight figure who did this and even get some help from the Justice League to do it.With an epic creative team, you need to create an epic story that Snyder and Lee handle reasonably well.  UNCHAINED is equal parts action heavy, character building, and metaphorical as ever could be; with additional handles on all aspects of the Superman mythos under story while dealing with the current New 52 continuity and being a stand-alone tale.  So all of Superman's list of characters like Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, Lex Luthor, and a few others make appearances, while still holding firm so some the New 52 Superman's personality traits reasonably well.  Snyder's work on darker material like Batman, American Vampire, and current Image series, Wytches, are his suitable options, but his work on lighter material like Superman is handled pretty well for Superman's character, as well as the numerous other characters like Lois Lane being the tough reporter she is, Luthor being the cool, calm, and collected evil genius, and yes: Batman gets some of the best times to shine (what did you expect from the current Bat-writer?).  And the new addition of Wraith is a decent and likeable character as we see him being a semi-mentor figure (you have to read to find out what I mean).  So overall, Snyder makes a story that is gripping, massive in action and scale, and just what Superman means to the beacon of hope with his own touches to what a Superman story could be.Since Jim Lee is the artist, it should come as no surprise that he is still one of the best artists in the industry for a good reason.  Sure the comic was delayed for months because of his slow drawing style (9 issues were done from June 2013 till November 2014).  Every detail, done to the littlest scratch is done in full by Lee, with massive splash pages of kinetic energy ripping off the page.  The epic 6-page foldout from issue #1 (which is not part of the deluxe edition sadly), saving the worlds tallest building in Dubai,to the vastness of the Batcave and Fortress of Solitude, to the fight with Wraith taking place all over Earth and the Moon, and Batman fighting Wraith that Bat-fans go hog wild; Lee's art will not disappoint, which is also in thanks to long time inker Scott Williams.  I do think there are parts of Lee's art that look a little rushed by comparison to many of his other works, but that's only something diehard fans will notice.  Additional art is handled nicely by Dustin Nguyen on the backup stories and flashback sequences.So although I liked this series, I'm only giving it a 4-star rating.  A few of the flaws go toward some of the changes in the story.  One of which is the massive change for Wraith, who readers will get to know for a while throughout the first half of the story, then he does a complete 180-character change and he becomes one-dimensional and reasoning is narrow minded; his character feels like it was forcefully changed and it didn't make sense.  Another aspect one that is amongst the many themes in the story, the first being time.  This theme has been covered in past Superman tales, but it doesn't add because: 1)it's comics; these characters have been around 75 years and they do not age.  I get Snyder's concept, but I doubt the theme he introduces will ever come up again because comics will never get to the point he references and 2)we already have the Legion of Super-Heroes to show that Superman's influence goes a long way for time (like say the year 3000 or so).  And the other theme that Snyder introduces goes against many of the ideas he uses throughout the story at the ending.  It felt a little anticlimactic.As for this hardcover deluxe edition, under the dust jacket is a blank black board (why can't DC make a decent board cover?).  The book is sewn/glued binding and has a lot of pages for the buck.  Unfortunately for the binding, there are times the book suffers from gutter loss, not in the wording balloons, but Lee's jaw-dropping art.  Some of those splash pages cannot be presented properly because of the loss in some of the art.  It's only a few pieces I felt were lost, but still.  As for extras, if I counted right, there are 55 alternative covers! With most of issue #1's script with some of Jim Lee's rough sketches.  So there are some nice extras here.  And as I mentioned before, the regular comic issue #1 had a 6-page foldout of Superman busting through a satellite whereas that is NOT included in this deluxe edition.  So any of you fans who own the regular comic, you do have bragging rights.Even with one of the hottest writers and artist on one of the biggest characters in comics, SUPERMAN UNCHAINED is an enjoyable romp that fans of the Man of Steel will enjoy, as well as feast on Jim Lee's rich art.  The problems with the ending and some of the themes do hamper this story though.  I do not think it was one of the strongest Superman tales that would go in a top 10 or 20 Superman stories ever told, but this is still an enjoyable and lush book for new and old fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHABTAD0H38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401245226#wasThisHelpful","R2CHABTAD0H38","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Batman the Animated Series is widely considered one of the best comic animated television shows of all time, even among some of the best regular animated shows.  That is quite a feat.  I am a part of those who give it such praise because I am a part of those 90's kids who faithfully watched the show all the time.  During the time of the shows air time, a comic book series was published to coincide with the show like many marketing ventures would do.  Now most projects that tie-in to advertise usually fail to match the same material, but this comic series did carry on a good continuity with the show.  So after being out of print for some time now, the original comic series has returned and guess what?  It's still pretty good.BATMAN ADVENTURES VOL.1 collects issues #1-10 that consist of stories that are stand alone tales of Batman taking on numerous classic rogues like Penguin, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Clayface, Killer Croc, Riddler, and Joker; with some familiar faces like Alfred, Robin, detective Bullock, and Gotham report Summer Gleason.  There are some stories that loosely connect to an over-arching plot (say issues 1 and 2 lead-into issue 3), but these are done-in-one stories.There isn't much I can say about that.  Kelley Puckett wrote a good majority of these issues with Martin Pasko doing scripts with issues #4 and #5.  The following stories include Penguin stealing money for a charity scheme, Catwoman stealing jewelry (as usual), T.V. reporter Summer Gleason being used by Clayface, and Bruce Wayne being framed for murder is some examples.  Puckett follows the animated series greatly by being for all ages, yet keeping some of the darker elements of the show like blood, violence, and poetic justice/cryptic endings just right for comic readers.  One story with Scarecrow creating fear gas that makes people illiterate has a fascinating ending that really stood out for me.  Even the voice of the characters match the show enough where you can hear the voice actors lines when reading.As for art, Ty Templeton and Rick Burchett do majority of the shows Bruce Timm-style mockup drawings reasonably well.  All the bold details, noir black backgrounds, and touches of cartoony expressions are handled with care.The collection has zero additional material, even to the point of no advertisements in the back.  One slight error happened in issue #6, pages 133 where an interrogation piece between Bullock and Bruce's lawyer that their word bubbles are blank.  No big deal, but still an error.If you are a fan of the original Batman: The Animated Series or Batman fan in general, THE BATMAN ADVENTURES is a nice slice of nostalgia for you.  And it's also a good book for younger audiences who may want to stay away from the darker Batman stories out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7TW0FI1D998/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140125229X#wasThisHelpful","R3H7TW0FI1D998","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this summer's past release of Guardians of the Galaxy, it was only natural for Kotobukiya/ArtFX to release a statue as one of the many and current popular characters to people. That going for two of the most prominent characters in the film by most people: Rocket Raccoon and Groot. What is here is an awesome small statue, but some surprises in terms of scale compared to the other 1:10 ratio figures.For starters, both Groot and Rocket are separate piece. As with the rest of the ArtFX line, parts have to be assembled together. Groot is already done and requires no assembly; whereas Rocket has to be place on top of Groot and his arm holding his gun is a separate piece. Not too many parts and not difficult. As for the detail art, it's a usual Kotobukiya-level of detail and design that one would expect form the company. Every part of the two's coloring and subtle details show. Every scratch of tree bark, roots, and fungus is superb on Groot with those black eyes in an emotionless expression, while Rocket has tons of tiny holes to show his fur and mechanical display from his gun as he snarls onward grasping to Groot. Both are well-rendered from their movie counterparts.Now here is where some of the troubles are.As for the height, the Amazon product description is wrong. It says Rocket is 5.6 inches tall and that is incorrect. That is the height of Rocket WITH his gun ON Groot's shoulder. Rocket himself without the gun is 3.5 inches tall and about 4.7 inches tall with the gun. This isn't necessarily a negative considering the amount of detail the figure has, but once you piece it all together it looks small and underwhelming, especially when you compare it side-by-side to the Avengers statues. Rocket himself matches the right size of his character when you place him with any other Avenger at their waist level, as does Groot's head and shoulders. But since it's only 1:10 of Groot's scale, it just feels odd.Another aspect is the lack of a base for the figure. Amazon has it stated it comes with a base like the many other statues from Kotobukiya, but my figure had none. It could have been a packaging error on my copy, but none the less it does seem a little odd not to have one even though Groot/Rocket stands extreme well without it.And the last setback is the little flaw in placing Rocket just right on Groot. Yes Rocket does have pegs in his feet to place at, but his hand has to be just right when you connect to Groot which might be a problem. Nothing severe, but it's a small detail.As for the ROCKET ROCCOON AND GROOT ARTFX+ STATUE is usual Kotobukiya high level detail at a modest price when compared to more statues, I am a bit let down by this figure by the small sized compared to the other Marvel figures and at the same price. I think it would have been better for Kotobukiya to make a full-scale 1:10 ration body of Groot and upped the price tag like they did with Hulk. It's a good little statue, but I would have liked it to be a little bit bigger. If you are a hard-core Guardians/Rocket/Groot fan, this might really make you happy regardless of the lack of a base and size. But for the price, I was a little let down from the size compared to the other Marvel figure. A 3 ½ star-score, nut I'm rounding to 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZW756VBH7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS5F194#wasThisHelpful","R2IZW756VBH7Y","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the Kotobukiya/ArtFX Marvel NOW! Statue collection in full-swing, only two figures of the Avengers line need completion to round out the line-up: Iron Man and Thor.  While Iron Man will not come out until end of this year, my favorite Marvel super hero, Thor, has finally been released just in time for Halloween.  Although Thor may not be quite as detailed-oriented as some of the other figures, heâ€™s still a solid piece to the collection.Thor is one cool statue that stands at 7.14 inches from head-to-toe (8.3 inches if you count the wings on the helmet.)  Compared to the other Marvel statues that have some likeness to the actors, I find Thor to be solely based on the comic version and none of Chris Hemsworth facial expressions (but Hemsworth never wears the helmet in the films).  Thor stands strong-fully with his right hand in a tight fist, while his left arm is extended forward to ready a bolt of lightning or stand in a strong defensive position.  Standing next to Captain America, Thor looks a bit bulkier looking (heâ€™s a god after all!).Although Thor isnâ€™t quite as detailed as most of the other figures in tiny ways due to Thor being made up dark navy throughout, Thor still is a solid piece and detailed where it counts.  His belt, the outlined armor from his legs and arms, the head and helmet, and the cape.  There is a certain aura about his battle stance with the cape that makes Thor look wicked.As with the rest of the Marvel/ArtFX line thus far, the model has to be assembled. The lower torso connects to the upper body with the cape, the two arms connects on there own, head connects to upper body, and Thorâ€™s hammer, Mjolnir is made up of two-parts (the hammer connects to the handle as to slip on Thorâ€™s hand).  So for the most part, it felt pretty easy to piece Thor together compared to Hawkeye who had quite a few small parts.And like the other statues, Thor comes with a 4x4 black display stand that is magnetic. Thor is reasonably sturdy thanks to the magnets where even some wobbling wonâ€™t knock him down, though he can still fall over if an earthquake.  But heâ€™s pretty sturdy.My favorite Marvel superhero Thor is great for the price.  If youâ€™re collecting this whole collection, Thor is not one to be missed out on.  Tisâ€™ a good statue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189FZ1RSBC6A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPKOEL2#wasThisHelpful","R189FZ1RSBC6A9","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Marvel, a female-version character who was created in 1968 for Captain Marvel as Carol Danvers (not the original and confusing history of DC's Captain Marvel now called Shazam!).  Carol held the title for numerous years in comics and as sexual icon with her black spandex, long stocking boots, and red stash.  Carol has been a prominent component for Marvel women the past decade and has risen to now status in 2012 as Captain Marvel under writer Kelly Sue DeConnick with a whole new suit and outlook on life.  So with the title of Ms.Marvel being vacant, who else will take up the title?  How about fan-fiction writing 16-year old Pakistani American teenage girl  from New Jersey who is Muslim and who adores her idol, Carol Danvers?  Well that is one way to get peoples attention.MS.MARVEL VOL.1 NO NORMAL collects issues #1-5 and All New Marvel NOW! Point One.  Our protagonist, Kamala Khan is your typical 16-year old geeky girl who lives in a working class Muslim family.  She wants to hang out with the cool kids, go to parties to fit in, but her family's lifestyle holds her back.  But one night, while sneaking out to a party against her families wishes, Kamala gains shape shifting abilities in a dark mist.  Now scared and amazed by having super powers, Kamala takes up her icon's old alas and costume, Ms. Marvel, to help out the community, yet Kamala is trying to work out her new powers and the pressures of school and family life.The re-launched Ms. Marvel caught a lot of media attention because it is the first time a Muslim character stars in a comic book.  I personally do not care about such subject material, especially thanks in part to the wide acclaim the series was getting.  And it shows.  This is thanks greatly to writer G. Willow Wilson, who I have heard before but never read any of her material.  She is an American who went to college and changed to a Muslim during that time, so she has a working understanding of the religion and is a woman writing for a female lead.  I must say I am impressed.  What makes this series special is the simple, tired-and-true regular person gets super powers formula and makes for an engaging piece that is more human and down to Earth from many other comics.  The formula is very similar to Spider-Man for this opening volume with Kamala getting over her life's problems and dealing with superpowers.  This isn't a book where numerous characters throughout the Marvel universe pop in and out, or ties in to other titles, or be earth-shattering consequences; this is a grounded coming-of-age superhero story that our main heroine just happens to be Muslim.This is thanks to Wilson who portrays the character of Kamala as highly likable from the start.  The Muslim background is downplayed the moment we see her family and find out, even if their religion can a bit different from most people, they are just like every family out there and we connect with Kamala.  She's a bit of an outcast (with and without her Muslim background), she has anxieties about fitting in with the crowd, she likes all kinds of stuff, and she has a good heart.  Wilson gives Kamala a massive amount of charm, humanity, and even some funny pieces, which is backed up by an every strong supportive cast of character as well.  Kamala's best friend and her older brother are just examples. These characters are offbeat yet very real to the point where I like just about every character on panel (even the popular snobbish student, Zoe, has a selective charm as well).  And this is also shown throughout this volume where the antagonist is only a secondary story that will resolve in volume 2, where Wilson spends these 5 issues getting us used to Kamala' ordeals that I think most 16-year olds would go through.What greatly brings Wilson's story to have such visual wit and charm is Adrian Alphona's art work.  The man is responsible for drawing Runaways: The Complete Collection Volume 1, so Alphona knows exactly how to draw and express teenage characters, not like super models where many comics do.  It's good art and maintains a fine line for somewhat cartoony look and manga style for all ages.  And Ms. Marvel's new costume is practical in the same vein as Carol Danvers current costume.I didn't find any flaws in this opening volume from Wilson and Alphona, which those flaws are minor and do not affect the story.  It's not an action-packed story like many others.  It's rated Teen+, but aside from a few PG curse word this could pass for an all age's story.  One fault is the lack of explanation of the Terrigen Mist which gives Kamala her power in the comic is not explained or referenced.  The events of Infinity lead to the aftermath of the terrigen from the Inhumanity storyline, which explains the mist in this series.  Although it is annoying for new readers who might not know that, even lack of knowledge really didn't effect the charm of the series.So MS.MARVEL VOL.1: NO NORMAL is one of the most human and charming books on the comic stands.  It's a very grounded story with a lot of heart and humor that may not be anything new in comics, but it does it right.  This is one series I highly recommend and will continue to read from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FVJ7HXZS2EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519021X#wasThisHelpful","R23FVJ7HXZS2EX","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there is anything DC needs more to break the doom-and-gloom of the New 52, is more light-hearted comics and more female leads.  Marvel is doing pretty well in those departments with Marvel NOW!, so it makes sense to give one of the most popular females in DC her own comic for awhile.  Sheâ€™s done it in the past before, so why not?  DC has a very slim selection of offbeat comics like the brilliant BATMAN 66â€™ come to mind, it is always nice to have some more entertaining comics we can smile with.  And this new series of Harley Quinn fits the bill.Collecting issues #0-8, HARLEY QUINN VOL.1: HOT IN THE CITY seeâ€™s Harley Quinn inherent a building complex in Coney Island, Brooklyn from a friend who was in Arkham asylum and passed away.  Harley is alone without the Suicide Squad, without her on/off again lover Joker not around, so some change is needed for Harley.  She decides to move to Coney Island and becomes land lord of a 4-story building and its tenants that inhabit it.  But Harley cannot just sit around a building all day since the previous landlord owed back-taxes, building cost, and numerous other deductibles.  So Harley finds two different jobs working for as a therapist for a nursing home during the day and roller derby at night to keep the building afloat.  And in the background, there appears to be numerous bounty hunters gunning for Harley because someone put a hit on her head.  Itâ€™s going to one crazy adventure for Ms. Quinn.Outside of that summary of the story and issues #5 and #6 being a 2-part arc, a great deal of these stories are made up crazy shenanigans in the life of Harley Quinn.  .  Itâ€™s an absurd series where Harley takes on the classic tradition of the DC universe where one character is the social-satire/self-relevant/fourth-wall breaking character to point out the oddities in comics.  For the past two decades is was Lobo (Pre-52 Lobo, not slimed-down New-52 Lobo), so DC has made Harley the new advocate for insane hijinx.  Harley is nowhere near as fanatical as Marvelâ€™s Deadpool, but this new series is still fun, whimsical, violent, and loaded with irreverent humor and frenetic action.  Yes, issue #0 is all about breaking the fourth-wall with its cast loaded with all-star artist that draw one page apiece because Harley is having a dream about finding the perfect artist for her new comic series with additional commentary from writers Palmiotti and Conner.  Outside of that, most the issues are less meta and more crazy situations.Writers and husband/wife duo Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner make Harley a little of her Pre-52 self and some of her current New-52 version really embodies Harley Quinn as the ""lovable psychopath"" character she is and what situations she gets herself into.  Sheâ€™s a little ditzy, adores animals to the point of killing people who mishandle them (wait till you see what she does to a guy dragging his dog while talking on his cellphone), fights love-induced people on Valentines Day akin to Night of the Living Dead, helps out an old-retired super spy, gets advice from a stuffed beaver, and her closest friend which I will not spoil who she is drops by that makes some of the best scenes in the book and calls back to Paul Diniâ€™s work on Harley Pre-52.  Additionally, the writers have also wisely created a supporting cast that complements Harley reasonably well.Besides the massive cast of high-profile artist in issue #0, a good majority is handled quite well by Chad Hardin.  Itâ€™s lush, a bit cartoony, and surprisingly detailed considering this series could have done with more simplified art considering the humor.  Hardin also conveys a great deal of the running jokes and pop culture references on every page.  Additional art is provided by Stephane Roux who blends well with Hardinâ€™s art appropriately.I didnâ€™t feel this book had any flaws.  I say that loosely because itâ€™s a comic for a certain crowd of people.  I thought it was fun and humorous at times, but it wasnâ€™t gut-busting humor.  I thought the 2-part story arc was a bit of a drab.  The true flaw might be the books intentions.  It doesnâ€™t really know what it wants to be.  Itâ€™s just Harley getting into crazy scenarios.  It doesnâ€™t have anything to do with the larger DC Universe and its plot is paper thin especially considering the ending that we find out who put the bounty on Harleyâ€™s head.  And maybe thatâ€™s just the point of this series is to have fun without any real story here?Either way, HARLEY QUINN VOL.1: HOT IN THE CITY sets out to be a entertaining and buggy series for Harley Quinn, which I think it accomplishes quite well.  The action and zaniness are entertaining, the art is pretty great, and a lovable Harley is back in the New-52.  The lack of direction for this series might or might not prove if the sight gags and characters can hold up for future issues though.  I still enjoyed this comic for being light-hearted material and being different from the darker corners of the New 52.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCDWCIJ7OCRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401248926#wasThisHelpful","R3KCDWCIJ7OCRA","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this summer's past release of Guardians of the Galaxy, it was only natural for Kotobukiya/ArtFX to release a statue as one of the many and current popular characters to people.  That going for two of the most prominent characters in the film by most people: Rocket Raccoon and Groot.  What is here is an awesome small statue, but some surprises in terms of scale compared to the other 1:10 ratio figures.For starters, both Groot and Rocket are separate piece.  As with the rest of the ArtFX line, parts have to be assembled together.  Groot is already done and requires no assembly; whereas Rocket has to be place on top of Groot and his arm holding his gun is a separate piece.  Not too many parts and not difficult.  As for the detail art, it's a usual Kotobukiya-level of detail and design that one would expect form the company.  Every part of the two's coloring and subtle details show.  Every scratch of tree bark, roots, and fungus is superb on Groot with those black eyes in an emotionless expression, while Rocket has tons of tiny holes to show his fur and mechanical display from his gun as he snarls onward grasping to Groot.  Both are well-rendered from their movie counterparts.Now here is where some of the troubles are.As for the height, the Amazon product description is wrong.  It says Rocket is 5.6 inches tall and that is incorrect.  That is the height of Rocket WITH his gun ON Groot's shoulder.  Rocket himself without the gun is 3.5 inches tall and about 4.7 inches tall with the gun.  This isn't necessarily a negative considering the amount of detail the figure has, but once you piece it all together it looks small and underwhelming, especially when you compare it side-by-side to the Avengers statues.  Rocket himself matches the right size of his character when you place him with any other Avenger at their waist level, as does Groot's head and shoulders.  But since it's only 1:10 of Groot's scale, it just feels odd.Another aspect is the lack of a base for the figure.  Amazon has it stated it comes with a base like the many other statues from Kotobukiya, but my figure had none.  It could have been a packaging error on my copy, but none the less it does seem a little odd not to have one even though Groot/Rocket stands extreme well without it.And the last setback is the little flaw in placing Rocket just right on Groot.  Yes Rocket does have pegs in his feet to place at, but his hand has to be just right when you connect to Groot which might be a problem.  Nothing severe, but it's a small detail.As for the ROCKET ROCCOON AND GROOT ARTFX+ STATUE is usual  Kotobukiya high level detail at a modest price when compared to more statues, I am a bit let down by this figure by the small sized compared to the other Marvel figures and at the same price.  I think it would have been better for Kotobukiya to make a full-scale 1:10 ration body of Groot and upped the price tag like they did with Hulk.  It's a good little statue, but I would have liked it to be a little bit bigger.  If you are a hard-core Guardians/Rocket/Groot fan, this might really make you happy regardless of the lack of a base and size.  But for the price, I was a little let down from the size compared to the other Marvel figure.  A 3 Â½ star-score, nut I'm rounding to 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIEMXT07YNIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLX8Y0U#wasThisHelpful","R1YIEMXT07YNIZ","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I just recently did my review on Captain America, I can now start purchasing the lovely Kotobukiya/ArtFX Marvel NOW! Statue collection with some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thrown in. And since I picked up Captain America, I picked up Hawkeye sitting right next him. And although he's just as cool and detailed as the rest of the Kotobukiya/ArtFX line, he's a bit more complicated than the most.Hawkeye is a solid sculpted piece that stands roughly around 7.5 inches like the rest of the figures. His overall design is based off his comic incarnation, but his head design with the hair and cheek look like actor Jeremy Renner. Hawkeye is in a strong defensive/offensive pose ready to fight his arrow at any moment. Like the other statues, the amount of detail is incredible with little flaw. The various clothing details of the wrinkles, the belt-pockets, buckles, straps, boot laces, gun holster, fingers, and even the arrows are done to point blank detail. So as a sculpt goes, it's near flawless.As with the rest of the Marvel/ArtFX line thus far, the model has to be assembled. The lower torso connects to the upper body, the two arms connects on there own, the quiver connects to the back (you can choose to position it on either left or right shoulder), the bow is one piece, and you receive 5 arrows (1 for Hawkeye to use on his bow and the other 4 in his quiver). Now here is the part where Hawkeye struggles a bit. Compared to the other statues that I felt relatively easy to connect together, Hawkeye is a little bit more cumbersome. Putting him together isn't too bad, but you see you have to put the arrow in-between his two fingers and a tiny little gap on the bow to achieve the look you want and it might be difficult for some to do. I kept getting the arrow out of balance to fix the look because either his fingers or that tiny gap rarely held it up.Other people might or might not have the problem. Other than that, the statue is sturdy with a 4x4inches across black display stand that is magnetic. Hawkeye is reasonably sturdy thanks to the magnets where even some wobbling won't knock him down, though he can still fall over if an earthquake ever hit and because of the frailness of holding the arrow, you might be fixing that problem a lotStill this is an impressive figure all around and possibly has the best pose/action of the Avenger group in my opinion. The only problem is the arrow/bow stance that might be hell for some people, so I'll knock the rating down to 4-stars. Still a great addition to this growing collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZB6KYBH33GW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICMM1DM#wasThisHelpful","RZB6KYBH33GW1","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After three mediocre volumes of the New 52 Green Arrow, DC finally got it right by putting writer Jeff Lemire and artist Andrea Sorrentino on volume 4 to a much needed shot in the arm for the character, as well as making a different tone for the series that hasn't been done before to match the New 52 idea.  It is safe to say that the follow-up volume 5 by the new creative team continue to impress with this new direction and push the GL mythology in a unique direction.GREEN ARROW VOL.5: THE OUTSIDERS WAR collects issues #25-31.  Issue #25 is a ZERO YEAR tie-in and issues #26-31 are the Outsiders War arc.After finally overcoming Komodo from Green Arrow Vol. 4: The Kill Machine (The New 52), Oliver Queen AKA Green Arrow is ready to finish the fight against him and take on the mysterious Outsiders Clan in Prague, Czech Republic.  Not to mention Seattle is slowly being taken over by the crime lord Richard Dragon, but Oliver can only do one thing at a time so his bodyguard Diggle and assistants Fyff and Naomi stay in Seattle to ready the coming battle against Dragon.  But first things first, Shado wants Oliver to go back to the Island where he must find the totem Arrow to lead the arrow clan and fight back against Komodo the army of the Outsiders.  But there is more to the Island than just the totem Arrow: Oliver will learn more about his true origins and the revelations of his father.Jeff Lemire continues to redefine Green Arrow not only within the New 52 with its urban/noir setting, but the overall mythology of the character.  Lemire used volume 4 for setting up the initial tone and characters, but volume 5 is where things pay off with action, revelations, and the ending to the Komodo/Outsiders War arc.  I cannot explain too much because that would be a lot of spoiler.  I will say we get to the see the clans now and in action.  The inclusion of the various weapons clans make for a whole new array of allies or villains for the series to come for writers to pick up from and toy with.The other big factor in this volume besides the end of the Outsiders War arc is more insight on Oliver when he was stuck on the island.  A great deal of this volume is made up of flashbacks to Oliver's struggles as he went from spoiled brat to hardened superhero.  This adds more layers and insight on Lemire and Sorrentino's grittier GA that follows a bit from the ""Arrow"" television show (as well as Oliver's mother and Diggle meeting with Oliver from the ZERO YEAR issue), as well as taking the same urban grit from Green Arrow: Year One.  This gives the characters more emotion and grounding of the series.Additionally, we get Seattle story brewing the background with Diggle, Fyff and Naomi  readying the inevitable confrontation with the New 52 version of Richard Dragon that plays out pretty well.  It won't be until the next volume where Lemire ends the Richard Dragon arc.Besides the backup story from issue #25 by legendary artist Bill Sienkiewicz, Andrea Sorrentino does every issue to superb effort.  His style is hard-boiled yet it gels to match Lemire's scripts.  Some of his most lavishing work is the splash pages.  One for example that comes to mind is when Oliver has an epiphany and the whole page is spread out like a collage.  It's just art.If there are any setbacks for me it might be the totem clans do not receive enough page time to see exactly what they can do from one another.  We get to see the spear and fist clan do some stuff, but that's about it.  The change in GL lore might really tick some fans off; And that because Lemire and Sorrentino are finishing up Green Arrow with issues #34 and Futures End: Green Arrow, I feel Lemire wraps up parts of the story too well.  Meaning I would have liked some aspects of this new mythology for GA to stay intact so other writers can pick up the ball and see what they do with it.  You'll see what I mean by the end.Other than that, GREEN ARROW VOL.5: THE OUTSIDERS WAR by Lemire and Sorrentino continue to be a great breath of fresh air for the emerald archer.  If you loved volume 4, then volume 5 is a must-have.  It will be a shame to see this team leave after the next volume, seeing as the show ""Arrow"" writer Andrew Kreisberg takes over from Lemire.  I'm worried Kreisberg will wipe away what Lemire set and start making GA more like the ""Arrow"" show (please, please do not do that).  But we'll have to wait and see.  And oddly enough, Jeff Lemire will write Marvel's Hawkeye in 2015.  Ironic, huh?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2950ISZNRU5MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401250440#wasThisHelpful","R2950ISZNRU5MC","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit Iâ€™m not much of a Moon Knight fan.  Iâ€™ve read the occasional stories of the character here and there on team books (including his portrayal on Ellisâ€™s own work on Secret Avengers), but nothing too much on him.  I know his back-story as Marc Spector a mercenary who dies in an archeological dig site in front of the Egyptian Moon God statue of Khonshu where he was revived and came back to the US and became Moon Knight fighting crime with multiple personalities, including Khonshu taking over Moon Knights body half the time and the character having internal struggles with himself.*whew* Well beyond that synopsisâ€™, that same origin is summed up in two pages under writer Warren Ellis as to catch new readers up to speed without any prior knowledge. Warren Ellisâ€™s name is what caught my attention to trying out this new relaunch, so I had to give it a try.  Ellis is one of the more prestigious names in the world of comics with his work on Transmetropolitan, Planetary, IronMan: Extremis, Hellblazer, StormWatch, The Authority, Red, and many others under his belt and what Ellis has is a solid reintroduction of this character that is brilliant thanks greatly to the perfect art Declan Shalvey.MOON KNIGHT VOL.1: FROM THE DEAD collects issues #1-6.  Marc Spector is Moon Knight, a superhero who fights crime and many other weird things during the night.  Heâ€™s returned from the West Coast to New York to help out.  He only has two aliases this time: Moon Knight, the superhero who fights crime with gadgets, drenched in his traditional cloak, and very has little to say.  And Mr. Knight, a street-level detective who uses his brains to deduce crimes while driving around in a white remote-controlled limo and wears an all white business suit (very similarly to Ellisâ€™s other character, Elijah Snow from Planetary).Thatâ€™s the premise, simple as that because all six issues are done-in-one stories that highlight the various aspects that make Moon Knight an interesting character study from various situations.  Knight spends all six issues doing numerous acts to highlight his character: one issues being a Sherlock Holmes mystery, stop a revenge-fueled sniper from killing every member of an old past, using his mystic armaments to fight ghost(?!), investigate a sleeping experiment driving its patients crazy by entering a mushroom planet (I kid you not), single-handily clearing an entire building of enforcers just to save a kidnapped girl (think 2012â€™s Dredd movie in a way), and going into the mind what makes an envious good man become a villain (a perfect issue that could explain any and all why villains come from).  Each one of these stories are different from one another and yet showcase Moon Knight in unique ways, as well as giving some of Knights darker thoughts in a down-played manner without being bogged down in his own schizophrenic-mind (like Bendis run on the character Moon Knight thought he was Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America.  Yeah thatâ€™s a little too much for me).  And Ellisâ€™s sharp wit comes through each issue with a distinct message and metaphor that sets this series apart from many comics out there.Though there a few problems with this book do arise.  Because these are done-in-one stories, they will fly by quick or leave readers cold expecting a typical 5-6 issue arc.  Additionally, most of the endings are a bit too quick because of the short formats, and some would argue they might feel like Deus ex machina effect on one or two issues worth.  About half of these issues have very little to no words, so youâ€™ll skim through this quick.  And Ellisâ€™s metaphors might not fly well with readers in how he ends these arcs, some of which feel unfinished (the dream issue and sniper issue sort of feel that way).So why am I giving this the coveted 5-star rating youâ€™re thinking, right?  I would give this comic a 4 star rating if this were done by a different artist maybe, but this book gets that 5-star rating from Declan Shalveyâ€™s art.  Not only because itâ€™s gorgeous art, but of just how important it is for the narrative Ellis weaves here.  This comic book pushes the art narrative style to extremes by challenging all traditional methods out there and it comes off beautifully.  Take for example, the sniper issue.  Every page has 8 panels with a separate character taking up just their own panel.  As the sniper is picking off his targets, the killed peopleâ€™s panels get blocked out in white and each page it has less and less panels.  Itâ€™s pretty brilliant ideas there.  Or the dream issue.  Most of the issue has any words at all, and yet we see a trippy and alien-like mushroom world that is a feast for the eyesâ€”and thatâ€™s not even describing the other 4 issues.  Itâ€™s utterly hard to describe the art because it plays such a heavy hand in Moon Knightâ€™s story telling and itâ€™s gorgeous.  And I have to mention industry legend colorist Jordie Bellaire does the art and it blends perfectly with Shalveyâ€™s art.  Seriously, the art pushes this book to the 5-star rank for me.  Itâ€™s that good and important.So MOON KNIGHT VOL.1: FROM THE DEAD is a gripping 6-issue collection of stand-alone stories that new and old readers should try out.  We get numerous perspectives of Moon Knight, brilliant artistry and colors, and some of the most daring and unconventional art narratives in current comics.  The issues might put some people off for their short done-in-one style, very little wording, art-heavy, and quick endings.  So itâ€™s a 4 Â½ star book, but again, Iâ€™m going with 5-stars.  This is phenomenal book that, sadly, Ellis and Shalvey are leaving after this volume.  Ellis is known for doing short comic book arcs and he does it here with Moon Knight.  Writer Brain Wood and artist Greg Smallwood take over.  So I am nervous for the new creative change, yet excited for this character (and Iâ€™ve heard the current issues by Wood/Smallwood have been just as great as Ellis/Shalveyâ€™s work.  Have to wait and see on that.)Either way, this is a great peak at the potential for Moon Knight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMS0ABKGHISJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785154086#wasThisHelpful","RMS0ABKGHISJH","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nightwing, under the penmanship of writer Kyle Higgins, has been a solid series since the very beginning of the New 52.  The writer has brought a new fan base in the New 52 having Dick Grayson own his own circus going around the country, finding out his family history, and losing personal friends from his confrontation with the Joker returning to Gotham.  But for the most part, Higgins has used most of the stories based around events of Scott Snyder's work being the Court of Owls and Death of the Family arcs, with the first volume really being his own work.  Now that the crossovers with Batman are over with, Higgins can tell his own story of Nightwing and this is a shining example of a Dick Grayson story done right.NIGHTWING VOL.4: SECOND CITY collects issues #19-24 and see's Dick Grayson head to Chicago on the surprising reveal that Tony Zucco is still alive, the very man responsible for murdering Dick Grayson's parents, who everyone thought was dead.  Now Grayson must snoop around Chicago looking for leads into Zucco's whereabouts, while also putting up with a crazy vigilantly named Prankster, who has the city in an uproar over his acts, AND someone is mysteriously killing costumed heroes around town.  Grayson has a lot on his palette in Chicago and it doesn't look like he'll be leaving anytime soon.The boldest thing about this tale is that this is the first time since starting the New 52; Nightwing is actually on his own.  He's in Chicago, not some fictional city.  There are no cross-over's/tie-ins with other comics, and no cameos from the Bat-family.  This is truly a Dick Grayson/Nightwing tale that I get the feeling Kyle Higgins was waiting for and/or wanted since the start of the series and it truly shines.  It reminds me a lot like Chuck Dixon's beautiful run on Nightwing as well that new readers might not understand, but older fans will.  If you want proof of that, Nightwing Vol. 1: Bludhaven comes out this year and I highly suggest.Grayson re-adjusts with new friends, new living styles, and new ways to dealing with the city, as well as his alter ego Nightwing does more detective work by getting leads from the streets, dealing with Prankster (a bad name and not affiliated with the Flashes rouge, Trickster) is a worthy nemesis to Nightwing using technology as his greatest tool, and having a strong plot device of finding the man who murdered his parents.  All these facets Higgins plays up for this book and it really is enjoyable.  With a major theme/twist Higgins gives when we find out Zucco has become and how it ends plays out really well.As for art duties, Teen Titans artist Brett Booth does issues #19-21 with Will Conrad doing issues #22-24.  Since Ed Burrows did the majority of the art on Nightwing since the beginning of the N52, it really set the tone of the series and I thought the change to Booth's more cartoony/wild style would not fit.  To my surprise, Booth's art brings a fresh sense of energy about it that gives the action a lot of style for Nightwing that I think he really needed, and gets away from the serious/doom-and-gloom style of Burrows art (I still love his art though).  Conrad's art tries to replicate Booth's style, which he does manage, though not quite up to that level.  It's still commendable.I'm trying to think of flaws that this collection might have suffered from, but I'm not really coming up with any.  Aside from Prankster's name (he's far from being a prankster), the art style change from Burrows previous work to Booth's is the only really change of tone that some people might not sit right.  And the mysterious costume killer we only get a sneak peak here won't get any answers until next volume.Yet overall, NIGHTWING VOL.4: SECOND CITY is probably the strongest volume yet from Higgins previous three volumes, which were pretty good already.  A strong story, fresh perspective, and kinetic art to match the action make for a fabulous story that I wish Higgins could further explore in the future, as well as close out the costume murderer story because... The problem is VOLUME 5 is the last book of the series as it gets cancelled and a new creative team of writer Tim Seeley and artist Mikel Janin re-start Dick Grayon ditching the superhero persona of Nightwing and becomes a super spy simply called GRAYSON.  Even if the entire series is getting re-hauled, Kyle HIggins work on NIGHTWING has been great from the start and has only gotten better.  It's still worth sticking around for the final volume, Nightwing Vol. 5: Setting Son (The New 52) and plays a pretty big role in Forever Evil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124PMQBKEPYZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401246303#wasThisHelpful","R124PMQBKEPYZ9","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1987, I was just a baby around that time.  Only things I knew the likes of were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animates series, Transformers generation 1 series, and Super Mario Brothers for Nintendo.  Now Rick Remender, the writer of Deadly Class and numerous series in comics like Black Science, Uncanny X-Force, Strange Girl, Captain America, and Uncanny Avengers; he was 14 or 15 in 1987 and in a afterword, he mentions most of the characters are based on real life incidents when he was a teenager.  I do not know if the main character is Rick, or a friend he knew, or maybe amalgamation of both.  Either way, Remender's latest work DEADLY CLASS is a fascinating coming of age story while dealing with the social anxieties we all share in the school system.DEADLY CLASS VOL.1: REAGAN YOUTH collects issues #1-6 and stars Marcus Lopez Arguello, a Nicaraguan 14-year old homeless kid residing in San Francisco and he has nothing to live for.  His parents are dead, his time in the boy's school sucked, and he has a dark past he wants forgotten. About to commit suicide, Marcus's world gets thrown upside down when he finds out some government people are after him and he gets saved by a group of young would-be assassin's around his age group.  Come to find out, the group is from King's Dominion High School for the Deadly Arts, a school of teaching youth the ways of the assassin and Marcus has been accepted.  Now Marcus has to deal with a school full of jocks, gangbangers, cool kids, and skinheads from the worlds top crime families as they hate him just like any school would for being an outsider.DEADLY CLASS is a difficult comic to categorize since it has numerous aspects about.  From Image, has it billed in the back of the book as ""crime/romance/shoegaze"", which I agree with most of that statement, but it's also an emotional and funny book as it deals with the pressures of fitting in with the school, the world, and societies expectations.  I guess the closet thing DEADLY CLASS reminds me of is John Hughes Breakfast Club with Hunter S. Thompsons Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (which Remender does hint at for both).  The book delves deep on Marcus's perspective that is equal parts mysterious and understandable.  We all felt like Marcus in school growing up in trying to make friends (or enemies like a Russian jock), fit in-and-out of cliques (like smoking out back during lunchtime), and reputations to uphold in front of each other, as well as just trying to have fun.  In this case, jumping roof tops, taking a drive to Las Vegas with drugs and alcohol and going on a massive LSD-laced trip throughout town.  Seriously, there is a lot going on in this opening volume from Remender that hits home for readers.As for art, Wes Craig does an amazing style to fit the time period.  It's clean, yet has bold lines similar to Frank Miller's work on Sin City.  This is further helped by the colorist Lee Loughride who makes each scene vividly flair up with color.  It's a dynamic art style that really fits the book.Now I although I am giving this a 5-star rating, I'm actually giving this a 4 ½ score because of the incredible amounts of story that Remender introduces, but we will not know until later volumes.  What's the real point of the school?  Why is everyone in the school afraid of Marcus?  What is Marcus's dark past and vendetta against Ronald Reagan?  What's expected for our main cast if they are to be assassin's?  What the hell is up with Marcus's innervoice? Is he really a psychopath or is that just his inner conscious?  Who the hell are the government guys who chased down Marcus in issue 1?  Those are just some lingering questions I told myself that other readers might have as well.  But this opening volume isn't about those questions (yet), it's about establishing our character and his world.So DEADLY CLASS VOL.1 is another Image series that readers should try out considering its only $10.  Besides the many questions Remender left open, this is another series that I truly enjoyed and will continue to read and review in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNZVP68L86RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632150034#wasThisHelpful","R2VNZVP68L86RF","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to comic book events, they are meant to be a big transfusion of action, status quo changes, and most of the characters of the universe under one banner, hence the term event.  It being the year 2014 of this review, there has been numerous Marvel events.  Civil War, Age of Ultron, Secret Invasion, Atlantis Attacks, and many others, most of which have lost all sense of awe and scale because it's too common, things never really change, it never fells epic (a loose term thanks to its high usage), and...it sells more comics.  But during the earlier days of Marvel, events were uncommon.  The first real Marvel event was Secret Wars in 1984.  It was the first real time seeing just about all the Marvel universe in one story and it was/is a great story to see unfold.  The Marvel followed up with Secret Wars II (not quite as good), and some other events which were more grounded near Earth.  Then, around the beginning of the 1990s, there comes the story of the Infinity Gauntlet, which quite possibly might be the best Marvel event and battle in the company's history.  I know that's a bold statement for me to say, but I've read my share of Marvel battles, and this one takes the cake, and for the first time ever, has finally received a proper omnibus for it.But what led to such a decision?  Ever since the 2012 Avengers film where the very last scene audiences got to see was Thanos evil grin at the viewers, everyone and their mother too have been wanting to know more about the mad titan and probably his greatest story contribution to Marvel comics.  With Guardians of the Galaxy opening up to movie theaters next month in August, Marvel has been pumping out numerous cosmic stories for readers to get excited for, especially since many people feel Thanos might have an important presence in the film (it being a space/cosmic film and all that).  And thank the heavens, because this is not only a great story, but a great omnibus.THE INFINITY GAUNTLET OMNIBUS collects the following issues in order:Silver Surfer #34-#38, #40Thanos Quest #1 and #2Silver Surfer #44-#50Infinity Gauntlet #1-#6Cloak and Dagger #18Spider-Man #17Incredible Hulk #383Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #31Silver Surfer #51Quasar #26 and #27Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #32Silver Surfer #52-#54Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #33Silver Surfer #55-#58Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #34Incredible Hulk #384Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #35Silver Surfer #59Sleepwalker #7Incredible Hulk #385Silver Surfer #60Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #36[If you want a more in-depth review of the Infinity Gauntlet event specifically, please read Infinity Gauntlet and Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos.]Thanos, the mad titan is dead.  He was a being who threatened to destroy the entire universe for his love, Death, but failed in the past.  It appears Death needs Thanos once again, as Thanos is resurrected and needs to extinguish half the living beings in the universe as life is over populating and needs dwindled down for life to continue.  Thanos see's this as ample opportunity to serve his love well, but he has an agenda to do so and do so in such a way that has never been done before: he plans on collecting the six soul/infinity gems.  Each gem grants its bearer with complete mastery over one aspect of the multiverse: Time, Space, Mind, Soul, Reality, and Power.  With all gems together, he has the Infinity Gauntlet, which makes him the most omnipotent being in existence.  Who will stand up to the might of Thanos?  Is there even a chance to win?  It will take every being in existence to fight the god of all creation.Jim Starlin's story is the epitome of epic, in terms of scope, threat level, and pure destruction.  This is thanks to conveying the very threat of a villain and situation itself.  Thanos demonstrates genocide-level violence, world-shattering disasters by cutting away to numerous characters across the Marvel universe, and upping the scope of the participants by eliminating numerous superheroes in a blink like the Fantastic Four, New Warriors, and various Avengers.  And this all happens with Thanos simple snapping his fingers together.Wow.That alone sends shivers up the reader's spine that this is the real deal.  And when all remaining beings in the universe come together to fight Thanos, it feels big.  The battles between Thanos and the remaining forces are great not only for the scale, but the amount of how much Starlin keeps to their characters thanks in part by the pencils of George Perez and Ron Lim.  Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Hulk retain their characters to the bitter end, especially Captain America going up to Thanos and saying one of the best lines from his mouth I've ever heard.  And when celestial beings show up and fight Thanos throwing planets at him (yes, planets!), you know you have something big.  It's a hell of en event that even 23 years later holds up just fine.Now everything I've mentioned in the plot summary is part of the lead up and main event itself, which readers can pick up right on in trade form with Infinity Gauntlet and the prelude Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos.  It's the prime aspect of in terms of story of Thanos and the infinity gauntlet, which if that's what you want only, go for it.  You really do not need the various tie-in issues to enjoy the IG story.Now for this omnibus edition, it really is aimed for completionist, collectors, omnib-fans, and just hardcore lovers of the IG story.  The addition of the many tie-ins and aftermath issues are big deals because A) Many have never been collected in trade paperback before, B) it gives readers the grand feel of the event, and C) it's the Infinity Gauntlet in omnibus form.  This omnibus is for the hardcore fans who want all the story and not just the prelude/main event you can buy separately and cheaper.  I could go in much further depth regarding these stories, but again, they are primarily as tie-ins so there isn't too much to explain.Most of the tie-ins take place during the IG event are borderline supplemental and not entirely needed for the main story, but are still good ranging from the writings of a young Ron Marz, Terry Kavanagh, Peter David, Ann Nocenti, Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas, Mark Gruenwald, and Bob Budiansky.  With a host of artist including David Ross, Rick Leonardi, Dale Keown, Tony Dezuniga, Dave Hoover, Greg Capullo (yes, the same artist on Scott Snyder's Batman!), Chris Marrinan, Gavin Curtis, James Brock, Todd Smith, Dan Lawlis, Tom Raney, and Bret Blevins.As for the Omnibus itself, it's lovely.  The dust jacket is the typical infinity gauntlet cover seen on the trade paperback, the spine the IG logo with all 6 gems and Thanos at the bottom, and the back has every cover listed.  Under the dust jacket, the exact front cover except the font and logos are gone with just the picture.  And the back of the hardboard is a incredible head-shot of Thanos and his infinity gauntlet drawn by George Perez.  The book itself is oversized like most Marvel omnibi, with the paper being high-grade stock with little reflection.  The book is sewn binding with no gutter loss and lays flat with no problems (again, Marvel omnibi collections do it right).  The book comes with a complete table of contents with writer/artist and page numbers to find them.As for extras in the back, there are 26-pages worth if I am counting right.  The extras include a 2-page Year in Review parody article, Silver Surfer 1st print paperback cover, Infinity Gauntlet trade paperback covers 1st and 2nd printings, Thanos Quest 2nd cover, the Marvel Age magazine including cover, 2 page discussion/interview about the upcoming IG event, Fred Hembeck's 4-page comic strip making fun of Thanos, 2 more pages advertising the IG, early cover shots of IG #2 and #3, the Marvel universe trading cards series II and II, 2010 Avengers & Infinity Gauntlet miniseries for younger readers, and some art pages from the numerous artist.  So there is quite a bit in terms of extras.Since this is a classic of Marvel events, I really did not have any faults in this omnibus.  Sure some people might complain about very select issues that are not included like Quasar #24, Sleepwalker #6, and Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1.  But I think what is collected here is fine.  And I will say this, if you are strapped for cash and only want the main event, just pick up the soft cover edition and the prelude story into it, Silver Surfer: Thanos Reborn.  This omnibus just collects the numerous tie-ins and aftermath issues that are not necessary unless you're a hardcore fan.So finally, THE INFINITY GAUNTLET OMNIBUS is, for the most part, everything I think a fan wants from one of the best Marvel events ever produced.  If you want just the main story, save your money and go for the softcover.  But if you want most of the complete experience like never before, buy this omnibus right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LNECVZXJNLW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078515468X#wasThisHelpful","R3LNECVZXJNLW7","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After last volume, Green Lantern Corp writer Peter Tomasi, left the series after doing it for about 7 years straight, while Geoff Johns spend 9 years doing the main title of Hal Jordan, Green Lantern.  As with the other GL titles, New Guardians and Red Lanterns, all series writers/artist left after issue #20.  Mostly indie writers took up the reigns of the four GL-based series.  Charles Soule got Red Lanterns starring Guy Gardner, Justin Jordan got New Guardians starring Kyle Rayner, Robert Venditti got Green Lantern with Hal Jordan, and the most newest writer Van Jensen got GL Corp with Venditti as co-plotter, with John Stewart as lead character.  And guess what?  The series returns to the basis of illuminate the various Corp members and even give a little more insight on John Stewart.GREEN LANTERN CORP VOL.4: REBUILD collects issues #21-27 and GREEN LANTERN ANNUAL #2.  After the events of the First Lantern, John Stewart is continuing his daily activities as keeping peace throughout the universe as a GL with his love interest and partner Star Sapphire, Fatality AKA Yrra.  The GL Corp is in shambles from the First Lantern attack, and Hal Jordan has reluctantly taken the job of leader of the entire GL Corp.  So the job of John Stewart is to find fresh new recruits to refill the ranks under his training.  The thing about these new recruits is they need a lot of work in these tough times, and it doesnâ€™t help when Relic, an omnipotent being attacks an already weakened GL Corp.  Things are not looking so good for John and the Corp.The first aspect is writer Van Jensen continues the old ways (way before the New 52) of Peter Tomasiâ€™s tenure of GLC by making the series a reasonably stand-alone set of adventures, but having ties to the main GL title, thanks in part with co-plotter Robert Venditti who is the new main series GL writer for Hal Jordan.  So itâ€™s an overall good series on its own, while being complimentary to the main GL title.  Even the Lights Out crossover event with issues #24 and Batman: Zero Year tie-in for issue #25 really do not effect this series too badly.  Itâ€™s a difficult aspect to do for any series like GLC in keeping its identity and tagging along with another series, but Jensen/Venditti does a commendable job.  Hopefully this will last much like Tomasi/Johns work on the first years together on GL.Second, itâ€™s a starring title for John Stewart, who has gotten the shaft the past couple of years in the GL comics with little to do other than being a background character, especially Tomasi neglecting him in the New 52 in favor of Guy Gardner (I like Guy!).  So those fans who finally get to see John has his own starring title will be happy.  I for one will admit John is my personal weakest earth GL (I like all the earth GLs though, mind you).  Heâ€™s honorable and a highly dependable character, but for me, he doesnâ€™t give off any sense of human personality (I guess the marine background) and heâ€™s always in tough guy mode.  Jensen and Venditti manage to slowly humanize John by adding a complicated relationship with Yrra and his role as teacher/instructor to his young recruits show John does have some human life, but also a sellable main characters as well.  With Yrra having some solo time to sort out another plot looming in the background to make a pretty busy book.And third, this is a big for me, is the aspect of highlighting about the various GLC members.  The creation of the GLC series since the 1980s was to show the wide range of members away from the main series, and although itâ€™s never been a money maker for DC, itâ€™s always been an interesting look at the numerous members.  Tomasi started lessening the roaster over time to the beginning of the New 52, where it was about Guy and John (but mostly Guy).  Various characters on the cover to GLC new52 issue #1 like Soranik Natu and Arisia who were heavy hitters pre-52 in the GLC were not present, now make proper returns and feel very welcoming of older readers, and yes, even new readers will like them.  As for the new recruits John receives, I feel are some of the more enjoyable aspects I liked about this new creative team.  We have a young battle loving alien, a mother/wife figure who seeâ€™s being a lantern as protecting her family, a mute and pacifistic short guy, and a vagabond to make a pretty odd-ball team that is similar to the dirty dozen.  Itâ€™s a solid team book about and not just a solo title.For art duties, Bernard Chang does every issues except the GL annual and issue #25.  His art is clean, detailed, and conveys a good sense of action and classic GL fantasy in his ring construct designs.  Heâ€™s a solid artist, though he does slouch off around issue #27 a little bit.  Still solid art, with Victor Drujiniu and Ivan Fernandez doing the Batman Zero Year tie-in issue #25 reasonably well.In terms of faults, the Lights Out cross over hampers the story a tad, but not too bad.  And the Zero Year tie-in, as good as it is to convey a decent origin story for John, feels a little out of place.  But seeing as GLCâ€™s issue #0 was about Guy Gardner, itâ€™s fair John got his own proper story.  And the other thing is the inclusion of many pre-52 GL characters.  As much as many older fans will praise their older pre-52 characters are back (Iâ€™m one of them), new readers will be as enthusiastic about them.  And lastly, GLC is little rough in terms of new readers because of the previous storyline of the First Lantern carrying over.GREEN LANTERN CORP VOL.4: REBUILD really does live up to its title as Jensen and Venditti begin re-building the Corp by including the mass array of GL members, giving John his lead title with pleasing results, and great art.  Some stumbles from the Lights Out crossover and rough jumping on point are flaws, but small.  GL Corp is a engaging title for those who want to read about John, the Corp, or both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ORMYOGQBY5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401247458#wasThisHelpful","R10ORMYOGQBY5K","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collecting the 6-part mini-series by writer Justin Jordan (The Strange Talent/Legend of Luthor Strode, Shadowman, Green Lantern: New Guardians) and artist Matteo Scalera (Black Science) is an ode to the action crime revenge story.  After a bank robbery, one of the people involved with the heist take the money for themselves and hides the money away because his crew will kill him to cut him out of his share.  The local police inform Orson Gage, an ex-policeman who worked on the same task force, finds out his wife was killed during the heist trying to protect the bank.  Gage has nothing left in life to live for and will get his revenge on his wifeâ€™s murderer one way or another.Itâ€™s a simple revenge setup story but plays out much like the action films Mad Max and Bullitt, with helpings of crime and suspense thriller in the vein of Elmore Leonard (by Jordanâ€™s admission).  Itâ€™s not a deep narrative in terms of motivations and actions other than the focus of the money, but it still is a pretty action-packed story where every character is looking out for each to take the money for themselves.  We have the bad guys who just want the money and will kill anyone who gets in their way and Gage who just wants revenge, with numerous other characters who flip-flop sides in order to survive and take the money as well.  So it is an interesting course of actions as everyone is killing each other for the money.The art done by Matteo Scalera fits the revenge/crime narrative in his sketchy designs with characters shooting each other up to having road fury of cars fighting it out on the desert road.  Itâ€™s a great looking book and fits the mature-rated atmosphere.Because this is a mini-series, the book lacks some depth and real motivation in parts.  A character named Fletcher Cobb gets in on the robbery and wants the money like everyone else, but there is zero explanation of how he came to know about it or involved in the first place.  And Gageâ€™s motivation is lacking, I think.  He explains why heâ€™s doing this for through backstory, but I felt his motivation just wasnâ€™t strong enough to warrant his goal.  He only wants revenge and not the money, so you would think Justin Jordan would nail readers more deeply on Gageâ€™s reasons on fighting blindly on his wife with more than a just because-sort of whim.  Just some more motivation and feeling for Gage would have helped.  And I think the addition of writers notes would of been a great little extra, seeing as Justin Jordan making comments on each issue in the series if you bought and read the single issues.  Image did not bother to include those in this trade for some reason and I think they added some extra flare in terms of commentary for the series.  A little bit of a bummer there.Overall though, DEAD BODY ROAD is still a fun action heavy, revenge/crime story that is good to read in one single setting for an hour or two.  It lacks a plot hole or two and a deeper connection to Gage wanting revenge, but I still enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4UQAO3MNJJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632150476#wasThisHelpful","R2B4UQAO3MNJJI","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frank Miller is one of the highest names in the comic world for his highly influential work for the medium including The Dark Knight Returns, Daredevil, 300, Ronin, and the esteemed work this very review is discussing, Sin City.  Sin City is an ode to the classic film noir-mystery crime drama with elements of pulp and bold comic sequences spread throughout to make a strong book in terms of story telling and minimalist art that is a beautiful combination.  The series ran off and on from 1991 through 2000 with various trades over the years, and even made into a full-scale film in 2005.It being the year 2014, with the release of a new Sin City movie coming out next month (based on the second book, A Dame to Kill For), Dark Horse has not only re-printed A Dame to Kill For in a new hardcover (Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For) with some bonus material, but they did something that has not been done before until now: make an omnibus of Sin City.  Although it is not labeled as an omnibus, it pretty much is to a fault.  This being Frank Miller's magnum opus to the comic world under one large hardcover, this is a must have for content and price tag alone.BIG DAMN SIN CITY collects the entire series.The Hard Goodbye (Sin City) Episodes #1-13 of 13 from Dark Horse 5th Anniversary Special and Dark Horse Presents issues #51-62Sin City Volume 2: A Dame to Kill For (3rd Edition) Issues #1-6Sin City Volume 3: The Big Fat Kill (3rd Edition) Issues #1-5Sin City Volume 4: That Yellow Bastard (3rd Edition)Issues #1-6Sin City Volume 5: Family Values (3rd Edition) 128-page original graphic novelSin City Volume 6: Booze, Broads, & Bullets (3rd Edition) A number of one-shotsSin City Volume 7: Hell and Back (3rd Edition) Issues #1-9[Since review this omnibus would be far too long and detailed, I will simply summarize this series.  If you would like to know more detail regarding each of the stories, please click on the links above for more information.]Taking place in the fictional Basin City, where corruption is the rule and life is a miserable thing. It's a gritty, dark, ugly, and very edgy series with mostly stand alone tales with several interwoven connections to other stories.  The stories include a revenge tale about a hulk named Marv, a photographer named Dwight falling for an ex-flame to possibly kill her husband, an ailing cop Hartigan trying to protect a young girl from a rapist/sadist/murderer, Dwight looking into a mob murder and protect a piece of the city of prostitutes from attack, to small vignette stories, and finally an old war vet named Wallace having a drink with a woman that leads to a kidnapping.I could go into far more detail on each story, but I would be writing a thesis paper if I did and spoil some surprises that go with it.  As I mentioned before, Sin City is a film noir crime drama that fans of the genre will love.  For a good example, if you have seen the 2005 film, that's what the book is in a nutshell.  It's a stark, bitter, and depressing noir story with lots of killing, blood, sex, language, and revenge in a way to the old-school genre of film making.  It is a bleak series from beginning to end, but its oh-so well done you cannot help but love it and read on.The other aspect that makes Sin City a must read, or must look at, is the art style which Frank Miller also drew himself.  The artwork is visually portrayed as stark black and white, with a high usage of minimalist design with lots of nudity and blood.  There are hues of color for special effect and importance, but again, very minimal.  It's probably one of, if the last pieces of Frank Miller's artwork on full display before he started losing his drawing style.  If there is any highlight to want about this series, it's the artwork.Since there are numerous reviews on the Sin City series, it's nothing new for me to describe it to you, but the big feature is what makes this 2014 hardcover tick.  Again, it includes all of the Sin City series under one hardcover, the dimensions of the book are a whopping 12 Â½ inches wide with 8 Â½ length, with 3.6 inches thick and around 8 bounds or so, making this big-guy bigger and wider than most omnibus out on the market.  No dust jacket but solid board wrapped around.  It looks and feels a tad thicker than most omnibus boards as well, though it could just be me seeing things.  The binding is sewn with high-grade/low reflective paper which is amazing considering 1300+ pages.  The book folds out flat with almost no gutter loss from what I saw.  You might get some slight cracking near the ends the first time opening the book, but for the most part, the books lays flat with no problems and feels sturdy.  A bright red ribbon takes up the middle of the book as a bookmark.  As for additional content, there is none sadly.  We only get a page with all the softcovers and a biography of Frank Miller and that's it.  I know plenty of people love extras in their omnibus collections, but considering 1300+ pages in high grade paper stock, the lack of extras is pretty insignificant as a whole.This is the part where I point out the flaws or setbacks in my review, but considering how much content there is for the price, I feel there barely any flaws.  This is a book for mature readers and because of it's weight/thickness, it will be uncomfortable to read on your lap.So BIG DAMN SIN CITY is probably Frank Miller's grandest achievement in the comic world in terms of scale, writing and drawing himself, and still making a compelling read/sight for the eyes to readers.  This is a wonderful package and the amount your paying at $100 price tag that would be $125-$150 from DC and Marvel is a steal, even more so with Amazon discount at $60 is worth owning.  If you're a Frank Miller fan or fan of the film or crim/noir, pick this beauty up now.  This book really does sum up the statement on the cover, ""Hot damn!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PFYDU7UUPEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616552379#wasThisHelpful","R2PFYDU7UUPEQ","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are reading this, you must be a fan (or hated it) of Tom Taylor's volume 1 of Injustice: God Among Us.  A quick refresher of what that is: Injustice is a fighting game based off of DC Universe characters, plain and simple.  As with any media tie-in, a comic series was written to accompany the story of the game.  Most of the times these aspects fail or are simply fluff to sell the game/movie/television show.  But the comic book has turned out surprisingly well done tale of numerous superheroes that have taken sides with either Superman, who has become a bit crazy and wants to police the world from harming itself; or Batman, who wishes to stand against Superman's new goal and continue to uphold the traditional values of superheroes.  It's very much been done similar to Kingdom Come, but this series has proven enough that some of the same aspects still work.  And volume 2 holds up pretty well.INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US VOL.2 collects issues #7-12 and Injustice Annual #1.  After the events of volume 1, a beacon is sent out from the wreckage of Metropolis, a lone survivor named Lex Luthor.  Lex has been Superman's friend his entire life and wants to help Superman in his cause.  You see even with an incredibly powerful team of super beings, Superman's group cannot police the world with their little numbers, so Lex has an idea to create a pill that gives people super powers who will help in their cause.  But Batman being the tactical genius that he is, has plans on taking away the super-power pill and using for his team to counter-Superman's agenda.  What stakes will it mean for the planet?  What will both Superman and Batman do to make their plans come to fruition?As with volume 1, volume 2 of Injustice is a dark ""what if?"" comic that has nothing to do with DC continuity and stays somewhat in the same effect of the game's main plot.  This makes Injustice a gritty comic that makes most fanboys dreams come true of a story of Batman vs. Superman that they would never get away with in a regular DC series.  It's a still a good helping of light banter humor between characters (Harley and Green Arrow STILL arguing over the name of the Arrow cave) but with off-kilter aspects of character that are parts of their old pre-52 selves and this new Injustice universe.After volume 1 which spent most of the time setting up the general plot, volume 2 delves more deeply on both Superman and Batman's fractions duking it out trying to one up each other.  It's a fun and interesting how each one finds ways to how Superman can hurt Batman though various acts, and vice-a-versa with Batman to Superman that I cannot explain or else it would spoil the book.  Some big moments that have you either rooting for the characters or thinking their actions are ""hitting below the belt"".  It's quite enjoyable to see.And the other aspect is the continuing debate among characters that their actions mean for either Superman or Batman's sides of moral ethics might not be the best ones.  One of the biggest faults I have with in-continuity Batman is every writer always makes Batman right, because...he's Batman.  It's a bias answer toward the rest of the DCU when the debate comes up.  With Injustice, every character on each side questions their leader's actions and the other sides as well, making for a fairly great examination that both Superman and Batman are right, but very wrong.  Some examples include a chess match between Superman and Flash over policing the world means a totalitarianism-like planet gives not free choice; or, without giving things away, a scene that involves Superman doing something he would never do in-continuity to save the earth.  The act saves everyone including Batman and his team from destruction.  Batman's team is grateful for Superman doing what he did for them and the planet and Batman arrogantly does not acknowledge Superman's actions.  Even with possible defeat, even death, Batman see's Superman as wrong.  Stuff like this is a treasure to read about because it keeps readers open-minded and on the fence about both characters actions we probably would never get from the regular DCU.And the last aspect that makes Injustice work is the fine line of never knowing what might happen next, that being no one character is safe.  Volume 1 had two big time characters bite the big one and who are playable in the Injustice game.  It goes to show any character within this series could die at any minute which does up the stakes for this series.  And yes, two characters do die in this volume.  You just have to see how and how they go.As for art duties, the art is mostly handled by Mike S. Miller, Tom Derenick, and Bruno Redondo.  These three artist share most of the art duties and it's passable to good most of the time.  Additional artist to fill-in include Kevin Maguire, Neil Googe, Jheremy Raapack, Xermanico, and Jonas Trindade.I personally love what Taylor is doing for this book and give it a 4 Â½ star review, but I'm rounding score to 4 stars.  Beyond the ever-changing art with does muddle some parts here and there, this series is not for everyone.  It's dark to the point that some readers will despise it because it's so different.  Seeing how far Superman and Batman go from their standard DC selves, pre/post New52, is shocking.  I love it for that reason really, but some might hate it.  Then again, if you read volume 1 and enjoyed it, volume 2 will be a pleasure to read; and if you hated volume 1, then volume 2 will not change your mind.Now a full year into the INJUSTICE storyline for the game, and VOLUME 2 delivers everything you want from a Batman vs. Superman rivalry in a alternate universe you will not find in DC continuity.  It may not be original, but Tom Taylor is still hitting all the right beats to the point that the success of the series will mean a Year Two of INJUSTICE Injustice: Gods Among Us Year 2 Vol. 1 that looks exciting (especially the way volume 2 ends on...).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNA6B4TCUPNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140124601X#wasThisHelpful","R3KNA6B4TCUPNV","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank you sir Ian Fleming for sparking the pop culture with the creation of 007, James Bond, and the many film adaptations that followed behind it.  Because of it, the spy genre has always been a thrilling exposition to see unfold with the cloak and dagger vibe with a sense of grittiness and crime-noir to it.  If there is one comic book writer who knows the genre all-too well, itâ€™s gotta be Ed Brubaker.  His work on Incognito, Sleeper, Gotham Central, and Fatale are just some of his work on the crime/noir, with his 8-year run on Captain America dwelling on the spy genre being a must read material.  Now Brubaker returns to the spy genre in the spirit of James Bond era with his co-conspirator artist, Steve Epting, who did a great deal of Captain America together in this trilling book that may not be original by any means, but it still works exceptionally.Collecting issues #1-5, VELVET takes place in 1973 London, England.  Velvet Templeton works as a secretary for the director of a British spy agency named Arc-7 (a fictional MI6).  Arc-7 uses the best secret agents in the field called X-Operatives, which news just came out that the best agent X-14 has just died out in the field.  Looking into the investigation, itâ€™s clear X-14 was setup and now Arc-7 feel there is a mole in the agency.  Just as Velvet is getting even slightly closer to what is really going on, she gets framed for murder and displays knowledge and skills far beyond her status as a secretary.  Now on the run from the authorities and her own agency, Velvet must travel across the globe to clear her name, find out who setup X-14, and who is the mole in Arc-7.Brubaker takes the concept of a what if scenario of Miss Moneypenny were a secret spy and makes a thrilling spy book equal parts drama with spies (duh!), double crosses, double agents, and collateral damage during the Cold War days.  A good deal of the narrative is Velvet traveling around the same leads of X-14â€™s last mission, while having flashbacks to important events in her life, and to see whatâ€™s going on back at Arc-7 headquarters as they trail Velvet.  There isnâ€™t much I can say outside of that description that really needs to be said because I would be spoiling a lot of juicy plot points.  Itâ€™s one book where you want to follow Velvet and what she uncovers and sees whoâ€™s telling truths and who arenâ€™t.  This may not be an original series, but Brubaker still hits all the right buttons for an enjoyable espionage book.And what better way to sell VELVET on the writing then the art by Steve Epting.  Both gentlemen worked together on Captain America and the duo are work exceptionally well, and even over years they still got it.  Eptingâ€™s art is a mixture of photorealistic, grittiness about it that fits the atmosphere to a fault.  Every physical emotion is portrayed well under Eptingâ€™s art work including a stunning number of times including a chase sequence in the rain, Velvet perpetrating a damp prison, to a gorgeous Carnival of Fools.  Eptingâ€™s art has only gotten better and better.This is the part I usually give out some possible flaws, but Iâ€™m at a loss of words.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Maybe you might not enjoy as much as I have considered numerous action films that are spy-action flicks are similar to Velvet.  But no point in bringing down VELVET because of films doing them.Image has another winner with VELVET VOL.1 under Brubaker and Epting.  The book isnâ€™t reinventing the wheel on the spy genre, only being an ode to it.  Itâ€™s everything old-school spy enthusiast will really enjoy.  A solid written story, luscious art, and all for the great introductory price of $10.  You canâ€™t go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REL5FMQ57OZWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607069644#wasThisHelpful","REL5FMQ57OZWK","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to the black-and-white vigilantly of Frank Castle, AKA The Punisher, writer Garth Ennis set the bar to the brim for the character.  It's so herald as the peak Punisher run that many feel like there is no more reason for any writer to continue the character of Castle because it was that good.  That tells you something.  But like any comic character, they will carry for years to come because, you know, comics.  And in 2010, Marvel decided to give writer Jason Aaron his own series of Punisher under the Marvel MAX imprint meaning creators have the freedom to write more realistic and mature stories that cannot be seen in regular mainline Marvel Universe and be self-contained stories that do not affect continuity.  After Ennis work, what's the point right?  But guess what?  This is phenomenal.  And it's everybit worthy of Ennis work and the Punisher legacy.Collecting all 22 issues of PUNISHER MAX OMNIBUS by Jason Aaron and Steve Dillon, as well as never before collected one-shot story Punisher MAX X-Mas Special #1.  The following issues are collected as:PunisherMax: Kingpin (issues #1-5)PunisherMAX Vol. 2: Bullseye (issues #6-11)PunisherMax: Frank (issues #12-16)Punishermax: Homeless (issues #17-22)[For more detailed review on each book, please click on the links above.  I'll only summarize this omnibus since it would take too long to review every nook and cranny of this book.]For 30 years, the Punisher has brutalized the crime world and the New York mob has had enough.  All five major crime families join together to create an imaginary figure head of the New York mob to draw out Castle.  That figurehead is Wilson Fisk, a low enforcer who plays the role of Kingpin.  While Castle is trying to figure out what is going on, Fisk is slowly rising to the top of the underworld and he's starting to like it - a lot.  Next thing you know, Fisk wipes out all opposition and actually becomes the ruler of New York.  Now seen as the #1 powerhouse, Frank Castle continues his one-man war against the Kingpin that means fighting his way through the likes of Bullseye, the New York police, escaping an entire prison system, and finally dealing with Fisk personally that Castle will fall harder and lower than he has ever before.As stated before, this 22-issue series is self-contained from previous Punisher stories and from the rest of the Marvel Universe, so no prior knowledge is needed.  It's an original story and the likes of many characters (who I admit will die without spoiling who they are) does not affect continuity.  But it definitely helps if you've already read Garth Ennis work on the Punisher since Aaron continues many themes and traits from Ennis work.Jason Aaron is a pretty well established writer in comics the past few years on numerous works like Wolverine, Thor: God of Thunder, Scalped (I highly recommend you check that one out), and Ghost Rider on his rÃ©sumÃ© to show the man can write dark and gritty perfectly.  Each of the 4 parts of the run focus on the main themes they talk about.  ""Kingpin"" showing the origins and rise of Wilson Fisk into the ruler of the mob, ""Bullseye"" detailing a cat-and-mouse game of Punisher and the incredibly psychopathic Bullseye, ""Frank"" giving readers a in-depth look at Castle's psychology of the past when and how he became the Punisher, and ""Homeless"" with Castle going after Fisk in a fitting ending worthy of the character.  This is some masterful level storytelling that I can explain in great depth about it, but it wouldn't do it any justice.  Just read the review links and you'll see what I mean.The writing up to the same caliber, at least almost close to Garth Ennis though, is something else.  I know this 22-issue series is self-contained enough, but it really carries on Ennis framework down to a T.  Punisher is still a man in his 50s/60 years of age, the super-high language (there's the F-word every page), over the top violence, dark humor, explicit imagery of sick and twist body parts, and emotional depth to a character most writers fail to do that Aaron accomplishes perfectly and adds on to Ennis work is brilliant.  Although Ennis work with Punisher deal squarely on the mob, Aaron uses the Marvel villains Wilson Fisk and Bullseye (and a few surprise others I will not mention) to make this a bit more ""comic bookie"".  Other than that aspect, everything else fits well under Ennis framework.As for art, all 22 issues are handled expertly by Steve Dillon, the same artist that has done numerous work with Garth Ennis before, including his Punisher work.  Because of this, Dillons art work conveys Ennis work through Aaron's writing, which completes the feeling that this is the work of Ennis.  I think Dillon's Punisher work is the epitome of the character for hitting all the right aspects of the character.  The crazy violence, the facial reactions, the X-rated scenes of mutilation to naked bodies.  This is some hardcore mature material and Dillon showcases is perfectly.And lastly, the one-shot Punisher MAX X-Mas Special #1.  Taking place on Christmas night, Castle is doing what he usually does (even if it's a holy night) and about to kill a mob family, the wife is in labor of her baby.  Castle spends the night trying to protect the couple from a rival mob family and well...I've said too much.  You gotta read it to see what happens and it plays out wonderfully and to the character.  If there's ever a reason to pick up this omnibus, it's for this inclusion.Now why the 4 stars for a 5 star story/art?  The price.  It's the one thing that hurts this collection (and the extras which I'll get to in a bit).  I don't know who came up with the over-exaggerated price tag at Marvel, but this is too much.  A little over 500+ pages for a $100?  Really?  Usually the $100 price tag for omnibi get over 900+ pages (as with the other great Jason Aaron book, Wolverine & the X-Men by Jason Aaron Omnibus).  Anything around 700+ pages is a $75 book.  But 500+ pages is usually $50 -$75.  Even DC/Vertigo/Image/Dark Horse are putting out hardcovers around 500+ page books at $50.  Heck, some of Marvel's oversized collections like Daredevil by Mark Waid, Vol. 1 and Superior Spider-Man, Vol. 1 (Marvel Now) are around 300 - 400 pages at $35-$40.  At the very highest, this collection could be $75.  I can see that because it's that good and I might give this a 5-star rating if it were that way.  I received my copy for $55 on release so I don't mind that, but try to get this book on sale if you can.  You can actually buy all 4 separate books in soft and hardcover at a reason price online instead of the omnibus price.  They do not have the Punisher MAX X-Mas Special #1 in those collections, but it's a small price to pay if you wish to save some money.The other aspect that hurts is the lack of extras.  Most omnibus come packed with extra goodies, but this sorely lacking.  It only has 1 variant cover and the script to ""Homeless"" #5.  That's it.  As if the high cover price wasn't enough, Marvel could have at least thrown in a ton of bonus content to ease in the deal.  But nothing.  A bummer there.As for the book itself, it's a true Marvel omnibus.  Oversized hardcover, sewn binding, no gutter loss, and just a solid book.  The dust jacket is the same as the Amazon picture, but the cover uses issue #21 as the cover with a little Punisher in black on the back.Overall, PUNISHER MAX OMNIBUS is every bit worthy of concluding the work Garth Ennis did on the character that every fan should read about.  It's a 5-star story and art in everyway.  But the high cover price and severe lack of extras hurt this collection, which is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating.  If you can get this at a cheaper price, go for it.  If you own all 4 trades, you really do not need to trade them in for this omnibus.  As with most Marvel omnibi collections, if the publisher produced a high quantity of copies, it might get reduced in price in the future.  But if has a low quantity, then this book might go out of print and the price will skyrocket.  Either way, the choice is yours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQEDL8AMHOM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785154299#wasThisHelpful","R3LQEDL8AMHOM3","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After 18 issues and 1 Annual, Scott Snyder's tenure on Swamp Thing is over with.  I thought Snyder's handling of the first arc was brilliant, but felt it lost something after that once it became all about Rotworld.  Snyder's whole run was good, but I don't think it was the bees-knees of Swamp Thing runs.  Regardless, Snyder has become a top name in the comics' world due to his current work on Batman and anyone who follows behind him in any work, is bound to have preconceived notions.  For Swamp Thing, that writer is Charles Soule, an indie writer I had no knowledge of before becoming the new writer.  And after reading his work on Swampy, I am now officially a fan of his.SWAMP THING VOL.4: SEEDER collects issues #19-23 and #23.1 (Amazon has the soliciting wrong.)  After the events of Rotworld, Alec Holland/Swamp Thing is getting back to doing what he does: being the avatar for the Green and going around the world doing the bidding of his masters, The Parliament of Trees.  After going to Metropolis and running into certain Batman-villain and a certain local hero, Swampy has been getting weird vibes from the Green throughout the world.  A being going around named Seeder has been plopping up in areas that have been interfering with the nature of humans and the Green, including a tree in Scotland that produces whisky and makes anyone a crazed maniac who drinks it.Charles Soule makes a clear and direct opening for old and new readers by catching up on Snyder's entire run within a few pages and gets to the heart of Swampy in no time, so this is a jumping on point for people who want to try out Swamp Thing.  Whereas Snyder focused on traditional horror and the Alec Holland/Abigail Arcane love angle, Soule conjures up an amalgamation of wit, occult/sci-fi, and horror that Alan Moore did in the 80's.  So for Soule's first volume on Swamp Thing, there really isn't a story arc just yet, just short stories essentially of Swamp Thing doing numerous errands for the Green as to allow readers Soule's writing style and eventual buildup for the new villain, Seeder.  Two issues are for Swampy's visit to Metropolis and three issues are dedicated to the Whiskey Tree arc.  This is a welcomed approach since coming off of the Rotworld event and gets you psyched up for the next volume.And issue #23.1 informs us just what happened to Anton Arcane after the events of Rotworld.  A rather brilliant issue not only because it gives new/more insight on Arcane's past for new and old readers, but a great display what hell would be like for someone of Arcane.  Great issue.The new art team is divided between Kano and David Lapham sharing some art duties.  Their styles meld wonderfully together.  Although they may not be the same level as Yanick Paquette was under Snyder, Kano/Lapham's art still fits the Swamp Thing design, again, being compared to 80's Swamp Thing.  When Swamp is in the desert, he looks like a cactus.  When he's in a tropical jungle, he looks like an exotic plant.  Stuff like that makes a difference.  And fill-in artist Jesus Saiz does issue #21 and 23.1, which does massive amount of detail and richness in his art.  I'm surprised Saiz name isn't more recognized because he does some fine artwork.As much I love this new direction, this opening volume under Soule and company is a bit short.  As mentioned before, volume 4 is made up of short stories to catch new and old readers up to speed, and slowly work Soule's writing style for the new big arc.  So although volume 4 is named ""Seeder"", we won't get to see Swamp Thing confront him until volume 5.  So essentially, volume 4 is Seeder part 1 and volume 5 is Seeder part 2.SWAMP THING VOL.4: SEEDER does plant the seeds of the new creative team and for the future story lines.  It's fresh under Soule's writing and Kano's art style that fans of Alan Moore's run on Swampy might enjoy.  It's only fault is its short length being connected by Â½ issue arcs and Seeder not making a real appearance until the next volume, Swamp Thing Vol. 5: The Killing Field (The New 52) (The New 52: Swamp Thing).  Still, this is an enjoyable start that people who enjoy Swampy and/or liked Snyder's work on the character should try out.  Things will be epic in the next volume as Swampy takes on Seeder and adds new depths to the characters legacy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8W46YA6SJROV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401246397#wasThisHelpful","R8W46YA6SJROV","A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V4TZ4TXGBH3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Frontline: My Brother's BomberThis is a three part series and in order to understand the documentary, one needs to watch all three segments. This documentary is real investigative reporting by a journalist whose brother was shot down over Lockerbie, Scotland some twenty five years ago with 242 other passengers. So for 25 years this journalist tries to link all those characters who were in the images with the convicted bomber, Megrahi from Libya. What I noticed were the same thing that I have noticed all along for many cases and this was no different and that is all governments are corrupt and incompetent. Here are some facts;1. Scotland releases Megrahi although their legal process found him guilty. The reasoning, COMPASSION.2. Another suspect, Musbah Eter a Libyan individual, who was link to other bombings including the 1986 La Belle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, Germany lives and works happily in Germany as a consultant for Libyans.3. Another individual Edwin Bollier who was selling Libyans bomb timers who is living happily in Switzerland.4. The US government claiming that the investigation is on going but there does not seem to be anything even after 25 years.CONCLUSION: Germany is the same country that has created immigration crisis in Europe, claiming that other countries should allow those immigrants to go through their countries and ruin their countries since Germany can not reproduce fast enough and needs immigrants but yet Germany would not fly in the same immigrants from where ever. Germany is the same country that loaned Greece money but yet sold Greece millions of dollars in submarines when Greece had no need for any submarine now they are loaning more. Germany has allowed a criminal like Musbah Eter live happily in Germany while proudly claim his involvement in the bombing. Then there is that Edwin Bollier in Switzerland, a country where the biggest US criminal had to hide till our dear Clinton pardon him for his donations so he could return back to the US. Then we have Scotland who becomes compassionate and oh what can I say about the the USA... Their agents are still walking around confused not knowing what is going on when a journalist can put all the links together without the resources that CIA and all these agencies possess.I wish not only this journalist and all the family members of those innocent 243 victims of the Lockerbie bombing well but I hope no one ever goes through such experience since if all these governments had their act together, we would not witness what we are witnessing daily. An absolute joke.P.S. Germans are the same group who have successfully produced Hitler, VW and Holocaust that includes the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to approximately eleven million. But now they are after wildlife since a A German hunter just paid $60,000 for killing of a ""majestic"" 60-year-old elephant in Zimbabwe.

"A German hunter apparently just paid $60,000 for killing a ""majestic"" 60-year-old elephant in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Association of Safaris Operators (Zaso) said the elephant was the largest seen in Zimbabwe in 100 years. Its tusks, which were so large they almost touched the floor, weighed 120lbs. Now that is an individual living in a civilized society who enjoys killing wildlife instead of promoting wildlife. A German not a Chinese.In September of 2015, Californiaâ€™s Governor, Jerry Brown signed AB96 a bill to close a loophole in the state's ban on importing, buying or selling elephant ivory or rhinoceros horns. San Francisco and Los Angeles make up two of the country's top three hubs for ivory sales. New York, which wildlife officials call the country's biggest ivory market, banned the sale of most elephant ivory, mammoth tusks and rhinoceros horns last year. California is a major market for ivory, and the ban would help dry up demand. The measure is aimed to end the state's exemption for selling ivory imported before 1977.With some 35,000 elephants slaughtered every year for their tusks that mostly are shipped to China illegally, there would be no elephants left in few years, regardless. I have never seen so many wild huge elephants up-close within few feet of a camera, nor the most dangerous killer of all, hippos so close to humans. The images that filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert have captured in this touching documentary about elephants are out of this world. It is a sad story to even consider that such a gentle animal will become extinct but if those proud citizens in NY and CA with their liberal beliefs did not protect the elephants till this last two summers by passing bills, then how in the world a communist country like China will stop their appetite for their criminal tradition of destroying many animals on this planet in the name of medicine or some other stupid beliefs that they have practiced for centuries with no regards for wildlifeâ€¦ This is a very touching documentary about elephants and watching these giants up-close in a journey to their destination in Batswana, Africa __where 1/3 of worldâ€™s elephant population thrives with their bones and tusks untouched on the ground after their death__ will get to appreciate these gentle giants much, much more. And hopefully the message will get to China as well.

"If you read the profile of the top reviewer on this item, you will notice his claim """"I am a retired research chemist"""" as well as hundred of five star reviews for many supplements. One does not need to be a chemist to understand any chemical element composition since all they need to do is a blood test which evaluates the level of elements in their body including selenium. It is done in the lab and when the results are provided, one needs to decide if their body requires more selenium intake or not. If one is lacking in selenium, then most likely Brazil nuts may be the perfect snack. Selenium is essential for human health. It is necessary for thyroid and immune system function, as well as antioxidant activity ALTOUGH HARDLY ANY ONE LACKS IN SELENIUM. The recommended daily amount is 50â€“70 micrograms, which may be achieved by consuming just one large Brazil nut. Each nut may provide up to 95 micrograms of selenium. The upper tolerance level for selenium is set at about 3â€“400 micrograms per day for adults, so consuming Brazil nuts in moderation is highly recommended.The sad part of all the promotional reviews written by that self claimed chemist with FIVE STATS EVALUATION is that he writes chemistry.

He is a very genuine, funny guy with absolutely no sophistication who just explains the whole process while consuming every single dish with delight and men, he eats lots and lots of dishes in the name of this production.Now donâ€™t be confused, these are no regular dishes, these are dishes by chef artists who are at the top of their game and what they have is what billionaires are after I am not into these food documentaries, not my gig at all but I wanted to watch the Tokyo episode since I love sea food which happens to be my main diet. I figured I will see how this nation which consumes half of the sea food in the world prepares their food so possibly I could learn a thing or two. I got much more than what I bargained for since I got to see a whole culture. Now that was the Tokyo episode and Phil has many other episodes that I will be watching since I will get to travel to different parts of the world, learn about cultures and learn about food that I can die for. Phil is the perfect host for this travel series for food and he gets to experience life just like you are suppose to before leaving this Blue Planet only if you happen to be a lucky soul. Unbelievable food, culture, tradition and much more in every city with different language and that funny, goofy Phil guy who does an excellent job of putting the whole series together, infact a very superb job. Traveling is a must for humanity and this series is one heck of funny, entertaining, delicious and mouth watering series that everyone needs to watch and see how different humans are in every part of this Blue Planet and how differently they cope with live when it comes to filling their stomachs.

"Two buck a can, 3.75oz can, skinless and boneless in olive oil is a good price especially for Crown Prince. Sardines are small, oily and nutrient-rich fish. Although they are commonly served in cans, sardines can also be grilled, smoked or pickled when fresh. Sardines are very rich in EPA and DHA, essential omega-3 fatty acids that have been linked with improved heart health. One 92-gram (3.75 oz) serving contains more than half of the RDI for these essential fatty acids. It also contains over 300 percent of the RDI for vitamin B12. Furthermore, sardines contain a little bit of almost every nutrient we need, including high amounts of selenium and calcium. These are in BPA FREE cans, many are not. I consume sardine cans with skin and bones as well since those are the healthiest part of the fish. If you are consuming fish oil, you may want to check into some research since those are ineffective and worthless. Fish is the only way to get nutrients.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MYH4ES17QT5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFRB7V0#wasThisHelpful","R2MYH4ES17QT5H","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Insure that your order is King Oscar since King Oscar is top of the line for cod liver. I consume one  to two can a month, no more and each can in two servings and the oil in the can in three servings. The liver is the most nutritious part of any animal. It is rich in essential nutrients, including vitamin B12, vitamin A, iron, folate and copper. Vitamin B12 intake is particularly important, as many people are lacking in it. It plays a crucial role in cell, brain and nervous system health. Beef liver contains high amounts of vitamin B12, vitamin A and copper. A 100-gram (3.5 oz) serving may contain the following quantities of these nutrients;â€¢ Vitamin B12: 1200 percent of the RDI.â€¢ Vitamin A: 6â€“700 percent of the RDI.â€¢ Copper: 6â€“700 percent of the RDI.Just insure to consume in moderation, because excessive buildup of these nutrients may occur.

"Phil is this goofy guy who makes lots of facial expressions even walking alone, an American Jewish dude who gets to go to different cities on this Blue Planet and enjoy different meals in restaurants and gatherings and homes of different guests who are professionals, very familiar with the best dishes in their neighborhood. Now this Philly guy eats. He really likes to eat and talk which is hilarious. He is a very genuine, funny guy with absolutely no sophistication who just explains the whole process while consuming every single dish with delight and men, he eats lots and lots of dishes in the name of this production.Now donâ€™t be confused, these are no regular dishes, these are dishes by chef artists who are at the top of their game and what they have is what billionaires are after I am not into these food documentaries, not my gig at all but I wanted to watch the Tokyo episode since I love sea food which happens to be my main diet. I figured I will see how this nation which consumes half of the sea food in the world prepares their food so possibly I could learn a thing or two. I got much more than what I bargained for since I got to see a whole culture. Now that was the Tokyo episode and Phil has many other episodes that I will be watching since I will get to travel to different parts of the world, learn about cultures and learn about food that I can die for. Phil is the perfect host for this travel series for food and he gets to experience life just like you are suppose to before leaving this Blue Planet only if you happen to be a lucky soul. Unbelievable food, culture, tradition and much more in every city with different language and that funny, goofy Phil guy who does an excellent job of putting the whole series together, infact a very superb job. Traveling is a must for humanity and this series is one heck of funny, entertaining, delicious and mouth watering series that everyone needs to watch and see how different humans are in every part of this Blue Planet and how differently they cope with live when it comes to filling their stomachs.

"""Destroying rainforest for economic gain is like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal."" E.O.W.Ed Wilson had to face violent opposition, demonstrations, lectures and classes picketed at Harvard University since Ed believes that there are general properties of the way that human mind develops and children acquire cultures; where preferences and biases are generally adopted by most people that do have biological nature. Communication gives humans the amazing capacity to cooperate and that is the mystery at the heart social behavior. We are part of the natural world. Our minds and emotions evolve in nature. To understand them, we have to understand that evolution happens right here in this Universe. Cooperation permeates our being. Everything we do, everything we love and find beautiful is the fruit of cooperation. Exclusion makes us suffer, inclusion makes us thrive. So WITHOUT NATURE, how we humans are suppose to be better off eventhough as human we are so capable of the deepest kind of behavior that can create incredible goodness â€¦One needs to watch 120 minutes of this documentary to relate to the thinking of Ed who has dedicated his life to the issue of humanity and nature. As Mahatma Gandhi used to say â€œLive as you were to die tomorrow, learn as if you were to live foreverâ€. Thank you Mr. Wilson for what you have done for us, the human specie and this Blue Planet.

Gehry is a blunt individual who has no issue flipping the bird to answer a question but yet he is a complex individual just like his buildings.

It is the attention of his building that has given Spain millions of dollars in revenues since it requires time to analyze that attention. As Malcolm Forbes used to say ""There is nothing phony or put on"" about this guy. You can read this book as well as many other books as well as watch few documentaries made with Gehry to see how alive and funny this man is. He is an institution and I say that sincerely and to see him in a professional religious setting where you can relate to his philosophy and mindset that makes him a great artist, an architect of structures, then you really have to watch the documentary called __ Frank Gehry: The Architect Says ""Why Can't I?"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VFUQUHP1CDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307701530#wasThisHelpful","R15VFUQUHP1CDG","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have been watching any BBC nature documentary and their EARTH collections of nature documentaries for last twenty years, you know they happen to be the cream of the crop when it comes to cinematography and capturing nature unlike any other documentary so it is no surprise that this one is an another top documentary from BBC but only with one difference, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY and more, much more. This is the next close documentary in IMAX format but IMAX is usually only 45 minutes where this documentary happens to be for 90 minutes. The cinematography, music, directing, narration by Idris Elba is done so superbly that it becomes more than a nature documentary (although I miss David Attenborough. It becomes an action movie starring the creations of the Universe, the Blue Planet creatures and the forceful elements from wind to sun, rain, oceans, seas, sand dooms, volcanoes, alien islands, frozen spires, valleys, animals, bugs, . Absolutely and positively an unbelievable experience in 3D by the best of the best. An entertaining nature documentary unlike any. Escape the ordinary and witness the other side of extraordinary in 3D. This is such a superb production that you can even use the film as a screen saver for your TV without the sound at all.

"Hibiscus is a bushy annual plant. Parts of the flower are used to make a popular drink in Egypt called Karkade. Various parts of the plant are also used to make jams, spices, soups, and sauces. The flowers are used to make medicine. Hibiscus is used for treating loss of appetite, colds, heart and nerve diseases, upper respiratory tract pain and swelling (inflammation), fluid retention, stomach irritation, and disorders of circulation; for dissolving phlegm; as a gentle laxative; and as a diuretic to increase urine output.Tea companies in China and India use so much chemicals that even USDA organic becomes questionable. This has few good things going for it. Frontier, the producer is number one. Seller is Amazon. Sells for less than 12 a pound which is a good price. It is cut and sifted. It is the whole flower so you get the petals as well as calyces where I prefer only petals, no calyces but no one sells only petals. It is USDA organic.

"This documentary takes you trough few decades of history about why the nuclear bomb was invented and what happened during and after the invention of the bomb. On August 6, 1945 President Truman never approved dropping the first bomb ""LITTLE BOY"" on Hiroshima that killed 80K people but he certainly approved the second bomb, ""FAT MAN"" on August 9, 1945 that killed 70K people after the Japan Emperor refused to surrender. How amusing, Hitler dragged his country into war and destruction but in the end Japan Emperor ended up getting what Hitler was suppose to get since he and his advisers could care less for their people either.K.E.J. Fuchs, a Harvard graduate and a communist with the help of another spy, Theodore A. Hall were the reason why Soviet Union exactly knew what the US was up to during the process of making the bomb. In further trials of creating the more powerful version of the bomb, hydrogen bombs were exploded with the force of ten million TNT or 600 times more powerful than what was dropped on Hiroshima and then once again on March 1, 1954, the Castle Bravo, large thermonuclear hydrogen bomb, the largest bomb by the US, was 1K times more powerful than the ""LITTLE BOY"" or equal to fifteen million tons of TNT.J. Robert Oppenheimer who successfully managed the technical end of the production of the bomb for a decade was disgraced and fired after many years of hard work by his enemies in the Congress since he wanted end to further expansion of the bomb. After all in politics it is not about what you know but who you know. This a a very informative and educational documentary especially when you are watching the past some seventy years ago. What they did then could never be accomplished these days due to divided politics and Internet since there would be no secrecy, the one essential requirement of making the BOMB which can bring so much destruction. The triumph of the bomb, winning the war with science seems the perfect American success story of that but how about the present or the future. This is a very good documentary that shows what this plant has gone through during a century of practical abuse by its only resident with ego, the human race. Unbelievable to say the least, although we witness the race for domination through destruction time after time when all such energy can be used in improving human lives on a peaceful Blue Planet.

"They should send a copy of this documentary to the clients of  Dr. Walter Palmer, the dentist who paid thousand of dollars to kill animals so he could proudly take photos of his poor victims from rhinos to lions where in contrast the dedicated individuals in this documentary donate their time and expertise to save lives for a better planet for human race. The Governor of Minnesota and Mayor of  Bloomington should show their humanity by expressing their regrets for having such a disgusting individual as part of their society.When I watched a clip of this documentary few months ago, I did not think for a second that I would be watching a documentary that will break me into tears. There are many animals in this documentary that get saved by these dedicated and caring trainers and surgeons who operate on these beauties when they are in need of medical attention but watching the dilemma that the gorillaâ€™s trainer had to go through in order to decide to amputate a whole arm of the gorilla was so painful that when the surgeon got the electric saw going, I had to stop and gather myself for few moments. The love that animals offer is so amplified at the time of need that it is not difficult to see them as your blood, your child, a loved one or even as a part of yourself in need. What you will witness in the first season of this documentary is so out of this world that you will jump to the next season immediately. You will witness the birth of a manta ray that has never been captured before, surgery on thousands of birds due to a tradition that Indiaâ€™s government is trying to stop, exchanging panda babies, and moreâ€¦ An informative, superbly well done documentary that shows not only how sensitive these animals are but more importantly how much better planet we humans can have when we only decide to care.

The sad part of this equation is that this man who never harmed a single soul for a single penny that he made in addition to saving lives, did not get the recognition from Nobel Prize but yet Nobel Prize has gone to individuals who have done nothing, absolutely nothing in comparison to Nicholas. Flags all over the world should have flown at half mast for an individual like Nicholas since he was one of the rare humans who represented the value of humanity on Planet Earth. This is a very sad, sad day. I wish his daughter, Barbara health and happiness.

If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients. ZO is what surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions. Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production. More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less but then again, less ZO offers less protection. Producers write whatever they want to push a mix and it is up to consumers to read ingredients and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans' salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceansâ€™ salty water. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin. I don't intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix. Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group's annual Sunscreen Guide.3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.7. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container.8. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.9. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.10. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLTD63K383F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089QD9WI#wasThisHelpful","R1HLTD63K383F0","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Human body does not compensate for liquid sugar calories, making one to eat more calories overall. Sugar-sweetened beverages like Vitaminwater are strongly linked to weight gain and obesity. In the U.S., they sweeten Vitaminwater with crystalline fructose and cane sugar, but in other countries they use mainly cane sugar (fancy word for sugar). Crystalline fructose is the worst, being almost pure fructose (over 98%), while cane sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose. A bottle of Vitaminwater (in the U.S.) almost contains about the same amount of fructose as a bottle of regular Coke. That is because the majority of the sugar in U.S. Vitaminwater is in the form of pure fructose, while fructose comprises only half of the sugar content of Coke.

"This is not a film only about mountain biking. This is not a film only about few talented and blessed individuals who are capable of the impossibilities, THIS IS MUCH, MUCH MORE... I am in many sports and have explored beautiful Utah and many of its towering canyons on my mountain bike as well as on my boards and could not stop being overwhelmed with the level of comfort that these athletes and professionals in this film handled those over 50% sheer canyon drops on their mountain bike with such ease. These guys are so good at what they do and make it look so easy to glide on any type of dirt from sandstone to granite in scary cliffs, that one forgets that they are not on their snow boards or skiers, they are not on white powder, they are all free falling on rough dirt surfaces where you can hardly see more than few feet on front of you at that speed since the path is so steep, so dangerous, so unknown, so exhilarating that the only sure thing that one can rely on is their natural gift and ability of balance on those two wheels since the smallest mistake will push you down few thousand feet to the bottom of the cliff. This is not a film only for mountain bikers or any specialty group or athletes, this is about human capabilities in locations unknown to most. Watch this film with your kids and expose them to mountain biking and traveling that can offer to them gratifying life of adventure for years to come. The director has done a superb work of putting all those movie images together from many different angles with a cinematography to die for in many different locations and elevations that requires Heli and speed boats with music that will get you glued to the film and the adrenaline will get you get up and going for years to come. Absolutely, positively and happily I have to admit that this is one of the handful of exhilarating documentaries that I have watched that kept me pumped up and going for more thrill especially after a long happy surfing day in Pacific Ocean. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Unbelievable talents.There are three versions of this film. DVD and streaming. Both versions are 1 HR and 21 minutes. With streaming, you will get to watch in HD unlike DVD which you can not. This is a film that should be watched in HD so you can see all the real details of those canyons and many of the shots made from Heli. You can watch the same 1 HR and 20 minute streaming in five HD segments each 25 minutes that will add up to the longest version, 150 minutes which offers an extra 60 more minutes of advanture in the same five locations, 2 Utah, Argentina, Canada, Nepal and China.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFVW97TPQ66P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7ETPNA#wasThisHelpful","R1DFVW97TPQ66P","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I consume hemp all the time but I consume hemp seeds purchased in NEEDED quantities, kept frozen, and consume it well before its expiration date since just like any seed high in oil, it does go rancid quickly. Refer to the comment section about the hemp seed review. Most brands are usually trustworthy as long as purchased through a reputable seller with high turn over and there are couple of producers that I purchase from all the time. Now, there is a big difference between hemp seeds in complete form to all other type of hemp from hemp oil to hemp powder to hemp protein. All those productions are worthless and many individuals unknowingly fall for the health gimmick offered by many producers which runs in billions of dollars without any benefits to the consumer.Protein suppresses ghrelin more than sugar or carbs. One may consume more calories in the same amount of sugar than protein, but regardless they certainly will not feel full consuming sugar as long as one will feel when consuming protein. A gram of fat has twice the amount of calories as a gram of sugar. Fats are good for body in Mono or Poly form not in damaging Trans forms that can be found in processed foods. Human body turns dietary fats into body fat quicker than turns sugar into body fat. When it comes to adding muscle mass one needs protein but when it comes to endurance which is getting work out of those muscles, one needs glycogen. When there are not enough glycogen in human body, protein in form of amino acids are pulled from muscles and pumped into blood stream which turns into energy, or sugar so body can perform. Such taxing not only is not healthy on human body, it shrinks muscle mass but fat stays untouched. Any athlete or anyone in many sports knows the amount of protein that they consume as well as the amount of glycogen that they are storing in their body. That itself is a science which is very easy to learn if one considers themselves an athlete since without a healthy diet no human can be in any sport less in few sports.Reading through all the reviews, everyone is talking about what may be in the item other than hemp protein. Well, one needs to ask, if this is such a good protein then why there is no complete amino acid breakdown on the labeling... The short answer is simple, marketing. I happily consume hemp as well as flax as well as sesame as well as many other seeds but I purchase all those seeds in complete form not in processed form and then I process it myself, in small batches since anyone with knowledge about nutrients knows that sesame or flax are worthless in complete form or processed form by all producers regardless of the producer, it is only a healthy ingredient when I ground it myself in small batches in my coffee grinder to allow digestion of the nutrients and AVOID rancidness which is the biggest problem of oils. I consume protein when I pump iron since I need to build muscle so I consume protein which is fresh, without any additives, without any chemicals, without any sweeteners, when purchased fresh from a reliable and trustworthy source. All these vegetable proteins regardless of the source, nut or seeds or rice or mixed, are nothing but pure calories without the intended nutrients. Forget about lead or other additives in the bag, even in pure form, these are nothing but empty calorie. If not, they would produce the amino acids table on the labeling.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PHUZKNTTCK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQFGLAW#wasThisHelpful","R23PHUZKNTTCK6","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"one thing that I can not do is find the knowledge that this writer has offered in her book which is how certain food items behave and why they are not as nutritious as others. Very informative book. Bravo.1. Buying fresh tomatoes instead of canned.Cooking tomatoes makes them more nutritious, and the longer you cook them, the better. Heat changes the lycopene into a form our bodies can more readily absorb and â€” surprise! â€” canned tomatoes are much higher in phytonutrients, thanks to the heat of the canning process. Tomato paste, being more concentrated, is even better.2. Storing lettuce wrong.You might think that damaging your vegetables before storing them is a mistake, but when it comes to lettuce, tearing the leaves triggers a protective blast of phytonutrients that you can take advantage of by eating the greens within a day or two. Lettuce that is torn before storing can have double the antioxidants of whole lettuce leaves.3. Boiling spinach â€” or any vegetable really.You may have heard that boiling vegetables is a no-no because water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C leach out of the food and into the cooking water, but you might not know that boiling also reduces the antioxidant content. The difference in spinach is especially dramatic: after 10 minutes of boiling, three-quarters of its phytonutrient content is in cooking water, not in the vegetable itself. (Of course, if you consume the cooking liquid, as you do when making soup, you consume all the nutrients in the water as well.) Steaming, microwaving, sautÃ©ing, and roasting â€” cooking methods that donâ€™t put vegetables in direct contact with water â€” result in more nutritious vegetables on the plate.4. Eating your salad with fat-free salad dressing.Weâ€™ve known for a few years that you absorb more of the nutrients in salad when you eat it with fat, but the type of fat can make a difference. Most commercial salad dressings use soybean oil, but extra-virgin olive oil is much more effective at making nutrients available for absorption. Unfiltered extra-virgin olive oil is even better, as it contains double the phytonutrients of filtered.5. Cooking garlic right after chopping it.If you mince a clove of garlic and quickly throw it in a hot pan, you consume almost no allicin, the beneficial compound that makes garlic such a health star. Thatâ€™s because the enzyme that creates allicin is not activated until you rupture the cell walls of the garlic â€” and is quickly inactivated by heat. Just two minutes in a hot pan or 60 seconds in the microwave reduces the allicin in just-chopped garlic to almost nothing. Letting the chopped garlic sit for 10 minutes before exposing it to heat gives the enzyme time to do its work, so your finished dish contains the maximum amount of allicin. Using a garlic press is even better than mincing, as it releases more of the compounds that combine to create allicin.6. Throwing away the most nutritious parts of the vegetable.Most American recipes call for only the white and light green parts of scallions, but the dark green parts have a higher concentration of phytonutrients. Instead of throwing out the nutritious tops, you can ignore the recipe instructions and toss in the green parts as well, or explore recipes from elsewhere in the world â€” such as Chinese scallion pancakesâ€” which utilize the entire green onion.Beet greens are another often-discarded vegetable part that we would be better off eating; they have more antioxidants than the beet roots, which are already high in phytonutrients. Try cooking and eating the greens alongside the roasted roots in recipes like Warm Golden Beet Salad with Greens and Almonds. And donâ€™t forget vegetable peels, which often contain a higher concentration of antioxidants than the rest of the vegetable. Try roasting them and eating them like chips!7. Eating potatoes right after cooking them.Many people avoid white potatoes because they are a high-glycemic vegetable, spiking blood sugar after eating. But chilling potatoes for about 24 hours after cooking converts the starch in the potatoes to a type that is digested more slowly, making them a low-glycemic vegetable. So potato salad chilled overnight is a low-glycemic food, as is a cooked, chilled, and reheated baked potato.8. Cutting carrots before you cook them.Cooking carrots whole and cutting them up after they are cooked keeps more nutrients in the vegetable. And speaking of cooking, carrots are one vegetable that is better for you cooked than raw â€” cooking helps break down the cell walls, making the nutrients easier to absorb.9. Buying broccoli florets, instead of a whole head.Broccoli looks like a hardy vegetable, but from an antioxidant standpoint, it is shockingly perishable, quickly exhausting its stores of powerful phytonutrients after harvest. â€œI call it one of the â€˜eat me firstâ€™ vegetables,â€ says Robinson. One study found that after 10 days â€” the time it took to get the vegetable from field to supermarket produce section â€” broccoli lost 75 percent of its flavonoids (a type of antioxidant) and 80 percent of its glucosinolates, the compounds in cruciferous vegetables that are associated with numerous health benefits.Cutting the broccoli into florets doubles the rate of antioxidant loss, so in addition to buying the freshest broccoli you can find and cooking it right away, you should choose whole heads rather than the bags of pre-cut florets.10. Cooking beans from scratch and discarding the cooking liquid.Dried beans are some of the most phytonutrient-rich foods out there, but the big surprise is this: canned have more antioxidants! If you prefer from-scratch beans, let the beans sit in the cooking liquid for about an hour after cooking to reabsorb some of the nutrients that have moved into the liquid. And try using a pressure cooker to cook beans; one study found that beans cooked in the pressure cooker had more antioxidants than those cooked with other methods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OOI2SI3Y7PVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D81WUYW#wasThisHelpful","R1OOI2SI3Y7PVM","A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Governments are not the only ones (or often the best ones) to solve social problems. In these pages, there is (well, at least anecdotal) proof. What business writers Eggers and MacMillan call ""The Solution Revolution"" is essentially a movement whereby nonprofits and for-profits are finding creative and sustainable ways to solve some of the world's most pressing social problems, from Recyclebank's methods of getting more people to recycle, to Rideshare and Zipcar's aid in solving congestion caused by motor transportation, to several companies' successful attempts to offer good, low cost, education to Africa's poor.I will warn right now that this book is both somewhat unstructured and more of a rapid-fire profile of socially-conscious enterprises than an instructional book on ""the solution revolution."" The book is...er... organized around the ""six principal features"" of the ""solution revolution: wavemakers (the players), disruptive technologies (they use to create innovation), business models that scale, impact currencies (currencies other than money, like social impact or reputation, used to motivate innovation), public value exchanges (innovative marketplaces), and solution ecosystems (that allow collaborators and competitors to converge on pressing social problems). But the execution is not there. Basically each chapter introduces the particular principal feature, talks about a few organizations and how they illustrate that feature, and then meander onto other organizations that may or may not illustrate that feature... all with VERY little explanation of how they leveraged that feature to create good results.With that, my big criticism of the book, aside, we can talk about the good aspects. In relaying the stories of successful businesses and organizations succeeding at alleviating some of the world's pressing problems, Eggers and MacMillan permit and enable readers to imagine yet untapped possibilities. From companies who are offering low cost education to the world's poor (or just those in the ""developed"" world who can't afford higher ed's high price tag!) to companies finding ways to decrease government response time to natural disasters, the enterprising reader comes away with a heightened sense of optimism. These guys sure are good at telling the stories!But, alas, this book is more inspirational (and in that sense, one could justly accuse a bit of Polyanna-ism) than instructive... unless one reads between the line and gleans the instruction solely from the book's examples. The book's sole ""instructional"" chapter - ""How to Create Your Own Solution Revolution"" - does little more than tells potential entrepreneurs to think ""outside the box"" and governments to be creative with how they tackle problems (think competitions for private solutions and crowdsourcing).Be all this as it may, as long as you are reading this less as a how-to and more as an inspirational tale of how innovation can change lives, I highly recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YBDNP9VXJNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422192199#wasThisHelpful","R36YBDNP9VXJNF","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to Make Money Selling Drugs is ostensibly a ""career guide"" for those who want to learn how to make money in the drug trade. Whether for lack of other meaningful options or just a desire to ""get rich without really working,"" this film, featuring interviews from some successful drug dealers, law enforcement and others, is designed to look like a way to explain to outsiders how to get into the business.But as the film goes on, you get the real message of social commentary: the reason the drug war is so lucrative is because that, far from decreasing the demand for drugs, the drug war increases demand and creates a system where everyone can strike it rich. Dealers benefit from drugs being kept illegal because they are more lucrative that way; police officers and police departments can make money both through confiscation of drug dealers' property but generous federal aid based on number of drug convictions; prisons can get rich over the boom to their business created by drug prohibition (which as we've said, does nothing to stop demand), etc.This film was truly outstanding, though much of its message (and even some of the same interviewees) are reflected in an equally outstanding critique of the drug war, ""The House I Live In."" How to Make Money gains the edge, I think, because of its creativity of approach.

"It is hard to get excited about mouthwash, but for me, it is especially hard to get excited about alcohol-free mouthwash. I tend to prefer antiseptic to antibacterial mouthwash (this one being the latter), but I was asked to try it.Part of the reason I am skeptical of non-alcoholic mouthwashs, frankly, is that the taste on many of them just isn't very strong. I want a strong mint, and most non-alcohiolic mouthwash I've tried is rather wimpy. This Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield Wintermint, though, is surprisingly bold in flavor. I could feel the mint in my mouth for about an hour after I used it (something I usually only get from Listerine or Act antiseptic mouthwash).As far as really cleaning my teeth, I'm afraid I am going to stick with the alcohol-infused antiseptic mouthwash, mostly because my problem is not bad breath, but wanting to prevent gingivitis and the like.

"Before reading One Simple Idea, I had no real idea about the long and deep history of the positive thought movement. This is a very readable book (informative, but not scholarly in tone) about a chain of thinkers devoted to the idea that thoughts can have a material effect on the brain. Familiar with Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People? Rhonda Byrne's Oprah-fueled success The Secret? Here are the origins.Really, it starts with a New England ""spiritual teacher"" named Phinneas Quimby, who was convinced that thoughts can help heal physical (and of course mental) disease. Once he began seeing patients and developing a following, it didn't take long for others to expand on or come to the same thoughts, particularly those like Mary Baker Eddy and the Christian Science movement (about whom the author recounts a very public controversy about how much intellectual debt she and the movement owed to Quimby. Followers of Christian Science sometimes left, establishing their own variation on the positive thinking movement, and within several decades, a movement was born. Prentice Mulford, Norman Vincent Peale, Dale Carnegie, Benny Hinn? They were all figures arising from this history (and the author profiles the thought and lives of all of these).But the book is not just as historical profile of a movement, but a reflection on how the movement has affected larger culture. One chapter ruminates on how the positive thinking movement made a deep influence on Stokely Carmichael and the ""black power"" movement. Another chapter discusses the positive thinking elements of the Reagan revolution and presidency (and its influence on politics at large during the tumultuous 80's.)The last chapter - ""But Does It work?"" - is more of a philosophical rumination on whether these ideas are any good. The author (who has a personal connection with the positive thinking movement) is skeptical of some of the ethics of a movement that, in effect, places blame on people for their individual failures or lack of success (because if thinking it achieves it, a lack of achieving it means you just didn't want hard enough). For my tastes, one thing missing from this book was a bit of the history of skepticism toward the movement; occasionally, characters are introduced who are skeptics, but not very often. I think more of this would have offered a bit more of a counter-narrative to fit with the overall narrative. Also, probably because many of the characters espoused very similar beliefs and had very similar career paths (a boom for a few years and then a sharp fall-out in popularity), the book did get a bit repetitive.All in all, though, this book gave me a lot of info into the history of the positive thinking movement that I just didn't know. It introduced an intriguing cast of characters and did so in a very readable and relatable way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZP1EZLWBAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307986497#wasThisHelpful","R2SZP1EZLWBAO","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deborah Meier is one thoughtful educator. I first encountered this book in graduate school (in a class on Education Leadership) and, to my surprise, ended up coming back to it again and again. At first, I wasn't terribly blown away by Meier's arguments and the nuances in them, but the book did grow on me.Meier's concern is that the ""stakeholders"" (my word, not hers) in schools do not trust and form relationships with each other enough. Students don't come to know and trust teachers, teachers and parents don't come to know and trust the other, and teachers often do not come to know and seek feedback from other teachers. Meier's suggestion (and I agree) is that this is largely because we quite often seek large solutions to problems: learning standards that apply uniformly state-wide, power centralized into higher and higher up political channels, and creating more standardized approaches.Maybe what is needed is actually a bit of flexibility and a return of schools to (what social theorist Kirpatrick Sale argues) a ""human scale."" For teachers to attend and respond to parents (rather than seeing them as just one more nuisance and thing to worry about), maybe schools need to be of a smaller size that allows families and teachers to be a bit more flexible. For students to trust teachers, maybe teachers need a bit more authority to make decisions so that students can see their teacher as someone other than a rule-follower that has no real discretion or authority. (It is hard and maybe superfluous to trust who you know doesn't have authority to make decisions.)Utopian? Well, Meier deals with some of those objections. If we create small schools that have discretion and authority over their own budgets and methods, doesn't the success of any school depend on the people? Well, yes, but a small school approach is probably more likely to attract good people and bring out the good work in people than a system where everything is mapped out by the state and teachers just follow orders. (Don't we all do better work when we have a bit of discretion on how to do it?) What about accountability? Meier's answer: accountability is as or more effective when it is down to the consumer than up to state bureaucrats. Et cetera.Alongside all this, Meier goes into explanations of how small schools can and may be better able to deal with sensitive issues of race, class, and ethnic differences among students and ""stakeholders,"" as well as one of the best non-technical discussions of why standardized tests don't quite measure what we think they do. (Long and short: norm-referenced tests are kind of circular and convoluted in the way they design and select questions for the test, and criterion-referenced tests leave open very thorny questions of how we decide what emphasis to put on what knowledge and ""what every fourth grader should know."" And either way, the tests are almost unavoidably designed with cultural bias and questions that could lead legitimately to more than one feasible answer.)There are a few things I wish Meier would have addressed. First, Meier doesn't address the seemingly obvious concern many would have that small schools that all do things a bit differently may have a difficult time with the idea of equality. (Doesn't it sort of mean that we return to days where the schooling I can get is dependent on where I live?) Second, given Meier's love of decentralization (a love I share) and her allowance for some sort of school choice, she doesn't really address much about why she thinks school choice should be confined to public schools and warns against ""privatization""? (She says something about this in a very brief final chapter, but it needs more unpacking, especially given governments' seeming penchant for centralizing school systems over time.) And there are a few others.But this is a book I would certainly recommend to educational leaders and scholars, largely because Meier is so good at articulating her concerns and her vision for how we could design school systems differently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5IJ1ITDMNT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BE24V7G#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5IJ1ITDMNT6","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a huge David Mamet fan but, to be honest, his films of the last several years have left a bit to be desired. (The  dialogue and scripts were too choppy; the plots, a bit weak.) Here, though, we have a Mamet film that really has Mamet doing what he does best - creating really good, forward-moving dialogue around a really intriguing plot.The plot centers around the first murder trial of Phil Spector, seen through the eyes of Spector's defense team. This intriguing angle is largely responsible for the film's uniqueness. Helen Mirren does a fantastic job as the lead defense lawyer who, at first, does not want to take the case, but gradually sympathizes with Spector and fears that without a good defense, a jury might convict him for his eccentricities alone. She and her defense team are determined not to see that happen, so they develop a defense not only based on (their interpretation of) the facts, but allowing the jury to learn about the human side of Spector. The question up until the very end of the film: put the unpredictable Phil Spector (played by an impeccable Al Pacino) on the stand?I found the film quite riveting. Mamet creates a forceful forward motion with his rapid-fire dialogue punctuated by emotion-filled monologues (usually by Spector). The plot is both an interesting who-dunnit as well as a psychological exploration of Spector. All in all, a really good film that (at least to me) finds Mamet recapturing some of that ""Glengary Glenn Ross"" magic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OVW8NI3XUQ0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F35DUCC#wasThisHelpful","R1OVW8NI3XUQ0O","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Government's End, Jonathan Rauch gives a good introduction to the world of public choice economics. In other words, it is a book about what happens when government programs create inducements for ""special interest"" groups to lobby. In other words, when governments get in the business of wealth transfers (via tarrifs, subsidies, tax breaks, etc), it is only rational for various groups - industry representatives, consumer groups, policy groups - to start lobbying in order that some of those transfers go their way.But let's get something straight: Rauch is NOT doing the typical ""let's complain about those special interests"" thing, or a political rant targeting some special interests (but not others) as destroying America. Rauch is actually quite neutral in this book. So, first, the term ""special interest"" is, for Rauch, a misnomer, because any group who has any interest at all in getting any policy enacted (or maintained) constitutes an interest that is likely to lobby. Second, these interests are not (generally) lobbying to subvert the will of the American people, but often are simply fighting for causes they believe are worthy and acting quite rationally (seeing as other groups are lobbying, it would be foolish to be the group that doesn't). What we have, in econ-speak, is a tragedy of the commons, where it is in everyone's interest to do what they can to get resources funneled their way, but when everyone does that, it risks creating a net loss (more money spent lobbying overall than benefits won as a result of lobbying overall).While this book was written in the mid-1990's, the examples Rauch uses of public choice economics in action are quite good. From the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administration's failed attempts to challenge ""special interests"" enough to fulfill promises to change government, to many a stubbornly persistent government policies protecting everything from agricultural subsidies to taxicab licenses and wool manufacture. And while the book is easily read by non-economists, Rauch introduces several key economic concepts from the public choice literature like how ""concentrated benefits and dispersed costs"" often lead to policies remaining in place even when they cause a net loss to society, and ""churning"" whereby government programs often give to group a while taking from group by while also taking from group b to give to group a.It is worth stressing again that this is not meant to be a partisan book. Rauch goes out of his way to point out that special interest groups (and good-spirited attempts to transcend ""special interest politics"") come both from the left and the right. In fact, particularly since the book is NOT partisan, it is hard to read it without amplifying one's pessimism because, as Rauch describes it, the ""tragedy of the commons"" problem (they lobby, so others lobby, increasing the inducement of still others to lobby) seems pretty unsolvable. Just stop the wealth transfer programs that lead to lobbying? Too late for that. Enact strict campaign finance or anti-lobbying laws? Good luck getting a system where everyone seems to benefit from lobbying to do that. Just elect more strong-willed and honest representatives? Good representatives + system dependent on lobbying = good representatives realizing that the only way to do good is to accept lobbying.Anyway, this is a really good book for those wanting to understand not why our system doesn't work, but how our system works. (Whether it does or doesn't work depends on where you sit.) As Rauch writes, this is a book about side-effects, how a result no one seemed to plan arose and keeps growing because of incentives built into our system of government.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BZ5CYL6I05W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PYDBUS#wasThisHelpful","R16BZ5CYL6I05W","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, well maybe it is not quite THAT simple, but here's the story. Madmen (those who have original ideas, whether in or outside of academia) think up some new idea - deregulating the airlines, earned income tax credit, whatever. Intellectuals (the dealers in second-hand ideas, usually in academia) figure out which ideas are good by writing and debating with each other. And then the academic scribblers (those who take ideas and apply them to concrete policy problems) finally take the ideas from intellectuals and apply them to policy.Well, sort of. Really, the main concern in this book is to go beyond standard public finance and public choice theory. A 'public finance' approach tells us that policy is made by benevolent and altruistic public servants in order to correct for market failures. But that doesn't explain how - as often happens - policy often gets made (and stuck) that is clearly not in the public interest and not something the public seems excited about. So, public choice theory comes in to tell us that it is often the case that our public servants are self-interested, and often pass legislation because it will advance their careers, their livelihoods, etc. (I want x to pass, but can't do it without your support, and you want y to pass. So, I will help you pass y and you help me pass x, and stuff like that.) But wait.... that doesn't tell us why sometimes, bad policy DOES get removed, even at the seeming expense of the public figures and special interests who now have vested interest in the policy's existence. (The examples used toward the end of this book are the auctioning of radio frequencies on the market, deregulation of airlines, and welfare reform in the Clinton era.)So, now comes our authors' theory: public choice has it right much of the time, but we also have to account for how ideas effect what policy proposals get traction and which don't. The theory is that ""madmen"" (in academia or out; we might call them 'rogues') come up with new ideas. From there, ""intellectuals"" in academia and out debate the ideas and keep some of them alive in the process. Finally, the ""academic scribblers"" are those who are in the world of policy, and put the rubber to the road by taking the ideas intellectuals have been researching and talking about, and applying them - when appropriate - to pressing problems of the day. The process can take many years from the original idea to the policy problem that catches the right person's attention (who knows just what academic idea to apply). But when it works, it works.The first third of the book is spent discussing the traditional public finance and public choice views and why both of them have limited explanatory power (though the latter gets higher marks than the former). Next, the authors outline their theory of madmen, intellectuals, and scribblers. Last, the authors demonstrate by going over the three examples above. (So, for the radio auctioning, the madman who came up with the idea  in 1956 was economist Ronald Coase, who modified the idea of a graduate student). After thirty eight years of intellectuals tossing the idea around,  the FCC finally took the idea seriously and implemented it. Why the inefficient political distribution of radio frequencies hung around for so long was the stuff of public choice theory. Why it was repealed is the stuff of madmen, intellectuals, and academic scribblers.)One thing I am not sure about with this book: while the authors' theory adds a potential new explanatory layer onto public choice theory, now it seems we must explain WHY certain ideas become powerful enough to overturn entrenched interests and why others don't. The authors suggest that there is simply a confluence of factors: the problem becomes so pressing and the policy so visibly bad that certain ideas (which might have laid dormant otherwise) now seem like a good idea and gain political traction. Okay, but there are many glaringly bad policies and proposals to fix those polices where entrenched interests ultimately do prove to great to overturn. So, should we now figure out what makes some situations more susceptible to innovation and others not?That being said, I enjoyed the book. I teach education policy at the college level, and while this book is not specifically geared to my field, I think there may a useful framework for explaining why education reform occasionally happens and doesn't happen when we think it should,  Very readable, and highly interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309CXHAK127BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQDUZQK#wasThisHelpful","R309CXHAK127BT","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intellectuals in Action is a history of the New Left movement like no other. Rather than a blow-by-blow, Mattson examines the evolution of ideas that moved the New Left by exploring the lives and writings of several intellectuals in the movement - one per chapter. (Sociologist C. Wright Mills, social critic Paul Goodman, historian William Appleman Williams, philosopher Arnold Kauffman, and the journalist academics behind Studies on the Left and New University magazines.)What is Kauffman trying to find out? What is he doing with this history that other histories don't do? First, he is paying careful attention to how the New Left expanded on and drifted away from the Old Left, and particularly how each author handled the tension between liberalism (wanting to keep what is good in the liberal tradition) and progressivism (wanting to expand beyond the liberalism that left them frustrated). Second, he examines how each intellectual saw the role of intellectuals - themselves included - in the New Left; how much, for instance, should intellectuals be neutral scholars and how much should their scholarship be motivated by, or even be, activism?I found this book extremely interesting. Particularly, I enjoyed the author's very neutral but passionate portrayal of all the intellectuals involved here. For instance, while the author clearly admires all the figures he writes about, he is quick to point out some of their blind spots and tensions in their work, such as some of the uneasy tensions between the appeal to traditional American liberal values and appeal to progressive radicalism. Other times, the author takes some figures to task for doing more pessimistic complaining about what the New Left saw as liberalism's increasing corporate style, and offering very few policy recommendations beyond telling the world to ""decentralize.""I have always wanted to understand the New Left's intellectual core a bit more; while my own libertarian view is not quite matched with the New Left, it shares many commonalities, so my goal has been to find out where those similarities and differences are. What do New Leftists tend to mean - in terms of specific policy - by ""decentralization,"" ""participatory demoracacy,"" and the like? What kind of society were they envisioning that equally rejected laissez-faire capitalism, planned socialism, and (seemingly) the ""War on Poverty"" corporate welfare state? Mattson's book helped me get some of those answers, give me some new authors and ideas to play with, and leave me with new questions.A very great read about the New Left that goes beyond the typical blow-by-blow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6QWHH715D0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TK2XHS#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6QWHH715D0Z","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most readable histories of American (public) education I have yet read. Graham, a historian of education and former public school teacher, breaks the history of American education down into roughly four (aliterative) phases: assimilation (until the 1910's), adjustment (until about 1950), Access (until around 1980), and Achievevement (to present). (She also includes a chapter on the increasing role of university education, called ""Autonomy to Accountability""). Each of these phases was, in some sense, an instance of public schools trying to adjust to the changing needs of the nation. Assimilation - where schools' primary function was to 'Americanize' - was brought about by an influx of immigration from Europe. Adjustment - where education was to be made more relevant and mindful of children's interests - was brought about by schools' goal of trying to keep an ever-expanding number of students (thanks to compulsory ed laws) interested in schools. Access was the goal when various groups - African-American, the disabled, foreign students for whom English was a second language and American was a second culture - worked to make sure that they all received quality (and integrated) schooling. Lastly, Achievement was brought about by increasing awareness that student learning was declining and what this might mean for America's place in the world; schools, therefore, needed higher standards, and learning would be measured by achievement on standards-based tests.Be mindful that, while easy to read and concise, this book is quite shot through with the author's opinions... and that those opinions are somewhat educationally ""conservative"" a la Diane Ravitch or E.D. Hirsch. Not ""conservative"" in the sense of being critical of public schools generally or wanting to see privatization and markets in schooling, but ""conservative"" in the sense of believing more in schools' assimilationist and achievement mission than in their adjustment mission. That is, it becomes quite evident that Graham is no fan of the progressive trends in education from the 1920's on, or on schools' increasing focus on vocational training.... and definitely not that increasing role that educational ""tracking"" has played since the 1920's. For better or worse, one gets the feeling that had Graham her way, we'd see schools return (in terms of curriculum, not administration) to the way schools were in the 1890's - focused on the 3 R's and giving students instruction whose purpose is to bring students into a shared American culture.One thing, in fact, I was concerned with in this book is that a good half of it seems somewhat inconsistent with its subtitle, exploring how the public schools meet the nation's changing needs. That is, from the progressive era to the 1950's (and even beyond that, when talking about American schools' increasing focus on vocational education), Graham writes as if the schools were not meeting the needs of the nation at all. Mostly, she writes as if schools were meeting what academics in education schools and the administrators who looked to them mistakenly thought the nation's needs were. Focus on education being congruent with student interests, and vocational training, took focus away from strong academic skills and educating people to think (rather than do specific ""real world"" tasks). As the author tells it, the nation got back on track, to a certain degree, with the standards movements brought about by reports like A Nation At Risk. (For the record, she has grave doubts about increased focus on standardized tests and exaggerating the ""crisis"" in American public schools, but believes that at least the focus is in the right place.) [Another small concern I have is that, to my mind, the author is VERY naive about the role politics plays in American education, often talking about political debates about school policy as ""public debates"" and legislation doing what legislators want as ""doing what the people want."" I am much more skeptical than the author about the congruence of what politicians do with what ""the people"" want, and likely because of that, much less rosy-eyed about whether public schools succeed in meeting ""the nation's"" needs, or even whether ""the nation's needs"" are homogeneous enough to be met through a single set of institutions like public schools. While that is a difference of opinion, it is one that explains why I disagreed with the author's assessment fairly often.]But honestly, I still give the book four stars, because it is a highly readable and (if we take opinions out) accurate broad assessment of the history of public schooling in America. While there are no footnotes - as it is intended to be a popular work - there is a helpful list of suggested readings (thorough, but maybe a bit skewed). Those who want an interesting and thought provoking history of American public education should DEFINITELY read Graham's account. (And if you want a different and maybe more pessimistic perspective, balance it with Joel Spring's textbook, ""The American School."")","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S5KCJDCWI0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QZ8PFG#wasThisHelpful","R17S5KCJDCWI0C","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Neuroscieintist/philosopher Joshua Greene has a big thesis in this book that requires some quite involved steps. His concern is to argue for a ""metamorality"" of the kind that should help groups with differing moralities resolve differences. Greene starts out envisioning two prototypical ""tribes. One has a morality of self-reliance and ""just desserts,"" where people are responsible for their lot in life and get rewarded in proportion to their efforts. The other has a more altruistic view of the world, where things are shared and shared alike, and everyone feels responsibility for everyone. The question: how do we decide which of these groups - or more likely, which elements of each group's worldview - should win the day in cases of moral conflict? (More specifically: when we face moral dilemmas where we could respond via self-interest and ""just desserts"" or with altruism and egalitarian ""desserts"", how should we determine which to go with?)Greene's answer is basically a form of utilitarianism that he calls ""deep pragmatism."" And to see why requires some explanation, which could be really dull but isn't, owing to Greene's gifts as a good and clear writer. He argues that humans have what is called a ""dual process morality"" that is divided between intuitive gut instincts (dominated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and a more calculating thought process (owing more to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). When it comes to questions of ""me versus us,"" the intuition side of things is pretty reliable, making us feel guilty for taking more than ""our fair share,"" breaking rules that we expect everyone else to follow, etc. Understandable, because our intuitions of empathy and the like almost certainly evolved to stimulate cooperation within groups among otherwise selfish individuals (which confers an overall survival advantage).But our instincts also don't do very well with ""we versus them"" problems, because the same mechanisms that evolved to stimulate cooperation evolved to do so only WITHIN GROUPS (not between them). So, instincts often make us feel guilty at not helping others who are close to us, but the guilt lessens the farther removed the others-in-need are from us. Here, though, the thinking part of our brains can step in, and the thinking part of our brains (Greene's and others' research suggests) tend to be ""utilitarian"" - preferring whatever option leads to the greatest overall happiness less discriminately.The most interesting (and original) parts of this book are those where Greene reviews his own and others' research on ""the trolley problem"" - a problem philosophers have concocted to illustrate the dilemma between the sanctity of individual rights and the imperative of maximizing overall happiness. The trolley problem - and there are many variations of it - is of a train going down a track where five people are trapped. One can avert the trolley from killing the five only if one pushes a particular person onto the track (fortunately, you are standing at an area of the track where any obstruction to the trolley will avert it to a side-track, and pushing the man in front of the track will create such an obstruction.)Yes, it is highly contrived, but philosophers have argued for many years over the 'correct' answer to the problem: is it better to maximize happiness by saving five even if it means you have to intentionally sacrifice one, or is it better to let the five die if it means not intentionally killing one innocent person? Greene's study has led him to see the ""dual process theory"" of morality at work here. Those who have damage to the ""instinctual"" part of the brain unhesitatingly kill the one to save the five, and those with damage to the ""calculating"" part of the brain do the opposite. The rest of us struggle because the two parts of our brain are telling us different things.But, far from saying that there is no good answer, Greene suggests that in the trolley case, the best answer is the utilitarian one, because he suspects that our compunctions about intentionally killing to save five lives is a relic of the intuitional module of our brain (as evidenced partly by the fact that those who choose to let the five die can''t generally give any good explanation for why, save that it feels wrong). And Greene also suggests that while intuitional thinking doe serve us well at times - in ""me versus us"" questions - it is often ill-equipped to deal with ""us versus them"" problems (problems the world is facing more and more of).This is where I start to find Greene unconvincing. Without getting into too much detail, Greene strikes me as a utilitarian only to the degree that it gets him to the answers he wants to get... and there is a lot of inconsistent reasoning Greene gives about why utilitarianism is the best actual theory, rather than the one that gets him the answers he likes best. Mostly, this comes from a mixture of explaining both how utilitarianism doesn't conflict with some of our most deeply held intuitions (disrespect for individual rights when they conflict with the greatest good, etc), AND explaining that when it does, it is because in those cases, our intuitions are wrong. In other words, when utilitarianism validates our intuitions, that shows how good utilitarianism is, but when it conflicts with our intuitions, that shows that our intuitions - not utilitarianism - is flawed. Something seems very post hoc and inconsistent about this.To be sure, I don't have a much better answer. I think that, in the end, Greene's work actually REDUCES our confidence that there are best and worst answers to moral questions, but that is because unlike Greene, I see no reason to think we can resolve the ""dual process"" competing answers by somehow stepping above our human moral thinking and saying that there is an objective criteria that can determine which ""process"" is the right one and which, the wrong one. Might it just be that our impulses toward intuition and calculation conflict and that is that? Yes, Greene (and many of us) do think that it is quite important to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number, but if our instincts about what is morally right can be flawed in some cases, why can't our feeling that the greatest good is important be flawed too (and even though we reason to it, the value we put on the greatest good is still an instinct)? Not that Greene is wrong to put value on it, but I came away thinking that he wanted it both ways: intuitions can be trusted when they validate our calculations, but they're probably wrong when they don't.Anyway, aside from my general misgivings about Greene's conclusion (or at least his defense of it), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Greene's research on the neural basis of moral thinking is intriguing, original, and does a service to moral philosophy. And here, he writes a clear and well-written explanation of those and a larger moral case he draws from it.

"I will say it very directly: this device is of superb quality, especially considering the price. You can see the specs above these reviews (where amazon usually lists them), so I won't cover that. Rather, I will cover those things that make this device an OUTSTANDING value for the price.First, let's just go with the Chromebook concept, which some like and others dislike. I love the idea largely because every computer I've owned, since it has a lot of software, takes a long time to boot, gets progressively slower with each new download or install, and requires periodic maintenance to de-clutter. Not so with this: it boots in 10 or fewer seconds, and since there is no software on the device except for the small OS (a file manager and a web browser, really), you don't have to worry about your computer slowing down. And for those who want software on their device, ask yourself (as I asked myself): how much time do you really do stuff offline? IF you didn't have an internet connection, how much time would you really spend using your computer? And if still unconvinced, ask yourself whether the trade-off of a slower, heavier, and energy-sucking computer is h it to you.Now what about this Chromebook. Well, it beats the Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) in a few ways: connectivity, screen, and keyboard. (It is SLIGHTLY lighter at 2.2 rather than 2.6 pounds, but I don't see that as a huge advantage.) The screen is brighter, and while it is not the matte screen of the Samsung, the trade-off is that the screen is brighter (the matte seemed to dull the color a bit).The keyboard is easily - EASILY - the best small-device keyboard I've typed on; while the Samsung was good, this keyboard is a bit ""springier"" and responsive in a tactile way. (I used to have a netbook way back yonder, and the keyboard was positively awful. This review is being typed on my HP Chromebook, and I have not experienced anywhere near THAT level of frustration.) The only thing that is hard to get used to is the  lack of ""function"" keys and, more importantly, the lack of a caps lock key (which is now a 'search' key that pulls up your app list.)Connectivity? Well, let's just say that my Samsung had serious connectivity issues. While it was most probably a defective unit, any google search of ""Samsung Chromebook connectivity issues"" will quickly show you that MANY other people have the same problem. This device, so far, has always found my wi-fi signal, never kicked me off of it, and 'holds onto' even relatively weak wi-fi signals.The last thing worth mentioning about this device is that it is just darn nice looking. I have the white device with blue 'highlights' (the 'highlights' are on a rubberized bottom, perfect for keeping the device secure on a desk, and a little tasteful 'ring' around the keyboard.) The device, like the Samsung, is made of plastics, but it absolutely does not feel cheap. Instead, it is very solid in the hands and just feels great to pick up, especially compared to my 'regular' clunker of a laptop.Long and short, if you at all like the idea of a Chromebook - and as a second device, it does everything most people would need it to do INCLUDING offline google docs and gmail editing - this is the device you should consider. There is a 14 inch model that has a better battery life (advertised as eight hours, where this one is about six), but it is a bit more expensive and quite a bit heavier. I am sold on the idea of a Chromebook, and so far, this is a purchase I absolutely do not regret.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTF27A9P1VG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJXVRM8#wasThisHelpful","R1JTF27A9P1VG2","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a Samsung Chromebook. I want to like this device, and am completely sold on the idea of a computer that doesn't require downloading programs that slow the computer down over time, etc.But alas, I can't review it, because every five minutes, this device built around wi-fi kicks me off of my wi-fi network. No other device in my house does this. Lo and behold, when I search google with keywords like ""Samsung chromebook connectivity issues"" there are a slew of Google group chats from people who have precisely this problem... and no one seems to be able to resolve it. I have tried a myriad of their suggestions on what might resolve the problem (from retooling my wi-fi to playing with my Chromebook's advanced settings... so much for the computer that just works!) to no avail. I wish I could say that I just have a defective unit, but I don't know... because no one from Google has ever contacted me back from my customer service request.Meanwhile, my device just sits there, because it can't really do anything offline... at least, not when I only have five minutes at a shot to download offline apps (and it is even money whether the machine will disconnect when I do that.)If you were partly sold on the Chromebook because it is a device that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, just keep this little story in mind and ask whether you want to roll the dice.

"About two years ago, I gave up coffee completely and switched to black tea. As such, I like full-bodied teas, which is why I tend to like pyramid bags over 'traditional' tea bags. (I prefer loose tea, but when I need tea bags, pyramids are the closest thing to loose tea.)The idea behind the pyramid bag is that, unlike 'traditional' tea bags, there is room for the tea leaves to expand, which means that the leaves are steeped a bit more fully into the water, resulting in a fuller bodied flavor. But here is the problem: the Lipton tea 'leaves' in these pyramid bags are the same small coffee-ground-esque buds you find in the 'traditional' tea bags. So, even though there is room for the leaves to expand, the leaves just aren't big enough to expand. (After steeping one of these Lipton bags and finding no real difference in fullness between it and a more 'traditional' Lipton tea bag, I cut one of each open to compare the size of the leaves; they are virtually the same.)So, really, this is the same old mono-dimensional wine in new bottles. I was hoping that the Lipton pyramid bags would have better tea in them, but alas, it is the same tea that you find in the traditional bags. And that means that the entire point of the pyramid bag - meant for leaves sized to expand - are basically superfluous and don't perform any real function.If you want any kind of full-bodied flavor - or at least something different from the 'traditional' Lipton teabags - you WILL be disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIC1AFEJIN3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUQDIFA#wasThisHelpful","RVIC1AFEJIN3T","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New discoveries often breed hubris, and the happenings in the field (and related subfields of) neuroscience are no exception. Armed with fMRI scans, neuroscientists are becoming better able to show what brain activity correlates with what 'thought' activity, that this is indeed a good thing for increasing knowledge about how humans operate. But some over-eager neuroscientists are claiming that these developments can explain why people commit crimes, their buying habits, explain not only how we make moral judgements but what judgements are morally correct, and even undermine the idea of free will itself.Psychiatrist Sally Satel and psychologist Scott Lillenfeld wrote this book to proverbially separate the what from the chaff - to discard the unjustified and overreaching hubris of some neuroscientists from the legitimate work of neuroscience. Just because neuroscience is doing great work to help us find out what brain areas seem to correlate with what mental activity does not mean that neuromarketers are justified in suggesting that neuroscience is well suited for getting us to buy certain products, or scholars of 'neurolaw,' in suggesting that brain scans can or should be used as mitigating factors in criminal cases.The first chapter is where we get the most bang for he buck. Satel and Lillenfeld broadly go over what fMRI scanning and, what it does, and what it doesn't do. This gives way to some broad critiques of those who go beyond what fMRI data supports. Put simply, brain researchers have subjects (usually undergraduates at universities, which alone possibly limits the potential generalizability) doing particular tasks while ""pictures"" are taken of activity in the brain. While this is indeed useful and produces some interesting knowledge, there are some criticisms. First, contra how many magazine headlines report it, correlation of brain activity to other activity (x area of the brain lights up when I raise my right hand to grab a pencil) does NOT mean a causal relationship (x brain area causes the hand movement). Second, different areas of the brain are seemingly responsible for MANY different functions (is x area responsible for my raising my hand, my thinking about the pencil and its spatial location, or something else?). There are some other interesting criticisms in this chapter, such as some questions about how some of these studies are designed that may unintentionally skew results.The rest of the chapters essentially apply these (and other) criticisms to different areas: neuromarketing, neurolaw, what neuroscience can('t) tel us about free will, etc. As for neuromarketing (where companies hire firms to use brain research to help craft products and ads that will best resonate with the brain), the authors bring up several interesting points. First, it just hasn't been shown that because we know what brain regions are activated by what stimuli, that this gives us any real information (remembering that brain regions are often responsible for several different 'tasks,' such that when x lights up, we don't per se know what 'task' it is fulfilling). Second, even if neuromarketing could produce evidence that it tells us something meaningful, does it tell us anything we couldn't actually get from other means? (Neuromarketers will tell us that the brain often performs in ways hidden from consciousness, and that this means it's info is superior to that of focus group and survey data. But the authors note that except for 'impulse buys,' we DO consciously deliberate about what to buy, and many other factors determine our decisions than the product or advertisement itself.)What about what neuroscience can tell us about law and the very idea of free will? For me this was both the most philosophically interesting and disappointing section. The authors focus most on applying some of their chapter 1 criticisms, such as the idea that because a brain area appears damaged (such that the individual's x area doesn't function 'normally') that just doesn't tell us anything about whether they had a choice in whether to commit a crime. (Think of the often cited case of the man who noticed an increasing urge to rape, only to find that there was a cyst impeding on his amygdala; when it was removed, the urges stopped, until he later returned to the police commplaining of the urge to rape again. Upon examination, the cyst had grown back. While this is often taken as evidence of how neuroscience impedes choice, the authors note that the man VOLUNTARILY went to the police station afraid he might rape again, meaning that on some level, the cyst did not abolish choice.) But this section was also a bit disappointing, largely because some of the authors' criticisms are irrelevant to the neuroscientific arguments. (THe authors argue that the human intuition to seek retributive justice even when neuroscience shows us that the criminal may not be consciously 'responsible' for the action. Yes, but neuroscientists will respond that our intuitions are irrelevant if the scientific facts show that they are wrong!)I also really wish that the authors had discussed two popular areas where neuroscience (in my view, wrongly) impedes: education and morality. Sam Harris's recent book The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values argues that neuroscience can help us 'determine moral values' - and not just how we arrive at moral values, but what values are the correct ones and how we should decide moral questions. (For those who have not read it, Harris does not get around the classic division between facts and values; even if we have all the facts in the world, there is still a non-factual leap required to determine what ought to be the case.) And 'brain-based learning' proponents like Eric Jensen Teaching with the Brain in Mind, Revised 2nd Edition are convinced that if teachers understood more basic neuroscience, they would be able to teach students better. (Yes, students have brains, but brain-bseed research largely seems to consist of telling us what we already know from, you know, observing student behavior and psychology.) These are both areas where neuroscientists are increasingly hubristic, and I think many of the authors' criticisms apply well to these areas.All in all, this is a good book, particularly for those with a sneaking suspicion that while neuroscience is a very valuable field, it breeds a tendency toward over-eagerness among acolytes. Like the authors, I admire the field of neuroscience and believe that it is and will help us better understand the human brain and human condition. But I don't think - at least where it is now - that it tells us all that some think it does. Very well done book.

"I read Paul Bloom's Descartes' Baby: How The Science Of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human some years ago and found it an intriguing and persuasive read. This book in some ways picks up where that one left off. Descartes' Baby had the thesis that babies are born in some sense 'hardwired' for things like a very basic understanding of physics, like that objects have some sort of physical permanence and that objects that go up will come down. This book, cataloguing a host of intriguing studies, argues that babies are 'hardwired' for certain basic moral sentiments (a basic sense of justice, fairness, etc).For instance, in some studies, infants and toddlers will 'help' a stranger by pushing a ball back to the stranger or helping a stranger by reaching for an object the stranger seems to want. In other studies, babies are shown a puppet show with two sets of puppets; in one, the puppets help each other, and in the other, one puppet does not help the other. When given a choice, Bloom reports that a statistically significant number of infants and toddlers choose to play with the helping puppet rather than the non-helping puppet.Bloom's chapters range from exploring infants' and toddlers' sense of justice (little egalitarians, they tend to be), their sense of empathy (they generally prefer to help others, but this desire increases with age), whether their 'moral sentiments' change when dealing with members of their family or those who look like them, their sense of disgust (both moral and physical), etc. But here is where my mild complaint about Bloom's book starts. While I found the entire book well written and attention-holding, a good half of the book really is not about the moral sense of babies at all, but about what evolutionary accounts there are to humans' moral sense in general. For instance, the chapter on humans' sense of disgust was about 7/8ths a rumination on why humans have a sense of disgust and how much is cultural versus biological, and really only briefly mentioning a few studies about babies' sense of disgust interspersed throughout. Same with the chapter on humans' seemingly innate preference for members of the in-group (those who look like they do or share something in common with them): a few studies having to do with children - of many ages, not just babies - and the rest, theorizing about why we have these biases.Not that this detracts from the book's interest... if exploring the world of moral psychology in general is your thing. But I do worry that Bloom strays a bit far from what the book is supposed to be about: babies and what kind of innate moral sense they have. Otherwise, the book is a very interesting survey of existing literature (with citations at the end for further reading!) on the world of moral psychology (with SOME emphasis on the moral psychology of babies).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFJ7D1K842ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886840#wasThisHelpful","RRFJ7D1K842ME","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Owens was a bad teacher... at least according to his supervisor at a NYC charter-esque school. This is both his adventure of his brief tenure (less than one year) at ""Latinate Academy,"" and an argument about how hard teaching is and how wrong it is for politicians, pundits, and the general population to blame teachers - rather than elements of the system they work in - for poorly performing schools.I must say - as a former high school special educator - that my eyes were very much glued to this book. I was a teacher for two years and an instructional assistant (teacher's aid) before that for two years. And Owens's experience overlaps pretty well with mine - going into work day after day trying to do one's job given some very lofty goals, very little time to get them done, and virtually no support from administrations who care mostly about the schools numbers appearing good enough to justify their own jobs. Students are often passed on grade to grade in order to make schools' numbers look good, leaving teachers to teach students who are often ill-equipped for the subjects they are teaching and must get students to pass on frequent standardized tests. Given this, when behavior problems understandably arise, administrators will often make it known not only that teachers are to deal with these in-house (while still trying to teach the other students in class), but (often indirectly) that behavioral problems are just the result of bad teaching. So, despite teaching several classes per day and having to grade homeworks, plan lessons, and enter data on evenings and weekends, teachers often go into school with a sense that no matter how well they do, every day is a steep uphill climb.Owens makes this come alive. It is CLEAR that he really enjoyed his students, and doesn't blame them for the situations they are put into. In other words, this is not a book about how horrible kids are today, how this generation is the 'dumbest generation,' or anything like that. It is a book meant to show how even the purest-hearted and most diligent of teachers can hardly avoid seeming to fail in a system where they are given little discretion, a hell of a lot to do, expectations that get higher all the time, and very little support from administrators.Two negatives: first, perhaps Owens is NOT the right person to make this case, especially to those not already convinced. As he lasted less than a year (rightly or wrongly) I suspect that there are some who will too easily dismiss him as a novice, and it is widely reported that the learning curve for teachers is about two years: the first two years are often nightmarish and after that, teachers start to really get the hang of it. Second, while Owens does not want(us) to blame teachers for schools' failing, his story does SLIGHTLY contradict that message, given that some key figures in his book were subsequently caught padding data to make it look better tahn it was, and generally cheating kids in order to make themselves look better and advance their careers. Granted, these teachers (and administrators, who often started as teachers) are in the minority, but it will cause readers to rightly suspect that there really are SOME bad teachers out there.Otherwise, I liked this book a lot. Those who have not been teachers really should read this, the next best thing to trying the actual profession out for a while. And while I disagree a bit on the author's anti-school-choice bias (no, no one believes it would be a cure-all, so that is a red herring), I think his case that the problem is less the teachers in the system than the current state of the system itself is well-taken and needs to be heard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JJ76T2AQCBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQC94YM#wasThisHelpful","R31JJ76T2AQCBA","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two schools of thought about human rationality: the economics profession models humans as rational calculators, and the behavioral psychologists (in books like Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions) model humans as decidedly irrational. Both, say the authors of ""The Rational Animal,"" are partly right and mostly wrong. To a large degree, humans do make decisions based on weighing costs and benefits, and humans do have many ""blindspot"" areas where their decisions are often less than rational.But instead of asking whether we are or are not rational, these authors use evolutionary psychology to show that, given our evolved brains, many of the areas where humans look irrational exhibit a hidden rationality. So, several behavioral economic studies show that humans have a loss aversion: we value things higher when we are faced with losing what we possess than when gaining them for the first time. (In concrete terms, we will pay a lower cost to attain a thing than we would to give it up once we have it.)The authors would respond to this above tendency as follows; we have several 'evolutionary selves' - mate attractor, survival expert, social networker, parent, etc - and each of these serves an evolutionary function and has slightly different preferences. So - and this is verified in studies the authors rehearse - when our 'mate attractor' self is primed (by having people look at pictures of attractive members of the opposite sex - we exhibit less risk aversion and are more aggressive in the amount of risk we often take. But when our 'parenting' selves are primed - by having people read stories about happy families - we become more 'conservative' in our riskiness behavior. (This, because in evolutionary terms, attracting mates often requires taking risks while raising successful offspring often requires more stability and less risk.)So in this and other areas, some of our seemingly irrational tendencies have a deep rationality to them (those who raised successful offspring were less risky, and their loss aversion helped them survive. So, when we are loss averse, we are doing what made sense for our ancestors.)Here is my big problem with this admittedly very interesting book. I am not sure the authors are saying anything that most economists (on the one side) and behavioral psychologists (on the other) would really object to. When economists model humans as wholly rational actors, it is WIDELY known among economists that this is a model valued for its simplicity, not its descriptive accuracy. (There are only a few more extreme economists who take this model as an accurate description.) And conversely, behavioral psychologists who say that many human behaviors are irrational, they mean irrational according to the standard of making the decision that makes the most rational sense given the context in which the decision is made. In fact, Dan Ariely's big selling book on why humans are often irrational is called ""PREDICTABLY Irratioanl"" and has a subtitle about what the 'hidden forces' (often, the evolutionary forces) that create those blind-spots in human rationality.So, what this book does is gives us a good, plain-English survey of evolutionary psychology and how it helped shape current thought processes that often appear irrational (ironically, something similar to what Ariely does in the book these authors treat as a foil). What this book is not is an argument for anything new. The only reason it might seem novel is because the authors do not represent the present state of economics or behavioral psychology very accurately.Still worth three stars for being really interesting, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85HD2OI3IQZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKRW52S#wasThisHelpful","R85HD2OI3IQZ6","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently offered a promotional copy of Office 365 to review for Amazon and I eagerly accepted. I am a Linux user and I have heard that, where Linux cannot install Microsoft Office, Office 365 comes with Office On Demand, a web-based application of the full MS Office Suite. (For the record, I am quite happy using LibreOffice instead of MS Office, but have many occasions where I need to create on MS Office in order to collaborate with others. So, I was excited: the ability to work on MS Office on the web on my Linux machine?Linux users beware, Office On Demand does not work on Linux machines - even though it is web-based - because it requires the download of a client that only works on Windows and Mac. (To my knowledge, WINE cannot bypass this.)So, what does the Linux user get for the Office 365 University subscription? Basically, 20GB worth of storage on a cloud word processing app (Skydrive) that anyone whose used Google Drive for five seconds would recognize as vastly inferior.I will go further and suggest that WINDOWS USERS WHO HAVE OFFICE DO NOT NEED OFFICE 365.

"Alison Wolf's book about women in the late 20th and 21st century, The XX Factor, bears both good news and (what some would consider) bad. The good news? Many, and the most important, gaps in achievement and opportunity between women and men have disappeared. Somewhat controversially, I'm sure, Wolf presents a bevy of statistics to show that things like the wage gap between women and men has virtually disappeared (when we adjust for things like hours spent working and type of career). Women in careers where there used to be noticeable ""glass ceilings"" (finance, business) do not appear to have them any more. And when it comes to college attendance and degrees earned, women have been outstripping men for years.But the bad news: all of this equality is leaving noticeable gaps between upper and middle class women, and poorer women. Upper income women have largely been the beneficiaries of the women's movement(s) and the emphasis on choice, because these women are the ones who have resources to take advantage of things like increased educational opportunity. Poorer women, on the other hand, are having more children earlier, taking either lower wage jobs or traditionally-female-heavy jobs like daycare, teaching, and social work (that are lower paying on the whole, or have fewer chances of advancement. In fact, as a criticism, I'd have liked to see some discussion about whether some of these inequalities - like, choice of man women to enter lower-paying 'caring professions' are likely make in a fully deliberate way, or may be due to perceived or real lack of choices, and whether inequality that is arrived at by differences in deliberate choice are problematic.)So, the upside is that the goal of equal opportunity for women seem to have largely been achieved, at least as borne out by Wolf's lengthy statistical analysis. But the downside is that the inequality has manifested in the different choices women in different income groups make, either with full deliberation or because some women don't have the options others have.Stylistically, readers should be 'warned' that while this book is fascinating (chapters exploring everything from whether women really do more labor around the house compared to men to differences in how 'rich' and 'poor' women approach romance), it is very statistic-heavy. Wolf not only asserts and argues from anecdotes, but summarizes A TON of statistical literature on each subject, which bolsters her case, but also makes for (what some would call) dry reading. Another thing I think could or should have been made clearer is the author's actual thesis - which comes out much clearer in my review than in her book; she doesn't very explicitly pull all of her separate threads together into an outright argument. That may have been a deliberate choice to keep the book more of an objective survey of literature, but her conclusions are sure to be controversial enough to warrant arguing a more explicit 'thesis.'I really enjoyed this book, mostly because it bears a lot of good news for those of us who care about equality of opportunity regardless of sex. Whether many of the inequalities between women are problematic, and subtract from this good news, may well be a matter of whether the inequalities are arrived at by differences in choice or by some lacking options that others have. But it is always healthy to take the good news with the bad, and anyone wishing to take stock of what women's rights movements - both in developed and under-developed countries - have yielded (so far).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTDZZJ03NSN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307590402#wasThisHelpful","R3FTDZZJ03NSN7","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Situated in working-class Levittown, Pennsylvania is a high school drama program so successful that it routinely wins national accolades and attracts Broadway directors to see its productions. At the heart of this program is drama director (and former English teacher) Lou Volpe. When journalist Michael Sokolove was invited to give a graduation speech at his alma mater of Truman High (where he took Volpe's English classes), he decided to write about Volpe and Truman's drama program - what makes him and it so special, how it maintains excellence every year, how it changes the lives of its participants.This is a year in the life of the Truman drama program. Volpe and company are putting together a production of an edgy and controversial work, Good Boys and True (exploring themes of homosexuality, teen sex, etc). We not only get to know Lou Volpe and members of the Truman drama program, but the dedicated students (who really aren't the 'typical' drama students) who make the program go. Sokolove not only tells the story of how this production comes together, but, through in-depth interviews, paints a picture of each player and what the drama program means to them. What emerges is a program that challenges students to know and push themselves through acting.I will tell you that I had a hard time putting this book down. And it is not because of an intense plot - the book reads more like a character study that meanders from narrative accounts of rehearsals to biographies of participants to musings on arts programs in an age of standardized testing. Through all this meandering, what sustained my interest is Sokoloe's ability to get at the 'soul' of this drama program and how it affects students, and the pleasure of getting to know that such a program exists for students... somewhere. In an age of emphasis on standardized testing and all things human capital in American schools, Sokolove gives us a really inspiring story of how educational well-run drama (and probably other arts) programs can be. This is a truly inspiring story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L50NAF73ZP43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594488223#wasThisHelpful","R1L50NAF73ZP43","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Markets can't cater to the poor. Markets in education are motivated only by profits, not by concern for education. Private companies will work in education only by selecting the best students and ousting the others.These are some of the common objections heard to markets in education. Just like he did in The Beautiful Tree: A Personal Journey Into How the World's Poorest People Are Educating Themselves, James Tooley gives us more evidence that calls some of these into question. Here, his focus is entirely on one global education company: SABIS International Schools Network. The SABIS company grew from a school founded in the late 19th century in Lebanon as a private girls school (when girls didn't generally go to school), SABIS gradually expanded into a brand of schools represented everywhere from Kurdistan and the United Arab Emirates to England and the US. And they tend to open in areas - like post-Katrina New Orleans - that caters to what most would call ""at risk"" (or at very least, poor) students.Using a mix of interviews with central figures in the SABIS history, trips to various SABIS schools, and access to archives, Tooley tells us about the history, the pedagogical methods (which eschew many ideas at work in current public schools, like individualized instruction), and their results. SABIS students undergo, for instance, testing schedule that may well be more rigorous than in US public schools with one very key difference: the SABIS tests are formative, rather than summative: designed to really figure out what students are and aren't soaking up in order to figure out what instruction should come next. And with this and other methods, SABIS students have experienced marked success as measured by standardized tests...results that become more impressive when we factor in the student populations they tend to serve.While Tooley documents SABIS successes, he also documents some of their failures, particularly some attempts to start charter schools in the US. Despite having a proven record of success in a range of locations, starting charter schools (schools that run privately, but receive public money as part of the public school system) often meet with fierce local and national opposition, often motivated by concern that private schools run by for-profit companies are not likely to offer a good quality education. SABIS however, remains steadfastly for-profit, and Tooley devotes a chapter to explaining why they made and make this choice, which largely has to do with the idea that not seeking profit limits their ability to grow as a company (similar to the arguments made in Uncharitable: How Restraints on Nonprofits Undermine Their Potential (Civil Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives).For me, the SABIS story fits in well with contemporary work on the idea of conscious capitalism (Be the Solution: How Entrepreneurs and Conscious Capitalists Can Solve All the Worlds Problems and markets that serve the poor and disenfranchised (The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Revised and Updated 5th Anniversary Edition. By seeking profit, SABIS turns what could be charity (or a clunky government enterprise) into a positive sum situation where they, do well by doing good for others. It is sustainable, it is proven effective, and it is innovative. Critics might wonder whether the SABIS model (in all its painstaking detail) is scalable and whether its very standardized approach to schooling avoids the problems of standardization within current public ed models. But anyone who wants to see what markets and for-profit companies are capable of in the are of education needs to read this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QI0QDQINLVKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FR6Z8G#wasThisHelpful","R2QI0QDQINLVKH","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Caring Democracy, Joan Tronto is concerned with how we allocate care services (and care for others generally) in society. Despite professed gender and sex equality, women bear the brunt of care work (teaching students, care for the elderly, care for the vulnerable), men are often not recognized as capable of giving and receiving care, and we tend only to care for those very close to us (or if for others, we do it in the context of markets where service is paid for). This, Tronto suggests is a problem. Correspondingly, and she suspects, relatedly, there is a marked apathy toward civic participation in American society. Maybe we are just becoming disconnected from each other and, by effect, care services get relegated to low paid labor and people find more excuses not to form caring relations with others.Tronto's book is an exposition of how we might use some sort of deliberative democracy to alleviate this problem - to regain our concern for and connection with others and to democratically allocate caring services in a just way where we all recognize our potential to be care givers and -receivers.My big problem with the book is that I cannot quite figure out how Tronto's solution is actually better than the problem she points out. Partly, this is because if the problem is that caring services are, to some degree, forced onto people who have little choice but to take them - either women who've traditionally had no other option to but be 'home maker' or low wage workers - I don't see how allocating caring services in a democratic way would not result in the same kind of dilemma: if a majority - even after a reasoned discussion - wants to allocate care on a minority, how is this better?The reason I think Tronto believes it will be better is because I think she overestimates democracy and badly caricatures markets. Tronto talks about the importance of democratic deliberation most often with the assumption that the democrats share her values (equality of the sexes, inclusion of all in deliberation, etc) and are all quite engaged. In reality, democracies don't generally work this way. Quite a bit of literature documents that democracy is more often marked by low participation, dialogue that is often more polarizing than unifying, and special interest politics. (See The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (New Edition) and Selling Out America's Democracy: How Lobbyists, Special Interests, and Campaign Financing Undermine the Will of the People for just two sources. Most of the ""public choice"" economic literature tells the same story.) Tronto recognizes these possibilities occasionally, but assumes that in the absence of markets, people will just behave better, becoming more civic minded, informed, and reasonable.Tronto also mischaracterizes markets and what they entail very badly. Markets, she tells us, can only be defended if one believes that humans are exlusively or primarily self-interested calculators operating under conditions of perfect knowledge. Of course, Tronto points out that neither of these describe the actual world, but she'd be surprised perhaps to know that even some of the most ardent champions of markets (and most market-oriented economists) argue the same. In fact, most defenses of markets use almost opposite reasoning: since perfect knowledge doesn't exist, this is all the more reason to distrust governmental solutions that also suffer from that knowledge problem.. even if they are 'democratic.'  (see Individualism and Economic Order and  Robust Political Economy: Classical Liberalism and the Future of Public Policy (New Thinking in Political Economy Series)). Markets, Tronto also writes, are unequal in that they tend to favor the well-off over the less-well-off. Well, research shows that deliberative democracy suffers from basically the same problem, favoring the better-organized, more persuasive and articulate, and most assertive....who tend to be the better off. (See The Other Invisible Hand: Delivering Public Services through Choice and Competition on this point). Nor are markets any less voluntary than forcing the results of majority decisions onto minorities. (At least in markets, leaving a particular role as consumer or producer is a POSSIBILITY.)In the end, I believe Tronto fails to make her case that deliberative democratic allocations of care would fare any better than market (or private) allocations. Some people don't have a choice in the private sector? Others won't have a choice under a democratic decision making process. Markets corrupt caring by turning it into something done for money? The only option that wouldn't is allowing care work to be done ONLY voluntarily: yes, governments pay public school teachers just like schools pay private school teachers. Markets lead to potentially exploitative relations? So do social situations where individuals must abide by whatever allocations the deliberating majority chooses and have no exit options. To be convinced of Tronto's case would involve painting democracy in its most ideal form and markets in their worst possible form.Maybe neither of those assumptions is justified. If not, Tronto doesn't make her case.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQQE2XF2SFWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDQ5I8S#wasThisHelpful","RMQQE2XF2SFWA","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drug dealers, sex workers, gypsy cab drivers, under-the-table nanny services. These are areas of the American market that we don't consider when we tabulate GDP. But they are vibrant markets, and markets just like any other, so according to sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh. And just like he did in the critically acclaimed Gang Leader for a Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets, he has sought to understand the people who buy and sell (mostly the latter) in these markets: what are their motivations, what are their business practices, how do they think about what they do?The Floating City is written in an engaging ethnographic (narrative) form, where Venkatesh hangs out among those working in the sex industry (prostitutes, brokers, a few clients), the drug trade (primarily one popular drug dealer), and a few other industries to find out about their lives. Shine, an established drug dealer in New York, is looking to expand his market with a new drug for a new and more ""upscale"" audience. Margot is a middle-aged broker for sex workers (the less kind word, of course, is ""pimp,"" but Margot does much more than most pimps, including counseling about money management) who is preparing for her future; Analise is the young woman trying to get into Margot's business. Vanketesh tells the story of these and other characters in New York City's vibrant black markets.Interestingly, we also get a significant amount of Venkatesh's own story. We find out, for instance, about his struggles to meet new people (er...research subjects) in New York, a city very different from his previous Chicago. Also, we get a glimpse of how a ""rogue sociologist"" manages - or mismanages? - to keep his professional life separate from his personal life when dealing with prostitutes and drug dealers during the day, but a wife at home. As I am an aspiring academic, I found a lot of interest in Venkatesh's writing about how he struggles with generating and growing his research questions: what do I want to know about these people, and now that i know some of that, what are the remaining or new questions.While this book doesn't make too many arguments, there are some key takeaways. First, these black markets may take place under the radar, but they are markets very much like legal ones, but with their own peculiarities (often stemming from their illegality). Transactions take place on trust, entrepreneurs try to find their niche and grow their markets, and the most savvy do their market research before making any big moves. The second takeaway: as Venkatesh is fascinated in this book by finding out the similarities and differences between the black markets amongst the disenfranchised and black markets amongst the wealthy (crack versus powdered coke, cheap motel prostitutes versus posh escorts), Venkatesh found a slight difference in how each talk about what they do. the former group talks about doing what they have to do to climb the ladder, and the latter talk of the kick they get from flouting social conventions. In other words, the former do it because they have to, the latter do it because they want to, and both find a way to one might say) ratioanllize why they do what they do.But a formal sociology book, this is not. Venkatesh is a great writer and the book reads more like a a work of journalism than a stuffy ""ethnography."" To me, the best part is that Venkatesh writes in a way that seeks to understand and even relate to, rather than in a way that treats his subjects as victims who know not what they do. One can see quite easily why his ""subjects,"" who probably don't talk to many people, talk to him so freely.Anyone wanting to understand those secret markets that keep some of our other markets afloat should really read The Floating City. You will just never see New York City, or crime, again in the same way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZWFY551TQT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204160#wasThisHelpful","R27ZWFY551TQT2","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why? Well, of course, they only send you one sheet.

This is a big problem because the protector is actually quite difficult to affix; first, you have to make sure to line up the ""n"" button with the corresponding cut out on the screen protector, but once you do that, odds are that another part of the screen protector has already touched the screen; at least that's what happened to me.

"When I first got a Kindle (generation 1, in early 2008), Amazon advertised the heck out of their $9.99 price for most books. It was a huge selling point, because other ebook sellers (Sony, Barnes and Noble) were selling at higher prices. I fell out of love with the Kindle (for other reasons than book pricing) and got a Nook, accepting the slight rise in book costs. So, I didn't pay attention to the legal rumblings I occasionally heard about. Then, one day, Barnes and Noble sent me a notification that, per the result of an anti-trust suit launched against publishers, I was being credited for ebook prices that were the result of collusion by the major publishers.That was really all I knew.This very short but informative book fills in the remaining details. The long and the short is that, by the time Apple decided to launch an ebook platform for their first release of the ipad, the main six publishers were not happy with the wholesale model where they sold to Amazon and Amazon charged whatever price they wanted, largely because they feared that in the long run, it would bring down prices of books and limit their own future profitability, and that Amazon would grow to dominate the market such that they might start publishing directly. Apple proposed that the they and the publishers deal instead on an agency model, where publishers set the ebook price (within certain Apple-defined limits) and give Apple a 30% profit on each book sold at that price. But here's where it got dicey; Apple informally told each publisher that they must agree to only operate with Amazon if they accept the agency model.This short book is a blow-by-blow account of the lead up to the legal war and (surprisingly quick) legal war itself. While it is interesting in and of itself, there is really no editorializing on the story, which does leave the reader wondering why, other than hearing an interesting story, they read this book. Is there a ""moral"" to this story? Was there an aftermath to the story? And what might this story mean for the future of ebook sales?This leads to my next complaint: the book really reads as written in haste. Most of the book focuses on the run up to the legal battle, exploring the tense relations between publishers and Amazon, exploring the genesis of Apple's strategy, and the negotiations between the publishers and Apple and Amazon respectively. The legal battle, by comparison, is given very short shrift and I would bet that the book was basically written right after (or during and after) the legal battle; that's how short that latter section is. And there is NOTHING exploring the aftermath of the antitrust case or what all of this may mean for the future of publishing. The book literally stops at the very end of the antitrust case.Interesting read that fills in a backstory I was always fuzzy on.

"Dan Palotta has devoted his life to helping others through several non-profit charities, particularly geared toward funding AIDS related causes. Over this long career, Palotta became frustrated at every turn at the different rules people expect for-profit and non-profit companies to play by. For-profit companies are allowed to invest money in advertising and expansion for the future, are allowed to spend money paying employees in order to attract and keep talent, and are not expected to put all of their money directly toward commodity production. Non-profits, on the other hand, are expected to pay workers poorly and not invest in infrastructure for the future or advertising, all because the money is supposed to go directly to those in need.Uncharitable is Palotta's attempted explanation of why it makes complete sense to think about non-profits the way we think of profit-making companies; no one expects profit-making companies to squeeze every dollar into commodity production, because it is understood that advertising, investment in infrastructure, and offering competitive salaries aid the company's mission every bit as well as producing the widgets. Yet, no one seems to be fine with allowing non-profits to do anything but put all of their money into direct aid, which means sacrificing the kind of expansion that for-profit companies can achieve.I found the first chapters of this book to be the best by far, where Palotta addresses the obvious concerns that markets play on self-interest, where non-profits are supposed to operate from altruism. Rightly, Palotta suggests that this is a dangerously false dichotomy we hold. Doing for others isn't positively correlated with the degree of self-sacrifice we make. (It is not as if the impact of my doing for others hinges on the degree to which I deny myself.) And as long as we allow that people can be interested in helping others (and feel good doing it), behavior oriented toward helping others can be behavior that nourishes, rather than sacrifices, the self. (Palotta gives a too-abbreviated, but interesting, discussion on how the idea that doing for others requires self-sacrifice was something we likely influenced from the Puritans. I suspect it is older than that.)Palotta also aims to convince us why we should allow non-profits to advertise, pay competitively, and invest in infrastructure in the same way for-profits do. As to the second of these, the theory is that offering high pay attracts people primarily motivated by money, not ""the cause."" Restricting the amount non-profits pay might help them hire some altruists, it is true; but more than not, it leads to hiring people with few other job prospects (and even altruists get tired of working long hours for low pay!). As to the third point above, it seems pretty obvious that for-profits invest in infrastructure because they value long-term growth and know that infrastructure is a way to help secure it. Yet, people scoff when non-profits hold events that have relatively high overhead, purchase good equipment rather than cheap equipment, etc. But, Palotta argues, disallowing this sort of thinking-toward-the-future for non-profits only limits their future growth potential, not something people should want if they care about doing good in the future as well as the present.Now for my two criticisms. First, this book probably could have been 75 pages less and still contained the same argumentative force. It reads like a 75 page essay that employs a lot of repetition in order to get more pages. And for all of that, my second criticism is that Palotta doesn't really address how one could convince donors to give money to a charity that is planning on spending a good percentage of that money on advertising, infrastructure, and paying employees handsomely. I don't think Palotta's idea is wrong at all, but I just worry that people do not want to donate if they know the CEO is getting paid in the upper six figures. And Palotta didn't really convince me that there is a way around this. Instead, he repeated his main points again. Hopefully the next edition will include a bit more by way of persuasion toward the skeptic who wonders whether people will donate to a cause not much of their actual money will go to.All in all, though, Palotta's message is super-important. For those who care about helping others through charity and non-profits, it is time for us to consider using the power of market capitalism to do as much good as we possibly can. And it is time for those not on board to face Palotta's arguments and explain why restricting non-profits to relative subsistence rather than allowing them to use market forces to expand their scope does more good than harm. Palotta goes a long way toward explaining that these well meaning ""anti-capitalists"" are just wrong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVAW70GG3Z4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584659556#wasThisHelpful","R3SVAW70GG3Z4M","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the story of Jacob Asprey, Jr., mid-twenty-something son of a con-artist, and his attempt to pick up the pieces that his father shattered. At one point, Jake was in college, but all of that changed when his father went to prison (for fraud and other things) and some of Jake Sr.'s debts became his son's. Now, he is working a somewhat crappy lifeguard job and living with his uncle. He works with a former sweetheart who left him when she found out his father was a con-artist.Jake is down on his luck...until a proposition comes to him from some former friends of his father's; help them steak something (what, we don't know until late in the book) from his employer and he will be made well. It sounds good, but Jake (a) wants to move on from his father and everyone associated with him, and (b) this theft requires that he steal from his ex-girlfriend, who he still loves.This is How You Fall is not quite a thriller, and is not quite a work of ""literary fiction."" It tries to be a bit of both, though I think it succeeds more in the latter. What I did like about it was the story line, which is slow moving but quick enough moving to hold an eager reader's interest.What I didn't like - hence the deduction of two stars - is that the main character of Jake Asprey is entirely one dimensional and repetitive. I didn't count, but I have to think that three quarters of his inner thoughts that we are privy to deal with him feeling very sorry for himself about his father. It got to the point where, in the latter half of the book, I skimmed past all the predictable internal monologue (because I knew what it was about from the book's first half) and read only the action.Oh, and while the book is sort of interesting as a character study, those who expect a big ending (like the kind from a thriller) will be a bit underwhelmed.Overall, I'd give it a lukewarm recommendation and mostly to those who want literary fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPABG7ADCDG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099862#wasThisHelpful","R3MPABG7ADCDG6","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eamonn Butler's Best Book on the Market is a good explanation of markets and why they work - especially when ""no one is in charge."" It is precisely because no one central body coordinates economic behavior in markets that lead to so much anxiety about how they work and calls for central planning by governments. Butler does a good job explaining to lay readers how and why markets often do their jobs when left alone and when they are most decentralized.Butler's account of markets is very ""Hayekian"" (after the economist Friedrich Hayek). Rather than using the standard - and utterly false - idea that markets only work when actors have perfect information about the market landscape, and when a perfect equilibrium between consumer demand and producers' supply is reached, Butler sees markets as dynamic forces that NEVER reach equilibrium, whose value is precisely because actors don't have perfect information. In other words, markets work because they allow producers to make educated guesses about what consumers will want, and consumers to figure out what they do want using a standard price system to weigh options against each other. If private actors have imperfect information - and they do - so do government actors. Government intervention in markets (price and wage controls, regulations that make production more costly or restrict consumption, etc) tend to have unforeseen and under-appreciated negative effects (so, regulation restricts market competition, which often makes goods more costly, etc).While Butler gives a good ""Hayekian"" account of why markets work so well, and government interventions don't, there are two things readers should note. First, the explanation is definitely geared toward the lay reader and is somewhat surface-level. (I was looking for some sort of bibliography so that readers interested in a particular area of Butler's argument could read further, but there is none.) Second, Butler does not deal much at all with the common objections to markets: that they can't deal well with ""public goods"" or private goods that produce significant ""external"" costs or benefits to non-purchasers, that markets are unjust because they produce inequality, that certain things just can't be ""commodified,"" and that markets threaten community or tradition. Not that I think these can't be or haven't been answered, but if we are making the case for markets to lay readers, it might be best to show how such commonly heard tropes can be answered.Otherwise, this is a really good book and those who want a good but simple overview of how markets (and free markets) work. Other books of possible interest might be The Morality of Capitalism: What Your Professors Won't Tell You and that oldie but goodie, Free to Choose: A Personal Statement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EEHG5P9MGIBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906465053#wasThisHelpful","R2EEHG5P9MGIBG","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am giving this book two of five stars, not because I disagree with most of the conclusions, but because I find almost all the reasoning to the conclusions to be faulty and oversimplified. I agree, for instance, that the popular conception that humans are selfish creatures who only cooperate when they can benefit from it to be correct; I just hold that most people (yes, even Adam Smith and most 'neoclassical economists') have known that. I am an avid user of Linux and advocate of its open-source way of operating; I am just at a loss as to why anyone thinks that Linux is a golden model of cooperation. And I am an advocate of doing what we can to harness human cooperation;; I am just at a loss as to why 'cooperation' is conceived of NECESSARILY as 'other-oriented behavior engaged in at expense to self.'On this first, Adam Smith's use of self-interest as an idea was very broad. For Smith, engaging in self-interested behavior essentially meant pursuing what one was interested in. If I am interested in helping a friend or giving to a charity whose cause I believe in, this was me pursuing my self-interest. The author may well have a case that 'Chicago School' economists like Gary Becker often did fall into modeling humans as selfish utility-maximizers, but even most 'neoclassical' economists modeled human behavior AS IF if was selfish (often because some people would be selfish, and since that is true, social institutions needed in a way that, if the knaves fell into power, they could do the least harm.)As to holding Linux as the bastion of what cooperation can do, it is certainly a BIT true. Linux operates on an open-source ethos of sharing with others. Developers promise to keep the source code open and often contribute voluntarily (though developers often get paid, too). Yet, Linux is also quite competitive, largely because innovations ARE open-source and cannot be protected by competition-inhibiting trademarks and patents. Here are the words of Linus Torvalds as quoted in the book Top Dog: The Science of Winning and Losing: ""Does this mean that there will be tension and rivalry [between linux developers]? Hell yes, but that's kind of the point. Life is a game, and if you aren't in it to win, what the heck are you still doing here?""Lastly, the author talks as if the ideas of cooperation is simply antithetical to self-interest - the subtitle alone illustrates this dichotomy. But it doesn't take much thought to see that this is dead wrong. I can cooperate both because I want to help others (when I give fifty dollars to you)  and because I am aware that helping others can enhance my own position (when I give fifty dollars to you in exchange for something you are selling, or because I want to stay in your good graces). The fact that people contribute to wikipedia doesn't mean they are not doing so out of self-interest, unless you conceive - as the author does - of the term 'self-interest' in such a narrow way that nothing which produces positive externalities to others could possibly qualify as self-interested.I fully agree that humans exhibit a marked tendency to cooperate, much more than we are often given credit for. But I think that the author seeing this as a point that needs to be made shows his ignorance more than his interestingness. And the fact that he makes this point against economists who really always knew this shows that he might want to either read them again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4IQAJA4QPR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF5JUKO#wasThisHelpful","R3T4IQAJA4QPR7","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julian Le Grand has written a really good book in The Other Invisible Hand, but one that will likely appease any ideologues. Libertarians and (maybe) conservatives will like his cases for competition over command-and-control government services, but may want to go ""all the way"" toward full markets, rather than Le Grand's so-called ""quasi-markets."" Social Democrats, on the other hand, may be put off more fully by Le Grand's championing of markets and, particularly, his theoretical and empirical arguments that markets DO NOT produce knavish behavior any more than ""public service"" does.However, Le Grand's case is not simply a celebration of competition and choice in public service; it is much more complex. Le Grand explores four different ways public services can be delivered: trust (we can just trust the administrators to deliver good service), command-and-control (we can vest power in a central agency to give instructions on how to administer the service), voice (we can allow customers input into the service that administrators can use to adapt the service to customer demand) and competition (we can allow consumers to choose between competing providers). Springboarding off of his previous work (Motivation, Agency, and Public Policy: Of Knights and Knaves, Pawns and Queens), where he discussed the presence of altruists and self-interested actors in about equal measure in the public and private sector, Le Grand suggests that, on balance, competition leads to the best results. Trust and command-and-control demand that we trust people (the providers or the organization that tells them what to do) to do the right thing, when they may have incentive not to. Command-and-control and voice models may risk insulting service providers, who may feel like they are instruments rather than authority figures with expertise. And all three of these lack an exit option for customers, meaning that there is a lack of incentive for providers to take outside advice (from customers) into account, and that consumers may be stuck with service that they find to be suboptimal or would prefer to exit.Competition, on the other hand, generally means that customers can shop for the service they like (and diverse customers can each choose different service), allows service providers to feel like they have some authority over their service (they run things the way they think customers will respond to and the 'feedback' is whether customers DO respond to it). Also, the competition process puts pressure on 'firms' to be efficient, responsive to customers, and innovative. The work is not simply theoretical, either. Le Grand reviews a lot of literature showing (a) that (contra critics) the poor prefer choice more than the middle class or rich, (b) that (again, contra critics) when choice is offered, people use it and report feeling empowered by it, and (c) that markets may well not ""crowd out"" altruistic behavior (data is mixed on that point, but Le Grand finds that altruism is as likely to be expressed in the private, as the public, sector).As mentioned earlier, Le Grand is not simply a ""privatize everything"" advocate. He is not talking about private markets exactly, but ""quasi-markets"" where government redistributes wealth (in areas like healthcare and education) to ensure that everyone has access, regulates the market (both to increase flow of information to consumers and to regulate quality), and may do things like provide transportation to schools and hospitals (as Le Grand finds transportation issues to be an obstacle to effective competition and choice.)Here, admittedly, is where I start to have a few concerns. My concerns are that Le Grand does not adequately deal with some of the tensions between some of his goals. For instance, Le Grand wants to ensure robust competition for services by keeping entry and exit costs of 'firms' low, but at the same time, he advocates the kind of regulation that may keep entry costs high (firms wanting to enter educational markets must prove to an independent board that they meet certain fairly high standards, which can make for costly entry). And while Le Grand is aware of the potential for 'regulatory capture' that comes  from introducing regulations (and advocates that an independent body regulate and monitor school quality), I wonder how independent this independent body can be (would they be paid by the government? If so, that may lead this regulatory agency to make 'politically correct' decisions). I think these issues deserved a bit more exploration.I really liked Le Grand's book, though. In clear and precise language, Le Grand explained the benefits (and the limits) of markets and competition in public services. He follows it up quite well with empirical evidence about the ineffectiveness of trust, command-and-control, and voice options as well as the benefits of choice models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HFVB56GVX7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691129363#wasThisHelpful","R37HFVB56GVX7E","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For quite a while now, care ethicists like Noddings (Starting at Home: Caring and Social Policy) and Held (The Ethics of Care: Personal, Political, and Global) have argued that an ethic of care offers a viable supplement - if not alternative - to political theories of justice. These writers have sought to use care ethics to articulate a caring vision of social policy. This has proven to be an uphill battle for a few reasons. First, if care ethicists often acknowledge that care is most powerful and effective the 'closest to home' it is (we care best for those who are close to us, then how can an ethic of care say anything about what we owe to far-off others? Second, as Engster points out, because care ethics celebrates contextuallity and moral pluralism, many of the suggestions for a caring social policy have been vague guidelines rather than concrete policy proposals.In Heart of Justice, Engster attempts to flesh out a bit more what caring social policy might look like. What is the role and scope of government in a caring world? Is caring most compatible with socialism, market socialism, free markets, or some sort of mixed economy? And even beyond that, can we ground care ethics in something other than the natural emotion that most of us have to care for others (in other words, we have all sorts of natural emotions - from anger to revenge to care - so are there grounds to argue that care, rather than one of these other emotions, is what we should seek to nurture?)As best I can tell, Engster is a sort of market socialist who believes that markets in care services COULD do a better job in some cases than direct government provisions (allowing, for instance, that a regulated voucher system may lead to better outcomes of people's needs being satisfied than government provision of education). In my view - and my biases are revealed here - there is actually plenty of reason to take the idea that markets can provide caring outcomes better than government services; a simply perusal of decades of public choice economic literature should be sufficient to cast doubt on how responsive government bureaucracies often are to 'consumer' needs, and if decentralized governments are what we want, whether there is reason to think that decentralized governments stay that way for long. I like Engster's treatment; he is very balanced and unlike many care ethicists (see particularly Tronto's recent Caring Democracy: Markets, Equality, and Justice), gives at least some attention to whether markets can produce better outcomes than government provision of services. With proper regulation and state oversight, he suggests, they SOMETIMES can.Before that is an interesting discussion where Engster tries to offer a rational foundation for an ethic of care, not because we want to turn care ethics into a rationalistic philosophy, but without giving some rational account of why care, we risk not being able to convince those skeptical of adopting a care-based approach. At the risk of simplifying, the argument is this. (a) all of us are where we are today partly because of the care of others, sometimes those close to us, and sometimes from those distant from us; (b) we all probably agree that when we are in need, it is good for others to step in and help us; (c) because of that, if we want to be consistent, we should also hold that when others are in need, it is good for us and others to step in and help when they can. I think this is pretty solid, but my one reservation is that it may only set up a reciprocal obligation to care for those who've cared for us. In other words, why 'pay it forward' when it is clearer that my obligation to help only extends to those who have cared for me (or who I think are likely to return the favor)?To close the review, my real concern with this book is not whether it's arguments are interesting and good - they are both - but whether Engster's approach departs too radically from most existing accounts of care ethics. So, for one, Engster is more or less a consequentialist - what matters most is whether people get their needs met, not as much whether those meeting the needs do so from caring motive or within caring relationships. Second, while care ethics is often best seen as a communitarian theory, Engster's consequentialism and focus on a theory that satisfies people's needs seems to put him closer to a prioritarian or positive-rights position. Third, Engster does seem to value the idea of autonomy and individualism a bit more than many care ethicists (if one can take care of themselves, they should, often because that means that finite resources can be devoted to those truly in need of care - again, prioritarian.) And lastly, his starting off by offering a rational foundation for care, while I agree with this approach, seems to depart from the care ethics of someone like Nel Noddings.I guess in a philosophy so comparatively new, this kind of differentiation and modification should be welcomed, but I still wonder whether Engster's philosophy bears too many differences to existing accounts of care ethics that he risks being read as a positive-rights or prioritarian theorist in disguise. (As Engster actually admits, his approach bears a lot of similarity to a capabilities approach, and I suspect he may be closer to that here than to an ethic of care.) But either way, the book fills a needed hole in care ethics research and social policy, and Engster's arguments should evoke a lot of exciting thought and discussion. Recommended for anyone concerned with care ethics and social policy (or finding out why a caring approach can supplement or replace accounts of political justice.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8IKJ2UMBSIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199562490#wasThisHelpful","R3L8IKJ2UMBSIE","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Barnes and Noble Nook HD+ is either a really good tablet or a slightly below average tablet depending on what you are looking for (and maybe the price you paid). If you are looking for a decent semi-android-like tablet and don't need front or rear cameras - mostly for media consumption and sometimes productivity, it is pretty good. If you are looking for something more like an Ipad or Nexus 10, you may be best spending the extra money. In what follows, I want to give the pros, cons, and how the tablet compares to its chief rival, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9PROS OF THE HD+: First - and this is PURELY my aesthetic taste - I love the look of this tablet. Yes, it is made of plastics rather than metals, and I can kind of see how some, who want a firmer construction, might see and feel it as cheap. But in a world where 9 and 10 inch tablets have boring black bezels that screens that are flush with the bezel, this tablet actually looks quite stunning (well, everything except that strange little ring on the lower left side). Second, this tablet is the lightest you will find on the 9 inch market - WAY lighter than the Kindle Fire 8.9 and Ipad. Third, the operating system strikes a good combination of easy to use but customizable (one part Kindle Fire, one part Android). Fourth, the HD screen is just the best and brightest I've EVER seen on a tablet....nonetheless of this price point. And last... the price is very good for a tablet of this price, though there are some competitors that have prices just as low for those willing to make a few concessions (like the ASUS MeMO Pad Smart ME301T-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16 GB Tablet ( Blue ) and the Sony Xperia 16 GB 9.4-Inch Tablet S SGPT121US/S.CONS OF THE HD+: First, no back- OR FRONT-facing cameras, which may be a drawback if you want to take pictures or video chat. Next, while this comes with Google Play, it is not exactly a full android experience. So, things like the 'swipable' update menu, the ability to create folders of apps, Google Now, and the ability to resize app shortcuts do not exist on this tablet; usably decent, but not as free-feeling as android. Second, the performance is decent for a dual core processor (same as the Kindle Fire HD), but is a bit laggy compared to some tablets. Websites load and scroll a bit choppy, the carousel on the homescreen (which is honestly quite useless seeing as you can put app and media shortcuts on your homescreen!) is laggy, etc. (Oddly, I have not had a choppiness problem streaming music or movies, though.) Next, there is a proprietary charger, so while all of your other devices use a micro-USB port, you will have to carry a Nook charger (that is mildly pricey) for this device. Lastly, this tablet does tend to heat up on the back when used for periods of time longer than, say, 40 minute. (I should probably mention here a quirk that may be a minor negative but is really more of an annoyance: this seems the only tablet in the history of tablets that can only charge when the device is ON.)Now, for those considering buying a Fire HD 8.9 or a Nook HD+, here is a quick rundown of the (good and bad) features each has that the other doesn't.KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9: Prime members have access to text-to-speech on books, the kindle lending library, and free streaming of SOME videos from Amazon Instant Video. The hardware is way clunkier and heavier than the Nook HD+ (but many will find it sturdier). Front-facing cameras for video chat. Easy to use Kindle Fire Operating System that is absolutely not customizable. (You can sideload third party apps, but Amazon goes out of its way to make this difficult, so most users will be locked into Amazon's app store.) Very good stereo speakers. This is a great tablet for those locked into amazon's ecosystem, consuming media primarily from amazon.NOOK HD+: Text-to-speech access (experimental) for Nook books and access to the (limited) Nook video library. Access to the Google Play store and the Nook App store (so you are not locked into one app store, and can get books and other things from many sources.) Nook operating system that way more customizable than Amazon's. Expandable storage via micro-SD card slot, which the Kindle Fire HD does not have. This is the better tablet for those who want a more tablet-y experience, beyond consuming Amazon media content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQOYV8AMIAG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGAS6XW#wasThisHelpful","REQOYV8AMIAG8","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why does a marriage's health correlate with the percentage of time each person spends online? Why do divorce rates go down with recessions (unless you are poor)? Why is the percentage of black men who date women of other ethnicities higher than the percentage of black women who date men of other ethnicities?Economics is often called the dismal science, and one based on a presumption of 'rational actors.' For these reasons, it may seem off-putting to apply microeconomic methods to explain sexual and romantic behavior. But Professor Marina Adshade does a good job of showing us how economic thinking can help explain how and why humans choose as they do when it comes to sex and love. It is not that we ARE all rational calculators who seek to maximize utility (and isn't 'utility' a tough concept to define when it comes to romance?), but that the intuitions on which we make choices are often calibrated AS IF we are rational actors. (For more detail and argument, see Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions.)This book is based on a course that Dr. Adshade created in 2008 at the University of British Columia, out of concern that many first-year economic students are not 'turned on' by talk of interest rates and consumption functions enough to remain Econ majors for year 2. The classes's success led to a successful blog and now, to a same-titled book. Adshade organizes the book 'chronologically': from discussing how opportunity costs (the available choices we forego in making a choice) help determine how we date and 'hook up.' Next, we get into courtship and marriage (and how the latter produces a 'mutual gain from trade' and a sort of insurance policy). Last, we get into how economic thinking can explain decisions to have children and who with (or who we risk having children with out of wedlock). Last, we discuss love in the 'golden years' and the economic reasons why it is easier for men AND WOMEN to find love at older ages.I confess to being a bit squeamish at applying certain economic assumptions to the realm of love and sex. For instance, in discussing why couples seem less likely to divorce during a recession, she essentially describes a situation where it is harder for people to walk away when the costs of doing so are higher (when they are in debt, when they owe on the house, etc). This may well be, but there may be psychic factors involved that are difficult for economists to measure, like the loyalty one feels for the person one has pledged their love to or the joy one feels in being with the other. Dr. Adshade certainly acknowledges these difficulties, but  gives them short shrift. (She sort of has to when using a methodology employing ideas 'utility maximization' on a subject where what 'utility' is may vary wildly from individual to individual.)Be that as it may, I really enjoyed this book and would readily recommend it to two groups: first, those who want a really interesting introduction to economics without the feel of a 'traditional' economics text. Here, we are introduced to such ideas as thick and thin markets, opportunity cost, equilibrium, and supply/demand shock, in a way that makes these concepts quite understandable and relatable. Next, I recommend this to folks already familiar with microeconomics, who want to see it applied in an exciting way to an unusual subject area.Some have found the book dry. I didn't find it that way, but then again, I'm used to reading academic texts. I found Dr. Adshade to be concise, clear and, at times, witty. She interjects personal and hypothetical stories quite often to illustrate what she says and keeps econ jargon to a minimum (though a certain amount of it really is unavoidable). So, I'll say it this way: if you expect Freakonomics (co-written by an economist and a popular journalist),  you'll be a bit disappointed in the prose. If you've read the popular columns of someone like Gary Becker, Milton Friedman, or Paul Krugman, you'll be able to make it easily through this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCKM64OO42FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452109222#wasThisHelpful","RUCKM64OO42FS","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I REALLY wanted to like Lanier's new book, as I liked - and positively reviewed - his previous work, You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto (Vintage). I like and admire several points Lanier made there, but alas, there are simply too many fallacies in this book for Lanier's conclusion to hold. Also, stylistically, the book is poorly laid out, very repetitive, and prone to meandering.First, the positive: as with Lanier's last book, I think he is on the right track in criticizing the insane mantra that ""informatoin wants to be free."" (First, information isn't sentient enough to want anything, and second, those who produce information often want to be paid because the production isn't costless.) Second, several of Lanier's points about siren servers' ability to lock customers into their particular ecosystem to access content (think Apple's ios, or amazon's cloud for ebooks and mp3 music) are very well taken and need to be taken seriously. Third, as big an ""open source"" enthusiast, I can see at least some danger in allowing (or encouraging) individuals to create and make available information ""for free"" (though I don't think the results will be nearly as dire as Lanier predicts).Now, for the negative. First, his argument is premised on the idea that for economies to be healthy, the existence of a middle class is required. I am not an economist, but I know enough economists to know that this is a contentious point and very probably a tautology (the truth seems to be that an economy where products can be geared toward a middle class needs a healthy middle class.) Not that there aren't good reasons to want to see a healthy middle class, but ""economies need them"" is either not a good reason, or a good reason that requires more argument than Lanier gives.Second, Lanier is certainly no luddite, but his argument is identical to the luddite arguments of the past...the ones which have all proven wrong - that the new technology will simply destroy more jobs than it creates. Why have these arguments proved wrong? Because they are based on the assumption that the current marketplace (and the demand consumers express in it) is what the future economy will just look like, and that our lack of ability to guess at what people may demand in the future (once technology renders some current occupations and products obsolete) means that those possibilities probably don't exist. Take his brief discussion of how technology will destroy, or seriously dent, higher education. He talks about how new technologies that can scale instruction in a way that will render the existing model of higher education largely irrelevant spells doom for the higher education industry.That may be, but if this new education costs less than current education, we must imagine that the money that people WOULD HAVE spent on higher education will go somewhere - either saved (and invested) or spent. Where? We can only imagine. Lanier really does write as if he believes that people will just stop demanding things when present demands become easier to satisfy.Second, he writes that people should be paid when they contribute information to, say, Google, Facebook, etc, because they are providing these companies with valuable information (remember, facebook's users ARE NOT the customers; the businesses that use user's information are.) But, is the fact that they don't receive money payments mean they are not paid? What about Google providing me a free word processor, helpful calendar program, a free website creation service, and other things? Yes, Lanier may have a point that users may not realize exactly what information they are giving up, but I do have to imagine that a great many of them would still see the services ""gives"" them as a payment, even if they were made aware of exactly how much Google benefits from their information sharing. (Even in cases like Youtube, there must be a reason people are willing to create videos and share them freely; maybe the payment is just the knowledge that others are benefiting.) Simply put: just because money doesn't change hands doesn't mean payment doesn't exist.There are some other flaws in the book, such as Lanier's bizarre talk of how siren servers undermine the idea of free will by creating better and better behavior-prediction software, as if the fact that I can predict what choice you will make means you actually didn't make a choice. (Even if a company can predict what advertisement or price point it would take to 'nudge' you to buy x, that doesn't mean that you had no choice in buying x.)Stylistically, the book is very rambling and somewhat disorganized. It may well be that Lanier's case is much stronger than I am giving credit for and he just wasn't able to properly express it in this book. He is a very smart man indeed, but reading this book was much like reading someone who had so many intricate thoughts (and saw synthesis between just about every field on the planet) that he had difficulty limiting himself to one cogent argument. I skipped or skimmed a good many pages in the book largely because there were tangents and repetitions throughout.As I said, I wanted very much to like this book, and pre-ordered it months ago in anticipation. Unfortunately, there are many bad assumptions and arguments here, and the lack of structure just pushed it over the edge into the ""disappointing"" category.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PG0BGM94OIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J2AEY8#wasThisHelpful","R2PG0BGM94OIK","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""[T]his is not a memoir exactly; it is an account of a syndrome whose nature was a war with and for a self"" (loc. 634).""Denial: My 25 Years Without a Soul"" is a story of writer Jonathan Rausch's childhood, adolescent, and young adult years and what it was like to be gay without realizing one was gay. Rausch just believed that he was either asexual (or a heterosexual whose sexual feelings were just around the corner), and - smart as Rausch was - his brain ratioanlized his obsession with men's muscles as a strange case of envy. But meanwhile, where everyone else could feel romantic love, Rausch simply believed that that he was incapable of those feelings.The book starts during Rausch's early teens, when he realizes - just like that - that he'll probably never get married. He just doesn't have feelings toward girls. We follow Rausch through his burgeoning obsession with the male (athletic) figure and, in particular, a bodybuilding friend named Paul. It literally doesn't dawn on Rausch that he is gay, because (he says) he doesn't have sexual thoughts about boys. He rationalizes his admiration for their bodies as a sort of envy of a scrawny awkward boy of his ""betters."" In college, the same, and when periodic friends suggested he may be gay, he very honestly denied it (again, because homosexuality was about wanting sex with men, different from what he felt). It was only in his twenties (for reasons I'll leave you to discover) that he realized he may be - and then was - gay.I must reiterate - per Rausch's above quote - that this is not a memoir or even a story per se; Rausch is writing a psychological account of who he - this unsuspecting gay man, obsessed with his muscular friend Paul and convinced he was just abnormal and broken - was from childhood through adulthood. It is very well written, unflinchingly honest, Not a book you read if you just want a good story, but one you read if you really want to feel things you may never have felt before about a boy who exists but you've never known. This is what happens when a writer (given to self-analysis and -reflection) sruggles mightily with his sexuality and can put it into words for us.This book, that may have seemed too egocentric had it been a full novel's length, was quite perfect at less than 100 pages. Rausch's writing is appropriately self-reflective (even if his prose CAN be grandiose at times, using phrases like ""dear reader"" a bit too much for my tastes.) In this short book, though, Jonathan Rausch gives us a very compelling portrait of a boy trying desperately and unsuccessfully to figure himself out and finally - finally! - doing so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9T90JK9PAJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLJAMII#wasThisHelpful","RG9T90JK9PAJT","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1960's, the hijacking of airplanes became something of an epidemic. Those who wanted money, amnesty in other countries, and both, decided that they could achieve these by taking over airplanes once in midair, and making demands. In order to save lives, airlines created policies that pilots and stewardesses should accede to hijackers' demands which, of course, made hijacking more lucrative and thus more common. This is the story of one such incident, of an interracial couple whose intent was to hijack a plane, rescue professor and political activist Angela Davis from a criminal trial, extort money from the US government, and give the money to Vietcong forces in Vietnam. The hijacking worked, but not as expected.This book is a journalist's attempt to tell the story of the hijackers, the hijacking, and the aftermath. This is interspersed with chapters about the American government and airlines attempts to deal with the new ""epidemic"" in hijackings from the late 1960's to middle 1970's. The writing is fast paced, well staged, and engaging.But honestly, I think the story falls a bit flat largely because there just wasn't anything particularly extraordinary about it. Particularly, about a third of the book is devoted to what happens to Holder and Kerkow after the hijacking, and much of this is quite anti-climactic. Of course, as the story isn't fictional, the author can't be blamed for the lackluster latter portion of the book, it does it did make me wonder several times why this hijacking story was picked rather than others.Also, those who like historical readings will be a bit disappointed. To some degree, this story does intersect with America's attempts to grapple with the Vietnam war, civil rights, the rise of the Black Panthers, and debates over airport security in the age of hijacking, but these excursions are minimal, only engaged in to the degree necessary to explain the book's characters and ""plot.'This is an averagely enjoyable book, and those who want some mix of an engrossing journalistic story interspersed with some history will find some enjoyable things here. But I came away questioning why this story was told, as I didn't find it terribly compelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KK8ECKRBCZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886107#wasThisHelpful","R26KK8ECKRBCZC","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In one way, I am not the best person to write this review, but in another way, I may be exactly who should be writing the review. I am NOT the target audience for Office Professional; I'm a PhD student who uses a word processor, slide presentation software, database creator, and (if we go back about five years) a native e-mail client. But, on the other hand, I can approach Office with fresh eyes, because I haven't used Office for about two years. I tend to use the free LibreOffice for the my word processing and other needs, and webmail rather than Outlook. I use Office 2007 at work, but that is about it. (If you are wondering, I was given a promotional copy of the software to review for amazon.)And, to be honest, I don't love or hate the new Office. What do I like? Web integration is great - the way we have the option to sync files seamlessly with Microsoft SkyDrive (Microsoft's cloud storage). Of course, you can also do that with Google Drive, but there are still some lingering compatibility issues between Office and Drive. (Contrary to another reviewer's comments, one does not HAVE to save documents on the cloud; rather, setting up Office automatically sets up a SkyDrive folder that links to the cloud. So, when you save a document, you can either save it in that folder and, by extension, on the cloud, or in another folder not linked to the cloud.)I kind of like how easy it is to insert pictures and videos into documents and presentations (for videos). Unlike some past versions of Windows, one needed to have a picture or video saved natively in order to insert it, and inserting web video was a multi-step process. Not anymore. There is an easy option in PowerPoint (and Word) to insert pictures or videos from the web that, when clicked opens up a Bing search for pictures or videos by keyword. Once you click on your desired image or video, it inserts into the document. (The feature for inserting video into PowerPoint has proven A BIT buggy for me, where it will insert a picture of the video, but not the video itself, but that's only happened a few times.)Other than these, there is absolutely nothing that would compel me to spend a large amount of money on this product. Simply put, Microsoft now has competition in every area of Office, and everything Office can do, something else can do either just as well or better. LibreOffice has every bit of the functionality (with the possible exception of PowerPoint being better than Impress) for a price of zero. Google Docs and Google Drive can do quite a bit of what the average user would require from Windows, as well as replicate the experience of SkyDrive....also for a price of zero. I made myself try Outlook for purposes of this review - because I haven't used a native e-mail client in many years - and I don't see much that it can do that is worth the hard drive space, price, or giving up the convenience of cloud-based webmail.I think I will stick with LibreOffice, Google Drive, and webmail. Office has offered me no compelling reason not to.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNFZP3L3SWI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPL2K0#wasThisHelpful","R2VNFZP3L3SWI2","A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think we jazz lovers are all guilty, at times, of using jazz as background music - letting one's brain wander onto other things while songs play in the background. This, folks, is an album that should never be reduced to background music. Jimmy Smith and Stanley Turrentine are both exquisite soloists, and both are at their most melodic on this record (Smith plays a bit more sparingly on this album than he often does). While Donald Bailey (dr) and Quentin Warren are relegated to supporting roles (the only soloists are Turrentine and Smith), they do a great job, especially following Turrentine and Smith's dynamics changes and cues).The songs here are pure soul. Prayer Meetin' is a roadhouse style 12-bar blues with a wickedly soulful guitar riff. When the Saints Go Marching In is pure energetic gospel, and Smith's syncopated solo is probably worth the price of the album. I Almost Lost My Mind is a beautiful slow, sensitive blues. The album is pure soul from start to finish (even the strange latin feel of Stone Cold Dead in the Market has soul to it!).I've had this album for precisely three days and I've listened to it precisely three times, and I have to imagine that this will work itself into my ""favorite albums"" list. Please, no background music here.

"This is the best space/portable heater I have ever used! I work in a very cold office and this provides plenty of warmth for myself and coworkers who sit near me!What I love:1. Amazing quality and craftsmanship! It is very good looking, unlike other space heaters.2. The cord can be wound up on the bottom for easy transport and storage.3. Simple simple simple operation.4. Very well built high quality switches and knobs.5. A 5 year warranty.6. We tested the ""tip over"" protection and it works perfectly.7. Built in carry handle.What I do not love:1. It is quite expensive, but you get what you pay for. This does not change my 5 star rating, just wish it was a little cheaper in price.2. No thermostat feature. Its either on or off. No temperature setting like some other models. BUT the strange thing is it ""sort of"" does have a thermostat built in, because the unit will shut off if it gets too hot.. unfortunately this is a safety feature only.If you need a space heater, and want ""quality"", ""simplicity"", and ""durability"", AND you don't mind the hefty price tag, THIS is simply the best option out there in my opinion.

"I got this toy to give to my friend with a one year old baby daughter! I got some ""hands on"" time unboxing it and watching her play with her new toy. The toy is very well built and durable. It does require AA batteries which are not included.The handle can be attached to ""push"" around sort of like a lawn mower, or removed to be played with like a toy car. The buttons all light up and different songs/phrases are played electronically.I see this as a gift that can grow with the child as they get a little older, assuming they don't get bored easily. Right now, because the girl is only one, she is playing with it without the handle attached. I have nothing to complain about and this would make a wonderful gift for any toddler or young child.

"I don't have a fancy set-up, nor do I play that many games. I acquired this remote to use while watching Blu-Rays and videos on my PS4. My set-up is simple, my large TV connected to my PS4. No soundbars, cable boxes, receivers, surround sound, or any other gadgets.So my review is only based on using it as a remote solely to watch movies/videos on the PS4. I was sick and tired of using the dual shock controller, always bumping a button by accident or forgetting what button does which... This is why I got this remote.It paired very easily, the quality is decent, I can play, pause, skip, rewind, etc without problems. For this, it deserves 4 stars.I easily programmed my TV (Vizio 70"" 1080p) and that's it. It powers on my TV, it works the volume, and controls my PS4. I can't really complain.Now, for those who have multiple devices (receivers, etc), I can totally understand the lower ratings and frustration. I am just a simple person, with a simple set-up and this basic remote works fine for me. I don't have to constantly guess which buttons do what on the DS4 controller anymore when watching a movie. The best thing is now I can just use batteries and they should last a loooong time, instead of charging my DS4 every few days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWI4L8FIXQKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJRHSZO#wasThisHelpful","R2GWI4L8FIXQKN","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Serta Comfort Blanket is the best heated blanket I've ever used. Even though I live in Houston, TX.. when the cold fronts come in, I love using a heated blanket instead of turning on the heater throughout the entire house. The reason is by the next morning/day, it'll be warm again and then the entire house gets too warm. (Houston weather problems).So with this heater blanket, my wife and I can sleep comfortably and save quite a bit on our electric bill.My favorite features are:1. Very very plush and soft (Queen size)2. Very long cord, 19 ft. VERY LONG and reaches our oddly placed wall outlet.3. Digital controller (easy to use, temp +/-, Time +/-, and On/off) Simple!4. Lighted display on the controller so you can see in the dark.5. A 3 year warrantyMy wife and I sleep very little ~5-6 hours each night due to our schedules so the 12 hour timer doesn't really make a difference, but its great to have. We usually set it for 7 hours and simply go to sleep. The unit gets very warm (this is subjective) so we just set it on the lower temp settings. Usually a 2 is plenty warm for us in Houston.The blanket is wonderful and we highly recommend it. I really wish if they could improve ONE SINGLE thing, it would to put a rubber texture around the control unit so it doesn't slide off the night stand, and will be quieter when setting down onto a hard surface.One last thing, Can you feel the wires/heating elements? The short answer is ""no"". You literally have to try and squeeze your fingers into the blanket and you ""may"" feel something, but with normal use, we do ""not"" feel any wires like the cheaper heating blankets.Hope this helps, this is a ""top of the line"" heated blanket and it works very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNUB63HMJZ80L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHFT10#wasThisHelpful","RNUB63HMJZ80L","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sentinel 12 sheet crosscut shredder is a beast. A very very quiet beast. It will literally devour and shred EASILY 12 sheets of paper at a time. Now, I just stick the entire envelope without bothering to open it straight into the shredder. Before with junk mail, I'd have to open the letter, take the paper out, unfold the paper, etc.. Now, the entire envelope goes right in. Boom, Done! I've also shredded many old cards and the shredder didn't show any sign of hesitation. Stick it in, and its shredded into confetti like little pieces.I love crosscut shredders because you don't have to empty the bin as often, plus it is much much more secure than the strip style of shredders. The unit is very quiet compared to my previous cheaper model. The unit is very robust and well built, almost unnecessarily heavy in weight, but it just means I don't need to worry about it tipping over.I love the carry handle and lock to bin feature. Now I can just carry the entire shredder/basket easily into my garage to empty and not have to worry about picking up tiny pieces of shredded paper like before. The compaction feature works well, but I find with cross cutting, it isnt really necessary because the tiny pieces of paper take up much less volume. But regardless, it will compress the paper (manually) and you can keep shredding before needing to empty the basket. But remember, if you keep compacting and compacting, the moment you do empty the shredder, the paper will expand and you risk having tiny pieces fall all over the floor. This is why I do not compact it too much, I just simply unload it and prevent a mess.This is a very solid unit, it works very well and I expect it to last a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYX2UVVP2NZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FD2QYY#wasThisHelpful","R2CYX2UVVP2NZG","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Ultimate Direction gear. I have the AK vest so I am used to the bottles they use. This Access 20 Plus waistpack is comfortable for what it is.. Of course with the 20 oz. size of the bottle filled with water, it's heavy. If you pack in gels, keys, a phone, it gets even heavier. BUT this is nothing new, just don't think the belt will be 100% motionless and feel perfectly weightless. That's impossible.The reason I chose this pack is mainly for the storage! Finally, I can fit my iphone 6 with case and keys and not worry. Every other pack i tried can barely fit an iphone 6 or simply can't. I do not use the gel tube and leave it off the belt since I do not really run long distances. When I do, I wear my vest.The water bottle itself is sturdy and holds lots of water, yes it is stiff, but that makes it easier to unholster and reholster the bottle. I do wish it were insulated since Texas heat can be brutal in the summers. What I do is fill it 40-50% with water and freeze it overnight.. right before my run, I top the rest off with water. On short notice, I just use ice cubes but it ""rattles"" and can be a bit annoying. The wide mouth makes it very easy to put ice cubes, powders, etc into the bottle. It also makes it super easy to clean with a regular bottle brush. I just toss the lid into the dishwasher and have no problems.It's a great pack and very secure.. but just don't have a false impression that is simply ""disappears"" and you won't realize it's there. You will (minimally), and you will make minor adjustments throughout the course of your run. But it's no different than a vest or any other type of bottle belt. I wear this with the bottle positioned in the small of my back.If holding a large phone or multiple items is not a primary concern of yours, there are more ""minimalist"" options to pick from.

"Boots in secondsMy battery is averaging 12-13 hours of web browsing. I rarely watch videos.The wifi connects to my home and everywhere else perfectly.Light weightGood build quality for the priceDecent screen, but the viewing angle is pretty unforgiving.Resolution is good for the priceThe built in speakers actually sound very very decent. I listen to spotify all the time and the audio is on par with Macbooks, or other laptops costing much more.I rarely carry the charger anywhere because of the battery life.Sleek and fast. Its just a Google Chrome browser basically.This is my first Chromebook. It really blew me away once I started using it... I realized 95% of what I do is through a browser anyways. This is the perfect travel companion. It is very quick and snappy, faster than my desktop or other laptops running a full OS.Gripes:the charger prongs do not retract or fold. (think apple chargers, the metal prongs fold) The Asus charger does not.The blue outer shell is okay, but an absolutely fingerprint magnet.The proprietary charger connector should be redesigned.

"I am just an average guy who surfs the net, reads the news, and rarely demands much from my mouse/keyboard. So this review is coming from a non-power user.Please be aware, this keyboard is designed mainly for Windows 8, not Mac OS, or previous older versions of Windows.I paired the keyboard and mouse to my HP desktop w/ Win 8.1 (with built in Bluetooth) effortlessly. I really like the quality feel of the keyboard. The mouse on the other hand is not very comfortable and honestly, it is too flat for long term use (-1 star). My wrist hurt after a while because I have large hands.Battery life: I am on the original set of batteries, so I cannot comment on battery life yet. The battery doors are very nice.Please be aware, your PC must have Bluetooth built in, OR you must purchase a Bluetooth Dongle separately! (-1 star) for the price of nearly $100, a Bluetooth receiver should have been included.The keyboard keys are similar in feel with a modern Mac type keyboard. I personally do not like typing on Keyboards like this. But it works, and that is subjective.The Keyboard and Mouse combo is very pleasing to the eye. It looks sleek and high quality.

"I am familiar with JA Henckels products, I own a pair of kitchen utility scissors and several of their chef knives. All have served me well.I received this nail clipper hoping the extra cost is justified, and that it would be a superior nail clipper that will last me years and years....This JAH Nail Clipper has a few minor annoyances I would like to share. The plastic nail catcher (black part) is extremely difficult to get on and off. Its very wide, and simply a poor design. Also the Nail clipper is quite small, so it is mainly meant for cutting finger nails. Yes, the quality of the metal and the cutting blade is very good, but honestly my $3 clipper works the same.The nail file is a thin strip (like a toothpick) built onto the edge of the nail catcher (black part). It does not work very well because of the long/thin shape. It does work to get rid of minor unevenness, but not much more than that. For the price, I would probably pass this clipper up and stick with lower cost options. This Henckels clipper isn't really worth the high price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1TSAWK8WH31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MGYDGW#wasThisHelpful","R2K1TSAWK8WH31","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tons of straps, buckles, zippers, etc. Once you look at the carrier, everything makes sense. The adjustments are easily made and well thought out.

"The charge HR is my first activity band. It honestly has replaced the traditional watch I wore daily because it also displays the time and date. I really like all the features of the charge HR. Once you understand that it is not a professional/medical grade ""data"" tool, but more of a ""motivational & personal activity"" tool, then the Fitbit's purpose will make sense to you. My wife uses the Fitbit Zip and she loves it too. We challenge each other daily on who can do more steps in a day. I average 12K/day and my wife blows me away at 18K+/day!I am 6'1"" and 210 lbs, the Large fits me perfectly. I average 4-5 days of battery life on a full charge, and I am constantly syncing my watch, especially at the gym. Since the charge HR needs to be removed when showering, this is the perfect time for me to charge it. Setup is simple via a PC or just using the smartphone app. Fitbit has nice social features to join groups and add friends for challenges.My wife and I love our fitbits! I think the Charge HR model is the best one to get for the price and options. If you are on a budget, the ""Charge"" model is a great value. It has everything this one has, except for the heart monitor, AND buckle to keep the strap on. I like the strap on my charge HR, because it is more secure and I don't need to worry about it accidentally falling off my wrist.The heart rate monitor is just as accurate as anything found on a gym treadmill/elliptical. Usually only off by 1-2 beats. Please note, the reading can take a while to ""catch up"", as this technology has it's weaknesses. Again this is not a professional/medical grade heart rate monitor. It is for a fitness enthusiast or someone looking to be more active.The software works well both on PC and Android.Another awesome feature that I LOVE is the ""vibrating"" alarm. It is surprisingly powerful and wakes me up easily. I really thought this feature was gimmicky and would never really be able to wake people up, but every morning at 7:45am, mine goes off and I instantly wake up. The vibration ""gently"" startles you awake, but not in a heart pounding panic like regular audio alarms. You can set multiple alarms and have them repeat on specified days of the week.My few small complaints:-Fitbit, please add a feature to vibrate the watch and remind you to drink water at certain intervals/period of time.-Increase the vibration time of the incoming call notification. One quick vibration is easily overlooked, especially when working out.-Please also include a longer usb charging cable-Feel free to go bolder with the colors/designs. Black silicone rubber is boring, even as a guy. Have some more vivid, eye catching design options/colors available.-Please use a more scratch resistant display, such as Gorilla glass. (even though my plastic display has not scratched, it is still a concern), especially working with weights.-MAKE THE DARN WATCH SHOWER-PROOF! it's 2015 and the watch is $150! It should be water resistant enough to safely shower without removing.Even with these complaints, I would still recommend the charge HR. There is no need to spend any more on the Fitbit surge model IMO, as your cellphone can track outdoor running with it's gps and many apps.I think in a few more generations, these fitness bands will be amazing, but the latest Fitbits prove the technology is maturing very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSC0QTVJUD4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2BW2PK#wasThisHelpful","RRSC0QTVJUD4G","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Easy to set up and can be done completely from the phone app. You don't necessarily need to connect this to a PC, but it does make the experience more enjoyable.If you have the ability to, I highly recommend the Charge or Charge HR for all the cool features they offer.

"#### UPDATE #### UPDATE ######## UPDATE #### UPDATE ####It has been a little over a week now and I wanted to take a moment to update you about my Arlo system.I did absolutely forget to mention one more important aspect of the Dropcam, which is AUDIO. The dropcam offers very accurate and sensitive sound detection. You can customize the sensitivity and even hear the faintest sound.  This means the dropcam can also be set to record audio constantly, or begin to record once sound is detected. The dropcam also features a basic low quality output speaker, which you can talk through using the Dropcam app on your mobile phone. I actually tested the feature and spoke with my wife who was at home, while I was overseas on a business trip using wifi and my mobile app. It works very similar to a walkie talkie. It does not work like a normal phone conversation, instead, only one person can speak at a time, like a 2 way radio with a delay. This feature may only be useful for monitoring a pet ""OFF the Counter!!"", lol or maybe reminding your child ""Do your homework!"". The Arlo does not have audio, but I knew this going in, so it is of no consequence to the Arlo system's score. I simply did not use the audio feature enough on my dropcams and forgot to mention audio in my original review. It's a great feature, but for my purposes, audio is not a priority.Regarding the battery life, I have good and bad news. The bad news is the outdoor camera battery, only lasted around 6 days after installing a fresh set of batteries. The low battery warning appeared around the end of the 5th day, and the camera was dead by the 6th. I think this may be an issue due to the infrared sensors or maybe temperature? (its pretty chilly in the evenings ~38-40F). Again, I'm not an engineer so I have no clue what is causing this issue. For those like me who are price conscious, I am now on my third set of CR123A batteries. Again, the cost of the batteries could be justified somewhat due to the fact that the Arlo works well being FREE, you do not need to pay a monthly fee for cloud recording like dropcam.Remember, battery life varies greatly for everyone on something like security cams. Just because I am getting 6 days of use does ""Not"" mean ""you"" will get the same. You have to take into consideration, settings, environment, ambient light, temperature, and many other various options. So please don't say ""well I only got 2 days"" or I got 2 months of use"". Everyone's mileage will differ. This is why I cannot change the rating of my review.Regarding reliability, I had to restart the app on my phone a few times. The app would freeze and become non-responsive. Rebooting my phone or restarting the app solved the problem every time. A very minor annoyance, and has only happened about 3-4 times. I have had no issues with the cameras operating as of yet. I am sure as the software is upgraded and improved, the issue with the app will be sorted out.Besides the short battery life, I have nothing else to report. I have another week to decide if I will keep the Arlo system or return to my old dropcams and deal with the annoyances of wires. As of right now, I am leaning towards keeping the Arlo system as I really enjoy having the camera outside on my porch. It makes me feel safe to know that potential thieves/criminals would be recorded and stored in the Arlo servers ""cloud"". With dropcam, they can only be mounted inside the house, near a power outlet.If anything else changes, I'll certainly report back with an update. Best Wishes!""#### END UPDATE #### END UPDATE ######## END UPDATE #### END UPDATE ####[[[[[ORIGINAL REVIEW]]]]]]I have used Dropcams (2 were in constant use) in my home for over 6 months prior to purchasing the Arlo system. The dropcams have served me very well, but they also have limitations which I will explain throughout this review.Let's start with the setup. The Arlo system did honestly take me longer to decide where to put them, compared to the time it took me to set up. 5 minutes using an iPhone app, checking a few options, and done! The dropcams, were also similar in ease to set up. I consider this a tie between Arlo and dropcam.The video quality on the ""balanced (middle)"" Arlo setting, is about the same as the Non-HD setting on a Dropcam. (my dropcam only has the option of HD or non-HD) This resolution is fine for my use of home monitoring, without killing your internet bandwidth.. (don't forget to take this into consideration). (wifi video monitoring and streaming uses a lot of data, so make sure your home internet provider doesn't have a cap on your data usage).The greatest advantage to the Arlo system compared to the Dropcam system is:1. Wire free, no cables whatsoever attaches to the camera. This is the very reason I eagerly purchased this system! I hated having to compromise with the placement of Dropcams because of the power outlet requirement. With Arlo, you can easily get creative in the ways to mount the wireless cameras, which is a huge plus. Dropcams can be easily ""unplugged"" by anyone. If the Arlo is mounted on a ceiling or high up, this would make it much harder to disable.2. Arlo provides SEVEN days of FREE cloud storage of your video stream! Dropcam charges $10/month! or $99/year for 7 days of storage for the 1st camera!! (more for additional cameras!!) For 30 days of recording, it costs even more! If you don't know, this is where they will store the video in their servers for 7 days, so you can access the videos online or on your phone app, and save them onto your computer. In case you need to share the video with police, friends, etc.3. The Arlo system is also weatherproof. But only time will reveal how it stands up to humidity, moisture, condensation, dust, sand, HEAT (im in Texas)! Until this is an issue, it is a clear advantage compared to dropcam. Dropcams are only for indoors! You cannot mount them outside as they are not weatherproof and require a power outlet.The Arlo system truly shines because of those three reasons, especially when compared to DropCam!I love the magnetic mounting, I have one pointed straight down the largest portion of my living area/kitchen to monitor my beloved dog when I am out. The other is pointed outside in my patio so I can record deliveries, solicitors, potential burglars, etc.The DropCam system is greatly disadvantaged because it must have a power source nearby to plug in. That forces you to live with long or short, exposed cable, or breaking sheetrock and repairing the walls to hide the cables. This really limits the placement of dropcams.Now here are 2 Advantages of the DropCam system (again, I am being fair and non-biased).1. Rock solid stability. In the 6 months I've used both dropcams on my wifi system. I have NEVER had a single problem. I can view livestream, recordings, get notifications, change settings, etc all on my phone in an instant. I understand the Arlo system can do the same, but only time will tell if the Arlo system is as solid and reliable as DC. (this does not influence my rating, because the Arlo system has worked fine (surprisingly)...so far)2. The field of view on the Dropcam is superior to Arlo's very very wide view. I find the dropcam view a much better compromise of size and wideness. (People are larger in size, everything seems more normal, and not ""fisheye'y on my dropcams)(I take away half a star on the Arlo system because of this) The Field of view on the Dropcam really is better. The Arlo view makes everything look small and the slightly rounded fisheye effect is not desirable for my needs. Is this an absolute deal-breaker? no. But the next topic may be...For my final topic of discussion, it will be about battery life.I have used my Arlo system for 2 days now, I purchased at a local electronics store in Houston called, Fry's)My indoor camera in the living room/kitchen is still running on the first original fresh set of batteries. whew.The outdoor camera however is now on the 2nd set. Like the other reviewer, within 10-12 hours, low battery warning was showing. This is not good. Either there is something wrong with the IR sensor for night vision, or maybe the temperature is affecting the battery life? Im not sure, I'm not a electronics guru or anything. But I replaced the battery and things are looking good ""so far"", but it hasn't been long. This really concerns me as the batteries are expensive. CR123A, check it out yourself and see if you are willing to risk needing to constantly replace these batteries...even if it's every 2 weeks. These batteries are expensive!That is where the Arlo system lost another half star.I would rate the Arlo 4 stars for its excellent design, ease of use/setup, quality, price, weatherproof feature, and most importantly No Wires and FREE!!! cloud recording.My biggest complaints are the field of view, and the potentially unacceptable battery life... (I will try to update in a week or so)Yes, you can argue that the battery costs, are offset by the free cloud recording.. but do you want to risk being on vacation and the battery dies and renders the camera useless?I hope this review helps. Please know that I am not affiliated with either company. I used my dropcams for 6 months and I am merely offering a non-biased comparison explaining each systems own pro's and con's. The deciding factors between the two, DEPENDS on if You must have wireless, want free cloud recording, and if you're willing to spend $$$ on CR123A batteries. Or a combination of those factors.The Arlo is a great product, I really hope the battery issues are sorted out. I will try the Arlo system for 3 more weeks and decide if I will keep it or return it before the 30 day return period ends. I will update in a week or so.Best wishes to you all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2GD9YS0EEII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7EVST6#wasThisHelpful","R2D2GD9YS0EEII","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lightweight hoodie, comfortable, soft, and the sleeves are long enough for me. I am 6'2"" 210lbs with somewhat longer arms than normal.The only complaint I have is the cuffs on the sleeves are very loose, and wont stay up if you like to wear the sleeves around your elbows.The cuffs don't have much elasticity to it and constantly slide back down towards your wrist.

"I wanted to write a review after putting in several hours into the game. I installed the game and the update file before playing for the first time.The graphics are jaw dropping gorgeous. I can honestly say, it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The level of details and the environment (old Paris) is stunning. The movement of the character is fluid and easy to grasp. I do not play FPS type games and have no problems scaling walls, running, jumping etc. The game begins with a built in tutorial which flows very nicely and introduces the story and main character. Once you complete the ""tutorial"" the world opens up and you are free to roam and play individual missions, if you choose to. The combat system is simple, but not boring. which is a good thing.On the downside, the graphics do show some bugginess such as flickering textures, missing textures, etc.. BUT it honestly does not take away from the game. Now, it HAS frozen on me a few times and required me to go to the main PS menu, and close the ACU application. Also, the game has to load constantly, especially before, during, after cutscenes. Sadly, this is why the game has lost 1 star.I must admit, I had high hopes that the issues/bugs were 99.9% resolved, but unfortunately my game has frozen a few times randomly. If you can live with these minor annoyances and get the game cheap/used, I would still recommend it. Just don't pay full price or have super high expectations that the bugs have all been resolved.I do enjoy the game, and I would still recommend it to anyone who is not into FPS games such as myself. I am a very casual gamer, and not very critical of small bugs. Could it have been more polished and refined? YES absolutely! But is the game unplayable now? No, it is very fun, beautiful, and full of exciting things to do. I really do enjoy it as much as Infamous, Tomb Raider, and even GTAV(which I love).I never pay money for in game purchases, so I don't care either way about that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFLLQ0I5S6AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48MUS4#wasThisHelpful","R1KFLLQ0I5S6AP","A22CT4ZGGD2FJF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22CT4ZGGD2FJF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This BT headphone sounds amazing.... especially for the price.They are bass heavy, which I prefer and are very comparable to Beats in the way they sound. The downfall is a much cheaper build quality and construction.Charges via USB, charge lasts quite a while. I would certainly purchase this again. I use it for the gym and it is perfect. Pairing takes a few seconds.I wanted to also say I have a gigantic head (MLB fitted size 7 3/4) and these fit quite comfortably. After extended use of 2+ hours, the top of my head gets a little sore.

"Excellent spiral notebook. Very high quality.This pack includes 2 separate notebooks. One pink, one blue. Each contains 3 subjects separated by a divider with a pocket.I really like how durable the plastic covers are, The pockets are also very convenient for returned assignments or loose paper. Perfect for school. The bright colors are somewhat of a more feminine shade of blue/purplepink, but I don't care. It makes the notebook easy to grab/find in a backpack.Why I took off 1 star.1. Price is VERY high, may be cheaper to buy locally at a store. (these come out to around $8 per notebook!2. You cannot write on the cover because it is plastic (school subject, etc). But a label sticker can solve that problem.Although the quality is excellent, I would not purchase these again simply due to cost. MUCH MUCH cheaper spiral notebooks can be purchased.

"This is a paint-by-numbers noir tale, set in Egypt a few years after the end of WWII. The beginning is fun, with some repartee as our protagonist, Peter Wells, deals with bureaucrats at the American embassy after his travelersâ€™ checks have been stolen. And the end, amidst a (fictional, or fictionalized) revolution, is intense and showcases some entertainingly cynical politics. The middle of the book is weaker. The plot rambles, thereâ€™s no tension, no surprises, the characters are uninteresting and paper-thin. For about 50 pages, the protagonist is referred to only as â€œhim,â€ or â€œhe,â€ making me wonder if perhaps Gore Vidal had forgotten his own characterâ€™s name.Thereâ€™s nothing very interesting in the book, it reflects no special erudition.

"Bill Browder set out to write a Michael Lewis-style tale of wacky life in the financial trenches, plus a Tom Clancy-style geopolitical thriller, plus a tribute to a man named Sergey Magnitsky, who was murdered by corrupt Russian government officials for his refusal to play along with their schemes.I expected to like the ""thriller"" material the best, but I was favorably impressed with the entire book. Browder's backstory is amusing and briskly told, and the tribute to Magnitsky was deeply moving even though I had heard the story before.Browder skillfully uses small incidents to foreshadow later developments. For example, he stopped to help a sick man who had collapsed in the road in Moscow and in so doing may have gotten himself almost arrested by the police. This foreshadows his experience in challenging Russian oligarchs. He thought he was helping, by identifying and pointing out their crimes, but he was soon terribly punished, expelled from Russia, tried in absentia, and Magnitsky was murdered.The book is highly credible, and I raised a skeptical eyebrow only twice. First, in his early days in Russia, Browder describes everything as going perfectly. Were there really no bad investments? No ugly run-ins with gangsters? And secondly, Browder describes finding the data to investigate his first big asset-stripping investment on a CD-ROM being sold by a Moscow street urchin. Really? It seems more likely that Browder or one of his minions paid a government official to part with the data.Regardless, the book is excellent and well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFU3SN6V8H0IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147675571X#wasThisHelpful","RFU3SN6V8H0IT","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story of The Fifth Element is weird enough not to have been done before and never to have been tried since. The style is unique, and the special effects are more than adequate. It is ultimately a story about sacrifice. The priests who devote themselves for generations to carry word of the elements, the Diva who must die to deliver the stones, Korbin Dallas who must be willing to give up the woman he loves, and Leelu, of course, who seems to sacrifice herself.

"Dave Barry has a very distinctive authorial voice and you might think that after reading his pieces for 25 years I would no longer find him funny. Nonetheless, I laughed over and over again when reading this collection. I actually made a mark in the margin at every line that made me chuckle out loud, and by the end had marks in every chapter except one making fun of cable news, and the final chapter in which Barry gives humorous advice to his newborn grandson (a chapter that was clearly aiming to be more sweet than funny anyway).Ignore the putative organizing scheme here -- Barry's introduction claims this book to be about ""happiness,"" but few of the essays have even a tenuous link to the topic. Barry's publisher ought to just label his books with the year, like computer software. This would be ""Barry 2015,"" and I preferred it to ""Barry 2014"", not least because there was a hint of misogyny in that collection that is not apparent in this one. To the contrary, Barry's wife figures well in several essays in Barry 2015 about sports (she is a Miami sportswriter).Little here is likely to become dated, with the exception of a brief essay making fun of Google Glass, but even that one spends as much time making fun of Barry himself, an inexhaustible source of humor for this very funny, very gifted writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4FQWS2VF6E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165959#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4FQWS2VF6E1","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Satin Island is certainly not a book of events (almost nothing happens in its pages), nor is it a book of personalities (we barely even get to know our narrator, and certainly nobody else). It presents itself as a book of ideas, but I honestly can't tell you what lesson McCarthy is trying to teach here. Certain themes recur, but to no obvious conclusion. Near the end he hints that the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche may be central, but I can detect none of the man's philosophy elsewhere in the work. If Satin Island were 800 pages long this would be intolerable, but at 170 pages it's a quick enough read to be buoyed by the strength of McCarthy's writing, which I enjoyed for the most part.Much of the text has a sort of rapid, highly detailed patter to it, reminiscent of David Foster Wallace or William Gibson (if one is feeling generous), Chuck Palahniuk or Mark Leyner if one is not.

That said, the book is nowhere near as good as any of the Harry Potter series.Our heroes are faced with terrible magic and get thrown in a whirlwind of excitement.

"Much of this writing is easily five stars, perhaps most of it, but as a collection I'm not going to go all the way to the top. A number of contributors were allowed to pick the work they liked and perhaps to write a brief (one page) explanation for why they chose the work they did. Too many of these people selected stories that involve depression or suicide, in the assumption presumably that these become more interesting after DFW's death by hanging in 2008. And some do, a bit. The story ""The Planet Trillaphon"", published while DFW was still an undergraduate at Amherst, is particularly striking but as much for revealing how thoroughly developed his writing style was so young as for his insights into clinical depression. And while this depression was obviously important to DFW and his writing, the repeated reference to it in this collection comes by definition at the expense of his writing about other things that were also important to his development and self-identity.The book contains excerpts from DFW's novels ""Broom of the System,"" ""Infinite Jest,"" and ""The Pale King,"" and while I understand the importance of these novels, especially Infinite Jest, to the man's legacy, there is simply no way that any 240 pages of it can do justice to the work. The way to introduce DFW's novels, I think, is to introduce his short stories. And if the reader appreciates them, he or she will move on to the novels naturally.Fiction dominates the collection, accounting for perhaps 600 pages of its length. It is followed by some 60 pages of teaching material, some of which necessarily comes across as filler ""Student info sheet -- name, hometown, campus phone number,"" etc., but on the whole makes me regret never having had the chance to hear the man teach. I suspect I would have failed any course of his miserably -- after exposure to DFW for any length of time I find my speech patterns and writing unconsciously mimic his for days, which he would probably have interpreted as my weakness as much as his own strength, but I would have loved to see how others learned from him. Have any of his students yet made their marks as independent writers?DFW's wonderful nonfiction is shoehorned into the final 300 pages. We get two tennis essays (which are used to bookend the section, a decision I am not sure I agree with as it suggests less evolution in concerns than I think DFW actually experienced), one essay about pop culture, two travel pieces (they've included both the title essay from A Supposedly Fun Thing I Will Never Do Again and the Illinois State Fair essay that did as much as anything to make DFW famous, and these two are, for me, sources of inexhaustible pleasure). We also get several pieces about fiction and writing. No politics or math. The nonfiction section of the book is for me more obviously incomplete than the fiction section, though there too some really striking and memorable stories have been omitted.On the whole, this book is a fine purchase for known fans of DFW, for the few items that have not been published elsewhere, and perhaps if they're wearing through the covers of the collections in which these pieces otherwise appear. The commentaries, though brief, provided mostly interesting discussion of why certain of the selected pieces seemed important to include, or their relationship to other work by DFW. Anne Fadiman breaks this pattern in describing her use of DFW's work in teaching creating writing. For new readers? If they're the sort to read just one thing, better to pick a single short story or a single essay (I suggest Supposedly Fun Thing or the Illinois State Fair essay, though sometimes his piece on the McCain presidential campaign in 2000 or the Kenyon college graduation address from 2005). If they are willing to try a whole book, I generally suggest Consider the Lobster, because of its consistent strength.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FW4V8LPTCO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316182397#wasThisHelpful","R8FW4V8LPTCO4","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this incompetently told tale, a hunky special ops soldier / doctor named ""Clay Harbor"" and his once-and-future girlfriend ""Dawn Knight"" fight off her boss, an evil, sadistic hedge fund manager. The names of the characters, their physical descriptions, and the book's dialog are soap-opera bad. The dialog is so unnatural that it sounds like the over-enunciated speech of semi-educated gangsters in shows like The Sopranos, laden with bizarre exposition that no actual human beings would ever shoe-horn into a conversation, but which the author here must rely on for lack of any more skillfull narrative techniques. Imagine a woman speaking to an old friend, ""are you all booked up with Brandon Dunn, that stud trader from distressed debt?"" Any actual human would say ""aren't you still with Brandon?"" The rest is to tell us, the readers, that the inhabitants of this book's reality are hunky, and that this particular hunk is a distressed debt dealer (a point that is not even relevant to the story).The brutality, sadism, and violence in this story is astonishing. The lovingly described drownings, and arms being torn off, and people being paralyzed and watching their intestines being eaten by bears (I am not making that up), not to mention the shootings, stabbings, and eyeballs being torn out (I am making up none of this). Ben Lieberman may want to consider therapy, after even the first incident of this sort in the book I found myself concerned for his mental stability.Everything in the book is painstaking spelled out for the reader, with no artfulness at all. While some of the financial material or murder techniques would be new to a typical reader, a more gifted author would introduce an investigator who would piece together what had happened and why, and the reader would learn along with him (or her). In this book, we just get long, awkward explanations by the characters or the omniscient narrator.And the finance doesn't even make sense. In the first murder, evil guy Rory Chase kills an old man whose life insurance policy he had purchased. We are told that it was a $5 million policy and that Chase had paid $3 million for it, and that without his intervention it would not have been expected to pay out for another 30 years. If a life insurance policy isn't going to pay out for 30 years, why would it cost $3 million? That's saying that Rory paid so much for the policy that it would be an almost certain bad deal without his murderous intervention. Like he paid $1 million for a piece of canvas so he could forge a Picasso on it and sell it for $2 million. Absent the crime, the parchment is worth only a $10, and the planned crime shouldn't make it worth more. In fact, anybody willing to pay $1 million for a piece of parchment is clearly up to no good, and similarly, Rory's willingness to pay so much for that man's policy should have been a red flag to the seller that murder was intended.There's a little bit of sex in the book as well. X-rated, of course.Anyway, the book is terrible. Don't read it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JR1SSLDBJE7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477825878#wasThisHelpful","R2JR1SSLDBJE7X","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found El Deafo to be charming and sincere and affecting where appropriate. It tells the story of a young girl who loses her hearing and who learns to navigate elementary school as a bit of an outsider. Some classmates regard her as a freak, some over-compensate, but her worst enemy is her own insecurity. Gradually she overcomes.What's best about this book is that the deafness, while integral to Cece (the author and main character)'s experience, it is not the subject of the book. Worrying about fickle friends, and cute boys, and how much to comply with the rules, is universal. You will relate to her experience even if you have never had to deal with a physical impairment.The book is never didactic but it will teach those of us who have never had a deaf friend how to communicate with them more effectively, and perhaps will inspire additional compassion in some.

"This book promises to be a survey of the industries that thrive on and perpetuate poverty in America -- payday lenders, subprime mortgage lenders, tax rebate advancers, pawn shops, loan-to-own, etc. But while all these are mentioned in the book, only the first three types are discussed for more than a sentence. Typically, Rivlin identifies a couple of entrepreneurs in each industry and a couple of the activists who have sought to restrain their excesses, and then described how each industry (or sub-industry, depending on your point of view) evolved, especially since the mid-1990s. It's a decent idea for a book and there is some worthwhile information here.Unfortunately, I found the text repetitive and boring. Too many of the anecdotes were basically identical, and the story, while it has a relatively clear beginning, has no end, so it almost can't help but meander. By page 200, I found myself almost yelling at the page ""we get it, they were making a lot of money and they were good at lobbying the government so that they could continue to do so, what else have you got to tell me?""The material about ""instant tax rebates"" was new to me. The book may be of greatest value to those who believe that the 2008 financial crisis was caused by laws promoting lending to black people (a canard popular with libertarians). Otherwise, the book is mostly old news.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFYNBLNQ859V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061733202#wasThisHelpful","R2FFYNBLNQ859V","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's the nature of a collection like this that some pieces will appeal to any given reader more than others. That said, given the weltgeist and the preferences of the editor, each year's edition tends to have a common feel and certain themes that recur. The 2014 collection features many imperiled children in financially strapped post-crisis families and these stories, even if excellent, are hurt by their proximity to others that are thematically similar. The collection contains nothing that I would describe as a ""genre"" story, which is to say, no mystery or science or adventure. There isn't even any humor, with the exception of Benjamin Nugent's gem ""God."" I will look for future writing by Nugent, and by Nell Freudenberger, whose perhaps-magical-realism ""Hover"" was excellent. Nicole Cullen's ""Long Tom Lookout"" was worthwhile, though hurt by proximity to other similar stories. Peter Cameron, who is presumably not an older, rural white woman, writes beautifully in the voice of one in ""After the Flood."" T. Coraghessan Boyle, who so often impresses, does so again with ""The Night of the Satellite.""A handful of the stories were, to me, uninteresting.

"I've used a lot of different sorts of external speakers with my desktop computer and iPad. The X-mini KAI2 is unquestionably the cutest. It's tiny when closed down and has a sort of R2-D2 charm when opened up.You can connect it to your computer via an audio jack or via Bluetooth. It has a rechargeable battery and comes with an odd hybrid cable that connects it to USB for power (but not for audio!), and/or to the audio-out port for sound. It's too short to connect to both at the same time in most cases.The audio is lousy but louder than the built-in speaker in both cases I tested. To their credit, the designers did not even try to put stereo speakers in this thing. Given the size, it would be a mono speaker anyway, so they just left it as mono.

"The Peripheral is at its heart a time travel story, a genre I generally dislike because there's no way to resolve the plot contradictions they invariably raise. Some authors go to great lengths to explain why paradoxes don't occur. Others skip over the issue entirely. But for me neither solution ever really works. Gibson tries to split the difference, waving away the technology behind his sort-of-time-travel entirely, but explaining the absence of paradox in some detail.He unfortunately doesn't do so well explaining the shocking amount of coincidence in the book, the familiarity of different characters with each other in different timelines, even the reason the main characters get involved in the first place. Gibson seems to trust that he can plot quickly enough that we won't notice these issues, and he is in part correct. The story is a lot of fun to read, and much more rapidly paced than some of his early work.The story contains many characters in two different time periods. Their personalities tend to be perfunctory, however, and with maybe a couple of exceptions they're memorable only for their job titles and the bits of plot they're assigned to execute.Those who expect Gibson to predict the future, as he did in Neuromancer, will be disappointed. Much of the technology in the near-future portion of the book is torn from the headlines -- dark nets, 3d fabrication, online gaming, drones, etc. And in the far-future portion, technology is so advanced as to be basically magic.Lest this sound only like complaints, I found the book fun to read and Gibson used some great turns of phrase. I particularly liked one character's comment that she disliked a group of people so much it made her do ""hate Kegels.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZIFL3WHQNZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158448#wasThisHelpful","R13ZIFL3WHQNZP","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no surprise, I suppose, that Carl Hiassen likes the writing of Elmore Leonard or that Hilary Mantel reads a lot of Shakespeare. But that Bryan Cranston was moved by Moby Dick, or that Sting favors Bulgakov and Mark Twain? Not as expected.This book is a collection of interviews, a sort of ""greatest hits"" collection from the New York Times Book Review column of the same name, including brief excepts from some of the dozens (hundreds?) of interviews that didn't make the cut to be included in full. And to the extent one would have any beef with this collection, it's only in the selection of which interviews made the list. The book is somewhat heavier in writers than the column, I believe, and omits the Arnold Schwarzenegger interview that I found particularly memorable.Some of the questions are specific to one person (Editor Pamela Paul asks Sting about the ""book by Nabokov"" he sang about in ""Don't Stand So Close to Me,"" for example, and his response is self-deprecating and amusing), but other questions get asked over and over again, and this allows us to compare the responses from people of different backgrounds, at different stages of their careers. Most of the subjects take the questions seriously but sometimes they let loose (John Grisham can't really think that Barack Obama should read ""Fifty Shades of Gray,"" can he?)It's a fun collection, easy to read in parts or straight through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5C92EEXSWTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791450#wasThisHelpful","RX5C92EEXSWTT","A1QNYLBG73QRNF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNYLBG73QRNF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of Acceptance and, to a degree of the entire Southern Reach ""trilogy"" (which I put in quotation marks because it's not really three books, I think. It's one book they elected to publish in three parts). Southern Reach was never about plot, of which it has little. It's somewhat about character, but mostly about the imagination of our interactions with powers and intelligences far beyond our own. The bounds of that interaction are described in the first two books, leaving not much for this, the final chapter. Herein we learn somewhat more about the actual nature of Area X and how it came (or was brought) to the lighthouse.

"This is an interesting design - a magnetic holder - so I decided to try it out. I find it to do a good job of holding the phone, with great viewing angles, but to work best on horizontal air vents.The device is simple to use, and can be mounted two ways. First, they supply a metal piece with self adhesive, for those who want to place it directly on their phone (I would never do that).  This is for folks who don't use a case. The second way (and my choice) is to place the second metal plate they provide (which has no sticky back) between your phone and the case. It is thin enough that it works great. Then you can use the universal direction joint to find just the right angle and tighten it down -  it has around 60 degree motion in all directions.  To remove, all you have to do is pull the phone off. I found that I needed to reach around and hold the rotating base to easily pull it off, but it is quite sturdy and doesn't come off unless you want it to. Of the two methods, I think putting it under your TPU case (I use an Otterbox Defender) works best - the bare metal really holds the phone a bit TOO well, and is harder to remove.Mounting is another story. The device fits between the louvers on your air vents, and my Ford has vertical louvers. This works OK, but you have to slide it all the way down, and it isn't really as effective as horizontal louvers. I have those in my Civic, and that works much better.The only disadvantage (and it may not be obvious, but perhaps should be), is that you are blocking the air vent! Well, at least it keeps the phone cool in summer, so it won't overheat.Summary: If you have horizontal louver vents, this one holds securely and is easy to use.

"These gloves looked great for biking use, so I ordered them. I find them to be very easy to get on and take off, with great grips for the handlebar, but to not work at all with an Android touch screen.There is a lot to like with this glove. This is the most comfortable model I've worn; it goes on/off easily because of the velcro closure and fits my hands really well without being overly tight. I have no doubt they will be great for several hours. I also like the gripping edges, which are well situated for handlebars, with gel padding right where it needs to be, and space in the middle for the handlebar. It looks like a biker actually designed it! There is additional non-slip material on the inside of the thumb, index, and middle fingers, which help when working the gears and such. Construction is sturdy, with double stitching at stress points. The material is just the right combination of strength and stretchy.The glove is advertised to work with a cell phone. With my HTC M9, I was able to work the screen with the glove on, but I had to press a lot harder to get it to work. This is acceptable for the limited times I will need to use a phone while cycling.

"This looked like an good laptop for basic use, so I ordered it. I find it to be fast enough for basic tasks, with a solid keyboard and decent screen.There are some good points to this laptop:+ I wanted this device for basic word processing on the go, and for that purpose it is very good. It is not as convenient to pack as my former 11 inch, and at 4 lbs is a bit heavy, but is fine for a backpack.+ Overall I'm finding that I like the size - the screen is easy to see and quite readable. Some folks will complain about the relatively low screen resolution (1366x768), but in fact this resolution makes it excellent for basic word processing; it is much easier to read (and use, overall) than my more expensive Dell convertible.+ I like that HP bundled Office 365 with it, with a one year subscription. The files are executed off the hard drive, which makes it run faster.+ The keyboard is a bit small, but has very good backing and is absolutely silent in operation - great for a classroom. I like it for touch typing.+ The overall construction seems quite sturdy.+ The dedicated keys for home, page up, page down, end, print screen, and etc. are separate and easy to use. This is a fully functional keyboard, unlike some models where the keys have dual use.+ The touchpad works very well, with a solid left and right click. More importantly, the keyboard is situated such that I was not constantly accidentally hitting the touchpad and moving the cursor. I've had some laptops for which I've actually had to disable the touchpad because it interfered with typing - not this one.+ With the default power saving settings, I was able to get 5 hours of screen time. I think this could be pushed with tweaking and turning on airplane mode.+ OK, it is only cosmetic, but I really like the blue color. In fact, the overall design is stylish, while not sacrificing sturdy build quality.+ Three USB ports, although only one is 3.0. What I don't like is that the 3 port is not colored blue, which is industry standard.+ The 3mm port supports both headset and microphone, which means you can plug in an earbud or basic handsfree for use with Skype and etc. This leaves the USB ports free for other tasks.+ The full size HDMI port is great for playing movies.+ The supplied charger is very small (a mini brick), which will fit better in the backpack.There are some things that are less good.- I found that the hard drive has only 15 GB free when booted up. Fortunately, it does have a MicroSD storage slot (unusual, since most have a standard SD), which can be used to store files. They also provide a one year subscription to OneDrive for a full TB of data.- The screen is not touch sensitive, but at this price point that is just a note, not a drawback.- The antivirus is only good for a single month, and ironically, it looks like I will have to uninstall it and reinstall the same program so that I can register it. Mcafee allows unlimited computers to use the same license at home, and it actually works very well.- There is some HP bloatware, but that can be easily removed. This is frustrating on a machine with limited storage space.- I did notice that the laptop has a definite way of operating - occasionally it will slow down for a brief second. But it is not noticeable in general, and did not detract from using it. I attribute this to the Celeron processor and limited memory. You have to work with the machine, rather than fighting it.- When using this laptop, you will want to stay with the basics. This machine is not at all suited for gaming, or heavy database / spreadsheet use. Programs can take a few seconds to come up, but then they run fine. I don't plan on running more than a couple of major programs at a time. I'm actually impressed with how well it works with only 2GB of main memory. Once everything completes the boot process, it runs well. I did not bother running PC diagnostics - if you are interested in those numbers, don't bother with this machine!Summary: A very decent laptop for student use, at a great price. Highly recommended for light word processing and excel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVMORRTVFV0O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CQ8PNA#wasThisHelpful","RVMORRTVFV0O1","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looked like a great box to multi output, so I ordered it. I find it to be well made, with great features that work well.The device has a lot of uses:+ Some older TV's have only a few HDMI ports, so this device will come in handy for those situations.+ Two of the import HDMI ports support MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) version 2.0, which means you can connect newer smartphones and things like a Roku stick to the port, and play content directly to the TV. So even if your device doesn't support MHL, this box can provide it!+ The box will boost the HDMI input signal, which is of use if you have to run a long HDMI cable.+ The remote control provides very convenient operation. A manual button provides capability if it gets lost.There are a couple of limitations to the device.- It is limited to 15 yards input length and 20 yard output length for 1080P inputs.- The HDMI is 1.4b, which supports most of the modern functions, but is not as capable as the newer 2.0 standard. So check your system components and make sure it doesn't need the higher standard.The real mystery is why they included a white MicroUSB cable in the box. It is not used anywhere in the device. Oh well, a bonus I suppose.Summary: A nice box if you have the need for more inputs. Highly recommended.------------Design Notes:The box is made of metal, and is well put together. It has a single HDMI input on one side (next to the power input, which uses a power plug into the wall). The other side has two HDMI inputs and two MHL/HDMI (auto switching) inputs. The other end has the single HDMI output. The front has indicator lights for what is in use, and a single push button to change inputs.

"I listen to music when walking, so I decided to try these out. I find them to have good music output, especially on higher frequencies, with decent hands free capabilities, and an excellent mix of ambient hearing and music.There is a lot to like here:+ This is the most comfortable version of this ""over-ear"" bud that I've tried.  I always have trouble with this sort of earbud - it is just hard to get on. The key is to fit the ear piece first, then rotate the ear piece into place. The rubber on these is very pliable - much easier to use than others I've tried.+ The sound from these is pretty rich, but it is better on high notes than low ones. It is not as good on the bass as some other models I've tested, but I really like the balance between high and low output.+ I found that all buttons worked great (see design notes below). The thing I like about these for sports use is that while they put out a good sound, they also allow you to hear the noises around you. That means they are safer than some I've tried that really isolated the noise - which may not be the best idea when exercising!+ The device features voice confirmation, which helps with pairing and ensuring the device powers down.+ There is no blinking blue light when it is active - I hate those.+ The buttons turn out to be easy to use because they have raised patterns - I can work the controls without looking.+ The sound is controlled at the headset, but doesn't affect the Android master media volume. On some headsets, the ear bud actually changes the phone volumes, which results in my not hearing some of the Google voice outputs unless I go in and set it back. No such problems here!+ For hands free, the microphone is on the control portion, which sits high on the left side - well placed for voice pickup, although you might have to twist the cable so that the microphone faces out. Sound is acceptable, though this device is really only acceptable for occasional phone use, and definitely not as a primary hands free device.+ I have to mention the stuff that comes with it, because it is so great. They provide a very good quality hard zip case with a clip that will go on your bike or exercise equipment. It holds the included spare ear pieces and microUSB cable.The only thing to note that might be a drawback is if you prefer a lot of bass sound or noise isolation. This set is not built for those. Otherwise, no problems!Summary: A great design, well optimized for exercise. If you don't need maximum bass, these are perfect. Highly recommended.------Design Notes:The earbuds have a single multifunction key for power on / off (3 second press), pairing (5 second press), answer/hang up / play / pause (single press), and redial (double press). There are also a button for increase sound (long press for next track) and decrease sound (long press for last track or repeat)..

"You can never have too many power ports these days, with all the electronics around, so I ordered this one. I find it to be attractive, with good power output from all ports, but to have a somewhat bulky design that is best used at home rather than on the road.There are two plugs that put out the 2.1A that is standard for Android and iPad / iPhone, plus two additional ports that put out 1A, which was used for older devices (but can still be used for more modern items - it just charges slower).  I found that all four ports work fine.The only thing that could be improved is the small blue light they use to indicate power ""on"". It is right next to the left most port, and the light spills over through the port itself. It would be better if they somehow shielded the interior of the USB port so the light did not shine out. It isn't a huge deal, but if you are using this in a bedroom, you might want to keep something in that left port!Summary: A great device for home use. Highly recommended.-------------Design Notes:The product page pictures are exactly accurate. This is a fairly large box (3.75"" X 2.75"" X 1.2""), and it attached to the wall with a two prong cord, which is rather different these days (most of these chargers plug directly into the wall). There are small ""feet"" on the bottom to help stabilize it. This is definitely intended as a home device,and is not a lightweight plastic thing - it is actually somewhat heavy, and appears to have a metal base. Due to the weight (and size) I would recommend using it at home rather than for travel.Please note that I received this free of charge so I could review it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U6JPDM55GMPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166M78VY#wasThisHelpful","R2U6JPDM55GMPZ","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looked like a nice gift for my daughter, who likes to write, so I ordered it. I find it to be well made, with a nice rustic feel, and to have good quality paper that holds ink well.The book is made of a heavier leather and is pretty small, just under 4"" X 6"", which makes it a good size for carrying around. The pages themselves are 3"" X 5"". It has no snap, but rather closes by means of a rawhide cord that you simply wrap around and tie. One end of the cord has a nautical themed end piece (which actually functions to make it easier to tie), while the other end has a small metal piece that hooks over the inside clamps so as to form a bookmark - so you open to the right page every time.The pages are brown, and a bit thin, so I was surprised to find that the ink does not bleed through to the next page. Thus the book can be written upon both sides of each page, although if your pen has a very fine point, you might indent the page. This looks cool until you start using the reverse page! The design uses loose leaf pages, so they can be refilled if you can find some the right size that are six hole punched. That is not a very popular size from a brief online search.Summary: A nice gift for the person who appreciates the rustic look and likes to take notes.

"This looked like a good quality cable, so I ordered it. I find it to work well and to be solidly constructed.The cable is the newer 2.0 standard that supports Audio Return and Ethernet via a special set of wires. I don't have anything that supports those standards, but I was able to test it on my 4K TV and it worked fine. I note that other reviewers had problems, but I'm wondering if they followed the instructions provided to reset the electronics involved. The instructions say to ""press and hold the on/off button on your DVD/PS3/Home cinema so that it will reset and start working"", or to try swapping the ends of the cables (not sure why this would help, but it is in the instructions). But if you have problems, the warranty is for 10 years (not including physical damage).I like the construction, with braided cable covers that will help prevent the cord from being frayed. The cable is also attractive, and includes triple density shielding, 23k gold plated connectors, and copper wires. I'm not sure why the product page mentions ""flat"" cables - these are round.One thing to note is that the ends are very stiff. I would not suggest this cable if you have to bend the cables to get it into your TV.Summary: A great quality cable that is backwards compatible for normal HDMI, yet provides for the future.

"I liked the look of this lamp, so I ordered it. I find it to be very compact, and to put out great light, but that there are no (English) instructions provided.The lamp puts out very good light that is fairly direct, and is excellent for reading and detail work. Maybe they list the color warmth in the instructions, but it definitely is not a warm LED - I could characterize it as ""cold"". I was surprised at how well the design holds up - so long as the middle part is not past the vertical, you can adjust the light just about any way you want.The lamp looks much like the product page, but is way cooler in person. Folded size is a little over 7"" L X 1.75"" W X 1"" D. This means it would fit well in a backpack or briefcase for a business trip. It is powered by a standard MicroUSB port (such as is used in all Android phones), but does not come with a charger. It features a rechargeable LiIon battery, but there is no way of knowing how long it will last, because the specs are in Chinese. From the weight, it cannot be very large. I think it is best used plugged in, with occasional capability of providing temporary light without the charger. The unit is also very lightweight, but still solidly constructed. It consumes 1.6 watts of energy in use.There are a couple of things that could be better. The instructions are completely lacking, being Chinese only. The other thing is that the on/off switch is very hard to move. I have to close the unit, or pick it up, to turn the switch.Summary: This makes an excellent light for traveling or home use.

"I was intrigued by the idea of a car charger that also had a built in battery for use without the car, so I ordered it. I find it to be a bit bulky in the car, to provide good charge when plugged into the car and also as a stand alone battery, but that it does not indicate charge properly with my hybrid vehicle.The bank is 5 inches (12.5 cm) long, and a lot wider than most car chargers due to the battery portion. The battery also makes this a bit heavier than you might think. When plugged in or on batteries, it supplies 2mA split over two USB ports, but it seemed to me that when used with only a single device, it charged faster, so I think they actually provide higher power for single port use (the documentation is not clear on this point). Most modern phones will accept a faster charge that 1mA (the output if both ports are used), but will still charge well at the lower throughput. There is a single light that has dual uses. When used from the battery source, it flashes red below 20%, solid red up to 69%, and green above that. When charging, it is solid red until it reaches full charge, when it turns green.There are three things to be aware of when considering this device.1. This is longer than you think. The power port location varies widely on different vehicles. On my Ford C-Max, it just barely fit without interfering with the gear shift. On my 2002 Civic, it stuck out a pretty good way, but again did not interfere. But be aware that it IS long.2. My C-Max is a plug in hybrid. On this car, the device did not indicate charge correctly. It kept blinking red when plugged in, which it should not do. I tried it in my Civic, and the light immediately turned green, indicating the battery was fully charged. I think that there is some interference between the device programming and my hybrid programming, so I cannot recommend this for use with a hybrid car like the Prius, or for a plug in hybrid like my C-Max. I did not test it with a full electric vehicle, so I cannot comment about that. I did not mark it down in the number of stars, because it does work in a conventional car, which I believe is the designed market. Just be aware if you drive a hybrid that the ""charge"" indicator may not work right, even though it is charged. Not being willing to take the chance, I will use it on my two other cars, because I don't want to risk any electrical strangeness!3. Since it is not good to keep a LiIon battery at full charge, I recommend that you charge this only when you are going to a place where you will need the external battery. That means this device is best used occasionally rather than as a daily charger. But for use with camping or backpacking, it is ideal - charge it up heading to the site, then have have some spare power to use. It also means that you can recharge it while you are at the campsite using your vehicle, then take it backpacking later, or back to the tent. This is the optimal use for the device.Summary: A nifty idea to provide a charge when there is no 110v power. Highly recommended unless you drive a hybrid vehicle.Please note that I received this free of charge so I could review it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SIAD3JAQC9K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R3IBN2#wasThisHelpful","R1SIAD3JAQC9K3","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose drinking red wine is supposed to be something relaxing, so you have time to open the bottle and let it air out. Unfortunately it doesn't always work out that way - sometimes you need to open fast, or open another bottle to go around. That is where this handy little gizmo comes in.The device is very simple - just put the detachable tube into the glass part, which then goes into the wine bottle like a rubber cork. As you pour the wine, it is aerated perfectly - the air mixes with the wine just right. This is so simple I wonder why I ever used anything else. From now on, this is the way I will drink red wine. Clean up is simple as well - remove the tube from the glass part and rinse with water. The only thing to be careful about is that you have to ensure you push the glass part on top of the wine securely (or you will end up with wine everywhere - except in your glass)!If there is any drawback to this system, it is that the tube sticks down into the bottle about the length of a standard bottle neck. This means that the last part of the bottle cannot get out through this tube. What I will do is to remove this device after pouring the first few glasses, so the last little bit can air out normally while we are drinking the first bit.Summary: Go ahead and pull out that extra bottle - and serve immediately.

"This looked like a different design than my other harnesses, so I ordered it. I find it to be strong, very flexible for sizing, and easy to use, but to be a bit difficult to release.There is a lot to like about this harness: it has great padding in the chest area, and the straps have a system that reminds me of zip ties (except they can be released). This provides infinite adjustments to fit just about any pet between 15 and 30 pounds or so. It fit my very large Cairn Terrier (25lb) well. Once set, the adjustment is strong and won't let go accidentally. Finally, the leash attachment point is well situated to control the pooch nicely.The only thing I don't care for is the way the harness has to be removed. The latch works by pushing down with one hand while pulling it loose. In practice I found it really needs two hands.It takes two hands to release each part of the harness. At a minimum you need to release two latches, and it can be difficult to get both hands down there - twice - while the dog is wriggling to be let free. On my other harnesses, the adjustment is made with buckles, and the connection is a plastic piece that can be squeezed with a single hand.Summary: A nice design that is comfortable for the dog. Recommended if you pet will stay still to get it off!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDZCEK28HL9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGU5L8#wasThisHelpful","RBDZCEK28HL9O","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice wrap for use just out of the shower. It has a velcro closure that has a pretty wide adjustment range (about 24 inches total), and elastic banding around the rest of the top. The material is a bit thin, so it is not suitable for actually drying anything, but works well as a wrap to use before dressing. It will be full length for my wife (4'10""), but about as pictured on the product page for most women. It is well made, with double stitching across the top where it will have the most stress.The only thing I don't care for is that it is not cotton - it is all synthetic fiber. While this makes it wash easily, it doesn't absorb or feel quite as good as cotton.Summary: A nice wrap for prepping in the morning.

"I needed a surge protector for my office, so I decided to order this one. I find it to be well designed and easy to use.It's a good thing I ordered this. When I plugged it in, the light for ""ground"" did not come on. I discovered that the one plug in my office wall (which was being used for my personal computer and the company routers) wasn't grounded! We quickly ran an extension cord and now everything is at least somewhat protected. And my personal computer now has this power strip providing some surge protection as well.There is a lot to like here:+ Construction is very solid, with good strength metal.+ The child locks, which slide over the power outlet to keep a kid safe - not useful in my case, but essential at home. I much prefer these to the spring loaded ones that can be hard to plug and unplug.+ There are indicators for power (one on the top and a lighted on/off switch) and for grounded plug status.+ It is really nice to see the cable connectors here. This would be great for those home users with antenna or cable connections.There are a couple of things to consider before purchasing. These are not ""deal breakers"" but you should be aware of them:- The protection is only 1000 Joules. I've seen expensive ones that cover 20 times this amount. But then again, those also cost a LOT more.- The cord is only 4 feet, which means it won't reach far. I usually prefer 6 feet.- The wall plug is angled and stiff. I like that it is strongly made, and this means it will be somewhat more flat than other plugs. But it also means that this protector is restricted to the bottom plug on the wall (otherwise it will block the remaining plug). You need to consider this - and not buy two if you want both to work in the same wall outlet.Summary: Not the highest levels of protection, but well designed and constructed. Highly recommended when this is all the Joules you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK17DGKMP2Q3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","RK17DGKMP2Q3Y","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a BT mouse for my laptop, so I ordered this one. I find it to be a bit small for my hands, but to be easy to pair, with good button action and accurate positioning.The mouse is easy to pair with Windows 10 (see below). I found that it moves easily across my mouse pad, and the two buttons on the side are very smooth. Left and right click were fine. I like the fact that it has three DPI settings - I can see that being useful when I'm working on website graphics and things like that. It is in fact quiet when clicking the left, right, and both side buttons, so I guess their advertised ""quiet mouse"" is accurate enough.You should note that the mouse is small, which is great for the backpack but may be a bit small on your hands. I have large hands, but was able to use it well enough - just not quite as comfortable as my normal large gaming mouse.The only thing I would change is to provide a small pouch for carrying the mouse around. With this size and (no Dongle) BT, it is meant to be used with a portable device, and it would be nice to have something to protect the mouse in my backpack.Summary: If you can live with the small size, this is a great mouse for your laptop. Highly recommended.------------------Design Notes:This is a small and light moues, about half the size of my Logitech G602 that I use with my desktop machine. The mouse has the normal buttons, plus a special one (on top) for changing the DPI resolution (1000/12000/18000 - I prefer the highest). To pair, simply hold the right mouse button and press the scroll wheel. I paired with Windows 10 on the first try by going to Settings and searching for ""Bluetooth""  - that brought me to the setting and pairing menu. It runs on 2 AAA batteries that are neatly stacked on top of each other, and features two power save modes (slight and deep) in case you forget to turn it off. The bottom has an on/off slide switch. The mouse pairs directly with your device rather than using a BT dongle that plugs into the USB port.Please note that I received this item free of charge, so I could review it.

"You can never have too many chargers, and this one looked good, so I decided to try it. I find it to work fine, but to have only one full strength USB slot when two devices are plugged in.The device looks nice, with a shiny finish. It has dual USB ports, one rated at 1A and one rated at 2.4A. These voltages are significant, since older phones will max out at 1A charge, while newer phones and tablets will be able to use the full 2.4A charge to fill up the battery faster.In use, I found that the two ports worked about equally well in charging up my phone, provided only one port is used. This makes me think that they programmed the device such that either port will put out maximum, but if both are in use one will max out at 1A. This is better than some models I've seen, which appear to split the charge to 1.78A per USB port when both are in use. At least with this one you can be sure that the one port will have a full output. The device is ""smart"", meaning that it will detect your device charge needs and not over charge the USB port. This is great because you can connect anything with confidence that it won't get fried!There are two features that are better than many models. First, it has a very small blue light to indicate that it is powered up (so I don't have to look at the phone to see it charging - I know it is inserted into the car charge port correctly). They got the intensity just right - it is not annoying at all, but does the job well. The other thing I like is that they clearly label each port so you aren't guessing which has the high power output when both are in use. I plan to have different color USB cables in the two ports.Summary: This one delivers the power regardless of what you plug into it.

"I do most of my meat roasting on the patio BBQ rather than in the oven, and this looked like an interesting thermometer, so I ordered it. I find it to be easy to use, to have accurate temperature readings and excellent display options, but to lack any way to turn off the screen when not in use.The great feature of this thermometer is that it has a colored screen that flashes different colors based on the temperature settings. Blue means it is well below the desired temperature. Within 15 degrees the screen turns green. At or above the set temperature the screen flashes red, and an alarm sounds for 60 seconds to let you know it is done. I find the screen really useful at night; I can turn off the patio lights and know at a glance how the meat is doing.I tested this with a pork roast on the BBQ. It is really simple to use - just set the temperature, insert the probe, and walk away. No more opening the BBQ to insert a thermometer. The only thing to watch for is to make sure the probe wire doesn't get trapped between the cover and BBQ bottom - I ran mine out a hole in the side of the cover. When the screen flashed red and the alarm sounded, I checked the temperature reading against my regular quick probe - this unit was exactly accurate. Just a side note, modern pork is safe to eat at 147 degrees - try it and you will be astonished at how juicy a pork roast can be!There are two ways to use this device. You can use the preset meat/doneness settings (which has the unit set the target temperature), or you can set a desired temperature. I found that their doneness settings were much higher than I usually prefer. Roasts in particular continue to cook after removing from the heat, and I think the settings they provide (while approved by national authorities) will result in over-done meat, at least to my taste. I highly recommend using the temperature mode instead to set your exact desired temperature.There are a couple of things to note about the design, neither of which is critical:It is common for probe thermometers to not shut off - I have another one that stays by the oven, and that LCD screen is always on and unnoticed. However, this unit flashes the screen blue continuously by design, and that is annoying. You can remove the batteries, but then you have to keep track of where you put them. I hope they change this on the next model to have a way to at least turn off the screen. For one thing, I'm not sure how much battery power that screen flashing is using up. I will probably remove the batteries between uses.The other thing that could be improved is that the clip is right over the battery cover, and interferes a bit with opening the battery compartment. It isn't a huge deal, but is a bit clumsy to use.A final note is that for the size of this unit, I was surprised they did not choose AA instead of the smaller AAA batteries. If you are going to have a unit this large, why not use the bigger batteries? There is plenty of room in this case!Summary: A good price for a thermometer that works great. Highly recommended.--------Design Notes:The unit is bigger than it looks, and has nice rubberized sides that grip really well. The front has buttons that change the pre-programmed meat settings (type of meat and doneness), or can be used to set to any specific temperature desired (which is what I used). The probe has a wire mesh construction, which I like better than the silicone versions. On the rear, it features a clip for the belt (used when in timer mode, presumably - no point in a belt clip when the probe is in use!). The clip doubles as a stand, which works really well - but interferes with inserting batteries a bit. The timer function will count either up as a stopwatch or down as a timer. There is no clock mode. It will display in C or F, and runs on 2 AAA batteries (included). The instructions are clear and easy to use, except that they include steps to set the timer when using temperature based cooking - I skipped those steps and everything worked fine.Please note that I received this item free of charge so I could review it.

"This looked like a nice headset, so I ordered it for use when I walk. I find it to have a very clear tone, with easy pairing, good voice prompts, and decent phone reception, but to have limited controls with Android.The volume controls did not work on my Android 5.1 phone (the instructions warned that not all phones support volume control), which is a bit surprising because some other headsets do work with my HTC M9. However, the sound output is nice, with quite a decent bass range and very clear sound overall. The button did work to move the track forward and backwards. I'm pleased with the sound, even if I have to adjust the volume with my phone. The earbuds were very comfortable in the default size; they also provide a larger and smaller size if needed.The phone functions work fine, and the sound is clear on both ends. The headset is not recommended as a driving handset, and I agree with that assessment. This is strictly for exercise use, but it is nice to be able to answer a call while working out.Summary: A decent value at the price: it doesn't sound cheap. Recommended.------------------Design Notes:The headset comes with a small MicroUSB charge cable, and the instructions say to use only that cable or make sure that the charger only produces 100 mA (a very small number; a computer puts out 500 mA). I connected it to my high power charger, and it worked fine. Most modern chargers will detect the correct settings, but if you are using an older charger, I do recommend using the supplied cable. It charged for me in about an hour. The unit is rated for 4 - 5 hours use time, 180 hours standby time, and 2 hours charge. I supports A2DP, AVRCP, HSP, and HFP BT profiles (BT version V4.0).  A single multifunction button handles play / pause (single press), pairing (Hold 4 seconds), on / off (hold 2 seconds), answer or hang up phone (single press during phone operations), and redial (quick double press). The same right side earpiece has a rocker that is supposed to increase / decrease sound and long press for move to the next / previous track.

"This supplement has a lot of the things needed for good nutrition. The Vitamin A is a bit high, but acceptable. There are a couple of things that are particularly good: the Vitamin D (which many people lack due to the use of sunscreen), and biotin, which helps thicken the hair.On the other hand, some of the amounts are just scary large (see list below). I wish someone would just make a supplement that cover about 90% of all needed ingredients, so that a person could simply be sure they are getting all they need, and not large amounts of certain things.

"I liked the look of this shirt, so I ordered it for the cooler weather. I find it to be very comfortable and to fit well.I like just about everything about this garment. The fabric has a sort of ""mini-waffle"" design that is small enough to be understated, but still adds an interesting variety; I like the longer sleeve length and closed cuffs that will keep the air out. The buttons have a two tone rustic feel, and the cotton / poly blend is just right for laundry - this will be easy to dry. But none of this would be good unless the shirt was comfortable - it is. This fabric breathes welll and feels a lot better than wool or solid polyester.It is a bit too casual for work, but will go great for outdoors as an undergarment, or for casual wear around town or the yard.Summary: A nice fabric and a good design.

"I have switched to non-stick cookware for breakfast, so I ordered these to use with them. I find this set to be well made but a bit rough.I liked the paint around the handles, which makes it a bit easier to clean up. The other parts are natural wood, and they are a bit rough around the edges - literally. I got a splinter when feeling them; they could use a bit of sand paper to finish them up.

"This looked neat, so I ordered it. I find it to be useful, with three survival devices all housed in the one bracelet.The bracelet looks nice, being braided parachute cord, but this isn't really a fashion accessory. It has a whistle built into the clasp, a very small device that could do a small bit of cutting (with a serrated 1/2 inch edge, not really that sharp), and a magnesium fire starter that you have to strike very hard (but it does produce a good spark when done right).This is a nice bracelet, but it is a bit tight on me - and there is no size adjustment. Additionally, when I put it on, the plastic parts covered most of my wrist area, which was not that comfortable. I will probably just attach it to my backpack.Summary: A nice little addition to your survival pack. Recommended.Please note that I received this product free of charge so I could review it.

"From the moment I saw this product, I was fascinated - what a great idea for anyone who loves taking pictures. I find this to be a great design, with good features that make it actually useful, not just a novelty toy.The cup is smaller than the typical travel mug, holding about 10 oz. It makes for a good coffee sized cup. The interior is made with aluminum, which is desirable for coffee because it won't capture the flavor, and there is no worry about the plastic leeching into the hot liquid. The top screws on, and features what looks exactly like a lens cover on the top. As for the outside, nothing works, but it all LOOKS like it is a real camera lens; very realistic.There are a couple of notes to the design.- The base is a bit narrow, because they stay true to the SLR format and size it like a camera mount. It will fit in a larger car holder, but not a small one. It fit in my Ford.- The top does not have any means of sipping - it is a screw down lid. This makes it less useful for the car, but OK for the office.Summary: Everyone will get a great laugh out of this one - but it will be a useful gift as well.

"This looked like an interesting BT product, so I ordered it. I find it to be easy to pair and to put out very good stereo sound.The system consists of a small disk that takes 3mm input from your device and converts it into bluetooth. Then you simply pair your BT speaker or headphones and play your media. Simple, but very effective. I had wondered how the headset would pair - there are no screens such as you have on a phone where you choose the device. This transmitter automatically chooses the headset and pairs with no interaction. I had no trouble at all getting my headset to pair. It ranges out to about 30 feet without problems. It comes a 2 foot 3mm cord, a 2 foot MicroUSB charging cord, and very basic instructions. It does not include a charger.I tested this with a Turtle Beach 800 headset, and the sound was great. If you are using it for a permanent installation, I would suggest getting a small power source for MicroUSB and simply leaving it plugged in all the time; for sustained use there is no point in using the built in battery.When the kids were babies, we had wired headset hooked into our TV so that we could watch without waking them. With this device, we could have done it without the wires. The only problem would be getting a converter from the standard stereo output to 3mm jack, but that is easily done. Other uses would be to allow two kids to listen to the DVD output in the car by simply plugging in this little gadget. Really, it has a myriad possibilities, the only limitation being that a maximum of two listening devices can be plugged in at any one time, and that the output of your music source (input into this device) has to be 3mm, like a phone, MP3 player, or computer.Summary: Great sound output from a small device. Highly recommended.Please note that I received this device free of charge, so I could review it.

"This watch looked to be elegant and functional, so I ordered it. I find it to be very large, with sophisticated hands and markings.The watch comes with a nice box and a gift bag, and would make a great gift idea. You should be aware that this is a very large watch, and I would suggest making sure that the person wearing it has big enough wrists so that it looks nice. I really like the watch hands, which are elongated and tapered very nicely, paired with face markings that are just single slices. As a combination, it comes off looking quite elegant - and it looks better on the hand than it does on the product page. The day and date are small (but readable), making them fit into the overall scheme really well. The leather band is nicely understated, and adds a touch of natural class to the overall watch design. The quartz movement will keep good time, and the 30m water protection is all I need for casual use.Their ""free gift"" turned out to be a leopard hair clip in my case, which I won't use, but was fun to see bundled with a men's watch.Summary: A great watch for a super price.

"These looked like a nice set of shears, so I ordered them. I find them to have a great grip and to cut well.These shears are really well designed, with lots of great features:- The grip has full-length rubberized covers - I can hold them securely from any angle, and I think they will work for smaller as well as larger hands.- The blades are very sharp, and the action is smooth. These are spring loaded to open, and the spring is just right - not too stiff and yet quite positive.- The lock is a simple slider that is easy to use even with one hand.- You can separate the parts to sharpen the blades, but it is a bit of a pain to get back together. This is acceptable because I will probably only sharpen them every couple of years.- While cutting, I found these did a good job. The blades are straight rather than curved, and the maximum branch thickness I would recommend is about 3/4 inch thick. Beyond that you will be hacking away instead of getting a good initial cut. These are great for light branches, roses, and such.The only thing I can recommend is that they might consider providing a leather sheath. There is nothing sharp here when folded, but it would make for a nicer experience if I could carry it on my belt.Summary: A great little set of shears for light branch work.

"I needed to connect an older computer to a 32 inch TV, so I decided to try this device. I find it to work well, with true plug-and-play simplicity.Many televisions comes with the 15 pin connector to hook up a computer, but the audio signal has to come in from another source. The advantage of this device is that it plugs into the USB port and routes the sound over to the HDMI connector (HDMI carries both sound and picture). I found that it worked great right out of the box, and the picture looks good. You should note that this is not an upscaler - your picture quality will vary based on the capabilities of your video card. So while movies and etc. will look good providing your laptop can support HD video, the desktop and other programs will only look as good as your card supports. In my case the desktop screen is a bit clunky looking, but that is what happens when you present a 15 inch screen on a 32 inch TV!I have tried several Cyelee products, and every one has had very sound construction. This one is no exception - it is well made and simply works. Sometimes the best products are the simple ones; the less drama in my electronics, the better.Summary: A good choice if your laptop doesn't have HDMI capabilities built in.

"I liked the look of this, so I ordered it to see if it would do for carrying my cards and etc. I find it to be well made, to look good, but to have no place to put the money.The case has a nice snap closure, and I really like that they provide two snaps, so that when it gets full you can accommodate the deeper size. The interior has only plastic slots, with room to carry 24 - yes, 24 - credit cards. As you can imagine, that many cards is pretty bulky, but that should be expected. The case is genuine leather, and is sturdy with no stitching - just a single piece of leather with two snaps and only a couple of grommets holding in the plastic insert. Simple and efficient. It works great for what it is designed to do.The only thing I didn't like (and the reason for four stars) is that they did not provide anywhere to put some cash. I seldom go out only with credit cards - I almost always carry some cash along, for tipping if nothing else. I would have liked a small slot along the inside to hold a few bills. Of course, you can always put some cash inside a credit card holder, but I'd prefer a dedicated place away from the plastic. In a case this big, I would expect to carry cash.Summary: I will hold a ton of cards, so if plastic is your payment of choice, this one will be great.

"I sometimes prefer to carry just a few things, and this looked great, so I ordered it. I find it to be well made, elegant to look at, and very functional for light use.The holder looks very nice, with tan stitching along with the tan strip, all on black leather. It is single stitching, but appears to be well done (and it looks elegant that way). From the smell, it appears this is actual leather rather than the cheaper PU stuff you often see. The slots are just the right size for credit cards, and the interior pouch is good for maybe a dozen or so bills, folded over in half. There is no snap closure - it holds simply because of the design. This will make a great addition to tight jeans and things like that - it is compact, just the right size, and will impress folks when you pull it out.Summary: An elegant design, very useful for those times when you only need to carry a few things along.

"I liked the look of this design, with waffle style fabric, so I ordered it. I find it to work well for absorbing sweat, with a strange but useful shape.The fabric appears to be 100% cotton (although this is the first product I've seen without a laundry and materials tag). It features a nice strap on the rear that could be used to hang on a hook. There is indeed a zippered place for a cell phone or wallet, but they chose to make the zipper into a triangle shape - and it won't hold my HTC M9 in an Otterbox Defender case (too small). That is OK with me, because I would not want my phone or wallet to be in what is basically a towel intended to get wet and sweaty! However, I suppose it would be useful for those with smaller phones doing yoga or other things like that where you could use the other end to wipe sweat.The shape confused me for a minute, until I realized that the intent is to wrap it around your neck while you exercise. It works well in this use, although I would think that a phone would be a bit too heavy carried this way. However, it does do a good job of getting you dry rapidly. There are no washing instructions, but I plan to use cold water with a normal dry.Summary: Good for light impact workouts like walking where you can loop it around your neck.

"I was intrigued by the concept of a pouch to hold cables and etc. for a phone, so I ordered this. I find it to be well made, and to be best used for a Nintendo 3DS or similar device that needs cartridges.The case is suitable for carrying lots of electronic cables, and miscellaneous chargers. I see this as being useful for packing on a trip, so that everything is all in one place; it is a good size for my computer backpack. However, with some small modifications (see below), I think it would do even better as a case for the Nintendo 3DS XL, with plenty of pouches for game cartridges and room for the charger and etc. That would be my suggested use. That side of the case has more protection from outside damage than anywhere else, so I think the 3DS would be fairly well protected.Summary: A well built case, it will keep everything easy to reach. Highly recommended for the Nintendo 3DS.-----------Design Notes:The case is heavier than it looks, because it has an inside flap with lots of slots that are sized for Nintendo DS cartridges, although they are pretty deep for that purpose. There are several mesh storage slots, and a row of elastic bands that would hold power adapters in well. On the opposite inside are two large pouches, neither of which would fit a DS, much less a 3DS XL, but I removed the seam between the two pouches and it made a good sized area for a 3DS. The outside has a single zipper pouch. The entire thing zips closed with a nylon zipper, and construction is good, with double stitch sewing on the outside seams.

"I needed a good looking portfolio, and this looked to be good, so I ordered it. I find it to look nice (except for an easily scratched metal area), and to be well designed and constructed.The design looks really great, with a casual style combined with the elegance of leather, yet using white stitching that give a more rustic look. I like the overall functionality and looks - this is a great way to take notes at a client meeting. It is classy and yet understated. While the backing inside the case makes it a bit heavy, it also means that you can take good notes easily because it is quite rigid.The only problem I have is that mine came with the metal accent piece (a triangle sort of thing seen in the product pictures) already scratched, and I expect it would get even more scratched with use. The surface is shiny and really shows the scratches. I would suggest that they remove this piece entirely from the design, or make it of a different metal that is not prone to scratches. Despite this, I still like this product enormously - it just looks and works so well.Summary: A great looking device for note taking - it will impress the clients. Highly recommended.-----------Design Notes:This is a ""padfolio"", not a portfolio, as I discovered when I opened it. The case has no area for carrying papers, but has an area that accepts a legal sized pad. The left side has an ID compartment with plastic cover, a multi use pouch about the size of large post-it notes, several slots that appear to be designed for credit cards or business cards, and a solar calculator with basic addition funcitons. The entire thing has a solid backing, making it heavier that it looks. It uses ""PU Leather"", which is not genuine leather but looks good, and is waterproof.

"I was intrigued by the idea of a steel door stopper (most are plastic), so I ordered this one. I find it to do a great job of holding open the doors on carpet or solid flooring, and to look good, but to be a bit longer and higher than you might think.The stopper looks exactly like its picture - stainless steel, with three rubberized bands. The rubber does a great job of holding the door. I didn't think the handle was necessary, but found that it does in fact make it much simpler to remove because it can be easily gripped. The rubber banding is not fixed - they can be moved around left to right; I was afraid that might make them less effective, but the pressure from the door is length ways, not left / right, so it is fine. This style would look great in a kitchen that features brushed stainless appliances.The only thing to note is that the door stop is just over an inch tall at the deep end, and 4 inches long (5 with the handle). That is a lot deeper than other stops, and considering the materials, I think it could be both shorter and lower while still doing a great job. I ended up loosening the screws for the handle so I could fold it over when in use - it takes up less room that way.Summary: A very nice door stop if it fits your interior design scheme.

"I liked the idea of having a quick charge capability in my car, so I ordered this adapter. I find it to have excellent charge capabilities, and to work well.The adapter features a Qualcomm certified (9V / 2A and 12V / 2A ) quick charger, which puts out a higher voltage that some phones can support (it will charge compatible devices in 30 minutes or so). I like that this port is indicated by a green USB end (making it easy to identify). The other two ports put out up to 5V at up to 2.4A. I say ""up to"" because the total output is a maximum of 4A, so if you plug in two high power modern cell phones, they will each get 2A instead of 2.4. This is a bit slower than normal, but still very good, and better than my other car chargers. They include a heavy duty 2 foot USB cable.I really like a couple of features:- It is very compact considering what it can do - basically it is as wide as it needs to be for three secure USB ports, and is only as thick as the car electric port. It also looks good, with a shiny finish. The USB ports are sturdy, and the entire device appears to be well built.- The charger is ""smart"", so you can plug in anything, from older 1A devices, to modern 2.4A phones, to quick charge capable devices. All of them are safe because the adapter detects the right voltage and amps for the connection.- The best feature of all is that it doesn't share charge capability between all three USB ports. It can charge the quick charge at full strength, AND two other devices. This makes it great for car use, where there is generally only a single charge port in the passenger cabin.The only thing to note is that they supplied two foot cable has a fairly bulky end due to the solid construction. A few devices are built for narrow MicroUSB connections. But you probably already have a compatible cable ready, so this is not a huge deal (and it fits most devices anyway)Summary: Powerful, with quick charge if needed - a great design.

"I didn't have a quick charger, and my HTC One M9 supports quick charge under certain circumstances, so I ordered this one. I find it to do a great job with charging or quick charging.The device is a bit bulkier than some of the wall chargers (wider than the OEM charger), but not overly huge. It puts out 5V / 2.4A (normal high power charger for most modern phones), as well as 9V / 2A and 12V / 2A (Qualcomm quick charge). It has smart circuitry that will detect if your phone is capable of quick charge, and is smart enough that even older phones will be charged correctly. In my case the smart tech worked well (the M9 only quick charges under 10%). I plan to use it for normal charging, since I don't think quick charging is very good for the battery life - and the M9 has a fixed battery that is not easily replaced.The only thing to note is that the supplied 2 foot cable has a MicroUSB end that is very well built, but bulkier than some OEM cables. I have a couple of devices that this won't fit, because the cable end is a bit too large. It does work on my M9, for example, but not on my MP3 player, which needs a thinner end connector.The only negative about this device is that the instructions are printed in tiny font - I had to use a magnifying glass to read them. But you won't need them anyway - this is truly plug and play stuff.Summary: A great and very reasonably priced quick charger. Highly recommended.Please note that I received this product free of charge so I could review it.

"It seems that everything these days uses a microUSB cable, and many of the smaller devices are no longer coming with cables or chargers, so I ordered this to have some ready for use. I find them to be well made, and to work well, but to have a large housing on the small end.The cables work fine - for charging, connecting, playing, etc. I had no issues at all with that. I like the number and lengths of cables, which will be very useful. Construction is great, with solid end pieces and good, strong cable ends.The only thing to be careful of is that the MicroUSB end is large. While this is good in terms of strength, some cell phones (or bulky cases) will restrict the opening somewhat. This is visible in the product pictures if you look closely - the width and depth is about twice the size of the connector itself. So you need to be sure that whatever you intend to connect has room around the MicroUSB connection for this cable. It will do great for many uses, but not if the area around the port is tight.Summary: Great construction and it works well, with a decent price for this many cables. Highly recommended - but check your device before ordering.Please note that I received these for free so I could review them.

"This looked like a great device for getting my hair dry on cold days, so I ordered it. I find it to work fairly well on the lowest setting, but to be too loud and too breezy on the other two settings.The device is larger than it looks - I have big hands, and this filled them up. It features three speeds - low heat, high heat, and cool air. The air turbine is in the base of the brush. I found that the brush works pretty good for drying, but that the bristles are far apart - it won't really do fine separation. It works best on the low setting (see below).There are a whole bunch of things I don't care for:1. It is LOUD. I needed to capitalize that, because it is appropriate. This thing is going to be 6 - 10 inches from your ear, and it is as loud as a blow drier. The hot setting and cool setting both are so loud that I'm afraid of hearing damage. The low setting is loud, but acceptable unless you have sensitive hearing.2. The hot setting is too hot. The instructions say it is for thicker hair, but it would have to be very thick indeed for this not to overheat the scalp.3. It is bulky. It really is very large in the hand. I think that a blow dryer might be more efficient - hot air coming in while you use a comb or brush.4. Except on the low setting, it blows the hair everywhere. It is hard for me to imagine hair thick enough to use the ""hot"" or cold setting.Summary: It will work on low, and may be useful if you need to make sure your head is dry before going out in winter - but be careful of your hearing! Not really recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTIXFTGHGPJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HJEA4C#wasThisHelpful","RDTIXFTGHGPJ5","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed something to pick me up in the afternoons, and this looked good for a low carb beverage, so I ordered it. I find it to have a slight aftertaste, but with good ingredients, high protein and low carbohydrates.There are a bunch of things I like about this mixture. It has a good ingredient list - I'm not particular about my supplements being organic, but that is a nice touch. I also am not sure of some of the digestive blend components, but I will say it has no ill effects on my digestion (so maybe there is something to it). But what I really like is the low carb counts. They thoughtfully list the ingredients and analysis on the product page, so I won't reproduce it here, but this is great for the low carb eater. With this product I can feel OK about having a little indulgence in the afternoon.As for the taste, I don't care for it cold. About the only thing the chocolate flavor works in would be as a milk shake, using crushed ice to make a smoothie. They suggest adding it to a fruit smoothie, but that really would only work with strawberry - if you are going cold and want to blend that way, I think the vanilla flavor is the way to go.Drinking it hot is another story entirely. This makes a great substitute for those instant hot chocolate mixes that have a lot of sugar. It has a slight aftertaste, but I find that if I put about half a scoop into 10-12 ounces of fluid, it is actually just as good - and a whole lot better for you. Don't overdo the amount of powder, because after a certain point the aftertaste punches through in a powerful (and not so pleasant) way. If you want to try my favorite, mix it with black Lipton tea; this is my relaxing drink in the afternoon.Summary: If you don't overdo the amount, this has an acceptable taste - and very low carbs. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OVKWLESBV4X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8ZA30#wasThisHelpful","R2OVKWLESBV4X7","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice piece of jewelry and makes a great gift. The finish is much lighter than the product page - it is entirely silver in color, not silver over black. I would actually have preferred the contrast, but this one looks good even shiny.  I like that it is not solid - the rear is hollow - because that keeps the weight lower, but still provides a solid look. The look is not as ""Celtic"" as some jewelry I've seen, but I suppose it is the shape of the cross itself that is Celtic - the design (which is exactly as seen in the picture) doesn't really feature Celtic loops.The pendant is made in China, not unexpected at this price point.Summary: A nice gift for the religious person in your life.

"I check my sugar levels daily, so I was intrigued by this meter. I find it to work really well, with or without the great phone integration.The meter is built for the iPhone/iPad, but there is an Android app available on the Play store that works quite well. I like the way it works; you pair the meter via Bluetooth, then take a picture of the test strip container - the meter then makes all the adjustments and entries necessary. No more ensuring the codes are entered right! The test strips are good for 90 days after opening. The meter recharges with a standard microUSB charger (used with most phones, so you will have one available); they include a cord but not a charger. The meter comes with a case, 50 strips, a lance device, spare lancets, a test solution, and the meter itself.Here are some notes:- The meter is accurate, based on comparisons with my OneTouch. I trust the numbers. Also, I find this meter easier to use, because when you insert the strips, it doesn't time out as rapidly (my OneTouch would often time out while I was getting the sample - what a mess!).- Along the same lines, the lance device is the best I've used. It still hurts a bit, but nowhere near as bad as the OneTouch device. Also, it looks very modern and cool. There is logic behind the design, and the button to use the lance is easy to push. Plus, it is easy to ready the lance for use. This is almost as great an improvement as the meter itself.- Please, please, DON'T prick your finger tips to get samples! The side of your finger works just as well, and is far less painful. I put a small rubber band around the base of my finger (gently), which helps get the blood sample.- The sample size is .7 microliters, which is a bit larger than my OneTouch meter (at .5 microliters). I don't really notice the difference, and the strips have worked every time - the OneTouch sometimes malfunctioned.-The app can keep track of your readings by uploading, but the phone doesn't have to be connected for the meter to work - it stores 500 readings.- The test strips are absolutely cheap compared to the OneTouch - 100 strips are 20 bucks for these, whereas they list for 70 bucks for OneTouch (although there are generic strips for the other meter). If you use insurance this won't matter, but for those buying their own supplies, these are a much better value.Summary: An excellent value, a great app, an accurate measure - a great choice all around. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHDUBNPS52WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1IRZTW#wasThisHelpful","RFHDUBNPS52WS","A3MFORLOKIOEQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFORLOKIOEQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Adventure Time Fluxx game, so I ordered this to see if it improves the play. I find it to be a good addition to the Fluxx game, with nice randomness.The add on consists of two new dice, a ""meta rule"" card that supplements the basic rules (if the players agree), and four event cards. As is usual for this game, the results on the game play are way larger than the components. If you run across the new cards, you have to roll the dice accordingly, and it adds a nice additional set of wackiness to an already zany game. Instructions are sparse (normal for this game), but it is easy to use.Summary: A nice add on to the basic game. Let the craziness commence!

"I needed a sleeve for my 15 inch laptop, so I ordered this one to try it out. I find it to provide good scratch and basic protection, but not impact protection.This is just what it says, a Neoprene sleeve. The zipper works great, and my HP laptop fits fine. The material is thin, and there is no padding built in. I think this provides decent protection for a laptop inside a backpack, but I would not recommend this as an only protection. It will keep the dust out, that is about all. But it works about like I expected; I bought it for a laptop backpack, and it works well in this use.Summary: If you want a bit of protection inside the backpack, this will do the job.

"I needed a converter to go to my old monitor, so I picked this one up. I find it to be simple to use, and to work well.The device is super easy to use - just plug in the DVI-D connector to your computer, then plug in the 15 pin VGA from your monitor. That's it. It just plain works.The real mystery to this adapter is the 3.5 mm cable they included. The DVI plug also has an input for a microUSB. Neither of these connections has anything to do with 15 Pin or DVI-D connections, and there were no instructions. The answer is actually pretty simple - this DVI-D part is used for other installations, specifically for DVI-D to HDMI - and HDMI carries the audio signal, so that port is explained. I still have no idea why there is a MicroUSB port on there, but in any case it all works. The ports are there because the manufacturer uses this same plug on DVI-D to HDMI cables.Note that it will also work with a DVI-I connector, and that the connector will work with a ""full"" DVI video card (although this is unnecessary because normal 15 pin VGA will not go to the ultra-high resolutions supported by ""full"" DVI).Summary: Ignore the extra cables and enjoy the adapter!

"I have been using a mortar and pestle to grind my seasonings, so I decided to try out one of these style grinders. I find it to do a decent job grinding leafy items, but to be less useful for things like allspice, cloves, etc.The device works as shown in the product page pictures, with a bunch of parts that screw together. The actual grinding is done by the very top, which has a magnetic closure. The top part has teeth that go in between the teeth right below it; the motion as you turn the lid causes the grinding motion. Unfortunately for my intended use, the teeth are so close together that I was unable to grind the spices (primarily cloves) that I like - they won't fit between the teeth, so the lid won't come down. However, the device does a good job of grinding weeds, which can be compressed down as you close the lid. I don't do ""Weed"" (presumably meaning marijuana) or tobacco products, so I can't speak to how well that works.Construction is excellent, with solid metal parts all around.

"I have a couple of area around the outside that need a bit of extra light at night, so I ordered these to try them out. I find them to be easy to install, to look good, and to work well for spot lighting.The lamps are very basic - just an ""AA"" sized battery attached to a photo collector (with a light sensor so that it works only at night), and a single on/off switch inside. You mount the light (or turn it off/on) by removing the clear plastic portion, which snaps off. It mounts with two screws (provided). The light is weather resistant because the main housing is of single piece construction at the top, and the light mounts below that. I expect it to be fine in an outside location.I find that it produces a fairly small amount of blue light - just about right for highlighting an entry way or walkway, but really better as an accent light than as a primary light. The photo sensor works very well; it only comes on at night.The only thing to note is that most installations will have this somewhere under the eaves of the house - and you need a good six hours of sunlight for a decent charge. Mounting under the eves will limit the sun exposure. I have not seen it run out of juice at night with my 1/2 day sun mounting position. However an optimal mounting would be away from the house proper, to get more sunlight.Summary: It looks good and provides a nice light.

I find it to be very comfortable, with good adjustments and great visibility.The vest is exactly as shown in the product picture, except that the color is more like the band instead of the belt pictured - it tends towards a greenish hue instead of yellow. This color is commonly used in some fire departments because it is so visible and obnoxious. The belt is reflective and very easy to see. As for comfort, it has adjustments for the belt and both shoulder straps - I found that they were just about the right length for my six foot height.

"I have big mitts instead of fingers, so I was pleased to be able to try out this pen. I find it to work fine both as a stylus and as a pen, but to have a rather inconvenient cap.The pen is pretty much as shown on the product page - one end has black ink and the other has an interesting stylus with a flat plastic disc on the end. I was a bit surprised at the stylus end, but it did work very well, and with that plastic tip it definitely has not chance of scratching the screen. The pen is a standard ball point, and it lays down ink well. They provide a spare ink refill with the pen (a nice touch).There are two things that I would prefer to be different. First, there is no pocket clip, so it is not convenient to carry this around except in a case. Second, both caps unscrew instead of pull off. This is a bit less convenient to use - I'd like a pull off cap better.

"I hate to use pockets when walking, so I ordered this belt to check it out. I find it to be well designed and comfortable to wear, with good weather resistance.This is a nice belt for use when exercising outdoors. It has a large plastic clasp closure, and is adjustable on both sides. There are two zippered pocket areas - one 6.5 inches long and the other 9.5 inches long. Both pouch areas are lined with waterproof material and expand in height, but you should note that the zipper is nylon, and therefore not entirely waterproof. However, I think that this will provide good protection in weather - just don't use it for water sports. I found that my HTC One M9 (in an Otterbox defender case) would only fit in the wider pouch. The belt is comfortable around the waist.The only thing to note before ordering is that the belt is elastic and not fixed. If it bothers you to have an elastic band around you when exercising, this isn't the model for you. For me, it works great.Summary: A really useful belt to carry those few essentials when exercising.

"I needed a bag to protect my ultraportable, so decided to try this one. I find it to have an innovative design, to be very well constructed, and to provide good protection.The bag has a single large compartment that easily fits my 13 inch ultra, with two smaller pockets that will (just barely) hold my power cord and a few other items. I really like the way it is made - all the seams are double sewn, and while the zippers are nylon, the handles are metal and it zips well. The padding is not thick, so don't expect this to do a lot of protection against  drops, but for basic carrying, it is convenient to use and lightweight.When I first looked at this bag, I thought it had a major design fail - the handles are attached to the inside of the bag instead of the outside! That means it won't zip completely closed. I think this is actually the intended design, and it is a quirky touch that is actually pretty cool. I also recognize that this design allowed them to have stronger handle connections and a cleaner look for the exterior. But for a little more dust protection while carrying, I think I would have preferred to have exterior handles.The only thing I would change is to make the outside zippers into a single larger compartment, to make it easier to carry a power brick.Summary: If you need light protection, this is a good choice.

"You can never have too much power for today's portable devices, so I ordered this one. I find it to produce very good output, and to be easy to use, but  to be a bit heavy to carry.The device will accept input from modern 2 amp chargers (I used a lower 1 amp), and it outputs a total of 3.5 amps. Most modern devices use 2 amps to charge, which means that if both ports are in use, they will get 1.75 each, but still charge. For best results, I would use this for a single device unless absolutely necessary. To recharge your phone, simply plug in the cord and press the button. Simple and efficient. With this much power, I can recharge my phone over 5 times before I have to plug in the battery again! This would be great for school use.The only downside to this model is that it is pretty heavy. Really, this output and size is similar to what some of the modern tablets put out - and as a result, it is really too heavy for pants or purse, but works well for backpack use.Summary: A great price considering the amount of charge provided - just make sure you can carry it! Highly recommended.-------Design Notes:The device has a single input from a MicroUSB (a common power cord for phones chargers, which is nice), and two standard sized USB output ports. Other than that it has four LEDs that indicate power and a single button to either check the charge levels or turn on the power when charging. It comes with a 1 foot microUSB charge cable.

"A direct connection capability is great for those times when I plug in to a hotel or at work, but my ultra portable doesn't have a 10 Base T port, so I ordered this USB 3 model. I find it to work simply with Windows 10, and to do a great job of transferring TCP/IP data.The device is very compact, and I really like that it will fold over the cord into the main housing. To use, just plug it in, then plug in your wired Internet connector. I found that Windows 10 recognized the device immediately; the instructions say that with Windows 7 you might get a notice that it installed wrong, but to just hit ""Cancel"" if that happens. The device transfers data at the maximum that my provider allows, which is all I need.Why do you need this? There are a couple of reasons:1. Speed. A wired connection is much faster than even the best WiFi.2. Security. For use on the road, a hotel connection is simply not trustworthy - it is very easy for others to sneak (and snoop) on the network, since they generally use a common WiFi key (or even have no key).

"I use this pan in the mornings to fry eggs, and it is great; the aluminum construction means that it heats quickly and you can control the temperature easily.  This is a great size for a personal omelette or a single hamburger patty (7 inches is smaller than you think).

"I love a good beef stick snack, so I ordered these to try them out. I find them to be decent tasting, with a slight aftertaste.My ""gold standard"" for these sort of snacks is the Slim Jim. In comparison, this stick has less texture for the actual internal product, but the taste is similar. I like the sort of ""snap"" that the casing provides. I normally provide nutrition information with food reviews, but if you are eating this, that probably doesn't matter! These have a lot of fat, but only 1g of carbohydrates - so it is suitable for low carb eating.Taste wise, it is really a matter of personal preference. I'd suggest that you buy a single one at a convenience store before ordering the whole box. The only thing I didn't care for (and the reason for four instead of five stars) is that the taste lingers a bit. I like the taste better than the aftertaste.Summary: A good low carb snack.

"These looked like a good replacement for the expensive name brand towels I use, so I ordered them to see how well they work. I find them to have a smaller size roll, but with good absorbency.The rolls are about the size of standard size budget towels, which is at least 20% smaller than the premium large rolls. They are quilted, and absorb spills well. These are not the new ""pick your size"" towels - they are full size sheets (which I actually prefer).  The individual towels are thick enough to have a good feel, and they look good as well.

So far I've noticed no ill effects, but then I use a lot of black pepper anyway.The thing I like about this product is the price. Under 13 bucks is a good bargain for CoQ10.

"As we get older, it seems we lose hair where we want it (head) and gain it elsewhere (ears and nose), so I ordered this device to help deal with the occasional problem. I find it to be well designed, to work very well, and to be nearly silent.I have a couple of nose / ear hair trimmers, but they are not suitable for use at the bathroom at work - because they are battery powered. Nobody wants to be caught admitting they need this sort of device! These work by rapidly closing the spring loaded bottom, which causes the cutting blades to twist inside the protective shroud. I found that with a bit of practice, I was able to move the bottom levers and still keep the blades in the targeted location. This design is simple and really works.This device uses exactly the same cutting design that is used by the electric models, but has two big advantages.1. It is very silent. You can visit the bathroom before your important meeting and not create the wrong kind of ""buzz"".2. It doesn't require batteries.

"These 3 mil-thick laminating pouches are FANTASTIC.  Though they will only accommodate items up to the size of a piece of legal paper, they are still absolutely WONDERFUL.~~ They are nice and THICK!  The laminate available on many commercial laminating machines (such as those at schools or office supply stores) is thin, so even a laminated piece of paper is floppy.  These pouches, however, are 3 mil thick, which makes for a much more substantial item once it is laminated.  Therefore, they can stand up to abuse!  I laminated papers I needed to stay legible when thrown in a camping backpack and when exposed to sweat and water.  These pouches are thick enough that my back-to-back papers laminated in the pouches were able to withstand such abuse.~~ They can be used with dry-erase markers.  I laminated bingo boards for kids to use with dry-erase markers, and they are able to be used, erase, used, erase, used, erased, and so on.  They still look new!~~ They can be used with poster-board-thick paper.  I have laminated business cards, thick fliers, brochures, and other papers that are thicker than standard printer paper.  I ran into no issues whatsoever!~~ They are easy to use!  One end is sealed, but the other three sides are open.  That allows you to arrange items as you need them to be arranged before sending them through the machine.~~ The price is VERY reasonable here on Amazon.  I've paid as much as 0.48/each for a box of 50 of these pouches, which is outrageous.  The prices here are much more reasonable!

"I have hair that is half wavy/curly and half slightly wavy/straight, which makes for quite the challenge in both styling and care.  I have found products that seem to control my hair adequately, but they are unfortunately quite expensive, so I am always on the quest for different, cheaper, more readily-available products.  Unfortunately, my trial of ""L'Oreal EverCurl Sulfate-Free Conditioner"" was a huge disappointment.Despite applying a massive amount of conditioner and letting it soak in for several minutes (up to 20 on certain trials!), my hair didn't feel conditioned AT ALL.  It wasn't soft, wasn't de-tangled, and was just as frizzy as it was prior to using the conditioner.  My curls weren't defined in the least.Once this conditioner was rinsed out, my hair felt squeaky-clean, which might sound like a good thing, but it felt TOO clean, as if I had only stripped it with a cleanser, and hadn't conditioned it at all.What this conditioner does have going for it is that it is lightweight (so it doesn't weigh down the hair) and has a very ""gentle"" fresh scent.  I am sensitive to smell, and this conditioner's gentle scent is far from offensive.I figured out that I could use this conditioner and then use coconut oil for my hair to feel conditioned and de-tangled with defined curls, but the conditioner alone couldn't do that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTE9OQA6ZRWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXQ832M#wasThisHelpful","R2XTE9OQA6ZRWQ","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this Vitamin C serum for about four months now and am amazed at how effective it is!My skin is extraordinarily fair, heavily freckled, and (unfortunately!) fairly ""lined"" for my age (despite wearing sunscreen daily, wearing a hat when in the sun, and avoiding the sun as much as possible).  I have, since the age of 25-30, had deep lines between my eyes, across my brow, and around my lips (due to using straws, I believe).  Around age 35, I began getting lines near my eyes and very deep laugh lines, as well.Trying to make myself accept my lines, I called them my ""lines of wisdom,"" but still (vainly, I suppose) wanted them to go away.  Hence the reason for buying this vitamin C serum!~~EFFECTS ON WRINKLES AND LINES~~Within about two weeks of daily use, I noticed the lines between my eyes were beginning to fade.Within about four weeks of daily use, I noticed the lines between my eyes were less than half as deep as they had been, the lines near my eyes were completely gone, and my laugh lines were beginning to fade.Within about eight weeks of daily use, I had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in the lines between my eyes, the lines near my eyes, and my laugh lines.  The lines around my mouth and my forehead lines haven't been significantly affected, but I can deal with those if the others are so significantly reduced.~~USE ON SENSITIVE SKIN~~I have very sensitive skin that turns fire-engine-red when most skin products come in contact with it, but my skin handles this serum quite well.  I have ZERO redness, don't break out, and have no other ill effects.If you are expecting PERFECTION and to have the skin of a young child, you'll be disappointed.

"I have been a fan of Priscilla Cummings for about ten years now, and her Red Kayak stories are among my favorite young adult books.  I have read the first book in the series-- Red Kayak-- so many times I've lost count.  All three books in the series, Red Kayak, The Journey Back, and Cheating for the Chicken Man, tell the stories of three teenage boys who live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and who are all, in their own ways, involved in a tragic incident that took the life of a young child and forever affected the lives of everyone involved.After we heard Brady's story in Red Kayak and Digger's story in The Journey Back, there was a piece of the story missing-- the story of J.T., the tortured young man who allowed others to control him and thus committed a crime for which he had to pay a big price. When I learned that Priscilla Cummings had written J.T.'s story, told from the viewpoint of J.T's sister Kate, I was very excited.  I ordered the book and waited patiently for July 14, the date it would be delivered.The book was delivered today and I read the entire book in one sitting.  It is one I just couldn't put down.Cheating for the Chicken Man takes place about a year after Red Kayak ends.  After J.T. serves his year-long sentence in a juvenile forestry camp, the sentence he received after being convicted of second-degree murder, he returns to his family's chicken farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  Several things have changed in a big way-- J.T.'s father has died, his mother is struggling with grief and agoraphobia, and friendships have changed. Unfortunately, other things haven't changed at all-- J.T. is still being bullied and tortured by Curtis and other students, the family's chicken farm is still a major commitment, and life is still hard for J.T.Kate, J.T.'s intelligent, honest, and dedicated little sister, can't stand seeing her brother be tortured by the bullies at school, so she takes action-- painfully acting in a way she never thought she would.Cheating for the Chicken Man is a heart-breaking story that captures how there often is no ""happily every after.""  The repercussions of poor choices often resonate for a very long time, and sometimes poor choices might FEEL ""right"" even when they are very ""wrong.""I cried throughout this book as I was pulled deeper and deeper into the world of J.T. and Kate, and I was forced to question of myself, ""What would I do?"" and ""What is the right thing to do?""This book is a realistic fiction book that will appeal to both young adult and adult readers.  While it isn't required, it would probably be extremely helpful to have read Red Kayak prior to reading Cheating for the Chicken Man.  Knowing the ""back story"" will help the reader better connect to, understand, and feel for J.T., Kate, and their mother.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OTLYCY7OYUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426175#wasThisHelpful","R39OTLYCY7OYUS","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought and set up my Worm Factory composter about three months ago, and my worm factory is now in full ""factory"" mode!  I am now feeding in tray #2, and will likely be ready to harvest my first tray of compost within a month or so.  The first tray of compost **looks** ready, but I am making sure it is FULLY ready before I harvest it. :)To set up this composter, you put together the bottom section, which includes a spigot for letting out excess moisture and a ""worm ladder"" to help worms that escape through the bottom tray to get back to the feeding tray.  You then mix together some bedding (coconut coir, pumice, and shredded paper) with some food (a mix of ""brown"" high-carbon items and ""green"" high-nitrogen items).  You then put your worms in the bin and leave them alone for SEVERAL days to let them get used to their new home.  The entire tray should be covered with a layer of moist newspaper or thin cardboard, and then topped with the lid that is supplied.Depending on how many worms you have and how hungry they are, you will have to feed the worms 1-4 times per week, though you **can** go longer between feedings if you give them a good feeding at one time, mixed with paper and other browns.I started with approximately 400 worms and it took them approximately two months to compost everything in the first bin.  I then added a second bin on top of the first, and began feeding only in the second bin.  It took only about 48-72 hours for the worms to figure it out-- they'd have to move up to the new tray if they planned to eat. :)It is important to keep the bedding moist, but not too moist.  It should be like a rung-out sponge.  If it gets too moist, just add some more paper.  If it gets too dry, just add some more moistened paper or greens.  It is also VERY important to keep the Worm Factory out of the rain and direct sun.  My bin is in an insulated cabinet (NOT air-tight), so it stays relatively dry and cool.  Even though it is 100 degrees outside right now, my worm factory's soil is currently measuring at 76 degrees.Good foods/bedding to put in your Worm Factory include:~ Coffee grounds and tea bags~ Junk mail (plain paper; no glossy paper or plastic)~ Kitchen scraps (vegetables and fruits only.  NO dairy or meat should be included, and only MINIMAL amounts of garlic, onions, peppers, and citrus should be included)~ Some pasta or bread is okay~ Egg shells~ Dead plant material (not diseased)~ Dead leaves from autumn~ Deadheaded flower heads~ Newspapers~ Paper egg cartonsI keep a freezer bag in which I put ""worm food.""  I then freeze the food to kill any fruit fly larva/eggs, and then just thaw the food before I feed it to my worms.  This also helps me ration out their food because I seem to go through ""spurts"" of producing lots of scraps, and then ""spurts"" of not having as many scraps.I keep my bin outdoors, and I DO have other critters-- mainly spiders-- that like my Worm Factory.  This is not a problem, of course.  As long as no black widows or brown recluses move in, the spiders are welcomed.  I have NOT had problems with mice, rats, roaches, flys, or other ""undesirables.""  I think this is because I do not include any dairy or meat, so there is less to attract pests.If you need to go on vacation for a few weeks (up to 2-3 weeks), it isn't a problem.  Just feed your worms very well prior to leaving.  They'll be fine!This is a great system for novice ""vermiculturers,""  and would probably be a great system for introducing children to the concept of vermiculture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXAC1N1IENE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PXU9BW#wasThisHelpful","R2WXAC1N1IENE1","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is a tool without which I am already not sure how I'd function.I have CHOSEN to not have a TV on the main floor of my home.  I've always had a stereo, and thus can listen to music while on the main floor, but  it has been a pain to change the music.  I've tossed around the idea of a Bluetooth speaker for a few years, but have never gotten around to ordering one.  When I heard about the Amazon Echo, I got excited-- the Echo could act as a Bluetooth speaker (playing my THOUSANDS of songs in my Amazon Prime library) AND a ""Siri for my house.""  All in one device!A few of the Echo's features include:~~Playing Music from Amazon Cloud Library~~ Having ""Alexa"" (the default ""wake-up"" word is ""Alexa"") play music is super-easy.  All I have to say is something such as, ""Alexa, play U2 music.""  It will then play whatever I tell it to play.  The Echo also works with Pandora.~~News Briefing~~ I have set up my Echo to give me an NPR news briefing (customized to my desires) whenever I tell Alexa to give me the brief.~~ Weather~~ All I have to do is ask, ""Alexa, what is the forecast for today?""  or ""Alexa, will it rain today?""  I have noticed that the Echo *cannot* give me the heat index, though.~~ Audiobooks~~ You can play audiobooks available through the Kindle library.~~ Volume Control~~  You can manually adjust the volume by turning the ring on top of the Echo, or just tell the Echo, ""Alexa, reduce to volume 4.""  It works fantastically!~~ Set a Timer or an Alarm~~  No more need for kitchen timers when you have Alexa!~~Shopping Lists and To-Do Lists~~ Telling the Echo, ""Alexa, add flour to my shopping list"" adds the item to the list, which you can access through the Echo app (free for phones and tablets)~~Facts~~  I asked the Echo to do some math for me while I was building a bookshelf, and it had no issue adding fractions quickly.  I have also asked it to tell me historical facts, scientific facts, and general facts, and it has done well.  *Every once in a while,* Alexa says, ""I cannot answer that question"" or ""I do not understand the question.""~~Home-Connected Devices~~ **I** haven't yet used my Echo to connect to the Hue lightbulbs or WeMo outlets/switches, but it is possible to do it!Setting up the Echo is very easy.  Just put batteries in the remote, plug in the Echo, download the app (again, free for phones and tablets), and follow the steps given in the app.  It took me less than five minutes to full set-up my Echo.The Echo is about nine inches tall and about the diameter of a Pringles can.

"I have a rather ""bad"" addiction to Bondi Bands, now owning over 35 bands.  Of my 35+ bands, almost all are the ""heavy sweat wicking"" variety, which are my favorite.  They fit my giant head extremely well, stay put whether I wear the band across my forehead (as shown in the photo) or across the top of my head, absolutely wick sweat away so it doesn't drip in my face, are cute (especially the ones with sayings), and are comfortable to wear all day.When the bands are sweaty, they can be thrown in the laundry to be washed with other athletic clothes, and they come out nice and clean and ready to wear again.Bondi Bands come in solid colors (such as the one pictured here), in prints, and in sayings.

"I am glad I followed the advice given in other reviews and ordered a larger size of this dress because it does fit somewhat small.  I am a size 4 (or so) and ordered this dress in a size large.  Even in a size large, the dress is quite fitted on top, but loose through the waist and hips.The dress is lightweight and is made of a slightly textured polyester/spandex blend (96% polyester; 4% spandex).  Even though it is lightweight, it has a nice weight, so it hangs well and has a nice ""swing"" to it.  It is a good spring/fall weight if you wear it with a sweater.The dress is ""handwash only,"" though it could probably be washed on a gentle cycle if it is then hanged to dry.When I first unwrapped the dress, I was upset because I thought it was doing to be too short.  Even holding it up against myself, I thought the skirt was going to hit me about 10 inches above my knee (mid-thigh), which would be an issue if I planned to wear this to work (with a sweater on top).  I am so glad I tried it on before repacking it to return it, because it isn't nearly as short as I thought it was.  The skirt actually hits me about 4-5 inches above my knee, which I can deal with for work. I have relatively long legs (32"" inseam), so anyone with legs longer than mine might find this skirt too short.I noticed some other reviews mentioned a belt, but my black and white dress did not come with a belt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N8U32MS3N8ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8FPV8C#wasThisHelpful","R1N8U32MS3N8ON","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several bands for my Fitbit Flex and was THRILLED when two of them came with silicone fastener rings to help keep the band on.  Once I saw how much those helped secure my band, I searched for more.  That's how I found the MDW silicone fastener rings.My pack of fastener rings/clasps came with:~ two bright orange clasps~ two cobalt blue clasps~ one lime green clasp~ one hot pink clasp~ one black clasp~ two margarita green fastener rings~ two cobalt blue fastener rings~ one bright orange fastener ring~ one sunshine yellow fastener ring~ one black fastener ring~ one hot pink fastener ring~ one kelly green fastener ringI am quite pleased with the color selection and feel the rings and fasteners do a nice job adding a ""pop"" to all my bands, including my zebra band, polka dot bands, dalmatian band, black band, etc.My only criticism is:~ The fastener rings are narrow and thin.  The rings that came with two of my bands are twice as wide and made of a thicker silicone, so they are easier to move into place.  These rings are difficult to move into place, and I feel I must use at least two rings to make the band feel secure.I would definitely recommend these fastener rings/clasps to anyone who wants to better match their band and clasp (i.e., my zebra band came with a gray clasp, and I like the idea of using a black clasp, or my blue band came with a pink clasp and I like the idea of using a  blue clasp), those who want to ""jazz up"" a boring band (such as the original band), or those who want to add some security to their bands so they won't lose their $100 Fitbit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32WONMGXMTLJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7TOUYU#wasThisHelpful","R32WONMGXMTLJH","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have now ordered several packs of these Active Basics tee-shirts, and have found that they all seem to be different.My latest pack was supposed to be a 2-pack of white ""short-sleeved, scoop-necked"" shirts.  Interestingly, the shirts that arrived ARE white, and ARE short-sleeved, but NEITHER is a scoop-necked shirt.  One is a *deep* V-neck, and the other is a high-necked regular tee-shirt. :(One of my latest shirts has a neck lined with a light green trim and the other is plain.

"I absolutely love 50's-style dresses, but was very disappointed in this particular dress.  I won't be returning it, but will also not recommend it.~~~Fabric~~~The fabric is a thin, unlined cotton that looks rather cheap.  With a crinoline/petticoat, it looks better, but because it is SO lightweight, it hangs funny on some crinolines/petticoats.~~~Quality~~~~ Issue #1-- The Zipper-- The zipper broke the first time I wore the dress.  It wouldn't unzip all the way when I put the dress on, but unzipped enough that I could get it on.  When I went to take the dress off, however, the zipper would only go down about halfway.  I was STUCK in the dress.  Pulling very hard on the zipper made it separate from the dress itself.~ Issue #2-- The Finishing-- There were random stray threads EVERYWHERE on the dress-- along the seams, along the zipper, and along the hem.  There was certainly not much finishing work done on this dress.~ Issue #3-- The Care Label-- There is NO care label.  It isn't in the back of the dress, isn't in the waist, isn't in the side seam, and isn't in the hem.  I don't understand how a garment can be sold without a care label.~~~The Fit~~~The dress is definitely small.  I am a size 4-6 (usually a 4 in A-line or Fit-and-Flare dresses) and am NOT busty, yet needed a size large in this dress. The large fits me in the torso, but the waist is big, so I need a belt.Overall, I am disappointed in the quality of the garment for the price I paid.  While the dress wasn't expensive, it was certainly more expensive than a dress of this quality should be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOES1Q8G2FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU3YK9S#wasThisHelpful","R2OOES1Q8G2FJ","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have *extremely* damaged hair, so I am careful about the products and tools I use.  When I broke my previous flat iron, I cautiously ordered a new one-- this Xtava infared flat iron.  I was impressed by the reviews, but was only cautiously optimistic because I was so concerned about how the heat could damage my hair.  Thankfully, I had nothing to worry about.~~ Infared vs. Ceramic and Hair's Response---  All my previous flat irons were ceramic irons, which did a good job ironing my hair, but I didn't like how I could hear my hair frying (even at a low temperature of 285*).  I don't hear my hair fry with this iron.~~ Flattening Quality--- This iron does a great job ironing my naturally wavy hair into a smooth style.  My hair looks NATURALLY straight, not flattened straight.  I like that!~~ Heating Time--- This iron does seem to take a little longer to heat than my previous irons, but it is still ready within a more than reasonable time.  It takes approximately two minutes to heat to 285*.~~ Cord Length--- This iron has a nice, long cord, so I can plug it in and easily maneuver around without difficulty.  I am no longer tied to one spot only inches away from the outlet.~~ Storage--- The iron comes with a zippered bag that is lined in a heat-resistant fabric.  It is very nice!~~ Overall impression--- I am very impressed.  My hair looks good, the iron is easy to use, and the manufacturer seems responsive.

From Amababa, I now have the dalmatian band, the black and white polka dot band, and an orange band, and I am quite happy with all of them!While some have complained that these bands fall off easily, I haven't found that they are any less secure than the original band.  In fact, they are more secure because they have a silicone piece that goes around the clasp/band to hold it closed.

Yes, it is embarrassing how many I have.I had wanted a Maggie Bags Butterfly Bag, but couldn't justify it when I had so many other great bags.  When I heard Maggie Bags was closing its doors, and thus was clearing out all their bags, I ordered a Butterfly Bag for myself as well as another as a gift. :)I carry A LOT with me, so I need big bags.  The Butterfly Bag not only is more than large enough for all the things I carry (a wallet, a small file of coupons, three pairs of sunglasses, two sets of keys, makeup, Epi-pens, inhalers, my phone, and more), it has plenty of room left for me to throw in a small jacket or pashmina, a small umbrella, or small purchases.  It is huge.Inside, there is an elasticized pocket on one ""short"" side (perfect for a small water bottle, I suppose, though I use it for my work ID's and keys), a set of organizing pockets along a long side (including space for pens and a phone), and a zippered pocket along the other long side.  On the outside of the bag, there are two zippered pockets inside the ""wings.""  These pockets are tiny, but work well for a bus or train pass, a key, a lipstick, or something else small that you wouldn't want to lose inside the big portion of the purse.The bag has two handles that fit well over an arm or the shoulder.This bag is so large that some may find it even works as a small carry-on on a plane.

"My dog LOVES her treats, but is insanely picky about her chews.  She won't touch most chews, including ones that most dogs usually like-- antlers, bully sticks, etc.  She *will* chew on a rawhide or cow leg bone from time-to-time, but quickly loses interest in those, as well.  I would just buy her treats, but she needs the chews to help clean her teeth.  When I heard about the Himalayan Dog Chews (on Shark Tank!), I decided to give them a try, with the hope that I wouldn't be throwing away $10+ on something she wouldn't show an interest in for more than a few minutes.She didn't lose interest AT ALL.  In fact, she goes searching for her Himalayan Dog Chews (HDC's), seeking them out over any other treat or chew.The large size HDC is perfect for my 50-pound yellow lab.  It is small enough she can carry it around, but large enough that she cannot bite it in half or quarters.The HDC makes ME happy because it doesn't stain my carpet or rugs, doesn't smell bad (as a vegetarian, many meat-based dog treats make me gag because of their smell), and doesn't upset my girl's tummy.  She can chew on the treat/chew to her heart's delight and I don't see any negative effects (stains, smells, or vomit).The HDC makes my dog happy because it is easy for her to hold in between her paws, it apparently tastes good, and it doesn't upset her belly.The HDC **is** expensive, but is SO worth it (in my not-so-humble opinion).  My dog is a ""moderate"" chewer, so owners might have a different experience with ""heavy"" chewers.  For my dog, the HDC lasts about 2-4 hours of constant chewing, or about two weeks of every-once-in-a-while chewing (when I hide it in between chewing sessions).  When my dog gets the HDC down to a nub, I just microwave it for about 40 seconds, which ""puffs"" it up so she can hold it again.I think the HDC might be my (and my dog's) favorite chew/treat/toy.

Even more amazing is how damp the towel can be and that it can then be entirely dry in a matter of an hour or less.  Incredible!Both of my Sinland microfiber towels are white, so I haven't had issues with them bleeding color the way others have noted with their brightly-colored towels.

"I was so excited to order these and put them into use at work, where I have cables that can look like a mess of Medusa snakes if I don't keep them under reign.  As a teacher who uses lots of technology, I have a lot of cables and wires to control on just one cart-- projector, DVD player, VHS player (yes...), document camera, docking station, speakers with sub-woofer, two lamps, and SmartBoard.I thought these clips would be perfect.  I could attach them (they use a double-sided tape) along the side of the cart, and guide all the different wires and cords through them.The first clip worked well for three cords.  Then I put two more on the cart, and both broke as soon as I clipped them shut.  The fourth one broke as soon as a student unclipped it and reclipped it (gently!).I am disappointed by the quality of the clips.

"I now have four sets of Xtenex laces, with another set on its way. These are truly the best laces I've ever used, and I've used A LOT!I like to run short races (5K's and 8K's), but struggle with my shoes and laces for several reasons. 1) I have to wear gloves to run if the temperature is below about 45, and gloves and shoe laces don't mix well. 2) I have broken my feet so many times that they now swell randomly, and swelling makes shoes get too tight too quickly. 3) I am lazy and like to slip my shoes on and off rather than having to untie them.I have used Lock Laces for the past few years, and have loved them, but they aren't the perfect solution all the time. I LOVE my Lock Laces, but they keep constant pressure on my feet, which can either be a good thing, or it can be very painful.At a race last year, a friend of a new friend introduced me to Xtenex laces and told me they are revolutionary. I ordered a pair and tried them, and he was right! They are PERFECT!1) While they aren't easy to get set in your shoes, once they are set, they are set. That's it. You don't have to adjust them for different thicknesses of socks, and they stretch enough to accommodate some swelling.2) You can set them to be tighter on some parts of your foot than on others, which is helpful for those of us with ""unique"" feet (a common issue among runners).3) They are tight enough to keep the shoes correctly on your feet, but aren't so tight that they cause pain.4) They allow triathletes to slip their shoes on and off without much difficulty at all. This also comes in handy at airports, when shoes might have to come on and off to go through security.5) They are fun! They come in lots of fun colors (I have royal blue in one pair of running shoes, neon yellow in another pair of running shoes, black in a pair of boots, and vanilla/brown/black in a pair of hiking shoes. Bright pink is on its way for yet another pair of running shoes!), and can really ""pep up"" a boring pair of shoes.Xtenex laces are expensive for a pair of shoe laces. Very expensive. However, they are worth every penny. The ease of use and comfort they provide makes them worth every bit of their high price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VNO9QVT5MS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004697DII#wasThisHelpful","R33VNO9QVT5MS1","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This petticoat is a ""one-size-fits-most"" size, so it is big on me (a size 2-6 depending on manufacturer), but it works just fine.  I just pinned it a bit at the waist so it fits better.The petticoat is VERY sheer at the top, so it really couldn't be worn as an undergarment that will be seen in costume changes (if you want modesty, that is).  This is probably more of an issue for actors/costumers who want this petticoat as part of a costume, but I just wanted to note that.Like most petticoats, this petticoat will make you itch if you don't put a slip between it and your skin.  That's typical of petticoats, though.At 26"" long, this petticoat will fit fantastically under most 50's-style dresses and skirts, and it does a great job making the skirts ""pop"" in a 50's-style way.

The top, near my neck, gaps a bit, but the bust fits just fine.  The waist is a little large, but can be cinched in with a belt once I find one that fits and looks good with the dress.I ordered a 22"" petticoat to go with this dress, but it hasn't yet arrived, so I tried the dress with a 26"" petticoat I already had, and it fits well.

"If you have dry skin and/or hair, this can be a miracle product!~~~~ USE ON HAIR ~~~~I have horrifically dry, damaged hair and thus spend an absolutely embarrassing amount of money on haircare products.  I do believe I've tried almost every product that exists, and while some work decently, or even quite, well, nothing has been perfect (yet...) either because it doesn't work that well OR because it's cost-prohibitive to continue using the product.After having read about coconut oil and its fantastic health benefits inside and out, I decided to try it as a moisturizer and conditioner.WOW!Coconut oil becomes liquid at 76 degrees, so it stays in a liquid state in my bathroom in the summer (when it is HOT upstairs).  Therefore, I do not have to liquefy it when I use it in the summer.  In the winter, I have to put a spoonful of coconut oil in a glass container and place that in hot water so the solid oil is liquefied.  No big deal.All I do is rub the oil through my **dry** hair, concentrating on the ends.  I then brush the oil through, wrap my hair up into a loose bun, wrap a towel or showercap around the bun, and relax or work for about two hours.  Then, after two hours, I rinse my hair, then wash it well (especially near my scalp), and let it hair dry.WOWZA!My natural waves are soft, not frizzy, and my fly-away hairs are better controlled.  My auburn color POPS because it is shiny instead of dry as dust.  It is great!You do have to be very careful to wash the oil out well so your scalp doesn't look greasy.~~~~ USE ON SKIN ~~~~My skin is so dry that it flakes.  However, I am allergic to many ingredients in traditional lotions, so I can't use them.  All-natural coconut oil works BEAUTIFULLY on my dry skin, and it doesn't cause any allergic issues!  Hurray!I also love how the coconut oil moisturizes (beautifully) without making my skin greasy.  The oil just sinks into my very thirsty skin.  It's great!This oil works FANTASTICALLY as a pre-paraffin treatment on my rough feet.  I just coat my feet in coconut oil, then dip them in a paraffin bath, and let the heat of the paraffin push the coconut oil into my rough-as-sandpaper feet.~~~~ USE ON FACE ~~~~I tried using this coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, but it is a bit too heavy for my very, very sensitive facial skin.  While it certainly does moisturize well, it seems to clog my pores, as well.I also tried using this coconut oil as a makeup remover (as I read in a magazine).  It worked well to remove makeup, but it didn't work well with my contact lenses.  It is too oily and makes my vision blurry for HOURS after I use it on my eyes.I would HIGHLY recommend coconut oil as a hair and skin moisturizer.  It will soften and moisturize even the toughest skin and driest hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RCKITGFIKK67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNTPEWU#wasThisHelpful","R3RCKITGFIKK67","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first discovered these ""Five Star Flex Hybrid Binders"" about three years ago and excitedly bought a 1-inch-capacity binder to use as my teacher plan book/ grade book.  It SEEMED to be perfect for my needs-- small enough to easily fit in my school-to-home-to-school bag, light enough to carry to and from meetings, flexible enough to be effective for my needs, and ""stocked"" enough (with dividers and pockets) to not require me to have to buy new dividers.  In addition, it was Five-Star brand, and I have always been impressed by their products.  I *thought* I had found the perfect plan book/grade book.  I was wrong.The binder worked out beautifully for me for about two or three months, but by Thanksgiving, it was struggling.  One of the rings would **barely** stay in the hole, and another was bent at a very funny angle.  By the New Year, it had to be replaced because all three rings were no longer staying locked.Thinking that my issue was that I tried to open and close the binder too often, I bought a **new** Five Star Flex Hybrid NoteBinder for the following school year, but that time bought a 1.5-inch.  I got ALL my necessary papers for the ENTIRE year together, put them in the order I wanted them, and opened the rings one time to ""load"" the binder, and then closed the rings (I used sheet protectors for some papers that have to be switched often so I wouldn't have to open the rings).  That binder lasted longer than the one the previous year, but was still ""done"" by spring break.  Again, the rings bent in a funny way and that caused one of the rings to no longer ""lock.""I didn't use one of these binders last school year, but after hearing that the technology was improved, and that now Mead/Five Star stands behind their guarantee that this binder *will* last an entire school year, I bought another one (another 1.5-inch) for this school year.  It's been in use for only two weeks, but is already showing issues with one of the rings.I am a *teacher,* not a student, so my binder probably takes far less abuse than a student's binder.~~ I only open and close my binder a few times per school year, while a student would likely open and close it a few times per HOUR.~~ I don't shove my binder into a locker, a backpack, or other small space.  Mine is brought to and from school in my ""school bag,"" but it is a big bag that offers *protection* to the binder.~~ I don't sit on, stand on, toss, drop, or throw my binder as some students do (yes, they do this).  It sits quietly on my desk or shelf until I need it.I certainly don't dislike this binder (it certainly has some fantastic features!), but am also far from thrilled with it.  I would recommend it with caution.  If you or your child is rough on supplies, this is probably not the binder for you/your child.  But if you or your child is easy on supplies, it might be worth a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J30SB3NUH5IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OCQSB6#wasThisHelpful","R2J30SB3NUH5IZ","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To fold it, you squeeze the two red tabs on the handle, then squeeze the handle that's in the base.  It then folds completely, including the wheels folding in.

The internal frame can be bent to fit the wearer's body, and directions are included to help the wearer figure out where to adjust the backpack to make it comfortable.  There are pads on the back of the pack to protect the wearer's spine from being irritated by the center stabilizing bar.The straps on this pack are well-padded and quite comfortable to wear, but the backpack offers two additional ways to make the pack more stable and comfortable-- a great waist band and a sternum clip.  The waist band on the backpack is very comfortable and very stable.  To further stabilize this pack, there is also a sternum clip.The entire back of the pack has ""Dynamic Air Flow"" to make it more comfortable to wear, especially in hot or humid climates.There are several straps and compression straps to further personalize the backpack.

"When I run, I need to be able to carry my phone, Epi-pens, keys, tissues, and an inhaler, so I need a belt that can handle my ""carry everything but the kitchen sink"" needs.  While I adore some of my other running belts, I wanted to try something that would allow me to spread my things out so they would not bounce around.  The FlipBelt is PERFECT for this need.I waffled on which size to order, but finally went with the size smaller than I thought I'd need because I didn't want the belt to ride up while I was running.

"I have *always* been a ""bug magnet.""  In fact, my family used to tease that they could be sure they wouldn't get bitten by bugs if they brought me with them because all the bugs would bite me instead of them.  Even with use of bug spray (DEET) when I am going to be outside for more than a few minutes, I usually have no fewer than 15 mosquito bites at a time.  I also seem to have a talent for picking up ticks when just strolling along a sidewalk in my suburban neighborhood.  Like I said, I am a bug magnet.With the higher incidence of mosquito-borne and tick-borne illnesses lately, I am getting more worried about the fact that I am so often targeted.  So I decided to take action.I began treating a few sets of workout clothes, several pairs of socks and shoes, my outdoor chair, and a set of hiking clothes with permethrin so I would have more protection from mosquitoes and ticks.  A 24-ounce bottle of Sawyer Premium Permethrin treats a few sets of clothes, and each treatment lasts approximately 4-6 weeks OR 6 washings.  I am currently on my second bottle of Sawyer Premium Permethrin, having just emptied my first bottle.Permethrin works differently than DEET.  Permethrin is odorless once it is dry (though it STINKS when wet!), and is not really a repellent.  Instead, it is an inhibitor-- it actually kills any bugs that stay in contact with the treated clothing/gear.So does it work?  YES!I do still have to treat exposed skin with DEET, but no longer do I wind up with mosquito bites through my running pants.  No longer do I have mosquito bites through my socks.  No longer do I find ticks crawling on me after simply walking my dog down the sidewalk.A few basics about use of this product:~~ It lasts well over a month OR for about 6 washings (though Sawyer recommends hand-washing garments).~~ It will last on items put in storage, but exposure to light does break it down a bit, so Sawyer recommends storage in dark plastic if you must store the treated items and expect any chemical to remain.~~ It works best when you treat ALL your clothing and gear, not just one item.  You also do have to completely permeate the fabric, so it takes quite a bit of permethrin to treat gear and clothes.  Again, a 24-ounce bottle should treat a few sets of clothes-- approximately 8 items total.~~ It **cannot** be used on skin, but works quite well on gear and clothing when it is used correctly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FESWIK4TFTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA950E0#wasThisHelpful","R39FESWIK4TFTY","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very problematic hair-- it is damaged from washing too often, poor nutrition, genetics (dry!), and several other ""assaults"" against it.  Because it is so damaged, but I want it to look like it is NOT damaged, I have spent a small fortune on products to help it look better.When I saw this Fructis Marvelous Oil Color Illuminate at the store, and realized that it looked like a clone for one of my very pricey salon products, I decided to give it a try.My hair is relatively long-- reaching my shoulder blades when it is brushed straight (it is naturally wavy, so it seems shorter when it is left natural).  Because of its length and its extreme dryness, I decided to use a little more of this oil than is generally recommended.  Below is my experience with the oil in several different ""settings.""1) *Applied to damp hair prior to blow-drying*  I applied six pumps of this oil to my hair and then used a blow dryer with diffuser to dry my hair into its natural waves.  The oil was a little heavy (perhaps three or four pumps, or brushing it in to better distribute it, would have been better!), but it did make my waves look smooth instead of their typical frizzy look.  I'd give this application three-and-a-half stars.2) *Applied to soaking-wet hair prior to allowing hair to dry naturally*  I again applied six pumps of this oil to my hair, brushed it through to distribute it evenly, and then allowed it to dry naturally.  This actually worked much better!  While it was a little heavy near my scalp (although I didn't apply the oil near my scalp, brushing it into the hair distributed it near my scalp a bit), it made the rest of my hair look fantastic!  It was slightly weighted down (again, six pumps is probably too much), but I had little-to-no frizz.  I'd give this application four-and-a-half stars.3) *Applied to dry hair prior to flat-ironing*  I applied three pumps of this oil to my dry hair, brushed it into the hair, and then used a low-temp flat-iron.  This worked well, and my hair looked VERY shiny.  I STRONGLY caution others, though, about using oil and high heat.  This is the same as FRYING your hair.  I used a LOW-heat flat-iron, and even that is risky.  I am not assigning stars to this application because it is not one I would advocate others using unless they are very careful.4) *Applied to dry hair-- ends only-- to smooth split-ends and frizz*  I again used three pumps of the oil, but applied it only to the ends, and brushed it into the ends only.  I didn't like the look of this application.  My hair was frizzy up to the last three-or-so inches, where it was greasy.  I would give this application two stars.5) *Applied to wet hair, left in overnight, and rinsed out in the morning*  I used six pumps of the oil, applied it to my wet hair, tied my hair up into a loose bun, and left it to ""soak"" overnight.  In the morning, I then rinsed it out.  Or tried to rinse it out, rather.  This  oil doesn't *rinse* out; shampoo is required, which strips the hair of the oil, leaving it the way you started.  My hair was slightly softer, but not enough to make me happy.  I'd give this application three stars.6) *Added to hair conditioner*  I added two pumps of this oil to a handful of my regular conditioner (in the shower) and rinsed it out.  WOW.  This was FANTASTIC!  My hair was soft, close to frizz-free, and shiny!  I'd give this application five stars.7) *Applied to ends of hair in shower prior to shampooing scalp*  I applied three pumps of this oil to the ends of my hair prior to washing the rest of it with shampoo.  The oil protected the ends of getting dried out by my shampoo, and the little bit of shampoo that did rinse over the ends of my hair removed enough of the oil that it didn't ""goop"" the way application #5 did.  I'd give this application four stars.Overall, I am happy with this product.  It does offer some fierce competition for my expensive salon products, but for about 1/4 the cost.  It is a LITTLE bit too heavy, but once you learn how much is needed for *your* hair, it is easily managed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D24GNJQ0NMZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4BMEWY#wasThisHelpful","R3D24GNJQ0NMZM","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is cute, but is VERY simple.  It is composed of a few small pieces that make up a sand with small pier, and then a handful of pieces that make up the water scooter on which the ""Friend"" rides.The entire set took an eight-year-old less than seven minutes to put together because the scooter itself is only a handful of pieces.  The ""beach scene,"" with the ""pier"" is 100% pointless.  The ""pier"" is only a 2x4 ""bump"" piece, which is so tiny that there is truly no point to it.The set is cute, but there is so little to it that I don't think it is worth the price tag.

"This set, like most ""Creator"" sets, is a 3-in-1 set.  One can choose which style seaside house he/she wants to build.  Very clear directions are included for all the options.Option 1, the seaside hut, is considered the easiest buildOption 2, the seaside apartment, is considered the average buildOption 3, the seaside house, is considered the most-advanced buildThis set does not come with a large building base, but instead comes with several small plates that get connected together to form the building base.  This works adequately well, and does seem to be the ""norm"" now.  I choose to build the house on a large Lego building plate to strengthen the build and to be able to attach the ""random"" pieces (palm tree) that are not designed to be attached to the other building plates.I have now built all three of the options as instructed and found that, for an adult, they were all relatively easy builds.  When I provided the set to an 11-year-old and 8-year-old, they had no problems building the two easier builds, but struggled with the house build because the top floor is fragile, and they couldn't get everything attached without help.After trying out the three builds Lego recommends, we built the most-advanced build, but modified it by adding a TON more bricks to make the house a seaside ""mansion."" :)This set is very cool, and some of the details are quite interesting.  For example, the house has an outdoor shower with towel rack, and it also includes directions and blocks to make ""rolling waves.""  These are details I wouldn't expect in a set that it priced to be one of the more ""introductory"" sets.There are also some other neat details in this set, including an osprey or eagle that sits in the palm tree, a small sandcastle, and a mounting ""hook"" for the surfboard.This set comes with several more-rare pieces, including:* pale blue bricks* a silver fish* an orange crab* a white surfboardThe ONLY ""cons"" I found with this set are:* The building plates can be tough for kids to all fit together without assistance* The set only comes with one mini-figure* There are few details inside the seaside house(None of these ""cons"" are significant enough to make me downgrade the set's rating)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXR7SDZXKJXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q0OMJW#wasThisHelpful","R2CXR7SDZXKJXB","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very fun set that is quite easy to build.  What could be better? :)This set includes three main parts-- a firetruck, an ambulance, and a police motorcycle, as well as a crook (who the police officer chases), a skate boarder (who the paramedic/EMT assists), and a fire in a box (trashcan?  crate?) that the firefighter fights.This set was completely assembled by an eight-year-old and a six-year-old in a matter of about ten minutes, and they didn't struggle with any of the tiny little pieces- not even the teeny-tiny face mask the firefighter can wear when using the oxygen mask.Each of the main pieces-- the ambulance, fire truck, and motorcycle-- comes with its own set of directions, and is bagged in its own labeled bag, so there is little room for error or confusion.After assembling the pieces, this set offered over four hours of imaginative, cooperative playtime during which time a ""public safety center"" (hospital-police station-fire station cross) was assembled from random bricks, some old Lego pirate ship pieces (including a shark, a dinghy, and a parrot) were thrown into the mix as catalysts for public safety emergencies, and a cafe was assembled for the public servants to enjoy a snack and cup of coffee.  After four hours of straight play, the kids were tired, but they refused to disassemble the pieces because they were to be used the next day.I love that this set celebrates public servants and is relatively easy for kids to assemble on their own.  It has enough pieces to make elementary-aged children feel they are assembling an age-appropriate set, but not so many that they get frustrated.  The **only** suggestion I have for improvement of this set is to make the top of the firetruck and ambulance *hinged* to make it easier to get the figures in and out of the trucks.  Otherwise, this set is perfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKQ8RS3NI8A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0QS6E4#wasThisHelpful","R2YKQ8RS3NI8A7","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These goggles fit quite tightly around the inner eye/nose, which is great for keeping water out, but NOT great for comfort.  I typically can wear these goggles for about 15 minutes before they have pushed so hard against my inner eyes and nose that I have bruises.  I then can't wear them for about three to four days while the bruises heal.(And, YES, I have tried loosening the strap.  That doesn't help because the issue is the hard plastic and lack of padding.  The only way it doesn't hurt is to loosen the strap so much that it renders the goggles ineffective by no longer helping the goggles form a water-tight seal.)For the 15 minutes or so that I CAN wear these goggles, they work well.  I can actually see while swimming outside, they are watertight, and they don't fog.  They work well.

"I have a body that is difficult to fit into clothes because my size 0-2 waist doesn't quite ""match"" my size 6-8 (depending on brand) hips.  Therefore, I LOVE fit-and-flare dresses; they allow me to accentuate my waist while hiding my hips.  I buy fit-and-flare dresses like most people buy socks-- in bulk and often.When I found this dress on Amazon, I was ecstatic.  While I have MANY black-and-white-striped dresses, I did not have any with an accent color such as the one this dress has.  When I ordered the dress, there weren't any reviews on it yet, so I knew I was taking a risk.The dress shipped quickly and when I opened it, I was quite happy.  The fabric is a brushed cotton with a slight sheen, and the dress looks like it cost more than it actually did.Once I actually got the dress ON, I was happy, too.  It is comfortable, moves well, and fits beautifully.So, I'm sure you're wondering why I only gave this dress four stars?1) The side zipper doesn't go all the way up, instead ending about an inch from the arm hole, which makes it difficult to get this dress on.  The side zipper should go all the way into the arm hole.  That would make it MUCH easier to get the dress on.2) It runs small.  In most dresses like this one, I wear a size 2-4.  I ordered this dress in a size 8, thinking I would need to alter it.  It fits, and is a TINY bit big under the arms, but the dress actually fits.  I would be VERY careful to order a size (or two or three!) larger than you actually wear.This is a great dress, but be aware of its zipper and size ""issues.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDEHDLAPYT6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGHL606#wasThisHelpful","RNDEHDLAPYT6R","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first bought these ""Ultomato Cages"" four years ago, after having struggled with multiple other varieties of tomato cages.  I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PY6S8IOTX8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRPENAU#wasThisHelpful","R9PY6S8IOTX8U","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This can be easily remedied with a camisole underneath the sweater.2) In the back of the sweater is a large large cut-out area that might hit some women right around their bra strap.

But those tiny packages of words contain worlds of images and experiences and feeling.  If our circumstances change and things seem to be falling apart, we can recall a poem that reassures us.  If we find ourselves in unfamiliar or frightening surroundings, a poem can remind us that others have journeyed far and returned safely home.  If we learn poems by heart, we will always have their wisdom to draw on, and we gain understanding that no one can take away.""This book is packed full of around 100 poems, all perfect to ""learn by heart,"" appropriate for children (and adults!) of all ages.~~ ""Poems about the self"" include ""from The World is Round"" by Gertrude Stein, ""Don't Worry if Your Job is Small"" by Anonymous, and ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling.~~ ""Poems about family"" include ""The Parent"" by Ogden Nash, ""Herbert Glerbertt"" by Mary Ann Hoberman, and ""Ballad of Birmingham"" by Dudley Randall.~~ ""Poems about friendship and love"" include ""The Dream Keeper"" by Langston Hughes, ""Liberty"" by Janet S.

"When my hair stylist pulled this product out for use on my very fine, very damaged, very frizzy, slightly wavy hair, I was quite surprised.  While my hair has definite waves (that does form some actual curls if allowed to full air dry without brushing), I wouldn't consider my hair ""curly,"" and the label of this product clearly reads, 'For Curly Hair.""When the stylist applied this cream, and then used a diffuser to gently dry my hair, while using only her fingers to separate my hair, I saw how fabulous this product is.  My waves never looked better, my frizz was almost non-existent, and my hair was shiny.  It was amazing!This cream is not too thick or sticky, so it works on hair that is fine and/or only wavy.  It doesn't weigh down the hair too much, nor does it leave the hair with that ""wet"" look that some curl enhancers do.  Instead, it lightly coats the hair and leaves it soft, controlled, and pretty.  It doesn't leave hair looking overly styled at all (which is a good thing, in my not-so-humble opinion!).After seeing how fabulous this product was in the salon, I bought a bottle for home.  It works well there, too, but without the top-of-the-line blowdryers and the professional expertise, I cannot get my hair to look as great as it did in the salon.

"I ordered these buzzers for use in my classroom, for use with a ""quiz show"" style review game (an alternative to standard reviews we use).  I liked the idea that these BOTH make noise AND light up; that makes it easier to determine who answered first!These four buzzers light up in different colors and make different sounds.~~ Green makes a ""laser"" sound~~ Red makes a siren sound~~ Yellow makes a buzzer sound~~ Blue makes a ""Charge!"" soundThe noise level is medium.  They are loud enough to be heard, but not so loud that they will disturb classes that are nearby.The buzzers each take two AAA batteries (not included), which are housed in a small battery compartment on the back of the buzzer.  In order to insert or change batteries, it is necessary to unscrew a teeny-tiny screw (I'd recommend a glasses screwdriver or a precision screwdriver set).  Amazon sells rechargeable AAA batteries for CHEAP, which is what I used.My only complaint about these buzzers is regarding the green buzzer.  The ""laser"" sound is similar to a digitized, video-game gun.  I just don't think that is appropriate for use in a school.

"This dog food, which is composed of a rather large kibble, smells absolutely horrible to me, but my dog loves it.  Her main food is Merrick, but at pushing $2/pound, it is quite expensive.  Therefore, I purchase a second bag of food and mix it into the Merrick, which makes my dog very happy (she seems to like the selection!), and also makes my bank account happy.My latest ""mix food"" was this Science Diet Adult Large Breed Dry Dog Food.  It is only rated with 2.5 stars on the rating scale I have referenced for the past five years, but I am okay with that because it isn't the only food my dog is receiving.  The main reason for the lower rating is that this food is more heavily plant-based than meat-protein-based, which is not necessarily a good thing for dogs, an animal that needs a meat-based diet.My dog LOVES this food.  In fact, she picks out all of the Science Diet kibble first, and eats it before she eats her Merrick.  She eats the Science Diet, then looks at her bowl, then at me, then back at her bowl, as if she is trying to say, ""PLEASE, may I have more of this food?""I have noticed that this food must have more filler than the last ""mix food"" I purchased for my dog, because her waste production has significantly increased since I began giving her this food.  That's not a great change, but I can deal with it.Overall, I'm happy with this food for my dog.  She likes it AND my wallet likes its price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNEUFKFJLHEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CQZQQG#wasThisHelpful","R2XNEUFKFJLHEM","A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My kids have a few Uncle Milton items in their rooms, so I figured this would be a nice addition to my 10-year old daughter's room.It was a bit smaller then I expected, but worked out just fine. Comes with a 14"" x 3-1/2"" sign that's mounted to a backlight. The backlight sticks out a bit, causing the sign itself to be about 2-1/2"" from the wall.The letters are stickers, so they went on just fine. They're somewhat removable, so corrections are possible. The part I didn't like about it were the decorations for the border... nice idea but poorly implemented. The plastic decorations are attached to the sign via tiny glue dots. Getting the tiny glue dots off the paper, then removing the paper on the opposite side as well, all while trying not to touch them too much was the worst part of the assembly. The adhesive reduces in strength every time it's touched, so we lost a few dots during construction. Even when properly attached, they won't stand up to much handling. This was certainly no project for a 10 year old as even I was having trouble with it. They could have saved a lot of trouble by simply making the dots bigger...Once it's on the wall, it works fine. When you press the sign, it lights up and goes through a cycle of multiple colors. Kids will have to be very careful when turning the sign on and off as to not knock off any of the fragile decorations.It's not very bright... wouldn't recommend this as a nightlight, if anyone is considering it. It lights up no where near as bright as the pictures above suggest. In a pitch black room, the ends of the sign are a bit dark, but the name is still visible.Lastly, this does not have an auto-off option, which can be good or bad, depending on how you plan to use it. Personally, I'm glad it doesn't have an auto-off feature as I hate wall decorations that are only nice to look at for 15 minutes before requiring you to reactivate them. My daughter has had this sign illuminated for three days straight and it's still shining brightly.Overall, it needs to have bigger glue dots and a slightly brighter light would have been nice, but otherwise it's a nice sign.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QYZI8UK17PDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5CC7Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2QYZI8UK17PDR","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to replace an old Briggs & Stratton 2000-watt generator I've had for about 20 years. It's amazing what 20 years can do... the Generac generator is so much more 'friendly' to use. Quality and construction is top-notch... I was not expecting this kind of quality is a sub-$1000 generator... very impressive.Adding oil is simple... remove the cap and screw in the included threaded funnel and just poor the oil it... super easy. I filled it up with gas, gave it a few pulls, and it started right up. It's also unbelievably quiet... at idle, the noise is muffled so well, you can barely hear it 50' away. It gets louder as the power draw is increased, but still quiet enough that I would use it at night without concern for waking the neighbors.It offers gauges for fuel and power output as well as a display for run time remaining. LED status lights show ready, overheat, overload, and low oil indicators. It ran great under the load of a few lights as well as a few moderately-powered tools.My only complaint is it would not run any higher-powered tools I have, such as 15-amp saws. Of course, this generator is rated for 1600w, with a max output of 2000w for startup, and a 15-amp (1800w) tool is 200w higher then the generator's rating, but my old Briggs & Stratton generator has the exact same specs and I didn't have any trouble running my 15-amp circular saw off it. I can't really hold it against the generator though...I mainly wanted it for an emergency use and camping, so the power output is perfectly fine. I'm very happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YP6BK7IEVXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128KR4EE#wasThisHelpful","R29YP6BK7IEVXA","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like all my Canon printers, this was a very easy setup. The included guide takes you through setting up the printer, and everything worked perfectly. I had no trouble connecting to my wi-fi network and I was able to print within a few minutes.I previously had the Canon app installed on my phone from another Canon printer I own... it immediately saw the MG7720 and I was able to print from my phone very quickly. The options for printing are somewhat limited, but from my experience with other brands as well, it seems that's par for the course.Print quality is excellent... for the price of this printer, I'm really impressed. Very sharp and the colors are very accurate. The scanner also does a great job, even on photos.I have another printer from this line, the Canon PIXMA MG6820, which is one step down from this printer, however it terms of functionality and performance, this printer is miles ahead of the MG6820. Print and scan quality is far better. In addition, I also love having two enclosed paper trays rather then a single exposed tray... looks neater and the convenience, since I swap between two paper sizes often, is fantastic. I do miss the rear tray that many of my older Canons have, since it was great for quickly printing on a different type of paper, but the two trays and cleaner look of this printer make up for that.Ink does seem to go a bit fast though... I've printed several pictures and there seems to already be a dent in the ink supply. For some reason, it seems the newer Canon printers use a bit more ink... or the cartridges have a bit less. I have several older Canon printers, such as the Pro-10, MX892, and MG6220... all of which are able to print quite a few more photos before sustaining a 'dent' in the supply.Aside from that, I'm very happy with this printer. It's a really great printer for the price and a huge step up from the Canon MG6820.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2SXO267J0Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZY3C#wasThisHelpful","R1W2SXO267J0Q3","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very easy setup... just unpacked and plugged in, then followed the included instructions. It was connected in just a few minutes and I was able to connect to it through my computer and start printing. I haven't had a lot of success in the past with wi-fi printers, but this one was easy to get running.I installed the Canon Print Inkjet/Selphy was able to connect the printer to my smartphone, but it took a few tries for the app to see the printer. Once it was setup, I had no trouble printing photos directly from my phone. The options available for printing are pretty limited... the app is basically good for quick printing from your phone... if you want more control over the output, you'll need to transfer it to your computer.One complaint I have is the limited paper paths... it offers one exposed tray on the front of the unit, under the output tray. All my other printers have at least two trays... with only one, it severely limits the printer's versatility since you have to stop and swap out the paper. Since I often print both documents on 8-1/2""x11 paper and photos on 4""x6"" photo paper, having to constantly swap back and forth is an inconvenience.Printing is pretty fast, but I'm not overly impressed with the quality of the photo printing. For the price, it's good, but compared to slightly higher priced Canon and Epson printers, the pictures aren't quite as sharp and the coloring seems somewhat off. I certainly wouldn't consider it 'bad', because again, for the price, it's quite good, however overall it's not overly impressive.Scan quality is also not overly impressive. I tried scanning in a photo and the quality wasn't quite what I was hoping for, especially when enlarging the size.I own a previous version of this model, the Canon MG6220, which at the time of purchase (two years ago) was in the same price range as this printer, but the MG6220 is an overall better printer in every way, in my opinion.Overall, it's a excellent document and graphics printer, although if you're planning on printing a lot of high resolution photos or you swap paper sizes often, I would recommend spending a little bit more... the next model up (Canon MG7720) is a big improvement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YODKKL6AAQDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZCCU#wasThisHelpful","R2YODKKL6AAQDP","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this game mainly for my daughters who are huge fans of fantasy games which include dragons and wizards. Despite being far below the age suggestion on this game (10 and 5), both have a great time with the game and fully understood the rules and procedures for winning.Game play offers pretty basic rules and can be extended with more advanced rules. The game's man goal is to use your cards, which act as adventurers, to attack and kill dragons. Players can work together to kill dragons and share the loot, or kill them on their own, keeping all the loot for themselves.My kids ended up loving the game, however I personally didn't care for the 'negotiation' part. Although my kids understood the idea, it slows down the game, and not in a good way. Having to convince other people to allow you to have certain gems doesn't make a good aspect of a game in my opinion. Especially since there's a single black gem that's worth way more the rest of the gems... our first three game were close enough that the winners ended up being decided by the value of the black gem, so from then on, the fight for that gem became ferocious. It's rare that a compromise is met for the gem as others would prefer to see it sent back into the bag rather then be distributed to any single player. The last two games we played, we shuffled the loot and gave it out at random, leaving the negations out of the game. It's now our preferred style of playing.Overall, it's a fun game, with some tweaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EK2KUMQEQZEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R2EK2KUMQEQZEU","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Easy to assemble out of the box. Overall quality is good, not great... plastic feels a bit cheap, but the construction is sturdy. The battery is very small and lightweight and the entire trimmer is incredibly light and easy to handle.Power-wide, it's 'ok'... I would say this is more medium-to-light duty. It cut through light grass with ease and the battery lasted long enough for me to finish my front yard. After recharging, I tried it on my backyard, which has denser grass and some weeds. The trimmer bogged down quite a bit and the battery didn't last nearly as long as with the front yard.Overall, it's a night lightweight trimmer, great for medium duty work and light trimming.

Second, it has a couple of feet on the bottom so you can put the iron down between uses, but they're small and don't offer much stability.Third is the price... it's pretty expensive for what it offers, and comparing it to other curling irons I own. There are interchangeable barrels, which are sold separately at $85 each. These barrels are the main reason I would purchase this model, and adding barrels would make this iron very expensive.Overall, it's really nicely built and designed, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not interested in the multiple barrels feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2HUHDG60217/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3FO92#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2HUHDG60217","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Incredible watch. My current 'everyday' watch is an Invicta watch, with I've been very happy with for years. My watch always seems a bit heavy, weighing in at 5.5 ounces. This watch is huge, weighing in at 14 ounces. The size of the watch and band is also oversized, so be aware that the watch you're seeing in the picture above is not a 'normal' sized watch... it's quite big and bulky.Aside from its size, it's undoubtedly a beautifully designed watch. Aside from the time, it also displays the day of the week (Sun, Mon, Tues, etc.) and date of the month (day only, not the month). The orange braided wire really sets off the watch. Overall, it looks, and certainly feels like an extremely well-made watch.Frankly, although I really like how this watch looks, it's way too big and bulky for an 'everyday' watch. I'll likely just use it for special occasions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHET8H9L6H7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVHNW7O#wasThisHelpful","REHET8H9L6H7E","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not a big fan of companies that copy successful products rather then coming up with their own idea. Although Terraria and Minecraft may have a different style of play, Terraria clearly copied the overall concept from Minecraft. The fact that the game is a rip-off is blatantly apparent in their toys... they're the same size and design as Minecraft and even the packaging is made to confuse anyone who's looking to purchase Minecraft toys and is not aware of the differences. My daughter, who is a Minecraft fanatic, gets Terraria toys from time to time from friends and family members who are not aware that they're different.That said, this set on its own is actually very nice. It's a very well-made toy, sturdy, and quite large. It has three levels and can be used with other biome sets that are sold separately. With a variety of figures, this can be a very fun set for kids. My daughter loves it, but uses it with her Minecraft figures. It really works just fine in either world...My biggest complaint is the price... VERY expensive for this set that only comes with ONE figure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CK1E57G6RESN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO49MI6#wasThisHelpful","R1CK1E57G6RESN","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a decent set... nothing overly interesting. Although faithful to the movie, it's really just an empty truck. Where Lego is different as they would normally use artistic license to add something a bit more interesting to the set, Mega Bloks stuck with a more exact replica... which is better or worse, depending on your interpretation. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a bit more done with a set this size. Lego normally crams a lot of detail into every bit of space... this set seems to have a lot of bare and empty spots that just seem a bit 'boring'.My biggest complaint with Mega Bloks overall is their quality... Lego may be more expensive, but you know where the money is going when you compare the quality of the pieces side by side. Mega Bloks just doesn't compare... especially with the coloring, as pieces that are suppose to be the same color can often vary from piece to piece with Mega Bloks sets. Thankfully, this is almost unnoticeable with this set since it's made to look camouflaged.Lego aside, this is a pretty nice set on its own. It's pretty sturdy, especially compared to previous Mega Bloks sets I've owned. I think this set would stand up to childrens' play a bit more.Overall, this is a pretty good set, particularly if you're a fan of the movie. If you're heavy into Lego like me, you might get the feeling they missed an interesting opportunity to make this better...","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21W0TM1BF3T5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9AG#wasThisHelpful","R21W0TM1BF3T5E","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is replacing a Delta 50-850 1-1/2-horsepower dust collector I had for years... until stolen from my storage unit. This model is not quite as powerful as my last one, coming it at 1/2 horsepower lower less, and it certainly is noticeable as my last one was an absolute monster (I always believed it was powered by a miniature black hole). However, for my needs, it works just fine. It has more then enough power to be used at one or two stations at the same time.It's also a LOT quieter then my last unit... easily the quietest tool in my shop. When I first assembled it and powered it on in my living room, my kids barely even acknowledged it. My last dust collector would have had them running out of the room. It runs at 85 decibels, which is identical to my home vacuum.So far it works great... plenty of power and reasonably easy to empty.

"This is my first Hisense TV. At first I was a bit leery about how good it will be, replacing a 32"" Samsung that works great, but I was pretty impressed with it out of the box. First, it looks good... certainly not cheaply made like some other off-brand manufacturers. I first mounted it on the stand, which was extremely sturdy for a relatively small stand with a TV this size. Afterwards, I mounted it on a wall with no trouble at all.Picture quality is pretty good out of the box, but it did have a bit more red then I preferred, so I adjusted it a bit, which I rarely need to do... not a big deal. Colors are nice and vibrant and the picture is very sharp. Extremely impressive for the price...The source menu looks a bit like Windows 8, but surprisingly I don't hate it.... works well for a TV. The remote is quite good... it's small enough that it fits in my hand perfectly, and is designed simply to control the TV and its many options, rather then them giving you an oversized remote that controls everything in your house. The remote is responsive and doesn't require you to point it directly at the TV to work... very user-friendly. I don't like the gloss black finish though... picks up fingerprints way too easily.The audio is quite good for a TV, especially these days when so little effort seems to be put into the sound quality on anything below top-range TVs.I'd love to give the TV five stars, but I did have a few problems with it. First, it connected very easily to my Vizio speaker system via optical cable, however when I setup my Verizon Fios remote to work with the TV, it also began controlling my Vizio speaker volume. Either Hisense and Vizio share the same codes, or the Verzion remote is the problem. Either way, it would work fine if it weren't for the fact that every time I change the volume, a pop-up appears, covering 1/5 of the screen, telling me I turned off the volume control on the TV... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. It's incredibly annoying and I wish they would assume the user might not be an idiot and allow for turning this notice off. Unfortunately, after a short period of time, it became evident that there's a very slight, almost unnoticeable delay in the sound through the speaker which wasn't there with my last TV. Once I noticed it, it became a glaring flaw, so between that and the fact that the TV thinks I'm an idiot, I turned off the speaker and use the TV's built-in speaker.Second, I cannot connect to my home network. This is a result of a number of problems...1) I have two wireless networks connecting to my home network. The TV doesn't even see my main wi-fi network, which is supplied via my Verizon Fios router and which I can access on any wi-fi device anywhere on my property. This, despite the fact that I have an extender for this wireless service four feet from this TV. My cellphone has full strength when placed next to the TV and with the wireless extender turn off, it still has 70% strength. This TV cannot see it at all, with or without the extender.2) This TV sees my second wireless network, but cannot connect to it. It keeps telling me the password I entered is wrong, but I double checked the password on the router itself and even was able to successfully connect to the wifi network from my phone while standing next to the TV, so I'm not sure what the problem is here. I have never had any problems connecting any device to either of my wi-fi networks, so I can only assume it's the TV.3) When all else fails, plug an ethernet wire in and directly connect your network... except this TV doesn't even have a simple ethernet port! Huge oversight here...I'll be contacting customer support about the wi-fi issue and will update my review whether the problem is solved of not, but for now it's getting 4 stars. It's a great TV with a lot of features, while looking and sounding like a much more expensive TV. Unfortunately, my current issue negates half the features this TV has.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4P0ZWRC5PLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0GZR34#wasThisHelpful","R1V4P0ZWRC5PLA","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure why these are marketed specifically for the Xbox, but I ended up getting these for my daughter for use with her Kindle. There are a lot of headphones in my family, all of which have their own specific purpose, so I've had a lot of experience with different style headphones at various different prices, from $20 all the way through to over $300.Out of the box, this set wasn't overly impressive. The ear pieces don't swivel very smoothly from the start, which affects how well they seal against the user's head. The headband is also pretty cheap looking and doesn't adjust particularly smoothly.When I ordered these headphones, I was concerned that they would be too big for my five year old's head, however they're a pretty small set. I don't have a large head and normally when I adjust a headset for my head, there's a LOT more room for larger heads. This set was only one notch from maximum size when I adjusted them for me, which is surprisingly small compared to all my other headphones. I am glad though, because at the smallest setting, they fit perfectly on my daughter's head. They're very lightweight and despite the headband, are pretty comfortable.Sound quality was great when I first tested it out on a phone call, but when I tried them for music and games, I was a little less impressed. Bass is decent, but the highs don't seem particularly crisp. I would compare the sound quality to roughly that of other headphone's I own which are half the price.The mic works great. I tested it out on a phone call and the other person said I sounded very clear. I really like how you can remove the mic when you don't plan to use it, rather then folding it away, although some people might have the opposite opinion since it could get lost easily.Overall, I don't like the headband and the sound quality isn't quite as good as it should be at this price, but the mic works great and it's pretty comfortable, so my daughter is very happy with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RSARJ3QWARFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5U40#wasThisHelpful","R1RSARJ3QWARFZ","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I installed this under my TV in my bedroom. Installation was relatively easy and the shelf mounts very securely. The shelf itself is tempered glass with the underside painted black... it gives a very nice overall look. It also has a wire channel cover for hiding wires to and from the TV.The compartment under the shelf is a really good idea, but it might be a bit small for some. My Verizon Fios box fit perfectly, but I know other people with larger boxes that likely wouldn't fit. Opening is 19"" wide by 2-1/8"" high.My only complaint is the installation. Although the instructions are very good and explain everything, and the amount of included fasteners is great for a variety of mounting options, the setup expects you to either mount this to two studs or just one stud with added drywall attachments. The included drywall attachments are more like zip-tie meets molly bolts... you drill a hole in the wall, slide the device in, twist it, then pull the plastic tie tight. I really don't like these. They seem to work and are very easy to use, but they aren't easily reusable and aren't as tight as if the shelf was mounted to the wall with screws. With all the mounting options they give you, even including concrete anchors, I don't know why they just didn't include regular heavy-duty drywall anchors. After trying out the molly/zip-ties, I removed them and used drywall anchors I had, and it worked out better.Still, it's a pretty easy installation and mounts very securely. Looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXK9GUQ566QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI7A4MA#wasThisHelpful","R3NXK9GUQ566QT","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this as a replacement for my Verizon FIOS backup battery. The original battery lasted over three years... this one lasted 8 months. The ""Designed for long life: 6 - 8 years"" statement is a joke.I finally contacted the company after a week of trying (even after a year, their website listed on the battery is not working) and they offered me a replacement, however I had to ship the battery back to them first at my expense. To pay $20 to return a $23 battery for replacement is ridiculous, so their ""3-year replacement warranty"" is absolutely worthless.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227GSNWI6BSZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICNXESC#wasThisHelpful","R227GSNWI6BSZV","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a nice case that keeps your phone well protected. Easily one of the most durable cases I've seen for a phone, offering everything from drop protection to being waterproof. I have two main complaints that keep me from using this normally. First, the screen protection does reduce the screen's sensitivity quite a bit. I've adjusted the sensitivity settings, but it still requires a bit more pressure. I've used plenty of screen protectors before and never had a problem like this.Second, the actual case looks different then what's pictured. The actual case is a bit more shiny and looks like cheap plastic. Not impressive for a $70+ case.Overall, it will provide significantly more protection over that of a standard case, however at the cost of a less responsive phone. It's also overpriced for the quality you receive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N524L08JXN07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOLC6DK#wasThisHelpful","R1N524L08JXN07","ASY25YMTIC2A9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASY25YMTIC2A9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice label flags... includes four labels per 4""x6"" sheet. Had no trouble printing out flags with the downloaded template from Avery's website.Two complaints... first, the flags are pretty thin... about that thickness of regular address labels. Although they function fine, the price for just 24 labels is very, very high. You can get 350 Avery 5262 address labels which are nearly twice the height of these for less money. Cut them in half and you have 700 labels that are nearly the same size. The only thing missing would be the split tail, which can be copied with minimal effort and creativity.Second, the flags can be difficult to get on straight, and when they're not straight, it's very noticeable and doesn't look very good.Overall, they're good for a quick display, with a bit of patience getting them straight.

Like that book, this one is well put together in a format that is easy to read and easy to search.  He speaks from a lifetime of training special operations personnel and can be considered an expert on the topic.This book is written mostly for those who are seriously into training.  The idea of Body Fuel is that you cycle how you feed your body so that it is constantly getting what it needs without hitting a plateau common to most other diets.  I found this book to be very interesting as I have spent the better part of a year researching nutrition and was happy to see that he espouses a real food approach.

It helps if you have an interest in American History and general understanding of the climate surrounding events associated with the American Revolution, as well as the key players shaping events.

"This watch is more impressive in person.  Like a lot of other Invicta watches, it's huge and it weighs a lot, thanks in part to the stainless steel housing.  You'll definitely know you're wearing it.  Mr. Pixels & Bits is a big guy (over 6 feet) and this watch looks stunning on him.  The face of the watch nearly covers the entire expanse of his wrist (Invicta says it's 48.5 mm).  The leather strap is long enough to fit his wrist with 3 holes to spare.I was curious how it would look in the rose gold tone and I have to say that I'm a fan because of the way it complements the brown strap.  It almost comes off as a light brown tone.  This watch looks amazing paired with browns and neutral colors.  I think it looks especially smart with dark brown dress pants and coordinating tie.(Mr. Pixels and Bits is something of a clothes horse.)I don't understand why they paired a leather strap with a dive watch, but this one is good up to 100 meters (300 feet).  It's nice to know that an aquatic emergency or accident (or more likely, an accidental dunking or submersion) wouldn't ruin the timepiece, but it's otherwise impractical for that purpose unless you change the band.  Some of the other features include:*  Dual time zone capability (to toggle between)*  There's a calendar that displays the day as well as the date.*  There's a 24 hour dial as well as a prominent second hand but the bezel is stationary and does not turn.*  It glows in the dark, just as you'd expect.*  It has a Swiss quartz movement on board to ensure that it keeps accurate time for years to come.*  It has a battery on board that keeps it charged.It's a good looking timepiece presented in a beautiful yellow Invicta box - perfect for gift presentation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTRH07DFEEC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y1VY#wasThisHelpful","R2CTRH07DFEEC2","A3IUW081KXD3PE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IUW081KXD3PE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I admit was overwhelmed when I unpacked all the pieces that come with this jumper.  I hadn't found the instructions yet (packaged in with the seat) so I set to putting it together based on the picture on the box.  This was a surprisingly decent way to go about it.  Once I found the instructions, it was super easy.  I had a hard time getting some of the pieces to click into place, but with a little effort, everything seems solid and we haven't had anything get loose yet.  Thankfully, the seat came pre-assembled even though the instructions gave directions for putting it together.There are so many little things to do to keep a little one entertained!  The one piece that's electronic needed 3 AA batteries, so you'll need a small Phillips head screwdriver.  It plays music and sounds and learning sequences.Perhaps the best part is that it's adjustable in height so you can get more use out of it.

"This is a great 2 person strategy game.  The game play is more intense the more competitively matched you are with your opponent.  While there are elements of luck (drawing cards), there is quite a bit of strategy involved in how you chose to play or not play your cards.This game doesn't take up a lot of space.  You could almost balance it on the seat tray of an airplane.  It's fairly quiet - based on how loud you and your opponent are with occasional outbursts.  The box takes up little space so it's a good game to take with you on the road.All of the pieces and materials are made from high quality materials.

"So much of Putin's life would seem completely alien to the average American experience.  Born and raised in the aftermath of WWII in a place struggling from its own efforts to rebuild, Putin was shaped by forces unknowable by most.  The author begins at the beginning and offers insight not only into Putin's early life, but also the people and events that shaped and influenced him.  What fueled his early fascination with the KGB and how his early KGB career differed from his ideals - even though he seemed to excel and was rewarded with more responsibility.This is a very readable biography of a complicated current figure.  The author has researched it to painstaking lengths.  Including the works cited, there are over 500 pages in this book.  Separated in five parts, it's an extremely impressive scholarly effort.  Included are:Part One1.  Homo Sovieticus2.  A Warm Heart, a Cool Head and Clean Hands3.  A Middling Spy in a Dying Empire4.  Democracy Faces a Hungry WinterPart Two5.

"This adorable little hardcover book is best for young children who can sit and pay attention for a reasonable length of time.  Hannah Viano has put together a gorgeous little book full of color illustrations depicting natural examples of the alphabet.

"This workstation was relatively easy for an able-bodied adult to put together.  It's a bit heavy and the box was bulky, but Mr. Pixels and Bits put it together on his own in less than an hour.  It's mostly a matter of putting together big pieces and then installing various bolts and pins.In terms of adjusting it for use, it takes a bit of getting used to it.  He is over 6'2"" and he can make it work.  It functions in a better height range for me at 5'5"".  Once tightened up, it's pretty stable.  Adjusting it takes a little time and there's definitely a learning curve.  I don't care for the way the seat folds up - you have to un-pin and then re-pin it.  The seat is not very inspired but it's functional for short to moderate duration.  You can adjust the angle a bit to make it comfortable.  Really, I think this task table is meant to be used from a standing position and the seat was added later.  It's not all that comfortable.  It would be functional used as a podium.If you need an inexpensive task table for moderate use, this might be a good option.  It functions well with a laptop.  I also use it as a drawing table.  I like that there's a little side table that can be adjusted from one side to the other as your needs demand.  It does not tilt, but stays flat so you have someplace to put your mouse or coffee.  If you have the table tilted at an angle there's a built in break at the bottom with a hollowed out area for your pens or pencil.It rolls around to move it - but it's a bit ungainly and awkward.  Quality is good with heavy metal supports.  The work surfaces are an attractive smooth blond wood product.  I like that there is an attractive shelf at your foot to put your feet on as you work.

Just from a pantry perspective, these are a great option for those with small bathrooms or little space in general.  Storing huge multi-packs won't be quite the investment of storage space that it is at present.To use them, you just pinch them open at the place where the two sides of the ""roll"" meet.  They easily go onto a standard toilet paper hanger with no snagging or other frustrating issues.  In terms of use, if anything, it's quieter than the cardboard core variety as you don't hear it slapping on the pin when you quickly pull paper off the roll.  Not that I need it to be quiet!Paper quality is good and consistent with premium brands.  It is soft and absorbent.I think this is a good change, though I can see why people might be skeptical about it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6Y72IYM6D3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DQJKTE#wasThisHelpful","R3V6Y72IYM6D3V","A3IUW081KXD3PE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IUW081KXD3PE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the bright colors and contemporary design of this shower curtain.  It's not overly ""girlie"" nor does it look like it belongs in a bachelor pad.  It measures 72 inches by 72 inches, which is the industry standard size for shower curtains that hang over bath tubs.  If you have a smaller space you can easily fold it in half to show the design on both sides and use it in a simple shower stall.It has reinforced eyelet holes to use it with your choice of curtain ring.  There is no liner of any kind.  It sheds water but is machine washable.  It's colorfast so there's no need to worry about color bleeds.  There are no magnets or weights in the bottom to encourage it to hang flat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376YIMUPYIWX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R8UYA#wasThisHelpful","R376YIMUPYIWX7","A3IUW081KXD3PE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IUW081KXD3PE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We usually use Member's Mark Bathroom Tissue where 45 rolls = 120 ""regular rolls"".  That means each roll is 2.667 ""regular"" rolls.  It's soft, pleasant toilet tissue that we have enjoyed without trouble for a few years.This Charmin Ultra Strong Mega Roll is huge by comparison.  It's so big it takes up almost all the room between the wall and where your standard sized toilet paper holder is mounted.  I don't see you being able to find a bigger roll of toilet paper to fit that standardized space and still be able to turn freely.  That said, I believe Charmin's claim that one roll is as big as 4 standard rolls because it's HUGE compared to the Member's mark roll that is 2.667 ""regular"" rolls.The Charmin is soft and absorbent.  I find the sheet quality to be about the same as the Sams Club Member's Mark that we use all the time.  If we had kids in the house, there would be an advantage to having the giant sized rolls.

"This began well and sustained my interest for the first fifty or so pages, then it just became a tedious chore. I'm very interested in first person plural narration (FPP) and am attempting to read every book in FPP. I found Otsuka's ambitious attempt to be less than successful. Otsuka's FPP is too broad,  There are so many ways Otsuka could have tackled this concept that would have worked better.This would have worked as a short story or novella at half the size as is. But still would have run itself to the ground. By including all of Japan's picture-brides with no anchor of place, there is no one for the reader to embrace, root for, or despise. Had she narrowed her choice to a group of several women, perhaps from a neighborhood, or church, etc. This work could have taken on some definable shape to capture the weight of the tale she wishes to tell. The Point of View (POV) is simply too limiting for the scope of the story she wanted to tell. You cannot tell an entire nation of immigrant's experience within this POV because the individual experience will vary too greatly to be contained here. As it does within her attempt - had she narrowed it to just farm workers or maids or mothers, it would have stood a chance, but including every possible kind of female Japanese immigrant voice left no room for anything but the most sweeping of generalities.This offering becomes static and highly repetitive. Otsuka often degrades the FPP to simplified lists that encapsulate generic experiences that are alienating and lose sight of the reader's empathy and patience. She often makes no attempt to lessen the harshness of the POV or weave the ""we"" voice into a more cohesive narrative. Indeed, as I read, I often felt I was being beaten over the head with the word ""we.""I'm disheartened that the novel was unsuccessful. Otsuka is more than capable of creating an affable and compelling story. Her imagery is crisp and her prose is lean. It is a fast page-turning read with small, tight, and self-contained sections that make it a perfect book to read in waiting rooms and when you only have a minute here and there. There is a very poignant and important story within its pages that deserves telling, however, Otsuka is incapable of balancing all the elements of the story in addition to the ambitious choice of narration. While I am a fan of first person plural, it was a poor choice for this particular story. This story and the characters within it deserve a closer and more intimate exploration than the method Otsuka chose to apply allows.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSJLRM6NTXP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4X7EO#wasThisHelpful","R3GSJLRM6NTXP7","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jackson shows what fiction is capable of in this tight and densely layered masterpiece. It's been so long since I opened up a book and one page just melted to the next and the hours passed whilst I was entrenched in an entirely different existence. Mostly, I read, and I reflect and I intellectually engage with a text - I analyze and dissect its parts - which is all well and good, I do enjoy it. But it's been so long since I just picked up a book that I just couldn't put down. A book that was so engrossing, I didn't have time or inclination to look for metaphors and hidden meaning or try to piece together the puzzle of what the author really intended. I'm not a proponent of plot synopsis in review, and less so for this particular book. An intimate exploration of the characters Jackson summons into existence comprise the powerful pull this book has. I read this many years ago when I was a teenager and I remembered it fondly, and vaguely recalled the plot - what I didn't recall was Jackson's preternatural prose.Jackson was prone to magical thinking and leaned heavily towards ideas of witchcraft and the supernatural, not just in her fiction but in real life. I try not to dismiss other people's beliefs out of hand, however, I'm not superstitious in any way shape or form. Yet, after reading We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I believe in Jackson's witchcraft. Not in the spells and charms she and her protagonist favor, but in the Divine inspiration she applied in her craft that allowed her to transform insignificant words into sentient human beings who exist and breath life within the confines of the neurons and electrons of the reader's brain. For 146 beautiful pages I saw the world entirely through Merricat's eyes. Jackson is a true storyteller, content to spin a yarn founded on her prodigious insight into the human condition. She is content to leave you to make what you will of it. Jackson never uses her authorial power to stand on a bully pulpit and inform, educate or dictate any agenda. She has a graceful confidence in her reader's capacity to interpret her work by and for themselves. This novel provides the genuine kind of pleasure that culminates when a great story is both well-written and entertaining. If you're on the fence or curious, go ahead indulge. Surrender and succumb to the enchantment of damn good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TZ9N1MSJBO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143039970#wasThisHelpful","R25TZ9N1MSJBO2","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has an exceptional amount of hype surrounding it. Having supposedly created a new category labeled ""Anti-Memoir,"" I had some reasonably high expectations for this work.If you take any kind of creative writing classes, or study literature at the college level you will already be familiar with the push toward legitimizing creative non-fiction memoirs. On a fundamental level I'm not really interested in that debate. If someone's writing can hold my attention, entertain, and get me to engage with their text, I'm on board. Fiction, poetry, non-fiction, or mix genre. Good writing stands on its own and transcends any genre. However, the prose in ""The Chronology of Water"" is premeditated and forced. It reads like any other self-obsessed MFA non-fiction essay awaiting rejection in a lit mag slush pile. It's another example of how this genre is failing to launch.On a line level the prose is highly pretentious and indulges in narcissistic self-aware faux avant-garde technique applied ad naseum. I'm all for a poignant fragment, but technique applied without reason or restraint renders the attempts into literary gimmicks (e.g. artsy-fartsy nonsense). At the line-level the book will drive an attentive reader bonkers. Anyone foreign to the MFA artsy-fartsy culture will just think there are a lot of typos and bad editing.Which perhaps could be forgiven if the substance were weighty enough. Frankly, I feel that Yuknavitch is an unreliable narrator of her own life. I certainly don't believe in the truth of this memoir part and parcel. I believe only in Yuknavitch's desire to shock and awe the reader at any cost. All the up-close and personal details feel pimped and slimy. The events are not so much exposed and explored as they are posed and marketed. In the age of internet porn, no one has the luxury of being a prude anymore. Yuknavitch's silly sex details read like teen swaggering, which would be condemned as excessive if this were written by a male, but Yunavitch insists it is all sexy and empowering because she's a woman. The former bad-girl turned house kitten Ph.D. recounts what a naughty slut she once was. Sexual? Yes. Sexy? Not even close.Read any of the prurient passages and transpose the gender and then ask yourself if you'd read the same thing from a male. I'd then invite you to ask yourself if parroting a braggart legacy of misogyny is really empowering to anyone, male or female. And you can offer the rebuttal  ""Oh but it's a memoir, she's just recounting her life."" But I don't buy it, and that comes down to a question of credibility. Yuknavitch guts her own credibility at every turn. Non-fiction requires a fundamental devotion to the truth and Yuknavitch's tendency toward self-aggrandizing hyperbole left me in disbelief.It's hard to not judge when reading a memoir, especially one that is so intent on not asking for your permission or forgiveness. I'm not really interested in condemning Yuknavitch. I don't want to be anyone's moral nanny. I believe women can be just as narcissistically self-destructive as any man. What I condemn is the boredom of it all. How does Yuknavitch afford her Rock `n Roll lifestyle? At the expense of the safety, sobriety, and sanity of everyone around her and after ruining other people's lives, she publishes an unabashed memoir of her exploits. Alcoholism, narcissism, and sex-addiction served straight with no chaser of complexity quickly becomes an easily dismissed, salaciously boring read.In the last few essays Yuknavitch seems to sense this and goes all mushy, which I didn't find redemptive, believable, or satisfying either. It reads more like selling out. The transformation from hard-edged selfish addict to deep-thinking literary snob is not shown, it's told - and again, I just don't believe it. Yuknavitch doesn't pick herself up off the floor and straighten out her own life. No, she looks into the eyes of her married lover and when he tells her he wants her to have his baby - Whoomp There It Is! -  She's done been saved by a man's redemptive love (insert Disney desperate lack-of-agency female chorus here). At every turn I feel the authenticity of experience is withheld, my trust as a reader trampled, and my time wasted.I once heard a tragedy defined as a story where characters come close to transcending circumstances but fail to grow and live up to their potential. In that sense, this memoir, its prose and its ""protagonist"" are a real tragedy. This has that current buzz on it, where a lot of people are discussing the book - so by all means read it if you want to participate in that dialog, but don't believe the hype.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2HTNSZP2O56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OA64I4#wasThisHelpful","R3G2HTNSZP2O56","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's absurdly easy to lampoon Ayn Rand because she is not a great writer. Furthermore, she espouses an extreme philosophy that is so simplistically monochromatic that anyone outside of a society of armchair intellectuals will find immediate and irreconcilable contrasts with reality.I didn't read this to bag on Rand like a lot of liberal-minded folks do. I read this because I am obsessively interested in first-person collective POV narratives. Of which, there are precious few. Of the short list which is under 10 well-known stories or (even rarer) novels, Anthem never made a list that I saw. When discussing my interest in first-person collective POV, someone recommended Anthem. My immediate reaction was a wince at the mere thought of reading Rand.I'm a snob, a literary snob and I don't apologize for it. I'm also a poor college student who has tried to slog through ""Atlas Shrugged"" off-and-on for 3 years going now, because the Rand foundation offers a $10,000 dollar scholarship via an essay contest focusing on Rand's behemoth work. After three years, I came to the conclusion, that you couldn't pay me $10,000 dollars to finish that damn book, let alone write an essay on it that could please a committee of Randians.So color-me-surprised: I really enjoyed reading ""Anthem."" Sure it's heavy-handed proselytizing Randianism - but it was passionate and concise. For the first time, I ""got,"" really got what Rand was about. Not that I didn't intellectually understand objectivism before - but I never really got the passionate ardor behind it.Rand successfully conveys the outrage and indignation often felt by those discriminated and dismissed because they are brilliant, creative, and/or beautiful by mediocre people who maintain the status quo. She aimed, and shot a pretty direct hit into the hypocrisy that surrounds the foundations of altruism and charity.Her prose lacks finesse and shows a very average comprehension of writing craft - Like I said earlier, it's easy to hang her out to dry here. She was a political philosopher first and foremost and a writer, maybe 79th in her list of human-being skills. But after all that criticism and many years after her death, and the end (for all intents and purposes) of the communism she railed against, she still demands to be read. Through ""Anthem,"" I came to understand why.There are real glimmers of insight and truth into the human condition here, as didactic and forced as they often are. And indeed, they are often sophomoric insights that are the beginning stages of a dialog, not the endpoint Rand makes them out to be. The initial youthful outrage felt at the suppression of one's individuality in the face of community standards is a universal human experience that Rand captures alive, with its wild heart thudding in your ear while it thrashes around in your mind resisting sublimation - and that's an experience well worth the time it takes to read its 100 or so pages, whatever your politics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD8P6B8QSYB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452281253#wasThisHelpful","R3DD8P6B8QSYB2","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this DVD set. I purchased it primarily for the first disc that focuses on authors, but was equally entertained by the second disc that focuses on ""Great Thinkers."" I felt that the first episode on disc 1 was a little tedious. Mostly, because it covers a time period that contained a great number of authors who are now considered canonical giants whose stories are familiar to everyone.However, after episode 1, the series continued on through the decades to many authors and books I'd never encountered before. Each section focuses strictly toward authors who were the voices of their generation. The authors are explored in the context of the era they wrote in. This particular lens provides a great deal of insight for those of us who weren't around to experience those eras. I came away from the series with substantial additions to my ""to read"" list.My only complaint about the series is the price. 44 dollars (at the time of this review) is absurd. Amazon Instant Video also offers the series at about half the price for the whole season or purchasable per episode: British Novelists: Among the Ruins, 1919-1939 - but even this option seems too steep. I purchased mine used from one of the Amazon sellers for less than the Instant Video price, but am still frustrated that quality educational entertainment is made elitist by this kind of high price structure. The series was not available anywhere else online, and while I enjoyed it immensely, it's not the kind of show likely to be re-watched often enough to justify its high price. I strongly suggest checking to see if it's available at your local library first, and/or requesting it for future purchase by your local library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCGC5T4MCRTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JY3O7M#wasThisHelpful","R1JCGC5T4MCRTA","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an incredibly endearing and charming read. In a world where people seldom grapple with religious ideas or themes, Salinger provides a glimpse of two young people sincerely searching for spiritual truth in the unorganized junk drawer that our society keeps spiritual matters and religion in.I loved Salinger's familiarity with a variety of different religions and their practices. He doesn't allow his characters to get mono-dogmatic. The characters rein in insight from all religions and find that all schools of thought contain grains of truth that are assembled to construct a world-view. Franny is stuck in the midst of a spiritual crisis unable to move forward with her life until she resolves that crisis. When was the last time anyone looked away from their Iphone long enough to allow themselves to have a spiritual crisis? Or to confront the fact that their existence begs larger questions than ""when is the next season of 'The Walking Dead' available on Netflix?""Salinger proposes some of those questions through Franny's transmundane conundrum to show that we can only touch the divine through our interactions with others. Zooey moderates Franny's pious hypocrisy and helps her to see that if she doesn't have a great grasp on the figure of her devotion, then she's just mindlessly repeating words that get her no closer to the kind of realized enlightenment she's looking for.Which all sounds pretty heady and maybe even boring. However, Salinger clothes all these issues within the likable and approachable Glass family. Bessie walks around in a house dress with pockets big enough for her cigarettes and ashtrays. They live in an apartment with root beer stains on the ceiling, while Bessie is frantically trying to cure Franny so the painters can get to work on the room Franny's stuck in. Moving from room to room we get a sense of a family that loves and relies upon one another. The story's foundation is the warm and compassionate love between siblings and family. The family is so close knit, that in the midst of her crisis, Franny can come home to spiritually convalesce in an environment that nurtures understanding.Where is your spiritual home? Where can you go when your soul is troubled? I think the larger themes in Franny and Zooey are the foundations of our spiritual homes and spiritual friendships that provide the basic building blocks and support for a healthy relationship with reality. It was a lovely story, the kind that you regret coming to the end of.

Having only read ""Debbieland,"" I was unprepared for the collection's focus on magical realism, which comprises most of the collection. It made for an oddly charming book. ""Debbieland"" is the darkest story in the book, more so because there is no magical realism in it, just the creepy magical thinking of the protagonist(s). Labeling these stories as ""quirky"" would be misleading, ""quirky"" has a light and airy connotation that is the antithesis of the atmosphere Bender painstakingly creates.These stories are downright peculiar. Bender's stories are deliberately sensational, while remaining authentically avant-garde creations. Which is a remarkable balance to strike, and all the more surprising due to the conventional and conservative standards that contemporary publishers and producers impose on artistic endeavors. Even when a particular story didn't captivate me, I was still in awe of the integrity and craft Bender applies to each of her willful creatures. But more often than not, I eagerly accepted the imaginative invitation Bender extends in each of her stories and found myself intrigued, disturbed, and satisfied. I would caution the conventional reader away, but highly recommended this collection to anyone who appreciates the unorthodox and finds the fantastical depths of the imagination sublime.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEVT566TIS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385720971#wasThisHelpful","R1MEVT566TIS2","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this puppy shampoo. It smells fan-freaking-tastic. Describing scent is always challenging, but I'll give it a go. It is very reminiscent of play dough, in a good way. It's a pleasing smell that doesn't smell like anything a human would wear. If a dog shampoo smells like lavender, then on the dog it smells like dog + lavender which = weird. This scent matches up with the dog's own smells and combines to smell wholesome and complimentary together.I have a short haired Min Pin who I bathe two or three times a week. Given her small size it's easy to plop her in the sink and clean her up, so we do. I was worried the excessive bathing would upset her skin, but the puppy formula is super gentle and she has no skin irritation from the frequent bathing. Even though she's now becoming an adult, we'll stick with the puppy formulation because it is extra gentle and we love the smell so much. Additionally, the built in conditioner is great. Her fur is silky soft to the touch and shines brilliantly in the light. Added bonus, the current price here on Amazon of eight dollars is five dollars less than what I paid for it at a brick and mortar pet store.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WBN3KYSM1ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054HUEI2#wasThisHelpful","R27WBN3KYSM1ZY","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:51 MinsI LOVE staniac. I was very nervous when I purchased this, but went off the strength of the positive reviews. I ordered ""beauty queen"" and it is so deep red in the tube, I was concerned, but I didn't want to get the more pinkish shade, as I never have luck with pinks.I am completely satisfied with this product. It goes on light and you can control how intense you want the color to be. And it lasts and lasts all day. It is always natural looking, which is important to those of us who don't go in for the painted look. If you like natural enhancing makeups as opposed to the overly done up look, this is a must-have item. I originally bought it for the blush, but love it on my lips more. I am not a fussy makeup kind of person and could never stand lip stick because of the high maintenance of reapplication. This is perfect color with no maintenance required. It subtly enhances my lip color and when dry I just put chapstick over it and go.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCFYR3H0SGAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BE52B4#wasThisHelpful","R3GCFYR3H0SGAI","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been anticipating this album for awhile. I've been listening to the first single, ""My God is the Sun,"" and old QOTSA albums all week gearing up for this release. I was really pleased with Them Crooked Vultures, but I am delighted to get back to a fully focused QOTSA album.This album is pure QOTSA. If I were to compare it to past offerings, it is most reminiscent of of themes from Lullabies to Paralyze, and invokes a strong sense of Homme's roots in Kyuss. However, it is a departure from Era Vulgaris. Era Vulgaris came on like a heart attack, power thumped your brain for an hour with hard hitting rock and then tossed you aside. ...Like Clockwork is far more creative and playful. ...Like Clockwork is reaching for a deeper and more meaningful connection. This is much more complex effort, both musically and lyrically. If your a long time fan you should pick this up on the first listen, but if you came to QOTSA first by Era Vulgaris, this will not meet your expectations....Like Clockwork isn't from this dimension. Homme is at home doing his own thing and ...Like Clockwork is a successfully avant garde offering. It contains the best experimental efforts of an art-rock album coupled with Homme's hard-rock genius and technical precision. The list of contributors to this offering is fantastic, but none overshadow or hijack the show. This is a new and original work, but it's a natural evolution of 90s rock that was weened on 70s hard rock. ""Smooth Sailing"" has Reznor's prints all over it and invokes the strength of Broken's best moments. ""If I Had a Tail"" is infused with Kyuss's Desert Session alchemy. The song ""...Like Clockwork"" caught me unawares at the end and conjured memories of This Mortal Coil. If your catching these musical allusions, you'll know how powerfully compelling the amalgamation is. I'm not in the ""rock is dead"" mindset that is so pervasive these days, but if rock is truly dying, then the best and most talented musicians are consolidating around QOTSA and are going out Alamo style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1KWIHI74HNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9U9YOW#wasThisHelpful","R1O1KWIHI74HNE","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:54 MinsI love these flour sack towels. They are super handy around the house for all sorts of tasks. They are *not* thick like terrycloth towels and they're not supposed to be. The thinness allows them to be lint-free and dry quickly.I prefer them for hand towels in the bathroom and kitchen because they dry rapidly which helps to inhibit the growth of germs. I use them as cheesecloth for tasks like squeezing the water out of freshly grated and rinsed hashbrowns or rinsed rice. I use them to clean televisions, mirrors and windows - because they are lint free. Any task you might use a paper towel for can be replaced by a flour sack towel and keep more virgin forest paper out of landfills and incinerators. My favorite use is to use them to dry my hands with before I put my contacts in so that I never get any terrycloth fuzz in my eyeball.Awesome product at an excellent value.

" 0:35 MinsThis has the silliest dust jacket I've ever seen. In fact, the three quarters dust jacket is so absurd that there must be a great story behind it. As a book lover, I found the dust jacket aesthetically challenging, and I confess it irks me every time I handle it.Nevertheless, it's all worth it for the book's contents. Jauss fulfills the title and challenges conventional thinking toward fiction writing. He applies logic and patience to the jumbled hairball of contradictory information that students of writing are inundated with.The majority of books on writing tend to forget about craft and focus more on inspiration. Inspiration is all well and good, but the more books on writing I read, the more I conclude that the inspirational writers really don't know how to teach craft. Jauss uses examples from the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of short stories and novels, that have transfigured modern literature, to show step-by-step how the author achieved their intended effect.If you're unfamiliar with an author or story that Jauss is referencing, make a list and read those stories ASAP. I've spent the couple years focusing on creative writing and these stories are referenced in nearly ever class and workshop I attend. Being intimately familiar with these stories will put you in the best position to glean the insight instructors offer when studying them. The writings Jauss' cites are canonical stories in terms of writing craft and you need to familiarize yourself with them.Jauss' instructional prose is accessible and easy to read. I never found my mind wandering from the page, which is a high compliment to any instructional book. His years of teaching show. I often felt as if I were attending an engaging lecture as I read along. I know I'll be keeping this book, with its silly dust jacket, as a go-to reference that will be re-read many times.Highly Recommended!Would also recommend: Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft (5th Edition) (edition is irrelevant if you're not taking a class - so get it used and cheap)Reading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them (P.S.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOXXPIRVFYKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AL51OYU#wasThisHelpful","R3EOXXPIRVFYKY","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've had the bag for over a month now. When I'm not carrying much more than a book and maybe a water bottle it is fine, but much more weight than that and I really begin to feel the strain between my shoulder blades and on my neck in a way I absolutely do not in more 'professional' and ergonomically designed backpacks. If I'm lugging it around all day, and as a pedestrian and student, I usually am, I wind up with a pretty severe upper back and neck ache by the end of the day. I wish this were more ergonomically designed because it is truly a cute, durable and well priced backpack - but it's not built for comfort during heavy duty use.

"Phantom Noise is an emotionally engaging and intellectually refreshing volume of modern poetry. I enjoyed this collection because the collection, as a whole, finds a balance between the poems that focus on the war and the poems that focus on the life of the culturally re-assimilated solider, while even finding room for a few poems that stray entirely from Turner's central war-based themes.I found this volume of poetry different than a lot of modern poetry and it was appealing for that reason. My first thought was that Turner doesn't read like your typical bourgeois MFA professor-poet that dominate the world of modern poetry. But Turner does have an MFA and he is a professor. He is able to transcend conventions and designations that society heaves upon us, and it comes through in each of these poems. Neither he nor his speakers are  just a war veteran or professor or poet or father or lover or survivor or witness to trauma - there  is an amalgamation of all. His speaker's are fully fleshed human beings weaving intense narratives that are capable invoking emotive empathy.Given the highly polarizing subject, Turner's poems are never polemic or didactic. His most sacred  duty as a poet is as a witness and in this capacity he vigilantly serves the reader as genuinely as he has served his country. This was a fantastic volume of poetry that I will be reading and  re-reading for some time to come.Highly Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MIUPB7O4DDMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1882295803#wasThisHelpful","R2MIUPB7O4DDMC","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first we didn't know what to think. The opening chapter was a horrific page turning event that we couldn't put down or believe. We didn't think any author could sustain that kind of momentum with such an avant-garde approach. We had, of course, read Faulkner's, famed short story, ""A Rose For Emily,"" and while admiring the daring method of employing first-person-plural narration, we did not think that it could realistically be sustained for the entire length of a novel.We were wrong.We kept waiting for Eugenides to stumble and fall while juggling such a behemoth as first-person-plural narration.  Yet he did so with such stunning grace that we were flabbergasted that this was, in fact, his debut novel. We were charmed by Eugenidies preternatural amalgamation of poetry and prose that flowed with a pervasive charisma that reminded us of the fiendish skill of Nabakov and Conrad. We gladly surrendered to the quest and joined the protagonists in their efforts to unravel their obsession with the Lisbon sisters.We found ourselves calling to mind similar families from our own adolescence. The girls in funny looking homespun dresses, the families that had no T.V. and didn't celebrate birthdays. The kids who had to leave class when it was time to say the Pledge of Allegiance. We remembered the curiosity we felt about their strange lifestyle, how fascinating they were, simply because they were corralled and disciplined. We were reminded of gossiping about how that one group had to wear special religious underwear. We recalled the mystery and power of our own personal myths of the everyday people, who were figures of gigantic proportion in our childhood and teens. We summoned up memories of how, as children, we knew how to stare, really look at a person or thing in a way we've sadly outgrown and labeled as impolite. We recalled a time when we could see a thing for what it was without making excuses for it.  Eugenides' anamnestic prose summoned visions of our own youth.We greedily consumed each word till at last we reached the last page and the concluding words left us teary-eyed and glad we'd followed Eugenides down the rabbit hole to Grosse Pointe, Michigan, circa 1970's for the chance to smell Lux's watermelon gum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGFZ8UAXX34P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312428812#wasThisHelpful","R1HGFZ8UAXX34P","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hate to give this product a low review. I love The American Heritage dictionary. The hard copy dictionary is perfect in every way and a steal at the current price offered of $37.50. When I searched it out at a brick and mortar store it was priced at $60.00 It's  visually impressive and looks great displayed.I originally purchased the kindle version as I prefer digital dictionaries. I returned it for a refund (you can do that with kindle purchases if you find them unsatisfactory) within twenty minutes. The kindle version is hairball of data that you have to pull apart yourself, page by page. There is no search function whatsoever. You can access a table of contents alphabetically and from there you must turn each page. So if I wanted to look up Azalea, I would have to start on page Aa, and digitally turn each page to get to Azalea. Whoever was in charge of the kindle version should be fired, it is an appalling waste of time and it is digitally incompetent.I bought the hard copy here on Amazon after price comparing with brick and mortar stores, motivated mainly by the access code for the android table and/or Ipad app. The app is far more thoughtfully constructed than the kindle version, as you can actually search for words. However, it is entirely redundant because it requires wifi to access the app. Which is irrelevant because AHD.com offers the exact same resource, for free, no access code required. So if you're not in a wifi accessible area (yes they do still exist), its useless, and its useless anyway because if you are in a wifi accessible area, you can access the dictionary free via their website. Additional heads up, even if you are still interested in the app, the access code that comes with the hard copy has now expired.So all things considered, I would not make this purchase again. I have nothing against the hard copy. It is rather beautiful in a nerdy-book-girl way and I do have it proudly displayed. Yet, in the age of modern convenience I rarely use it, because my tablet and/or laptop are much more user friendly.Great dictionary, but inadequately updated for the modern age.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UT3H2KUCMHZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547041012#wasThisHelpful","R1UT3H2KUCMHZR","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:32 MinsI am very pleased with my purchase of the Contech Procone. It worked great for my dog after her surgery. She had it on continuously for two weeks after she was spayed. The pliability of the material allowed her to snuggle up with us, rest her head, and access her food and water dishes without ever being able to access her stitches. She didn't like the contraption, but was as content as a post-operative dog with itchy stitches and a giant cone around her head could be. This was more affordable than the plastic shame cone offered at my Vet's office and I'm super pleased with its efficacy. In response to another review, I did not notice any particular odor or smell.

" 2:07 MinsI am mostly pleased with this item. Less than pleased with the sizing information provided in the description. I have a 9 lbs Min Pin, and was going to order the small version: Zack & Zoey Polyester Thermal Lined Dog Jacket, X-Small, Red However, all of the reviews on that listing stated that the small was too small for most small breeds. I ordered the medium based off of those reviews. As you can see in the video the medium is a very large fit on my Min Pin. I don't know if the small would have fitted better, or not at all as so many other people experienced.Pros:This jacket is exceptionally well made and warm. It's twice as thick and warm as any jackets available at Petco or Walmart. This is a heavy duty jacket for areas with harsh winters. The craftsmanship, materials, and quality are all top notch. It's red, which makes my wee little dog more visible should she happen to escape the leash. The Velcro strips stay securely on and make for an easy experience getting her into and out of the coat.Cons:Poor fit. Unclear sizing info available.

"Laura Read is a delightful poet whose work I have admired for a long time. I was thrilled to find that her new volume of poetry is finally available.Read excels in setting. The locations in her poems take on the depth and dimensions of fully fleshed characters. She captures more than just the essence of a place. Having been to some of the locales featured in her poems, I find her descriptive prowess downright eerie in its perfection.Read's speakers are imbued with a paradoxical flair of naïve wisdom that leaps from the page and pierces the innermost chambers of the reader's heart. The speakers range from little girls to women, all of whom eagerly whisper their secrets and desires in the reader's ear as if you were their long lost childhood bosom buddy. This collection will easily pull you back for a second and third read. With each re-reading, I discovered another layer of nuanced detail.

"Tori's skill as pianist has grown since the original releases of these songs. Her musical-craft is superb, and as a musician her technical skill has never been stronger. Her creativity and originality wellspring seems to be a wee bit on the dry side in recent years. As is evidenced by this rehashing of her former glories. Following hard on the heels of ""Night of the Hunters,"" ""Gold Dust"" is an orchestral reboot of Tori's greatest hits. ""Gold Dust"" is a cogent, if not very revolutionary idea that is often poorly executed. Tori fans are rabid enough to purchase anything their Siren Goddess puts out and based on her stunning creativity from the 90's I always check out her new releases. However, with the exception of ""American Doll Posse"" and ""Night of the Hunters,"" I've not cared for any of her full album releases in the last decade.""Gold Dust"" is, for me, a mixed bag. I like the last third of the album from ""Programmable Soda"" onward it's fantastic. However, that is only four songs out of fourteen.She's murdered the icy ethereal chill of ""Yes, Anastasia"" by softening up the arrangement with the addition of the orchestra, which was hardly necessary since the original already included one that did it much more sparsely in tune with the song's eerie charm. ""Jackie's Strength"" with all of its junior high school allusions is another odd choice for orchestration - it just doesn't match. ""Cloud on my Tongue,"" is one of my all-time favorite Tori tunes, and it sounded rather hopeful for most of the song, until Tori unpacked her (much overused in the last decade) frooty-loops chorus of her own pre-recorded backup vocals and sank the whole song. Ditto for  ""Precious Things.""  ""Star of Wonder"" is nice. ""Winter"" is another absurd choice for this compilation since it is so similar to the original that it is simply unnecessary here. ""Flying Dutchman"" is another personal favorite that is, again essentially unchanged from its original.  ""Programmable Soda,"" is super fun, and improves dramatically on the original, which was already great. Definitely the pick of the litter here. ""Snow Cherries From France"" is great as well. ""Marrianne"" has a few dramatic tweaks and is absolutely lovely, warm, and one of the few genuinely heart-felt performances on the album. ""Silent All These Years"" is well-done and pleasing, though not radically different. ""Girl Disappearing"" is fantastic and ends the album on a high note.Tori's performance on these songs for the first two-thirds of the album is subpar. I mostly felt as if her vocal tone was that of someone whose told the same tall tale so many times, that their own performance had morphed into kitsch parody of themselves. The passion, interest, and commitment are simply not present in her voice for the first two-thirds of the album.  I'd recommend streaming this album for a listen and then purchasing the tracks you want. With a few diamonds in the rough, ""Gold Dust"" is ultimately a failed attempt, that as an entire album will only be digestible to hard-core Tori-philes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AUDDTDBTVEOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RZHC7Y#wasThisHelpful","R2AUDDTDBTVEOM","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fantastic read. I had it assigned for an Ethics and Rhetoric class. It was by far the best reading of the quarter. Accessible to anyone, and I mean absolutely anyone. Marcus Aurelius' vivacity, wisdom and wit is every bit as relevant today as when he wrote this nearly two millennium ago. I rushed through this in two weeks, as it was required to be read in that time span for the course I was taking. It could be finished in a day. However, I suggest taking your time with this. It is filled to the brim with pithy wisdom and poignant aphorisms that deserve meditation, reflection, and time to process. I'm going to re-read this book, but take it a very slow pace, perhaps even just an aphorism a day to really give myself time to absorb and enjoy this great philosophical treasure.The introduction was very readable and I enjoyed it almost as much as the text. The translator is a deft philosopher as well as translator. The translator notes that some sayings and sections have been cut out as they are highly debated and require more commentary to decode than this particular version can accommodate. I found I was okay with that. This is an introduction, and while it is of a scholarly quality, I do not think it is for serious scholars. There is no extensive commentary and precious few footnotesBut that's the great thing about this text, you don't have to have any degrees or prior knowledge to understand and comprehend Aurelius' insight. It is the most accessible and practically applicable philosophical text I've ever read. Aurelius reached out to the philosopher in every human and shared his wisdom without pomp.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAUY8PR00PQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585426172#wasThisHelpful","RYAUY8PR00PQG","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this Wordsworth Classics compilation of Anton Chekhov's selected stories. What makes this addition such a rewarding read was the care with which these selections have been chosen. As noted in the superb introduction by Joe Andrew, Professor of Russian Literature from Keele University, ""All but four of the stories first appeared in the 1880's and many of them are only a few pages long. Consequently, they give the reader not only a particularly keen insight into the early period, but also afford many instances of Chekhov's hallmark style, his brevity, concision, and simple realism."" In other words, this is a fantastic introduction to Chekhov. Chekhov was a prolific writer of short stories, so if this catches your fancy you have the rest of his literary career and maturation before you to explore. He wrote up until his untimely death at the age of 44 in 1904.Because there is no definitive collection of Chekhov's stories, one would be best advised to approach his work chronologically and pay attention to how the collection of stories is compiled. Other reviews here have provided erroneous information as to the stories included in this collection. Most likely, I think they are reviewing a separate compilation and thinking one is much the same as another.For the Wordsworth Classics Selected Stories of Anton ChekhovISBN: 1853262889Stories in this version include:""Overseasoned""""The Night before Easter""""At Home""""Champagne""""The Malefactor""""Murder Will Out""""The Trousseau""""The Decoration""""The Man in a Case""""Little Jack""""Dreams""""The Death of an Official""""Agatha""""The Beggar""""Children""""The Troublesome Guest""""Not Wanted""""The Robbers""""Lean and Fat""""On the Way""""The Head Gardner's Tale""""Hush!""""Without a Title""""In the Ravine""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WWXON0I0ZIC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1853262889#wasThisHelpful","R2WWXON0I0ZIC0","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an awesome product at a fabulous price. Recycled products are often cost-prohibitively pricey. Toilet paper is one of the worst examples of this, with low quality products being two to three times the price of the virgin-forest sourced products. I saw a documentary once that attributed this strange pricing phenomena to government subsidies that timber industries get that allow them to bring virgin-forest sourced paper products to the market cheaper than recycled products can be produced. Which says a lot about our society, but I'm here to review toilet paper, not capitalism. So here ya go: This is lush, soft, dreamy toilet paper. I was using Seventh Generation 1000 square 1-ply and buying it in bulk here on Amazon. The price suddenly doubled so I looked for an alternative and this was the best one I found.At the current price of $54.95 for 80 rolls works out to be 69 cents a roll. Which is competitive with virgin-source TP. Check around and you'll find this exact product on other sites at a much higher price tag. Shipping was 99 cents and I received it within two days of my order. Fabulous deal, but it gets even better, because this is some high quality tissue paper. If it wasn't labeled as Recycled, I would never even guess that it was. Great quality, great price, and great for the environment.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWR9Z91SHAXNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CZSAMO#wasThisHelpful","RWR9Z91SHAXNS","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This production is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully inspired film-craft in regards to cinematography, location, direction and acting (especially from the younger actor and actress playing Heathcliff and Catherine).The director Andrea Arnold has lovingly understood and rendered Emily Bronte's masterpiece in a truer sense than I've ever seen previously in film adaptations. Her affinity with the novel is obvious in the extreme devotion to the nuances that other films always seem to miss. Specifically, and most importantly is location. Wuthering heights, Thrushcross Grange, and most especially the moors are such integral parts of this story and so representational that the importance of location cannot be over-estimated. Arnold's shots of the moors put the audience perfectly in the setting. Breathtaking images of the moors leave the viewer able to fully comprehend the isolation the characters would feel in such a desolate landscape. Which is then contrasted to the more populated and cheerful Thruscross Grange. Catherine and Heathcliff's bond is indigenous to the fierce and uncultivated land of the moors. Arnold's adaptation is unparalleled in expressing this deeper understanding of the story.She does a fine job with Catherine and Heathcliff's younger years. Solomon Glave and Shannon Beer gave heart-wrenching and profound performances, all the more remarkable given their tender ages. Glave's performance was remarkable. I believed in their love on screen, as surely as I did when I read the novel. However, the entire production goes belly up in the last third of film. The replacement of the characters with older actors betrays the powerful beauty and chemistry that was so painstakingly created by Beer and Glave. Kaya Scodelario and James Howson are both competent actors, but they did not earn the emotions they were pretending to as the younger actors had. Their appearance was too jarringly different. By the time they make it onscreen, Beer and Glave had already stole the show.Given that only three and half years pass in the novel between the time Catherine Marries Edgar and Heathcliff's return, the changeup of actors was even more senseless and inappropriate. But beyond this complaint, the rest of the story is wrapped up so quickly once the adult actors are brought in, that much of the story is missed. Heathcliff's revenge on Hindley, his reconstruction of his own trauma on Hareton, and his plot for Cathy and Linton are all forgotten about.This adaptation is superb in many ways, but fails in important aspects as well. I could not imagine watching this if I had not read the book. It would be incomprehensible and strange. Upon reflection as to why there has never been a generally accepted film adaptation for this story - I don't think it's possible. So much of the novel relies on narration. The narration of the ever boring Mr. Lockwood is a device for Nelly Dean to narrate the tale. It's Nelly Dean that makes the story human and digestible. She is not an unreliable narrator, but she is an incredibly biased narrator. In a sense, she raised Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff are detestable characters. They are selfish, narcissistic, and cruel. They are unlovable, yet Nelly loves them. Nelly forgives them. Nelly's narration softens and distills their harshness for the reader. However Nelly is never realized as a fully developed character in any of the film adaptations.This is a beautiful film with excellent cinematography. And while the directory clearly appreciates the story and captures real bits of the story with brilliance, she lets others important bits fall by the wayside, so that you have crystal clear snippets, but not the entire story in its full breathtaking splendor. What is captured is truer to the grisliest bits of the novel that are traditionally ignored in adaptations. It is a vindicating adaptation for anyone whose ever shaken their head in frustration when people romanticize Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff. This adaptation has glaring flaws and is difficult to digest, yet I'd recommend it to anyone else who is an avid fan of the novel, but not to newcomers and certainly not to people who enjoy standard period piece costume dramas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVH565SGELZXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2H9KUM#wasThisHelpful","RVH565SGELZXD","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't exactly an introduction, because much of what Johnson discusses will require prior knowledge and familiarity with Socrates and this period of Greek history. However, this work is nowhere near scholarly quality either. This can only be a review or refresher - yet it is a review of the author's highly biased ideas of what he wants Socrates to represent. The author's style is at once narcissistic, pompous, and vague.Johnson rebukes Plato for using Socrates as a mouthpiece for his own ideas, yet does so himself ad nauseum throughout the entire book. Socrates in Johnson's hands is little more than a puppet used to validate Johnson's own ideology. Johnson's sycophantic rendering of Socrates is selective hero worship, not genuine scholarship.The most positive thing I can say about this book is that it is highly readable. Johnson excels in creating a page-turning narrative. Because it lacks substance that would require reflection, this books can be finished in a sitting.Skip this drivel. Read Five Dialogues, so that you can form your own ideas and come to your own conclusions about Socrates.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REPOFB0H981TG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670023035#wasThisHelpful","REPOFB0H981TG","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this immensely. This is for the avid student of Greene, and not the casual listener. Writers and scholars will not find anything new here. Greene's 500 words per day writing regime, The libel suit brought by Shirley Temple, his travels, and opinions are all things I've read about before. However, it was a more engaging experience to hear Greene express these thoughts vocally.  The strongest tracks are when Greene is reading extracts from his writing journals that are compiled in, In Search of a Character: Two African Journals:  Congo Journey and Convoy to West Africa (Twentieth-Century Classics)  that go back and forth between bits of story and his commentary on how the story is developing in his mind while he travels through Africa. His reading of an extract of ""A Small Affair"" is especially compelling as well. You can hear how much he enjoys reading these selections. His tone and intensity here stands in sharp contrast to his taciturn manner when being interviewed.  He's not a very affable interviewee, the various interviewers really have to work at drawing Greene out. Greene maintains his British stiff-upper lip throughout the interviews, yet softens with warmth and charm when reading his own selections.Track Listing:1.

"I was a little nervous catching the bus at a transfer station which is a giant parking lot under the freeway, so I purchased this device for an added sense of security. Only a couple days after it arrived when I was at the transfer station, a couple of unsavory men were walking behind me, using foul language and I was feeling generally unsafe. I was gripping this device pretty tightly in my pocket and without meaning to, I pulled the pin. It was LOUD. The two men, whether they were up to no good or not, immediately turned around and walked the other way, rather quickly. Which was pretty impressive.However, an hour later when I was in the cafeteria, it just went off in my pocket - no idea how or why. I felt like a total doofus, but oh well, small price to pay for its earlier awesome performance. I haven't had any accidental alarms since. I have this and Brutus the Bull Dog Self Defense Keychain- PINK linked together on the keychain for easy access. Should the need arise you can then pull the alarm, have it sending out its crazy loud signal from your pocket and if that isn't enough to frighten someone off, you have the self defense keychain to defend yourself with.Highly Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5CIPF00DFWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005E04MK0#wasThisHelpful","R1U5CIPF00DFWC","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Awesome product. My new puppy would bark and whine when put in her crate and carry on all day while we were away. This product took about 3 days to fully work for her. She would get herself in a vicious barking cycle of barking because of the shocks and it did take her a few days to figure out the connection. The device has a fail safe for this and will take a rest period after several consecutive shocks. However, she did get it and now she does not bark when its on. She has figured out what sounds she can make without it shocking her and she certainly does whine at a very low level, But that's okay and both my neighbors and I can live with it.I have a Min Pin who weighs five pounds and in retrospect I would have bought a smaller sized model for her.

However, it had been so long since I'd seen this and I'd missed it so much that I took a chance and ordered it.I'm glad I did. I don't foresee this being queued up for a quality bluray transfer anytime soon. It is indeed a poor transfer and there is nothing special done for this '25th anniversary' edition. However, it is an acceptable version. Production values on this were low from the production's inception and its strength is entirely in its acting, dialogue and direction. If you have the attention span to overlook low production values, there is ample consolation to be found in the deft storytelling efforts of the cast and crew.

"In all the things I've purchased for my new puppy - this is by far and away the most aggravating and useless purchase. How it has such stellar ratings is beyond me. My 5 pound Min Pin instantly climbed out of it. I tied a blanket to the top, she chewed through it. I bought wire mesh and stapled it to the top - that kept her inside of the playpen. Until she began bodily pushing the playpen, with her amazing five pounds she could scoot this thing from one end of the room to the other, effortlessly. Eventually it gets turned on its head. Its lack of a bottom is a huge issue as well. Cleanup was a nightmare. Potty Pads were useless with the thing being moved about so much.Perhaps this will work for you if you have a mild, sedate and exceptionally well behaved older dog. However, it's absolutely useless for puppies who have enough energy and intelligence to outsmart this device. I wanted to give my new puppy lots of room while I was away - but the extra room just made her more anxious and destructive. Now I have her in a standard travel crate where she only has enough room to turn around and it works 100 percent of the time. As an added bonus she seems more content with the more den-like atmosphere. If you have an escape artist, or a not-fully trained puppy or an incontinent dog avoid this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AX4CK2QPC0Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FS6INU#wasThisHelpful","R1AX4CK2QPC0Q3","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a strong and entertaining offering from Philip K. Dick's public domain short story catalogue. It is a very early story written in his youth and brings up themes of confronting the nature of reality that Dick obsessively explored  throughout his life.More than a few reviewers have noted as a negative, that the ending was predictable or that the plot devices have been over-used by others, suggesting the idea that the story has lost its relevance.I contend that this is an incorrect assertion and is based on a poor reading of the material. Dick's works have a sci-fi flavor to them, but they are not sci-fi genre plot driven stories anymore than Vonnegut's. With Dick, the plot is a means to and end. Dick's end is always exploring which bits of reality are rigid and which are flexible, and if flexible, how far can they bend. His exploration of that theme is the crÃ¨me - not surprising plot twists and gimmicks.Dick is not deliberately withholding the conclusion - it is not supposed to be a ""shock and awe"" kind of realization. The shock and awe come in the implication that if time is not a fixed entity, then in a sense, you will be born again and again - with or without a time machine.Which for my part, I thought was an awesome good conclusion and a remarkably fun one to make in under 35 pages. Not to mention Dick's numerous and witty political insights and innuendos. While illustrating aspects of reality and time, Dick simultaneously tells a story that shows how those in power who try to control religious and social movements foster the growth of that which they seek to annihilate.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVEMXZAGWKZJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TRD3VI#wasThisHelpful","RVEMXZAGWKZJZ","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Watts is very fond of quoting William Blake's aphorism ""A Fool Who Persists in His Folly Will Become Wise,"" as a means of explaining Zen philosophy to western students. If you're already a fan of Alan Watts, that quotation sums up this lecture series perfectly.Out of Your Mind is a much more thorough, and thoughtfully compiled set than this one is (MP3 download is available at significant savings: Out Of Your Mind: The Nature of Consciousness I). I do not regret the purchase in the least and have enjoyed listening to this presentation. However, it doesn't bear comparison with Out of Your Mind.Much of this is similar to lectures given on the Out of Your Mind lecture series. Many are different recordings from different times, yet are nearly word for word. Sometimes this will lead Watts onto a different vignette of thought that contain tasty morsels of hitherto unheard wisdom.This is a philosophical casserole containing left over bits that have been pieced together by the philosophers of capitalism over at SoundsTrue Media. I'm sorry to report that the same spaced-out obnoxious announcer and lame corporate mystic sounding guitar intros from the Out of Your Mind series is ever present on this collection.All the same, I enjoyed the collection and would recommend it to anyone *after* they have listened to the Out of Your Mind lecture series. I've listened to the Out of Your Mind collection so many times, I tune it out now because I always know what Watts will say next. So in light of that, it's been wonderful to hear it all again, in a different order with a new bit here or there to spice it up and secure my attention.So if you didn't get it the first time, keep on keeping on and eventually we'll all reach enlightenment!Namu Myoho Renge Kyo :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ACV0MH1XZ1H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591797349#wasThisHelpful","R2ACV0MH1XZ1H0","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of the stories in this collection are steeped in 60's nostalgia. A dark spectre haunts each narrative and prevents you from succumbing to the lure of innocence, BLT's and bubblegum. The darkness in these stories is just a glimmer that you catch out of the corner of your eye, evaporating by the time you give it your full attention. This imbues each story with a satisfying tension and a kind of anxiety that hides deep in your belly while you apprehensively wait for the nameless shadow to take hold. Canyon refuses to drag that darkness kicking and screaming into the light. Instead she leaves the reader with an unsettled certainty that doesn't require  confirmation. The families that populate these stories remind me of familiar neighborhood families from childhood - as a child you just knew something was wrong, and you knew all the adults around you knew too. Yet, in a kind of communal conspiracy, no one dared to give voice to the darkness.This collection was especially effective and enjoyable due to Canyon's adroit talent with the short story form. This made it possible to read and enjoy while waiting for the bus, in waiting rooms, or just when I had a moment here and there. I didn't rush through the collection because each story was dense and weighty in my mind. I  felt the need to let each story be fully absorbed before I moved onto the next. ""Me, Myself & We,"" ""Side Pork,"" ""The Pottery,"" and ""Intimate Apparel (lingerie intime)"" were my favorites in the collection. I eagerly look forward to more offerings from this author.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P6CZXN9B7I2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DHYQNY#wasThisHelpful","R1P6CZXN9B7I2N","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great gem of a movie that has all the tell tale markings of a sleeper hit. I have to say this film made me realize how jaded I've grown toward independent films. Having seen the trailer, I expected to be entertained and enjoy the film, but I was sure that I was beyond its warm and fuzzy sentiments - I never expected to fall so hard for this movie.It was absolutely lovely to watch a film that both my teenage son and I could enjoy that has great characters, plot, dialogue and direction. Not to mention heart, warmth, and a refreshing lack of violence and nudity. The film walks a fine line, yet never falls into the realm of the sappy, clichÃ©, or bland family film. This is the kind of film that shows you how delightful it is to be surprised and charmed by everyday reality.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X88FPX0XP69Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OHV5R8#wasThisHelpful","R1X88FPX0XP69Q","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an insightful documentary that chronicles Canadian farmer David Schmeiser's legal battles against the international corporation Monsanto.The documentary is very bare-bones. No fancy graphics or cinematography. The soundtrack is just as sparse. The film would have benefited from a more elaborate production. However, the story is gripping, real and very engaging. And perhaps the film is more credible due to its sparse production value - no corporate sponsors were lined up to bankroll this documentary.More important than the story of Schmeister's individual legal defense against Monsanto is the documentation of Monsanto's insanely dogged corporate policy of legally victimizing and persecuting farmers as a means of bullying the market into buying their GMO seeds. Monsanto's tactics are predatory. They use their considerable financial resources to manipulate the legal system in an effort to retaliate against farmers who use their own seed to replant and do not opt to use Monsanto's.Farmers are on the front lines of this losing battle. Due to patents placed upon the seeds, because of their GMO nature - Monsanto has proprietary rights to any plant sprung from their seeds - even seeds that have been scattered due to wind, animals and other natural means. If Monsanto suspects one of its seeds has sprung on a farmer's land, they sue the farmer and attempt to confiscate his entire crop, plus legal fees. This film asks the question, Does anyone have a right to place a patent on life?The jackbooted corporate thugs at Monsanto think that they do. When you've consumed some of their GMO seed derived food and their patented gene is being absorbed for its nutrients in your body, do they own you too?I guess that's for our corrupt legal system to decide at another time - I'm going to wrap this review up before Monsanto sues me too!Highly recommended documentary. Cheers to Schmeister and the filmmakers for their bravery to stand up to the man and tell it like it really is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H1RIJB88RBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R14BZ8#wasThisHelpful","R29H1RIJB88RBB","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is very much Octavia Butler's response to conservative fanaticism and where she thought it would/could lead the United States. She follows through the social changes proposed by Christian conservatives through to its conclusion and creates the  dystopian world that their ideology would naturally lead to. Many people have commented on the horrific violence in this story - and it is at times oppressive and overwhelming. Violence is a real fact of life for many people throughout the world, and were Butler's dystopian future to come to pass, the violence in her tale wouldn't begin to tell the tale. It is not senseless violence added for a vicarious thrill or as one reviewer here termed it ""torture porn,"" rather it is always employed in service of the story. Given the nature of the violence and the story, the description could easily be more graphic and personal - Violence is always reported through Olamina's journals, and it takes on a news report kind of tone - Butler does not burden the reader with intimate personal accounts that would haunt the corners of your brain. There is little in the way of uplift in this tale - nor should you expect any in a truly dystopian novel.In the truest sense of hard-core old-fashioned science fiction, Butler's tale is a warning - it is speculative fiction. Butler speculates what would happen if the division of church and state were dissolved and corporate greed given a free hand. The tale is told in several voices, which separates it from ""Parable of the Sower."" While Lauren Olamina's voice dominates, the switch to her Daughter's voice who disapproves of her Mother, and her crusade levels off and balances the extremes of liberal self-righteousness that could have easily neutralized the validity of this novel.""Parable of the Talents"" is much better than its predecessor and is written so seamlessly, that you would not have to read ""Parable of the Sower"" to understand it. Butler has a better grasp of her characters and surer sense of where she's heading in this offering. The book matures significantly and reaches a sustained level of superb writing mid-way that lasts till the end of the novel.I'm saddened that Octavia Butler passed away before her time and before completing this saga. She was a visionary author with the chops to shatter the glass ceiling of the white-male dominated world of science fiction and show everyone how it's done.""All that you touchYou Change.All that you ChangeChanges you.The only lasting truthIs Change.GodIs Change.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTSKSUXU8COW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446675784#wasThisHelpful","R1UTSKSUXU8COW","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This show had every ingredient for success. An excellent cast of veteran actors - neat sci-fi starter story idea - excellent cinematography - and it all comes together to fall completely flat.So what went wrong here? I'm a sci-fi junkie and I know full well that a cancellation never reflects on a sci-fi show's quality. In fact most of the best sci-fi shows have been cancelled early. From the original Star Trek, to Farscape, to mayfly lifespan of Firefly - quality science fiction resists appreciation in its time.Yet that is just not the case for Outcasts. This show deserves its cancellation. Nothing groundbreaking or even particularly interesting happens in its 8 episode run. Each episode, including the pilot watch like a mid-season filler episode that you wade through waiting for the exciting arc episode, except there is no story arc.The show makes a lot of assumptions. It assumes that the audience will bond with the main characters - but they do nothing in the way of writing scenes that make these characters intriguing, likable, or even detestable. The characters are like paper dolls - one wears the reluctant hero outfit, another the scheming, yet complicated villain. The show is so plot driven they've forgotten to spice up the characters with personality and life. Refusing to take any risks, the audience is served up a cast of McCharacter's that taste the same, no matter what show or genre they're in.The show doesn't insult, offend, or alienate the viewer - it's just too cautious to be interesting. Too timid to be intriguing. And too confident to work hard for its supper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIKSLIAESGZ45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051SFTNE#wasThisHelpful","RIKSLIAESGZ45","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:11 MinsI like this book - its nicely sized to carry with you. It is approximately the size of a trade paperback and will fit in most purses. It is inconspicuous and doesn't look like your hauling your diary around with you - which is nice when you want to journal in public places.The book has some cons. The aged and distressed look of the book is more obviously faux in person than the picture renders. The photo looks as if it has a hard back, the description says that it has a soft cover - the soft cover is somewhat misleading, it is a paper cover, no thicker than the internal blank pages of the book. I'm not worried about it giving the book a damaged look, but find that without a hard cover the left side pages are impossible to write on if your not at a table or have a clipboard, which does limit its usefulness.Overall, I like the book - it's cute, clever, inconspicuous and portable","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BNZALABCM8C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G1A0J4#wasThisHelpful","R3BNZALABCM8C4","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:39 MinsI really like Pilot's Plumix refillable fountain pen. The pen feels great in the hand, it has good ink flow and writes smoothly across the page with no scratch.The package has no size details on the nib. However, the nib looks like and writes like a 0.7 nib (medium/average).My only complaint with the pen is the ink color. Package says that ink is blue, but it is a *very* light blue - I don't care for the light blue ink and would prefer a darker, more navy blue ink. I will update this review after I order replacement cartridges with information on how the color varies on Pilot's blue/black ink versus its blue ink. - I am not a fan of black ink.Overall this is a great starter fountain pen and a great deal at this price point due to its refillable option. Highly Recommended!***Update 9/15/12***I ordered Pilot Namiki Ink Refill Blue/Black 12Pk and can report that the blue/black shade of blue matches the navy blue ink from the Pilot Varsity pen in the video - ink cartridges are more reasonably priced on jetpens and other sites than here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHF5EYNF3RLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058NN9FC#wasThisHelpful","RPHF5EYNF3RLQ","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first read this book when I was in the third grade, 25 years ago. I instantly decided then that it was my favorite book and I read and re-read it many times. I loved it. I recently took on a research project involving children's and young adult stories and have a long reading list of Children's stories to read - I put ""The Witches"" at the top of my list for nostalgia's sake, not sure what to expect.As an adult, I can report, that it is simply a magnificent story. I can see why I loved it so much as a child. Dahl never dismisses the reader (children) as being inept. Like the Grandmother in the story, Dahl knows children don't require extreme coddling. He's not timid about using fear to tell a great story.Parent's strive to create a safe world for their children. But that illusion is one that all parents must slowly deconstruct to prepare children for reality. Fairy tales are an integral part of that deconstruction. In fairy tales, monsters can exist in a way that allows children face their fears and walk through those fears to the other side where strength, courage and confidence are found.""The Witches"" is a frightening, yet thrilling read for children. Dahl is a masterful storyteller and in ""The Witches"" he has weaved imagination, fear and courage into a fantastically fun story that has stood the test of time and remains refreshingly relevant  for each generation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R323C3WUMWI8CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014241011X#wasThisHelpful","R323C3WUMWI8CP","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product serves as a fine replacement to Comet or Ajax for those of us who dislike using bleach - it does absolutely everything that Ajax can do, and that is pretty groovy.However, it under-performs as a  replacement for ammonia-based oven cleaners. It does not equal a real oven cleaner's strength or efficacy inside the oven. In regards to those heavy layers of black backed-on chunks, it cleared out maybe 75 percent from my oven (which was not excessively dirty to start out with) and after that no amount of elbow grease or steel wool or extra cleaner was getting that last 25 percent off.Avoiding harsh chemical cleaners is a goal of mine and this product is great in the bathroom and on my stainless steal kitchen sink - but below par in the oven.

"This is an awesome product that works exactly like advertised. It was easy to apply and it works like a dream.My tub was quite literally a death trap, having taken a serious fall once, I purchased a 15 dollar rubber grip tub mat - which slipped and slid around the tub as often as I got in the tub and collected black gunk underneath it, and would take 5 minutes of scrubbing with abrasive cleaners to get the black soiled footmarks off of once a week. All that indignity and it never really worked!Motivated by yet another near-death experience in the tub, I researched and ordered this product. It is very clear and can be applied in an apartment, I'm quite sure your landlord will never know when you move that it's even there. It is slightly abrasive when you take a bath, I found it much more relaxing to put a towel down than have my backside exfoliated by its sandpaper grip. I bathe occasionally, but shower regularly and felt that its life-saving benefit outweighed its bathing irritation cost. I'm well pleased with the results and I will update this review if anything changes.I do want to point out that this is listed no less than three times on Amazon and the price point and shipping options vary on each one. When I ordered this it was $8.95 with prime shipping - but now it has a shipping charge. It is also available at varying price and shipping differentials here: Tub Grip Clear anti-slip bathtub coating and Tub Grip Clear Anti-slip Bathtub Coating - check them out and do a quick search to make sure your getting the best price.***********UPDATE 3/18/13*************I really loved this product when I first purchased it and originally gave it 5 stars, I am now reducing my rating to 3 stars. Eight months have passed and now many patches of the product have simply washed off and it will require a new coating. I could more easily accept the need to re-coat if the product was sold with several applications. However the amount sold is just enough to do the bottom of a tub with none to spare. With the new shipping charge the price has almost doubled since my original purchase prompting me to consider a new product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKNC3C4WQDOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EYZZGO#wasThisHelpful","RRKNC3C4WQDOT","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of reviews and the review process. It's one of the reasons I love Amazon so much, as consumers, the review process empowers us to share our experiences and make informed decisions on how we spend our money.This product has a fair amount of bad reviews and some of those reviews are truly horrid. Missing parts, damaged item, etc.However, I ordered this product anyway. Why? Its certainly not that I don't believe or put faith in the reviews, I do. Every product has lemons, and the cheaper the product, the higher the ratio of lemons. I discounted the lemon reviews because Amazon has always been faithfully easy when it comes to returns. Then I discounted the other negative reviews because I perceived that those reviews were written by people who were expecting to get one up on the system and score a great deal. Nothing wrong with that, I try to get great deals when I can - but this is not a great deal, you'll get exactly what you pay for.I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and knew that I was not going to get a deal, I was going to get what I paid for, which was 40 dollars worth of plastic and cheaply wallpapered press-board. But when it came down to it, I found I wanted the largest bookshelf I could get for the least amount of money, so I could spend more money on books. While I'd love an impressive and beautifully rendered bookcase that conjures memories and nostalgia, I don't have that kind of money and I'm more interested in spending the money I do have on more books to fill in the case rather than on the case itself.This thing is wobbly - I strongly urge anyone with young children to avoid this purchase entirely, it would be a falling hazard. It is cheap, the poles are lightweight plastic and while I was lucky and mine did not arrived damaged from the shipping process, there are actual design flaws and awkwardly placed seams (face 'em to the wall if you can). And most egregious of all, this thing STINKS. It smells like it escaped a paper mill - after two days, I come in the door and it is the first thing I smell (though I know it will fade out eventually), if you are chemically sensitive,  this is a purchase you should avoid.But all that said, it holds my books just fine and I know I would have paid 3 to 4 times as much for this much space on a quality shelf. So I am content with this purchase, but only because I knew what I was signing up for and got exactly what I expected. If you feel the same, I recommend it, if not, then I advise walking away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMOWEKISVOFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056NSQ16#wasThisHelpful","R3RMOWEKISVOFG","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a layer of rich splendor created in the cinematography of this film in its deftly applied attention to detail. A film critic's essay included with the Criterion Blu Ray edition notes that Merchant/Ivory productions had decades of experience in making the sets look authentic and lived in, and while having appreciated it to some degree in previous viewings on VHS, DVD, and even streaming  - these true details brought forth in such clarity in the Blu Ray version explode in a violence that took my breath away. Set in London's early 20th century, the film dresses its people and furnishings in subdued hues of browns, greys, beige, olive green  and powdered blues  - the shocking contrasts of colorific beauty are highlighted and segment the film when it switches to Howards End in its springtime glory, or Leonard Bast's nature walk out of London, or his wife Jackie's tacky fuchsia wardrobe. There is a level of intent from the filmmaker in these transitions and contrasts that becomes evident and meaningful to the story craft and is only fully appreciable in the Blu Ray.I've seen this film dozens of times and never before had I noticed how many beautiful and stunning scarfs and shawls Margret dons throughout the film. Let alone the glorious Wedgewood, China, and amazing works of art that inhabit all the sets.However, when I first started the Blu Ray I was horrifed and thought it was an exceptionally poor transfer. It was as grainy as a beach, with white dots littering the screen. I was able to resolve this by changing my TV's settings to appreciate the picture. My TV comes with a range of preset brights/huges/and balance controls - which of course you can use to set your own as well. I usually have mine set to ""vibrant."" However, this was too much for the delicate film work here and had the film screaming bits of grain and white flashes at me - a switch to my TV's ""cinematic"" preset made the Blu Ray brilliantly rendered. If you find the Blu Ray lacking, play with your picture settings. If you're like me, you have your colors and brightness up rather high and this film requires darker settings - I guess its like the equalizer settings on your stereo, you wouldn't use the same settings for rock-n-roll and classical. I'm not a techie so I don't know how correct my assessment is, but I do now that once I made the adjustments, the film was still in absolute high definition, and far more stunning and visually engaging than the DVD.Faithful to the book there is nary a detail left out, a few minor details are juxtaposed here or there for a tighter film fit - In my judgment this is the most faithful and positively perfect rendering of a classic book to film ever attempted. The script is expertly crafted, and it is cast under the divine intervention of kismet. Thompson and Hopkins have undeniable chemistry. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and it is a rare example of film's capacity  to harmonize with other art forms. The written word is brought to life, the soundtrack is exquisite, and the locations are teeming with exuberance and life.Yet this film is most certainly not for everyone, as evidenced by the  many ""It's boring"" reviews here. There is no instant fix, explosions or romantic endings.  Like any work of literary fiction, plot is not the catalyst here - the human experience is exposed through patient character development letting you experience E.M. Forster's most poignant commandment:  ""Only connect.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IFOHOE1AH241/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P829O6#wasThisHelpful","R1IFOHOE1AH241","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Season Seven gets five stars for one of the best and most complete endings in science fiction history - but 3 stars for its episodic quality throughout the final season - which averages my Amazon rating to 4 stars.All of the Dominion war arc episodes and the finale are fantastic - few Sci-fi shows get to end with dignity and grace. DS9 finishes the race without years of space and a fan based letter writing campaign in between. It is a complete story in and of itself within its seven year run and that alone makes the show a diamond in the rough.Out of the story arc, episodically this season was a real downer however. ***@!Spoiler Alerts!@*** The death of Jadzia in Season six devastated the show and left the show hobbling toward the finish line. While she was certainly drop dead gorgeous, she was so much more than just another pretty face. She was an extremely competent actor who crafted a vivacious and irreplaceable character for 6 years. Her death in every way detracted from the final season of the show. Though it fits in with her character's alien story line, replacing her with the character of Ezri was an absolute mistake. Perhaps this would have worked had the show many more seasons to go, but with one season left - half of the last season is left to flesh out the addition of Ezri and more often than not it feels forced and just falls flat.The weird sub story of Sisko's mother being a Prophet was also unfortunate in my opinion. It was an entirely unnecessary. It was a dramatic indulgence and weakness on the part of the writers - ""Sisko... I am your mother!"" Puh-leeeze. The show was amazing for 6 years and in its final season it really begins to run out of steam and no longer dares to be so creatively original. Many of the non-arc episodes are as awkward and stilted as those from the first and second season.They simply pale in comparison to the Dominion war episodes. These are stellar and redeem the season. The transformation, redemption and martyrdom of Dumar was a brilliant move and that it is successfully executed is a testament to the writing and acting involved. This story is followed up in an amazingly well crafted story by the actor Andrew Robinson, who played as Garak in his DS9 novel: A Stitch in Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine #27). Dukat and Adami are soul-mates from hell and the tête-Ã -tÃªte between actor and actress is richly crafted and for the connoisseur, it is a real treat.If you've made it this far, well of course you'll keep going and want to see it through to the end, but when it's not working - just shrug your shoulders and move on to the next episode.Goodbye DS9 - I will miss you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3583SYDPKMCHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HEIIMG#wasThisHelpful","R3583SYDPKMCHR","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each selection on Blunderbuss is steeped in a kind of 1970s mystique - This atmosphere is all encompassing from start to finish. Blunderbuss does the time warp and brushes against your ear with a nostalgic bliss. Some songs are downright lazy and won't be pushed or forced to a faster pace or conclusion.Jack White is entirely comfortable in this effort. Confidence reigns supreme in his vocals and you can tell he's creatively in control. It's a worthy effort, it's groovy, but I don't love it to death. I'm not on fire for the album but I am enjoying it.The album is growing on me slowly because there is no sense of urgency in any of these selections. Each musical moment pauses, examines itself and reflects. The album is slow paced. It's the kind of album that goes well with a hot cup of tea on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It's a kind of soundtrack you play when you wanna get lost in your own mind.Lackadaisically Recommended, to those who can relax and enjoy that which is not fast paced ;-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9YUB64SMJ2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CKNX28#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9YUB64SMJ2B","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the brilliant, talented female musicians of the 90s - Fiona Apple would not have been the one I'd picked to artistically reign supreme in 2012. But Idler is a masterful LP and Fiona effortlessly takes the crown.I've watched and wept as Tori Amos has gutted her feminism by desperately clinging to her plastic surgery enhanced dolled up closeups. I've held my forehead in shame as Bjork recorded an album on her freaking I-phone, so out of touch she believes embracing elitist technology will keep her vibrant. And I've fallen asleep listening to Ani Difranco sing her ode to Occupy Wall Street.So ya know, really, if I hadn't suffered a romantic disappointment the very same week Fiona Apple (Unidisputed Goddess of the Break-Up Album) released her first album in 7 years, I don't really think I would have had the heart to download this after all the disappointment that's come lately from my posse of favorite females of the 90sWell, Gawd bless relationships that end in disappointment and Fiona Apple for documenting the misery that follows them in all its glory. If you've made it into your 30s, or 40s, perhaps even 50s divorced, never married, or not-otherwise-specified alone, ask yourself this question: Who exactly is singing our song? The formerly mentioned ladies are all confronting wedded bliss (and I wish them all the world's happiness) while the rest of us are marching on, facing the world alone, without a back up choir.This release is enchanting. I found myself tapping my foot, nodding my head, and singing along. Fiona has matured - This album is complete from start to finish. It is a complete work of art, spilling over the edge with creative juice - no room for filler tracks or incomplete thoughts. This is developed, mature, and different than anything else she's put out so far. Yet, it's a natural evolution from where she started. For a seven year absence, there is no anxiety here. Fiona is calm, calculated and serene.""I can love the same man in the same bed in the same cityBut not in the same room, it's a pity, butOh, it never bothered me beforeNot 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guyAnd I can't even enjoy himAnd now I'm hard, too hard to knowI don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no noTears calcify in my tummyFears coincide with the towHow can I ask anyone to love meWhen all I do is beg to be left alone? ""Her skill as pianist is formidable and she finally steps into her own as a competent musical rival to all of her contemporaries. She bends her piano to her will and holds it spellbound. Fiona's strong Jazz roots give this album a distinguished flair you won't find anywhere else in the last or the next decade. She is heart-broken, yet absolutely her own, a complete, and fulfilled human being who can't help but keep rockin' on. Taking the road less traveled has left Fiona to fine tune and craft a passion that her contemporaries traded in for settled stability - This album is riddled with bipolar angst that refuses rest or regret and therefore stays vital, restless and alive.Her trademarked confessional passion is here, but it is no longer a young woman's passion; honest and inspired, Fiona's talent has ripened, and it is so bitter-sweet it will leave you salivating and craving more with spit dripping down your chin.Pure Excellence - Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJDIBTG0TL4K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088XXCZ6#wasThisHelpful","RJDIBTG0TL4K9","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High Definition is to Twin Peaks what a great cup of black coffee is to Agent Cooper. Seeing this again in High Definition was like having your best friend from High School come home for a sleep over. You will fall in love with Twin Peaks all over again..I found the entire series at a yard sale on VHS 4 years ago and bought it. I watched it, appreciated and enjoyed the story and dialogue and didn't think too much about it. I'm not sure what made me stream this, but Boy Howdy, I am so glad I did. The cinematography is gorgeous! Story and Dialogue are only part of this wonderful love triangle. David Lynch's brilliance as a director shines complete in the first season. This is visually stunning. Having last seen in on VHS, for me, HD was all the more enchanting, enriching the story with all the eye candy Lynch could find in his actors and spectacular Northwestern landscapes.What a treat it was to see the Twin Peaks logo on the Sheriff's coffee mug, or that the daily special at the Double R was Split Pea and Lamb Stew, or the fact that the delectable Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) had a set of Frank Sinatra baby blue eyes, when broadcast T.V. and VHS had led me to believe they were brown.Beware, if you were ever a smoker, no matter how long it's been, this show will trigger a longing you thought you'd conquered. Not to mention a deep longing for huckleberry pie and a cup of hot black java.Twin Peaks is a dose of double-dipped nostalgia; directly from the 90s, yet the show longs for 50s film noir flair with every sexy breath it takes. Queue it up and enjoy the flannel clad bad boys, the bombshell blondes in saddle shoes, and the quirkiest law enforcement crew since the Andy Griffith show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JY4UB0445YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076HMCCO#wasThisHelpful","R29JY4UB0445YE","A374CXEFOOX5DU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A374CXEFOOX5DU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm reviewing the 16,100 mAh model. As you can see from the product specs and as you should expect from the capacity, this is a big heavy power pack. Fortunately, it supports 1.9A input, so it should charge from 0 to 100% overnight, if you have a powerful enough wall charger (none is included). Output is rated at 3.4A, which is powerful enough for all the smartphones and tablets that I own. Quick Charging is not supported.A power pack this large is not going to fit in your pocket so you can charge your phone as you walk down the street. This power pack is more for long steady use, such charging your devices on long airplane flights or even weekend camping trips. 16,100 mAh will charge any tablet or phone multiple times. There are even 2 output ports so you can charge 2 devices at once (though the output charging rates is split between the 2 ports).Packaging is minimal. In addition to the power pack, you get one short micro-usb cable. There is no carrying case or wall charger. You can use the charger that came with your cell phone or tablet, if it is a usb or micro-usb type and is strong enough to charge the power pack at a reasonable speed (forget about those old 0.5A wall chargers).My package did not come with instructions, but using this device is simple. Use the included micro-usb cable (or use your own) to charge the power pack using any usb wall charger. More powerful wall chargers will be much faster (look for one rated at least 2A). I recommend using a high-quality name-brand wall charger and cables to avoid short circuits (some generic chargers and cables have questionable electronics). The 4 blue lights on the power pack show you the battery level. Use either of the 2 USB ports on the power pack to charge your smartphone or tablet, using the included micro-usb cable or your own cable (especially if you need Apple cables). You can check the power level at any time by pressing the button on the power pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100KCJ1W5XPRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ4JQAA#wasThisHelpful","R100KCJ1W5XPRM","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Picked up a few of these during their last half price sale and have been using them for a couple of weeks. They do work as advertised. Not sure how long the battery life will be, but ours are still going strong, even in high-traffic locations like the bathroom and hallway. They work fine with rechargeable batteries, so replacing batteries is a minor hassle, but not expensive. We do not mind the yellow light, since we use them only as night lights. The round plastic design is kind of ugly, but not too noticeable since we mounted them near floor level. We do wish the sensitivity or timeout could be adjusted, since if you stand still for a minute, the light will turn off even though you are still there.

"I own this case and also own the official Samsung ""Protective Cover"" for the Galaxy S6 (which costs $13 on Amazon). Comparing the 2 cases, the OtterBox case does offer more protection since the thick rubber sides wrap all the way around the sides.  The Samsung case only covers the corners. If you drop your phone a lot, the OtterBox will protect your phone in more types of accidents. On the other hand, the Samsung case is much cheaper and much more attractive. The OtterBox is pretty bulky and relatively ugly as cases go. Despite the thick sides, all the pass-through buttons seem to work OK. The phone is easy to insert and remove from the OtterBox case since the case is pretty flexible (unlike the Samsung case).

"For $300, this is a great deal for cord-cutters with antennas. I replaced my 7-year-old TivoHD (with $130/year service plan) with this Roamio (with lifetime service). If it lasts 7 years like my old Tivo, I'll have saved a ton of money. The Roamio also has 4 tuners (instead of 2 like my old Tivo), 75 hours of disk space (vs 20 on my old Tivo), and more internet streaming options. If you want, you can very easily upgrade the disk drive to 2GB for less than $100, but realistically 75 hours is plenty if you're just recording TV over-the-air. The Roamio does work great, with easy-to-use menus and great video quality (for over-the-air HD recordings).Registration was pretty easy for me. I just called Tivo and they took care of it with one phone call. Tell them you bought it from Amazon and you want to switch the registration to your name. No problem.My only complaint is that the remote control seems to be overly sensitive (lots of accidental double clicks).

"Back when I was using film in my camera, I carried half a dozen or more filters with me for various lighting conditions or special effects. Nowadays, digital cameras can adjust to most conditions pretty well, except for glare from polarized sunlight. The polarizer is the only filter I use regularly now, so I do want a good one.This B+W polarizer works great. As with all B+W filters, it has the trademark brass mount that resists binding to your camera like the aluminum mounts used on most other brands' filters. The traditional problem with polarizers is that they reduce the light reaching your camera by 2 stops (1/4), which is a huge amount, especially in lower light conditions where grain and camera shake can become problems. B+W claims that this filter does better in low light, though I suppose that really depends on usage and I am not equipped to measure it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I4S3QVRD7FV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R69839S#wasThisHelpful","R3I4S3QVRD7FV5","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using Panasonic and Braun travel shavers for years. Both brands work well, but there are a few differences. This Panasonic model is water-resistant so you can use it with shaving cream if you want and then rinse the shaver out with water. Braun shavers should be used dry (or with shaving lotion), then you brush out the shaver afterwards. Braun shavers have pop-up trimmers which are really helpful for your sideburns and loose hairs on your neck; that is the main feature that I miss on this Panasonic shaver. Lacking the trimmer isn't a big deal for a day or two, but I do miss it on week-long trips. Both Braun and Panasonic are powered by 2xAA batteries, which you can find anywhere if they die (and they easily last a week or more of daily use). Neither Braun nor Panasonic will shave as well as a full-sized shaver, due to the smaller screen and less precise screen. I use them only for travel or for touch ups (leave one in your locker or desk or girlfriend's house).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BX8QEF8FNAZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009DT34W#wasThisHelpful","R3BX8QEF8FNAZ0","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This kettle is better than I expected for this price, but you have to limit your expectations for a $18 product. The electronics are all in the base of the kettle, protecting them from your water. The upper part is almost entirely plastic. They say it is BPA-free, but if you're afraid of other chemicals in plastic (especially in contact with boiling water), then this is not the product for you.My biggest concern is the thermostat. This kettle very conveniently shuts off when the water temperature reaches a level that you set, but the company makes no claims about what the settings on the thermostat actually mean. I see some other reviews throwing out numbers about what their low-medium-high setting mean. I'm guessing that the thermostat is cheap and inaccurate enough that there will be significant differences from product to product. I stuck my digital thermometer directly into the water in the kettle right after it shut off. The temperatures I got are 172F for the low setting, 190F for medium, and 210F for high. The recommended temperature for green tea is 160-170F, so fortunately the low setting on my kettle is good enough. I do recommend that you test yours before using it if you care about the lower settings (many people care only about boiling).I'm giving this product 1 extra star because of the cheap $18 price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQI4LF8UP8L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086UJQN8#wasThisHelpful","RRQI4LF8UP8L4","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The lamp arm hinges are way too loose and even the slightest bump will knock it out of position (no tightness adjustment).The smartphone charger is flawed in many ways. Most importantly, it seems very weak. I doubt that a modern smartphone will fully charge overnight using this thing. Also, the phone holder tray is terribly shaped. A larger smartphone (5.5 inch screen) will not fit in the tray. Why couldn't they make tray open on the sides to that you could place the phone in sideways? Even if your phone does fit in the slot, since most modern phones have the charger port on the bottom.

"If your first Android smartphone is the Samsung Galaxy S6 and you need help figuring it out, this might be a good book for you. This book covers the main features of the Samsung S6 with very detailed step-by-step instructions. You probably don't want to read the book cover-to-cover, since all the detail makes reading very slow going. The book is better as a reference guide, where you can look up a particular subject in the table of contents, then follow the directions to use the feature.One complaint that I have is that the book always assumes that you want to use Samsung's TouchWiz apps, instead of more popular Google apps. For example, they use the Samsung Messages app instead of Google's Hangouts messaging app for text messages. They also use Samsung's photo gallery, music player, calendar, app launcher, etc. instead of the more popular and standard Google Android apps. Tutorial information on customizing your phone, eg using apps other than the Samsung apps, is very weak.If you're already familiar with Android and just want to learn the Samsung add-on features, this is not a good book for you, since the Samsung-specific material is sprinkled throughout the book and not easily located. I would have liked a separate reference section for the Samsung-specific features. Because the Samsung material is spread throughout the book, this book will be very confusing to people using non-Samsung Android smartphones.I would also like to see a section on what settings to use to optimize the phone for common use cases, eg. what apps to disable to maximize battery life or how to maximize security.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTKSHDAWHUQY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119113490#wasThisHelpful","RTKSHDAWHUQY6","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, the cable does have some electronic shielding trickery to preserve data signals (normal wire cables would destroy your signal). I have no trouble copying and streaming large files between 2 computers or to a printer using this cable.Construction quality is very good with a thick casing around the cable and heavy duty connectors.

"This battery pack is expensive for the relatively low power capacity, but the build quality appears to be much higher than the cheap ""lipstick sized USB chargers"". I bought a couple of lipstick chargers with flashlights for under $10 each and they barely work with flakey controls and iffy build quality. This NOCO charger is solidly built and the controls are easy to use. According to my phone, the power output is close to the advertised 1A current. Flashlight is very reliable. My only complaint is that the power level LED has only 2 levels (green for 80% or higher, red for under), which puts you into the red level most of the time.

"I'm pretty disappointed by this case. Construction quality and appearance are below average for this price. Most importantly, there are 3 big flaws compared to other Android phone flip cases. First, closing the case does not automatically turn off your screen. If you accidentally forget to turn the screen off, your battery will drain until the screen times out. Second, opening the case does not turn the screen on. Third, the cover hides the notification lights, so you can't tell if you have any notifications.

"This is my second Remington shaver. I have also used Braun shavers in the past. Remington shavers have larger heads than Braun, so do shave faster. Hard to judge which brand shaves the closest since blade sharpness makes a huge difference (don't compare an old shaver to a new one). They are close enough that I can't really make a judgement. This Remington has a bare minimum set of features. My previous Remington had a charging stand (this one just plugs into a wall cord) and a digital battery level readout (this one just has a single light). My Brauns usually came with nice travel cases. Of course, list price for this Remington is pretty cheap, so you get what you pay for. The trimmer on Remington's is much smaller and harder to use than Braun's.I see some people complaining about lack of replacement parts. I haven't needed a new head yet, but Remington heads do tend to wear out much sooner than Braun. I do see the replacement heads listed on the Remington web site, so you can always get them there if Amazon doesn't carry them. I haven't had any problems with this Remington yet, but my previous Remington lasted for a couple of years (on par with Braun) before the battery started dying too quickly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188ASF9ECFNDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8FEG0M#wasThisHelpful","R188ASF9ECFNDU","A33YZNZIRA3H97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33YZNZIRA3H97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've been buying Cottenelle toilet paper here on Amazon. We're trying to be environmentally-friendly, so tried this Scott Naturals TP. The tube-free design does eliminate a lot of wasted cardboard in the long run and this design is very popular in many countries other than the USA. The Scott Naturals also saves paper in several other ways: the sheets are single-ply instead of double-ply, the sheets are about half an inch narrower, the rolls are not individually wrapped (32 rolls in one large shrink-wrap plastic bag). and they claim 40% recycled paper content. Each roll of Scott has 400 sheets, compared to only 166 sheets for Cottonelle. Comfort-wise, the Scott tissue is noticeably less soft than Cottonelle, but better than average for a single-ply tissue. Single-ply is also better for septic systems or older sewer systems.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Good features, good audio at a very good price.WHAT I LIKED:- Headphones are very lightweight- The sound quality is perfectly adequate for gaming- The microphone records clearly and sounds crisp- The microphone is removable- There is a volume control on the headset which is easy to adjust, but not likely to get bumped and adjusted accidentally- There is also a mic mute switch on the cable- Short cable (ideal for connecting to a controller)WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- Not ideal for listening to music, the mid-range tones are a bit muted, and the low frequencies tend to get cut off- The microphone can be difficult to position where you want, as the boom is somewhat inflexibleWHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:- The mic only goes into the headset one way, so you have to make sure the slot on the mic lines up properly to the headset.  It would be nice if it was like an Apple lightning cable which can be inserted without having an up or down side to the plug.- The cable is a 4 pin 3.5mm connector, so keep in mind that if your device has separate line out and mic in connectors, you will need a splitter to get both audio and mic functionality from the headset.CONCLUSION:  Good, inexpensive gaming headset won't cost you much, and will get the job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCPV536DDHAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UKY#wasThisHelpful","R1BCPV536DDHAC","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"QUICK SUMMARY:  This item isn't a sweet spot for price-per-gigabyte, and overall performance is only so-so.WHAT I LIKE:- Inexpensive, but the better value (lower cost per gigabyte) is SanDisk Ultra 32GB Ultra Micro SDHC UHS-I/Class 10 Card with Adapter (SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA) [Newest Version]- This item claims to be waterproof (but I haven't tested that claim, though it's reassuring)- My experience with other Sandisk products has been favorableWHAT COULD BE BETTER::- Benchmark testing wasn't impressive, only 24-27MB/s read/write speeds using 1GB data in CrystalDiskMark 5.0.2, so not particularly close to the 80MB/s claimed (using a Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Series)CONCLUSION:  Unless you are constrained by a very tight budget, move up to the 64GB card.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZE6RDAVEQW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q57T02#wasThisHelpful","R1WZE6RDAVEQW0","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  The router is designed with beginners in mind, but provides all the features power users could dream of.WHAT I LIKE:- The router has a very beginner-friendly setup page that walks you through the process of configuring the router to your liking- The directions that come with the router are also detailed and very easy to follow (one example of this is that the Ethernet cable that came with the router was actually labeled 'modem' to indicate that it should be plugged into the modem, then into the router, as per the instructions)- Despite its initial beginner's focus, the router has all the configurability you could desire, from port forwarding to dynamic DNS.- The router has a button that will disable its blue LED indicator lights (I wish all electronics had this function).- It has MU-MIMO, although I didn't notice much difference between it and our current router, which is a modern dual-band router with AC protocol.USING AMPED-WIRELESS SUPPORT:If you think you'll need help setting up a router, Amped-Wireless makes sure you know support is available.  I actually contacted their representatives twice during the course of my configurations, and had positive interactions both times.  The first contact was email, and I received a reply exactly 24 hours later with a detailed and accurate answer regarding my question.  The second experience was with their live-chat support.  A representative was able to solve my issue with haste and politeness.  I was very happy with Amped-Wireless's support!WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- A bunch of static IP addresses disappeared when I added them in batch, although the rules were still applied, I simply couldn't see the addresses I had assigned, although I could see the devices they were assigned to.  Full disclosure:  This issue could have been caused by my not unplugging the device (as the instructions said to do).- You can add rules to both the static DHCP table and port forwarding list without having to reboot the router.  However, when you remove a rule from either area (which you will do often, because there is no option to edit rules) you aren't given an option to delay a reboot, it just forces it on you.- When you are entering MAC addresses in the static DHCP screen, the MAC address values cannot have colons or dashes, or you won't be able to add the entire address, since the text box is fixed at 12 characters.  I would have preferred it if the router to enter the MAC in whatever form you saw fit, and then the router's software would convert it to whatever format they wanted to use.- This is a very minor gripe, but the port forwarding on this router only allows forwarding ranges of ports to an IP, rather than specifying an external port and an internal port.CONCLUSION:  Nice feature set, helpful product support, and good overall performance makes this a 4.5-star product, but the high cost of it knocks it down to 4-stars.  If you're thinking of replacing your dual-band AC router with this router, you may not find much of a difference in WiFi performance to warrant the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5QJ76T7CO7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOO2R8A#wasThisHelpful","R3Q5QJ76T7CO7V","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  If you're looking for a dirt-cheap, Windows-based netbook (or small laptop) that's very light and enough computing power for everyday computing -- and you don't care much about the color display -- then you've found your item!  But upgrading to Windows 10 is not a slam-dunk (but keep reading to learn more)....BACKGROUND:  For the new school year, my kids were clamoring for better computing devices, as we've made-do with laptop that are 8-10 years old, and netbooks that are 3-4 years old.  Initially, I went down the path of buying a single, mid-grade laptop, but when I spend $500 or more on a laptop, I feel compelled to buy some sort of a warranty and accidental coverage protection on it, making it cost at least $100 more, so, =>$600.  Then my college-aged son suggested this dirt-cheap Asus netbook / small laptop.  It comes with one year of Office 365 subscription, it's upgradable to Windows 10, has terrific battery life and with flash memory, it's got relatively quick read/write access.  The Wifi works on the 5Ghz or 2.4Ghz band (on the N protocol, not the newer AC).  The keyboard is what you'd expect from a <$200 laptop.  So I opted to get a couple of these laptops, figuring that if they last a school year, I'm good, and if they last two school years, I'm better.  No extra warranty needed; if it breaks, just buy a new one.UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10:  You *have* to add extra memory to do the free upgrade to Windows 10 (Home Edition).  You'll want to add an SD card anyway, because the 32GB of flash storage is mostly consumed by the operating system and utilities, and the Windows 10 installer won't install without extra storage available.  A great solution is buying the SanDisk Ultra 64GB Ultra Micro SDXC UHS-I/Class 10 Card with Adapter (SDSQUNC-064G-GN6MA) [Newest Version] card, which is very low-cost but gives you ample room for everyday computing tasks.Upon initially starting this Asus laptop, Windows Update went right to work and downloaded Windows 10.  But when I tried running the update from Windows Update, the process failed at 19% overall complete (during the Copying Files task, which was 65% completed).  I shutdown the laptop (held down the power button until it shut-off, then pressed it again to boot up) and Windows restored back to Windows 8.1.  Strike one!So I tried putting an ISO file of Windows 10 on the Desktop (which I downloaded from Microsoft using my MSDN license), mounting it from Windows Explorer, and running the Windows 10 upgrade again.  This time, it got to 24% overall complete (still in the Copying Files task) before stalling out.  I rebooted, Windows restored back to Windows 8.1.  Strike two!For the third time, I still used the ISO file on the Desktop to perform the upgrade, but this time I said ""No"" to the question of whether I wanted to download the latest updates during the install process (which is the recommended option, btw).  This time, the installation worked.  After it booted up to Windows 10, I used Windows Update to get all the latest patches and fixes - no issues.  If you get this laptop and want to upgrade to Windows 10, my suggestion is NOT to use the ""recommended"" option of getting the latest updates during the Windows 10 install process (which is one of the early prompts you get when running the Windows 10 installer).WHAT I LIKE:- Overall, it's a great value for what you get, which is a cheap, usable Windows computer- The flash memory keeps it from feeling overly sluggish- The Intel Atom processor is miserly on power consumption- The battery life is reported at 12 hours.  Expect 8+ hours depending on usage and power option settings.- The keyboard isn't the worst chiclet-style keyboard I've used- For everyday computing (browsing the web, Word docs, email, YouTube, Netflix), it's fine- Office 365 one-year subscription is a great deal, too- Not a lot of bloatware, but there is some (the worst of which is McAfee anti-virus)- Super light, just about two pounds, so it's really easy to transport- The display size (11.6"" diagonal) is nicely big enough to do basic computing tasks- I had no trouble using the touchpad, seems okayWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The color display is a weak link.  Don't expect vibrant, true-to-life colors and great viewing angles.  Colors will appear faded if you're used to high quality color displays.  The color output achieves in-the-ball-park, okay-if-you're-not-too-picky color saturation.  Some colors, like reds and pinks, seem harder for the display to render accurately.WHAT I HATE:- I hate that vendors pre-install anti-virus solutions that are bloated and slow, and hard to get rid of, like McAfee.  After uninstalling McAfee (Control Panel > Programs & Features > choose McAfee and uninstall it), do a Google search for ""McAfee Consumer Product Removal tool (MCPR) download"" to download a utility that actually gets rid of McAfee off your system (well, it's better than just doing a Windows uninstall only, anyway).9/2/15 UPDATE:  My family liked these small computers so much, we bought three more of them!  The upgrade to Windows 10 went very smoothly on these other laptops when I chose NOT to use their recommended upgrade setting that downloads updates to Windows 10 during the upgrade.  Instead, we update to Windows 10 firstly, then after a successful upgrade, we perform all the updates.CONCLUSION:  What a great product if you're in the market for a reasonably capable, lightweight, inexpensive, Windows-based computer.  Solid four stars.  Wish the display was nicer and the system came with Windows 10, not Windows 8.1.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Great storage enclosure for permanently (or semi-permanently) enclosing a 2.5-inch hard drive.  USB 3.0 connection makes a huge bump up in performance, as expected.  Recommended!INSTALLATION NOTES:  Opening the case requires unscrewing two Phillips-head screws on the front panel (that is, the side that has all the connection ports), then removing the entire circuit board.  To install the hard drive (HDD), place the HDD flat onto the circuit board and slide it into the Sata connection.  Then, flip over the circuit board, take four of the five screws that came with the enclosure and screw the hard drive to the circuit board.  Next, slide the circuit board back into the outer casing (it only fits properly into the groove where the screws go, attempts to slide it into any other grooves will be met with failure) and, finally, re-affix the faceplate back onto the enclosure.WHAT I LIKED:- USB 3.0 connection allows for a massive increase in data transfer rates. The hard drive I installed, which once capped out at 30MB/s read/write via USB 2.0, achieved 100MB/s read/write after being installed in this enclosure- The enclosure is a smooth, black, brushed aluminum, and is comfortable to hold- The back end of the enclosure has a red LED showing disk activity- In addition to its USB 3.0 port, the enclosure has a Sata port (NOT eSata), which, when paired with another Sata-connected device, will allow easy, speedy backups and file transfers (I didn't test the Sata connection)WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The accompanying instruction manual wasn't as clear as what I've just written on how to install the HDD in the enclosure.  :-)WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:- It's a little too troublesome to quickly swap HDDs using this enclosure.  This is good for permanently or semi-permanently installing an HDD into this StarTech enclosure, but if you plan on frequently swapping HDDs, look for a different product than this model.CONCLUSION:  If you have a spare 2.5-inch (the kind of HDD that commonly is used with laptops) and want to start using it, and you have USB 3.0 port on the computer (or other device) that you're going to connect with, this is a great choice!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Surprisingly effective knife sharpener is easy to use.BACKGROUND:  I've never had much luck with the rod-style knife sharpeners that come with a set of kitchen knives.  Try as I may, I've never been able to get my kitchen knives consistently sharp using those rods.  But with this Wiitek knife sharpener, I actually could sharpen knives easily and effectively.  For as little as this sharpener costs, I'm actually very surprised it works as well as it does.  And it's easy to use, too!  The sharpener itself isn't much to look at, and it feels very light, which gives it a cheap feeling.  But I can't argue with what it does.Note:  The ""coarse"" sharpener actually left tiny little metal shavings on my kitchen counter, so I would generally avoid using the ""coarse"" sharpener unless your knives are really, really dull.  Be careful as you clean-up those metal shavings so as to not accidentally get them into any food dishes.  After using the ""coarse"" sharpener, be sure to use the ""fine"" sharpener slot to remove any burrs on the knife blade and create a very sharp edge.WHAT I LIKED:- This was the easiest sharpener I've used.  Hold it with my left hand, run the knife blade through the sharpener with my right hand.  Repeat 5 or 6 times, done.  Your blade is noticeably sharper.- The sharpener actually works!  Pruning knifes and carving knives were noticeably sharper after using this thing- One-piece design makes it easy to stow, then pull out when you need itWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- I would prefer that this sharpener were a little heavier, so it weren't so cheap-feelingCONCLUSION:  This item in very inexpensive, and yet it does what it says it will do, and it does it easily.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Everyone in the family wanted to keep this lamp in their own bedroom.  But they're all disappointed; it stays in MY bedroom.WHAT WE LIKED:- Novel use of multi-colored lamp (256 colors) makes for a nice nightlight- The LED white lights work as well as white LED lights are supposed to work (I personally prefer a warmer color than white LEDs)- Three different white light settings allow for some control of the brightness of the lamp- The flexible neck was stiff enough to retain the desired position of the headlampWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The user manual was written by a non-English writer who has very poor skill at writing English user manuals.  It's actually very difficult to understand how to use the lamp by reading the user manual.  Instead, just experiment touching the on/off control and color ring on the base of the lamp, and you'll pretty easily figure things out.  One hint:  press and hold the color ring on/off control to cause the base of the lamp to slowly and continuously change colors.- The lamp seems a little expensive for what it is, so the value exchange isn't as favorable as I think it ought to be.CONCLUSION:  Everyone liked this lamp because of the way the base could change colors (my daughters especially liked this feature).  It's good as a desk light or even a focused room light, and you can use the base as a night-light, too.  Recommended!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  We used this mostly in our backyard swimming pool.  What a disappointment!  It takes on water inside the two pontoons, began listing to the right-side, and one of the functions associated with the remote just stopped working after literally one minute in the water.  Might be fun for non-water use, but forget about using this in water.BACKGROUND:  I gave this to my older, pre-teen son to try out.  After charging the battery for the required five hours, we dropped in the battery into vehicle and went outside.  On the ground, it moves side-to-side very quickly, but going forward and backward was ridiculously slow.  Some blades of grass got caught in the rotating pontoons, adversely affecting its forward motion.  But we mostly wanted to try it out in our pool.In the pool, it was an utter disappointment.  On the remote, the right-side button I think angles the pontoons so it moves forward or backward, but after a minute in the water, the vehicle stopped responding to the right-side forward/backward button on the remote.  It was stuck in the forward position, so we were still able to maneuver it in the water okay (tricky, though, as the left-side button is imprecise).  But then the pontoons started filling with water, and the vehicle listed badly to the left, then it nose-dived forward, too.  At this point, it's still useable, but in looking over the battery cover seal, I feared that it would foul the battery compartment, so we took it out of the water.  Even after drying, the right-side button on the remote that controls the forward/backward motion doesn't work correctly on the vehicle.In short, this was a huge disappointment, and for the money that Mattel is asking for to buy this thing, I'd be furious if this weren't a review sample.  My son has since tossed it to the side, unable to use it in the pool.  Maybe we'll bring it indoors, but the outdoor experience was so bad, it immediately lost its appeal with my son (and with me).WHAT WE ALSO DID NOT LIKE:- The remote control is super-chintzy, light, and not at all like a nice gaming console control- The two buttons on the remote have terrible tactile feel, imprecise and cheap-feeling- Although this is supposed to be used in water, the vehicle's pontoons take in water and cause the vehicle to list if they don't take in water at the same rate- The battery compartment doesn't have a gasket to keep water out of it; it's just a plastic cover screwed onto a plastic body- The fine-printed instructions give important information that should be much more prominently communicated, like, don't recharge a hot battery, wait about 10 minutes, or else you'll damage the battery's future charging capacity, and charge the battery for 5 hours for the first two charging cyclesCONCLUSION:  Save your money and buy your kid some Legos or a cheap quad-copter instead.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Nice little portable desk fan works well, it's versatile, but I wish it offered different speeds and it's awfully costly for what it is.BACKGROUND:  We got this an immediately put it onto a gaming desk we have, in a room that tends to be warmer than the rest of the house because of the gaming computer and hot, overhead lights.  It was a cinch to plug this fan into a USB hub on the desk, and it helpfully kept the gamer cooler.  If you don't want to plug it into a USB port or another, powered device with a USB port, you'll need to use your own electric wall adapter that converts AC power to DC via a USB port, as this box doesn't have such an adapter.WHAT WE LIKED:- It's small enough to take up little desk space, but works well to keep someone cool that's within a few feet of it- It's a great idea to make this USB-powered- It has a battery compartment so, for short intervals, this could be used without a power cord- You can easily tilt the fan up or down to achieve optimal coolingWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- There is only one speed; I wish it offered at least a high and low setting, especially if I didn't want extra room noise- It's reasonably quiet, but it does add some noticeable room noise (again, I wish it offered a high/low setting)- The USB cord end that plugs into the fan isn't micro USB, so if you lose/misplace this particular cord, you can't easily swap to use another one- The cost of this fan doesn't strike me as a good value; I think it's worth maybe half the current selling priceCONCLUSION:  I like the USB-powered feature and small design of this fan, but for the selling price, I think it doesn't represent a good value.  If you have an electric socket nearby, you can get a similar desk fan for the half the cost.  If you need the USB-powered capability of this fan, and the ability to use battery power, too, then it's an okay (if costly) choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9CKA1E0OSPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU0W3CY#wasThisHelpful","R3T9CKA1E0OSPY","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  A mildly interesting read with some mildly interesting advice, but it's not something that really inspires (me, anyway).I was intrigued by this book because it's written by a Christian author about creativity.  I applaud what the author has set out to do -- and what he finished.  But the author is a creative arts type of person, and I live in a world of convergent, analytical thinkers (and I am one of them).  So, I don't know what I needed to be inspired, but the author's book just didn't really grip my analytical mind.  Maybe I was looking for a checklist of creative exercises or something like that.  If you consider yourself to be a very analytical thinker -- either according to some personality test or just by your own judgment -- rather than a ""feeler"" or ""intuitive"" type person, this book may not be what you need, either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBKORO1HTY1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426786417#wasThisHelpful","R2SBKORO1HTY1B","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Long-lasting battery provides plenty of power for that Saturday morning hedging you've got to do.  Powerful enough to snip off all but the fattest branches that fit through the guiding teeth of the blade.  And it has a battery power indicator, too!BACKGROUND:  I used this to trim my 30' long ficus hedge in my front yard this morning.  With my old Black and Decker cordless, this job would expend a single battery and then some, depending on how overgrown the hedge was.  Using this Scotts Li-Ion cordless, though, the battery level still read ""Full"" even after I finished the job!  Wow!  This new hedge trimmer weighs about the same as my old one, so no noticeable improvement there.  The blades move more slowly than the Black & Decker cordless, but they do the job its designed to do.  A few quirks about this device make it 4.5 stars overall.WHAT I LIKE:- The Li-Ion battery charged quickly, and provided PLENTY of power for my hedge-trimming chore- The hedge clipper only got stuck on a few fat branches that didn't quite fit the teeth of the hedge's blade, everything else got snipped off just fine- The hedge clipper has a battery indicator light which shows how much charge is left- It was reasonably easy to use, not anything better than what I'm used to with other cordless trimmers- It comes with an easy-to-use blade guard for when the hedge clipper isn't in use- The Li-Ion battery can be left on the charger; it can't be overchargedWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- When you squeeze the on/off trigger, the battery level light may not read correctly.  Be sure to squeeze the trigger fully and for a few seconds to get a reading.  When I first was testing this, I briefly squeezed the trigger and the battery charge showed only one bar, which I knew wasn't right.  But if I squeezed the trigger fully, the correct battery charge displayed.- When I replaced the battery onto its charger, the battery charger slowly glowed red - defective battery!?!  I removed and reset the battery onto the charger using a swift, sure movement, and that time, the battery began charging as I expected.  I don't think the battery is defective, rather, I think the battery can't be slowly inserted onto the charger and get a charged properly.  This shouldn't be a finicky procedure.CONCLUSION:  Nice cordless hedge trimmer will replace my Black and Decker hedge trimmer mostly because I know I won't run out of battery power doing my Saturday morning yard work.  Nice unit overall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37CBYDJTJLVM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVT186Y#wasThisHelpful","R37CBYDJTJLVM9","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Nice wicker basket (made from plastic, probably recycled) has a humorous shape and with the lid, it's quick to hide the dog toy clutter.  Not well-constructed to tote heavier loads around the house, it's fine for what it is.BACKGROUND:  We've got a mutt with a bunch of half-chewed plush toys, balls, old socks and more that we keep around for him to play with.  Until getting this basket, all that unsightly, cluttered mess was in a wicker basket on the floor.  Using this basket, it's a cinch to close the lid if I don't want to look at the clutter (downside:  the dog doesn't know how to lift the lid himself).  But use this indoors, not outdoors!  My experience with recycled wicker products for outdoor use is dismal; the plastic quickly disintegrates.  In a pinch, you could almost get away with using this as a picnic basket, but the lid locking mechanism isn't well-constructed, unfortunately, and probably would break if too much weight were being carried for too long.WHAT I LIKED:- Fun shape- Neutral color works well just about anywhere- Good size to stow a lot of dog toys, bones, clutter- The lid hides all the clutter nicely- The lid strap locks into place, allowing you to securely carry this storage basket by its handleWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The strap that attaches the lid to the basket compartment is attached rather flimsily; I wish it were more sturdily attached- When closing the lid, the lid is a slightly misaligned so it doesn't lay flush on top of the basket; I wish it lay flush instead (not a big deal, though)CONCLUSION:  A nice product overall, but if you're planning on regularly toting this basket around by the handle, I wouldn't advise getting this product.  It's fine when it sits on the floor, looks nice, and does what it's supposed to do -- hide the dog toy clutter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UHCNBS43M9UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3P9LB4#wasThisHelpful","R2UHCNBS43M9UV","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Great value for what you get, but if you're a runner, these probably aren't what you want, even if they stay securely attached to your ears (too much microphonic noise).  For gym use and walking, though, these are fine.BACKGROUND:  I use Bluetooth headsets while running 30-40 minutes outside during lunchtime.  During the summer, I sweat so much that I couldn't get wetter if you poured a bucket of water over me.  These Soundpeats lightweight headphones have a lot going for them, but what keeps them from getting 5-stars is I hear a LOT of microphonic noise as my feet hit the pavement, and the resulting vibrations seem to get picked up by these headphones and delivered right into my eardrums.  But these headphones are great in many other ways, not the least of which is they're price-competitive.  If you're not a runner, you may like these headphones even more than me.WHAT I LIKE:- The headphones were easily paired, and once paired, they connect very quickly to my iPhone- The set comes with a nice selection of ear pieces and attachments; I use the ear hooks to keep them securely attached while running- While running, I did not have to adjust these earphones even once; with a proper fit, they stayed very securely attached- They are comfortable to wear, too- I can turn my head from side-to-side without the cord (that's behind my head) tugging at the ear pieces- The audio sound, while not breathtaking, is good for the money- The set comes with a nice, zippered case to stow the headphones and all the ear piece attachments- It was easy to add/remove the ear hooks without accidentally detaching the already-attached ear rubbers- The headphone battery level is displayed on my iPhone when the two devices are connected- Despite my profuse sweating, these headphones worked wellWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- The microphonic sound is really bad (that is, unwanted sound from vibrations) while running- The ear rubbers are constructed with very thin rubber; I wonder if that contributes to the microphonic sound I hear while running- The bass sound is underwhelming, even if I hold these headphones at an optimal position in my earsCONCLUSION:  Since I use these while running, the microphonic sound really impedes my enjoyment in using these headphones.  I don't expect to have vibration-free sound from a pair of headphones while running, but these are worse than other Bluetooth headphones I've used.  That said, these are a very good value for the money, and if you're not planning on running with these on, they may well be a 5-star item for you.

"QUICK SUMMARY: These lights work as designed, but the color change effect was too abrupt for my liking.UPDATED 6/15/2015: ** DO NOT BUY **. After six months, most of these light fixtures stopped working. All of them showed a LOT of rust spots (the ""stainless steel"" is of such poor quality that they began showing small rust spots after just 30 days), marring the appearance of the one light that is still working. Terrible quality, a great disappointment. Try another a product - avoid these completely!BACKGROUND: I installed these lights around the footpath around my backyard pool, where they get a lot of sunlight during the day.WHAT I LIKE:- Easy to assemble. Just insert the plastic stake into one end of the stainless steel tube, and insert the light fixture into the opposite end of the tube. To turn on the automatic light mechanism, twist off the top of the light fixture, flip the switch to the ON position, then re-twist the fixture on again.- Each fixture came with a rechargeable battery pre-installed- The batteries are Ni-MH, not Ni-Cad, so they shouldn't be subject to a battery ""memory effect"" that degrades performance- The batteries are user-replaceable- I only cared that these lights would work from dusk until midnight, and they do that- They are maintenance freeWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The light color-shifting is too abrupt, occurring in 1-2 seconds. I wish the color shifting was more nuanced, even imperceptible. Instead, the too-quick color shifting draws attention to the light fixture. I want these landscape lights to be more subtle than what they are.- The stainless steel tube is paper thin and easily bent. I wish the product used marine-quality stainless steel that was thicker, sturdier, since these are going to be subject to the elements. As-is, I have my doubts that the ""Made in China"" stainless steel will stand-up to Florida's heat, humidity, and rain. (I also wonder how the batteries are going to hold up in Florida's summertime heat, too).- The red color is so dark, that it fails to illuminate my footpath. Only the greenish-blue color does a reasonable job of illuminating my footpath.- I wish there was a way to not allow the colors to change; instead, I wish I could just choose a color to always have lit up.NOTE: The package boasts ""Color Changing LED Lights"" which is true. But it also says, in smaller letters, ""The lights...have super bright white LED lights"" which is not true. They don't cast off white light, much less ""super bright"" white light.CONCLUSION: If the light changing colors were much more subtle, and if you could choose to display just one color (turning off the color changing feature), this would be a 4-star item. I do worry that a landscape light set that is ""Made in China"" won't hold up to Florida's climate very well.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  An outstanding 10KmAh battery charger that looks great and comes with a plush storage pouch and highly useful 4-in-1 charging cable.  This is an instant favorite charging power pack in my home.  Highly recommended!I have reviewed quite a few charging battery packs in recent years, and I really like them.  This Foxnovo battery pack may well be my favorite of them all.  I love the premium feel of its aluminum alloy shell, the high-quality feel of the included 4-in-1 charging cable that connects to all sorts of devices (micro USB, lightning, 30-pin Apple, and micro USB 3.0).WHAT I LIKE:- The 10KmAh battery capacity is enough to charge an iPhone several times before the battery pack itself needs charging- The aluminum alloy shell looks great, feels great, and the overall size is a little smaller than other 10KmaAh packs I have- The 4-in-1 charging cable is of nicer quality and feel than other, similar charging cables I have- The plush storage pouch is surprisingly nice, with a cushioned feel and attached, external pouch for the 4-in-1 cable, too- The battery pack performed as expected- The blue LED lights are muted, a pleasant change from the blinding blue LED lights of other, similar products- It's designed with one 1.0A port and one 2.1A port, so it can be used with both iPhones/iPods and iPads (and other devices, too)- This would make an excellent, elegant gift, not for the packaging, but because of the product itselfCONCLUSION:  I don't usually get that excited about battery packs, but both my college-aged son and I feel like this is the best external battery charging pack we've ever come across.  I'm delighted with what I'm seeing so far from the Foxnovo brand.  Highly recommended!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Finally!  A cable that serves the needs of everyone's electronic gadgetry! This cable is not only a great idea, Foxnovo did a great job with the construction, too.  Highly recommended!I have reviewed a lot of cables in recent years, but this one is an instant favorite.  Why?  It's got a nice length (2.6 feet) so you can charge your device while using it, but the best part is the well-thought way you can convert the micro USB plug to an Apple lightning cable.  The plug is narrow enough to fit easily into my iPhone with its protective case on.  The bright yellow-green color makes it a snap to identify as the one cable I want to take with me.WHAT I LIKE:- The 2-in-1 feature is one I've wanted for a long time.  Thank you, Foxnovo, for creating it!- The lightning connector fits very securely onto the micro USB connector- The yellow-green cable color makes it easy to pick-out of the dozens of cables I have in my home- Having this one cable means I don't have to carry two cables anymore to charge devices I carry with me- The overall construction feels good, it feels high-quality- I like the flattened, no-tangle design of the cable itself- The plastic coil that keeps the Apple connector secured to the cable stretches when needed, coils up when not in use- It's Apple MFi CertifiedCONCLUSION:  This is one of the very few times I review an item that I really love, and that I can't think of any way to make it better.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  The ""feel"" of using a hard-tipped stylus on an iPad isn't pleasing to me, the palm-rejection works (but not perfectly), the lag time between writing and seeing what you've written is noticeable, sometimes it just doesn't register what I've written, and heaven help you if you lose the charger.BACKGROUND:  Both my teen daughter and I used this stylus.  She liked it well enough, but I didn't really like using it.  She'll use it for drawing, not note-taking.  I was interested in note-taking, but I'm not going to replace my disposable fountain pen and paper just yet (or just typing out a Word document on my laptop).  We used this with an iPad Mini.WHAT WE LIKED:- The Bluetooth-enabled capability helps with palm rejection- My daughter liked the feel and balance of the pen (but I didn't)- My daughter liked using it to draw with because it's a fine-tipped penWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- As I summarized above, there is a noticeable lag between what you write and what you see written on the iPad if you write quickly- Palm rejection works okay, but not 100%- When I tried writing quickly, sometimes what I'd written didn't appear on the iPadWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- I just didn't like the feel of the pen's fine tip moving across the iPad.  I guess it's just too smooth or slippery for my liking.- I didn't like the weight, balance, and feel of this pen, despite the premium materials.- I didn't like that it has a special USB charger.  I hate devices that have special chargers when micro USB is ubiquitous.  There is no reason why this pen couldn't have accepted a micro USB input at the end where it fits onto its magnetized USB charging base.  Maybe it's not cool to have a dangling USB cord attached to a pen, but I've got 100 micro USB cables in the house, but I better not lose the charging base that comes with this pen or else I can't use this special, expensive pen.CONCLUSION:  I'm not to be counted among those who love using stylus with any kind of computing device.  This device isn't going to set me out on that road just yet.  My daughter gave this item 4-stars, but I gave it 2-stars; hence, it gets a 3-star review from my family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMJ3XOWCXV39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBWT1P4#wasThisHelpful","R1BMJ3XOWCXV39","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  I could not get the 5Ghz AC band to work well at all, but the 2.4Ghz BGN band worked well.  The mini CD containing the Wifi driver was inconvenient since my laptops either have slot DVD drives or don't have DVD/CD drive.  And the branding makes it impossible to know where to go for help.  Not recommended.BACKGROUND:  I run a sophisticated home network with dozens of connected devices.  At the core, I use an excellent TP-LINK AC dual band router with a D-Link and Linksys access point repeaters.  To test this unit, I sat five feet from my router and connected to both the 2.4Ghz BGN band and the 5Ghz AC band.  While the BGN band worked well, permitting data transfers from my Windows 2008 server at the 8-10MB/sec range, I nearly came to a crashing halt when connected to the 5Ghz AC band, where data transfers slowed to a crawl (< 1MB/sec).  My test laptop was an old Windows 7 Dell laptop using just USB 2.0.  I didn't expect great speed from the AC band on a USB 2.0 connection, but what I didn't expect was dismal performance.  Before I tested this adapter, I did install their included driver firstly (having my son transfer the mini CD to an ISO file that he put onto a USB thumb drive).WHAT I LIKED:- The performance on the 2.4Ghz BGN band was very good, at 8-10MB/sec- The size of this adapter is great, very small, very unobtrusive- The included installation manual was surprisingly clear with color screenshots of the installation process (albeit with a very small, 6-point font)- The optional Ralink utility that shows wireless connection options and information was useful and helpful- The Ralink utility lets you change your computer to an access point to extend your Wifi networkWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- The performance on the 5Ghz AC band was dismal, it never worked well for me.  This is the key reason for my 2-star review.- The green LED light on the adapter is nearly impossible to perceive because it's so tiny- The branding of this unit creates a lot of confusion.  The item is sold by Etekcity, but the manufacturer of both the adapter, driver and utility is Ralink, but Ralink isn't mentioned on any of the included packaging.  When I tried visiting Etekcity's website for a driver, I couldn't find this adapter.  When I tried Googling for it, I still couldn't find one.  The user manual unhelpfully says, ""Wireless USB Adapter"" on the cover, never disclosing that Ralink is the manufacturer.- The instructions should be very clear about where on the Internet to go to download the required driver (instead of using the mini CD)CONCLUSION:  I use the 5Ghz AC band in my home network on other devices, so I know that the issue I had using the AC band with this adapter is localized to either the adapter itself, the adapter's driver, or my Dell Windows 7 laptop.  Since I can use my laptop's original Intel Wifi card to connect to the 5Ghz band reliably (using the BGN protocol, not the AC protocol), I am concluding that the issue is with the Ralink hardware and/or software.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Nobody in my family liked its taste, so irrespective of its health benefits, no one in my family will use this product.BACKGROUND:  I made a plain smoothie (milk, this protein powder) using a shaker bottle.  The powder didn't dissolve easily from the bottom of the bottle; I had to use a knife to dislodge some of the powder, in fact.  When I tasted the finished result, I didn't care much for the taste at all, and I disliked the foamy texture of the smoothie.Then I tried making another smoothie for my daughters, without giving them any heads-up on my experience and opinion.  This time, I added ice and a strawberry Greek yogurt, too, and blended it together using our Vita-Mix blender.  I was hoping the ice would make it icier, but it still came out with a foamy texture.  When my girls tried their smoothies, they didn't even want to finish them.  One daughter just refused to sip any further, in fact.Then my college-aged son came home, so I gave him some smoothie without telling him anything about it.  He disliked it just like the same.Now, as a family, we love strawberries and we like bananas and eat a lot of both fruits regularly.  But one of my daughters summed up the problem this way:  ""It tastes like strawberry-flavored toothpaste.""  I had to agree.Although this product might be well-suited to families looking to steer away from dairy and wheat products, there is a downside to this soy-based product:  it doesn't taste that good, and it creates a foamy smoothie texture that you may not like, either.CONCLUSION:  Unless you like ingesting strawberry-flavored toothpaste, stick with a good chocolate protein powder.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z62025BBF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTNQ6OS#wasThisHelpful","R2Z62025BBF2","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  I used these *NOT* for moving or protecting furniture, but to create an acoustic barrier for a small, home recording studio.  Works very nicely for this purpose!  And these look nice, too.BACKGROUND:  I created a very small home recording studio this weekend in a small nook of my master bedroom.  To improve the acoustic features of this nook, I wanted to hang an acoustic curtain.  After doing a little research, it seems like buying moving blankets is a cheap way to do this.  I chose this set because at least one other reviewer said they bought this 4-blanket set for the same reason with good results, and other reviewers gave generally positive feedback, too.BUILDING THE ACOUSTIC CURTAIN:  Each blanket weighs 5 pounds.  To build the curtain, you're going to use brass grommets to attach 2, 3 or all 4 curtains together.  Others said they made curtains using three blankets, so I did that, too.  I started with the first blanket, used a grommet kit to punch five holes across one of the shorter edges of the blanket, starting about 6"" from one corner, then punching another hole every 12 inches until I punched five holes.  The stitching design of these blankets made it a very easy to do this, because the zig-zag design is stiched in one-foot intervals, so I didn't need to use a measuring tape to know where I needed to punch holes into the blanket.  Then I laid the 2nd blanket atop the first blanket and lined-up everything so when I punched five holes into the 2nd blanket, they'd line-up to the holes I'd punched in the 1st blanket.  Repeat again for the 3rd blanket.  Note that I didn't fold back the edge of the blanket when I was punching my holes (in effect, creating 2 holes for each grommet, ten holes total for five grommets total) which would have strengthened the hanging feature of this acoustic blanket, but I didn't think it was necessary since I will only hang up this blanket for a few hours at the most before I take it down again.After all the holes are punched, I used a General-branded grommet kit (1/2"" size grommets) to affix brass grommets to all three blankets so they're all joined together now.  This acoustic curtain now weighs 15 pounds!I used the 4th blanket as a smaller curtain by folding it lengthwise once, then affixing three grommets to the top of that 4th curtain.  I use this short curtain to cover the doorway into the master bathroom.To hang this acoustic curtain, I was going to use 3M Command hooks (Medium) until my wife got a clue as to what my intentions were.  She didn't want to see any hooks inside the bedroom walls.  So, instead, I tapped in picture hooks into my bedroom nook (which its walls cannot be seen from inside our master bedroom), then used a carabiner clip hook with keyrings to hook the curtain by its new grommets, and put the keyring onto the picture hook.  Worked like a charm!  It's a cinch now to hang up the curtain and remove it when I'm done using it.PERFORMANCE:  I used an iPhone app that measures decibels to see what difference my acoustic curtain made.  To test, one of my sons was watching a movie at full volume in our family room.  I shut my bedroom door and the reading was 40 decibels inside my bedroom.  Behind my curtain, though, it was 35 decibels.  A five decibel difference is very noticeable to the human ear.  Although I could hear the movie from behind my acoustic curtain, it was definitely more muffled now.OTHER:  There was a faint smell that these moving blankets have.  I suspect if I aired them out, put them outside and in the sun on a sunny Saturday, that smell would soon dissipate.  As it was, the faint smell didn't trouble me and didn't keep me from using them as a make-shift acoustic curtain.CONCLUSION:  For an acoustic curtain, these worked great!  If you've read this long review and only plan on using them to protect furniture and other stuff you're moving, well, these seem like a nicely made product that would do a good job protecting your stuff.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Worked to deaden the reflected sound in a small nook of my bedroom that I've turned into a recording studio.  Seems like a lot of money for foam, but I'm no sound engineer.BACKGROUND:  I've turned an unused make-up counter in my master bedroom into a home recording studio.  The built-in make-up counter is walled-in on three sides with a large mirror behind the countertop.  Without treatment, the sound was reflecting mightily off all the hard surfaces.  On a recommendation, I ordered these Auralex Studiofoam squares to dampen the sound in this area.  It worked!  The space I'm working with is approximately 2' x 3' x 2'.  Ideally, I need 21 squares to cover the walls 3' up from the countertop, and another 6 squares to create a hood over the countertop -- 27 squares total.  This set only has 24 squares, so I'm missing a few squares on both side walls right now.INSTALLATION:  To attach the Studiofoam squares to my walls and mirror, I used Velcro squares I cut-out from industrial-grade Velcro tape.  I only used two small, 1"" squares of Velcro per foam square.  Seems to work so far to keep the feather-light foam panels in place.  I did also try using 3M Duct tape (black, which has moderate adhesion properties), and that didn't work at all, which surprised me.  For the hood over the countertop, I used small picture frame hooks and 28-gauge picture frame wire to string thin strands of wire over the countertop, then laid six Studiofoam squares on the overhead wire.  That worked very well, but it doesn't look too nice, because the wire does tend to sag a little.  The benefit of this whole arrangement is I could completely remove all the squares anytime I want, as none of them are permanently attached to anything.PERFORMANCE:  After installing just the squares on the three walls, I sampled my voice above the foamed walls and within the foamed walls.  It was very, very noticeable the difference!  My voice sounds ""dead"" when I'm talking into the foamed walls, meaning that it sounds weird, almost muffled (it's not really muffled, of course, it's just that it's harder to hear my voice because so much of my voice energy is absorbed by the foam squares).  For my purposes of voice recording, this will really be very beneficial.CONCLUSION:  I'm not a musician or recording artist, just somebody who has a need to professionally record my voice at home without a big investment.  To me, spending a hundred bucks on something like this is a fairly big investment since it looks just like foam padding you'd find when unpacking a new TV set from its shipping box.  Be that as it may, these are doing the job they're intended to do, so all I can quibble on is their price.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  The built-in amp of this subwoofer delivers bass that easily fills a room.  Be sure you've got room for it in your room, though!BACKGROUND:  I have a small family room with a 46"" TV and Bose Acousitmass speakers, including the Bose subwoofer which is powered strictly from the speaker wires rather than externally powered.  And the Bose subwoofer, for all these years, has been very nice, augmenting the terrific sound of the small little Bose speakers atop my entertainment armoire.  This Sony subwoofer is about twice the size of my Bose subwoofer, and it's externally powered, too, delivering over 100-watts of power.  The result?  Much bigger bass effect!  But as my kids pointed out, it's not the kind of bass that resonates inside your chest.  It's just full, deep, and room-filling.WHAT I LIKE:- The wiring was straightforward and simple, identical to the Bose subwoofer we had.  Left & Right inputs coming from the receiver, and Left & Right outputs going to the small little Bose speakers we already had.  That, plus you plug-in the electric cord into a wall outlet for power.- The sound is much more room-filling than it was before, and I never thought our subwoofer before was that bad at all.  Now, the bass is really deep, and depending on the audio source, it's easy to discern the bass guitar or other instruments that operate in the low frequencies of a subwoofer.- There is a knob on the backside to adjust the amount of sound you'll get relative to the input source- A non-blinding, green LED light indicates power-on condition, and shows red for stand-by mode- The power-save feature should be set to ON to turn-off this subwoofer when not in use (it's a slide-switch on the backside).  If you're watching a movie, turn this feature off to avoid the power-off feature switching on and off throughout the movie.- The black color is standard, but that's a good thing, as I wouldn't want this thing to stand out in any wayWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The power-save slide switch and power button are inconveniently located on the back side of this subwoofer.  These could certainly have been put on the front or side locations on this big black box to make them easier to find and use when necessary.  As is, the power-save switch is located next to the phase selector switch (it lets you choose normal or reverse selections which can affect how the sound is reproduced), and since both switches are on the backside, it's hard to know which switch is which without bending, stooping to read the nearly illegible switch labels.- When power-save is enabled, if you turn on your audio input at a low volume level, this subwoofer won't automatically power up.  It will automatically power up at a higher volume, though.  So, you may have to crank up the volume more loudly than you want in order for this subwoofer to automatically power-up (or, kneel down and press the power button off, then on again, which is inconvenient)CONCLUSION:  For a small or average sized room, this subwoofer will easily fill the room with the deep, rich, bass sounds without overpowering the rest of the audio frequencies.  The subwoofer is double the size of non-externally powered subwoofers because it doubles the amount of sound it produces.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Tiny wireless adapter installed easily on two of our home laptops.  But getting the AC band to operate was a mystery in our networked home.BACKGROUND:  We have an unusual home environment.  We run two Windows servers, a TP-LINK n-router with the wireless feature turned off; instead, we use a D-Link AC router to broadcast the WiFi signal because it worked better than our TP-LINK (but we prefer TP-Link's router features over the D-Link).  We also have two repeaters in our home, only one which repeats the 5Ghz band.  My laptop is an old Dell XPS M1530 (2008).  My college son's laptop is a modern, mid-range Asus with built-in AC (2014).To use this TP-LINK USB adapter, the accompany instructions say to install the TP-LINK drivers firstly.  I downloaded the drivers easily from TP-LINK's website, which included a little utility which wasn't particularly useful.  To test with, I went into Device Manager and alternately disabled/enabled my Intel card and this TP-LINK USB adapter, with reboots between switching devices.  I tested sitting right next to our router and also outside on our patio, behind hurricane-resistant sliders.  I use a free utility, called INSSIDER, to examine the broadcast signal from our D-Link.  Weirdly, on my laptop, the utility only showed that our home network was broadcasting an n-signal, not ac, irrespective of whether I was using my laptop's built-in Intel Wifi card or this TP-LINK adapter.  But using the same utility on my son's laptop, the 5Ghz network band appeared as an ac signal.  I bring this up because I wanted to see how using the ac protocol would improve data transfer, but my son and I had difficulty ascertaining whether we were using the ac protocol at all.  On his laptop, he got dismal download speed using this TP-LINK connected to the 5Ghz band (3MB/sec, when his built-in Wifi card was getting 20 MB/sec on the 5Ghz band), but I think he just had some configuration issue with his laptop.  On my laptop, I got about 24 MB/sec using this TP-LINK adapter, which was about 4-6 MB/sec better than my Intel WiFi card.  When I was on our patio, I ran several comparison tests between my Intel card and this TP-LINK adapter, and overall the performance was about the same between the two, between 8-12MB/sec (which would seem to me to indicate I was only operating on the n-protocol, not the ac-protocol).NOTE:  The packaging for this TP-LINK Wifi adapter says that the max transfer speed is up to 433 mbps, which may be lower than what you're expecting for a WiFi adapter operating on the ac-protocol, but is perfectly fine for streaming HD video.WHAT I LIKE:- Extremely compact, and extremely easy to use, just install the drivers and plug-in- For laptops that don't operate on the 5Ghz band, this adapter gives them that opportunity in a small form-factor- The green LED light is useful to show the device is enabled and operating, but it's not blindingly bright- When I was near my router, the data transfer speed was better than my Intel 4965AGN cardWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- Instead of the mini-CD, I wish the packaging had included a small USB thumb drive with the drivers.  Mini-CDs don't fit into my slot CD drive.- The TP-LINK Wireless Configuration Utility only operates with the TP-LINK adapter, not with any Wifi adapter.  I wish it would let me select which Wifi card to use instead of having to use Device Manager.For whatever reason, though, neither my son nor I could seemingly get this to operate on the ac protocol.  I don't think that's the fault of this device, though.CONCLUSION:  I expected to write-up a comparison of data transfers between an n-network and an ac-network, but that didn't pan out.  All I can say is that the 5Ghz band worked fine with n-network speed, and that it performed better than my laptop's Intel wifi card.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQLYHRK2FC13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCACS0C#wasThisHelpful","R2DQLYHRK2FC13","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  An excellent value for the money!  These candles flicker realistically as if affected by a nearby fan or outdoor breeze.  And the company definitely stands behind their product and wants you to be a satisfied customer.  Recommended!WHAT I LIKE:- Small little candles fit nicely on bookshelves and other nooks in your home- By day, they're slightly off-white in appearance, by night, they glow warm yellow- Easy on/off switch on the bottom.  Note that Festival Delights offers this same product with a 5-hour timer, too.- The box came with a battery installed, plus each candles comes with a spare battery, too!WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- I wish the candles had two ""ON"" settings, one for a slight flicker, as if there was no wind/breeze in the area, and one for flickering like when there is wind/breeze in the area.  As is, these only flicker as if there is wind/breeze in the area.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- Three of the six installed batteries were dead-on-arrival.  I pulled the insulating plastic tab from the bottom of all six, but only three candles lit after that.  No big deal, though, as the package came with six spare batteries.  I installed three spare batteries to replace the three defective, dead-on-arrival batteries, and had all six candles glowing nicely afterwards.WHAT GREATLY IMPRESSED ME:- Given the very low cost of these candles, and knowing it would be a hassle to seek a remedy for the three bad batteries, I was contented to just let things be.  But Festival Delights sent me an email following the delivery, asking if everything was satisfactory.  I wrote back, telling about my experience with the three batteries.  A few more emails, and I'll just say that I was more than satisfied with the remedy that Festival Delights came up with on their own.  This is a company that really, really wants to do right by their customers.  The issue I had was a supplier problem with another company who supplies Festival Delights with their batteries, but Festival Delight made this their problem, and didn't pass the buck to their supplier.CONCLUSION:  I buy a ton of stuff online, but this experience was shocking to me for how well I was treated after the sale.  I intend to buy these exact candles as small gifts for next Christmas.  These little candles are a great value!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Nicely-featured, low-end laptop will suit many user needs in a very affordable price-point.  Several quibbles keep me from loving it, though.BACKGROUND:  I bought this laptop for my wife, who uses it for email, Netflix (DVD and streaming), creating documents, and surfing the web.  She plays no games and uses few other programs besides the Microsoft Office suite.  It replaces a 10-year-old Dell laptop running Windows 7 Professional on 1GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD.  Her old laptop was choking on lack of RAM.OUT OF BOX EXPERIENCE:  This Asus had relatively little bloatware, but there are a few Asus utilities and Asus-selected apps from the Microsoft Store preloaded.  I was surprised and irritated that Asus included Windows 8, not Windows 8.1, which meant I spent HOURS downloading security patches and doing the Windows 8.1 upgrade followed by more security patching.  But the *worst* decision Asus made was pre-loading McAfee anti-virus software tools.  The McAfee scanner gobbled up 500MB of RAM memory on a machine that only had 4GB to start with!  This, without me asking McAfee to do anything on my behalf.  My experience with McAfee and Symantec's Norton anti-virus products is dismal and it's impossible to fully remove their fingerprints from a system (running their uninstaller program notwithstanding).FOR TECHIE FOLKS ONLY:  I also encountered an error when I tried using my Windows Home Server 2011 to backup this Asus laptop.  The problem is that this Asus uses GUID Partition Table (GPT) for disk partitioning rather than Master Boot Record (MBR).  There is a hotfix for WHS 2011 for this, but that has it's own issues, so I've opted to use Windows 8's new backup/restore methods, like using File History.  I still created a system image backup in Windows 8, though, just to have an image copy of the hard drive.  To rid myself of McAfee and Asus's utilities, after I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and learned I couldn't use it with my WHS 2011 to do nightly backups, I decided to do a fresh install of Windows 8.1, deleting all of Asus' hidden restore partitions (which would have uselessly restored my laptop to Windows 8 and caused me hours of subsequent patching, rather than restoring this laptop to Windows 8.1) and letting the Windows 8.1 installer program create all the necessary partitions beyond the C: partition that I created myself.PERFORMANCE:-  About 45 seconds from power-on button to sign-on screen-  About 1 minute, 15 seconds from power-on button to your Desktop after signing on; this was actually 30 seconds faster than our old laptop that had an SSD but only 1GB of RAM!- Using the USB 3.0 port, I moved a 70GB file averaging just under 90MB/second- Using the USB 2.0 port, I moved a large file averaging around 25MB/second- The wifi card was moving about 4MB/second between our home server and this Asus laptopWHAT I LIKE:- Fairly lightweight, weighing just under 5 pounds (nearly 2 pounds lighter than our 10yo laptop)- The built-in CD/DVD drive is great for my wife, who still handles physical media to play movies from Netflix and the library- Has both VGA and HDMI outputs- Has a USB 3.0 port, which was helpful in quickly moving some large files to this laptop- The color display looks nice, as long as you're looking at it straight-on and not from a side angle- This is my first Windows 8 machine in the house (besides my college-aged son's laptop), but using freeware Classic Shell makes this laptop look and act like our familiar Windows 7 machine-  Fairly standard 4GB of RAM and 500GB HDD is a big step-up if you're using an old laptop or desktopWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- The keyboard is terrible, but my son says that most keyboards today are terrible, so this one is no different than all the other terrible keyboards out there, especially for a low-cost laptop like this one.  It's a chiclet-style keyboard, and typing on it feels pretty awful, really.- Already mentioned above, but this laptop comes with Windows 8, not Windows 8.1, meaning you'll spend hours to patch/update your operating system, and you'll do it again if you do a factory reset sometime in the future- The WiFi doesn't operate on the 5Ghz band, just the heavily-used 2.4Ghz band- There is no disk activity light!  I really dislike not being able to tell if the disk is doing anything or not, especially when I want to perform some operation (like hard reset my laptop) and need to know if my laptop is actually doing something, and isn't stalled- The battery life isn't any better than laptops made new 10 years ago; expect ~2 hours- The touchpad isn't as sensitive as I'd like, and there appears no way to adjust the touchpad sensitivity, either.  I found myself having to tap the touchpad (for a left-mouse click) repeatedly because my first tap didn't register.  I downloaded the latest touchpad driver from Asus, but that didn't help any.CONCLUSION:  This isn't the cheapest low-end laptop on the market, but what you get for the extra hundred bucks you're spending on this laptop is probably a little faster CPU, the built-in CD/DVD drive, a single USB 3.0 port, and perhaps a slightly larger hard disk.  I primarily got this model for the built-in CD/DVD drive.  Windows 8.1 works well on it (using Classic Shell so it looks like Windows 7), but getting from Windows 8 to 8.1 is all up to you to do.  To me, this is a 3.5 star product (rounded up to 4-stars, as I like it in spite of my quibbles).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMF6GS491SALM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8OMIDK#wasThisHelpful","RMF6GS491SALM","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Great first impression, this is a squirrel-proof design that works.  Hopefully, it holds up over time, too.BACKGROUND:  In the winter months the last few years, I'll setup a bird feeder and watch the various birds in my Florida home come to enjoy the free (to them) seed.  But then come the squirrels and then the blackbirds, and by spring, I'm tired of feeding all the non-songbirds and give up replenishing the bird feeder for the summer months.  I was happy to try this feeder because of its claim to keep at least one pest away -- squirrels.  Today I watched one squirrel try to get seed out of the feeder.  Our feeder is on a hooked, 6' iron pole stuck in the ground.  The squirrel evidently had unsuccessfully tried jumping onto the perches, but the perches must've given away and the squirrel must've fallen onto the ground.  So, this squirrel would climb onto the iron pole and look longingly at the seed and the perches, but never tried jumping onto them.  He also climbed on top of the feeder, but the seed is too far down the plastic tube, so there was no way for him to get seed from the top of the feeder, either.  He wound up contenting himself with finding whatever seeds may have fallen onto the ground.WHAT I LIKE:- It works!  Our squirrels can't dive into the seed inside this bird feeder.- It holds a lot more seed than our old feeder (in fact, I've filled our feeder only halfway so the seeds stay fresher and to reduce the stress of our bent, iron pole from which this feeder hangs)- Five perches mean up to five birds can feed at the same time.  I watched four birds feeding simultaneously.- Easy to pop-off the top and refill the feeder- The clear, plastic tube makes it easy to see how much seed is left in the feeder, even when looking at it from a far distance- The materials look reasonably weather-resistant, although I have doubts about how long the clear tube will stay clear since it's made of plastic, not tempered glassWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- We have pigeons, too, that like to land on the bird feeder and eat.  The blackbirds haven't yet come, but they will.  It'd be great to have a user-controlled setting to determine how much resistance can each perch withstand, so I could set it so the pigeons and blackbirds can't land on the perches, but the songbirds still can.  Our pigeons can land on these perches, but the perches do bend downward about 45 degrees, but not enough so the pigeons lose their ability to eat.CONCLUSION:  This is a very pricey bird feeder, but if you spend a lot of money on bird seed, it may pay for itself by keeping you feeding birds - and not squirrels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUJL8OGU9B9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3CU3M#wasThisHelpful","R2XUJL8OGU9B9F","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Stealthy USB recorder provides highly portable and discreet voice recording capabilities, but several design choices keep me from really liking this unit.BACKGROUND:  You probably already know this, but in many states and jurisdictions, it's illegal to record somebody's voice without their knowledge and consent.  To test this device, I used it to record my family's dinner conversation one evening without their knowledge or consent.WHAT I LIKE:- Serves dual purposes.  It's a 4GB USB thumb drive, and it's a voice recorder, too- Highly portable and as durable as any other USB thumb drive- Offers highly discreet recording capability- The voice recording WAV files offered very good sound in relatively small file sizes (roughly 1MB per minute)- Charging the rechargeable battery is as simply as plugging it into any USB-powered portWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The LED indicator showing recording on (blue light), low battery (flashing red), battery recharging (red) was so hard to see that I thought my unit was defective.  Only when I was making a short video clip to send to the vendor did the video pick-up the faint light emitting from a tiny pinhole on one side of this USB.  I wish this light were brighter, although I suppose that would take more battery energy, and it would diminish the discreetness of this unit- The sound files are dated with January 1, 2000.  Although there is a small application to set the device's internal clock day/time, that did not seem to permanently set the date/time inside the unit.  I ran this application several times, and immediately afterwards, recordings would have the correct creation date/timestamp.  But if I used this device a day later, for whatever reason, it seemed to lose the date/timestamp, and the battery never discharged fully during this time period.  There seems to be glitch in how the internal clock is set.- The voice-activated capability, which functions to only record when there is something being picked-up by the microphone, caused a lot of voice clipping to occur, especially if a person's voice was soft to begin with.  I actually hated this particular feature because there was no way to turn it off.  I would much rather have a setting that let's me turn-off voice-activated recording if I wanted.- The recording files are WAV files.  I'd prefer MP3 recordings, but this is probably a design decision to avoid having to compress data in such a small device.  It's easy to convert WAV files to MP3s, but that's just an extra step you'll have to undertake if you prefer working only with MP3 files.- Sliding out the male connector that inserts into a USB port is difficult to do, and cannot be easily done using just one hand.  You have to hold this device with one hand, and use your other hand to slide out the connector because there is so much resistance involved.- Since it can be used for very discreet or even stealth recording purposes, it's probably a good idea to avoid inscribing the abbreviation, ""REC"" on the slide switch, which would tip-off someone that this more than just a USB thumb drive, but also a recording device, too.CONCLUSION:  If you have the need to make discreet voice recordings in a highly portable, easy-to-operate device, and if you aren't concerned about a nearly-invisible LED indicator light and WAV files that are all dated January 1, 2000, then this just might be the very thing you're looking for.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Serviceable clock/radio is fine for a guest bedroom or for a kids' bedroom, but you might want to look at other options firstly before getting this for your bedroom.BACKGROUND:  With so many clock/radios fetching half the cost of this item, you have to wonder what you're getting for the extra cost of this iHome Bluetooth Stereo Clock Radio?  Well, you get Bluetooth connectivity, a USB charging option, stereo speakers, and that's about it.  The fidelity from the speakers is what you'd expect from a transistor radio, except there are two speakers, not one.  But various quibbles I have about this product keep me from really liking it.WHAT I LIKE:- Intuitive to use.  I figured out how to set the time, connect to Bluetooth, use the audio cable input all without reading the instructions- Compact design doesn't take much space on a nightstand- Bluetooth capability is the highlight feature for this item, it's why you're paying more for a clock/radio/alarm- I liked the white digital display, not too brilliant at night, perfectly legible during the day- It's easy to adjust the display brightnessWHAT I DISLIKED:- The FM antenna comes out of the back of the unit and it's just a long wire, really.  But you can't detach it!  I don't care about the AM/FM radio, and would prefer to remove that dangling wire, but I can't, as it's not user-removable apart from using wire cutters.- The unit came with 2 AA batteries for the clock back-up feature.  After I inserted the two batteries, the ""Low Battery"" indicator kept flashing.  Why?  I checked, and I inserted the batteries correctly.  Then I tested them with a multi-meter.  One battery was 0.00 volts, but it looked fine on the outside.  The batteries are made from (www-dot-china-dishy-dot-com).  I tossed even the good battery fearing it would leak if I used it, and replaced them both with Duracell-branded batteries.- The battery compartment cover requires a screw to loosen, but why?  I suppose it if it's used in a small child's bedroom, it would add a measure of safety.  It would be better, then, to make using the screw optional if you need it, but allow the cover to be closed securely without using a screw.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The audio quality is transistor-radio quality; don't expect great sound.  It's serviceable.- The audio input is on the backside of the clock/radio, where it's more difficult to get to.  It would be better to have the input positioned on the front, side, or top of the unit so I don't have to fiddle with getting to the back of the clock radio.- The standard USB port (for recharging something) is also in the back, where it's not easy to get to.  You can recharge your iPhone using a cable plugged into the USB port, but I would much prefer a clock/radio with a built-in lightning connector so I could dispense with the cable when recharging my iPhone on the device.- There is no date function.  If there were, it could auto-adjust for Daylight Savings Time, saving the trouble of twice-a-year time adjustments.- I wish there were a light sensor that would automatically adjust the display so it's brighter during the day, dimmer at night.  The user should still initially set how dim the display should be at night.  Then, the light sensor would auto-adjust the brightness based upon whether the room is lit or not.  That would eliminate manually adjusting the brightness each morning and each evening.CONCLUSION:  My family collectively thought this is the kind of item you might see in a 3-star hotel room.  It's serviceable, but not elegant, and it doesn't have outstanding design or sound, either.  If you need a clock/radio with Bluetooth for any bedroom in the house except for yours, this might work, but for your bedroom, get something better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9M6C16VY0L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5JCBNO#wasThisHelpful","R2S9M6C16VY0L3","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  This belt works as designed, but for my 6'+ size, it is much too tight around my waist.BACKGROUND:  I usually use an armband to carry my iPhone.  The idea of a waistband is good -- include a keycard, a set of keys, whatever.  But even when I fully extended this belt, it did not easily fit around my waist at all; it was just too tight.  And I'm not overweight, either; in fact, I'm rather slender.WHAT I LIKE:- Well-constructed and very, very light- Easy to buckle and easy to adjust the band- Easily fit my iPhone 5C (but note it was a *tight* fit)- Felt surprisingly comfortable to wear, even for the first time (except, it was just too tight around my waist)WHAT I DISLIKED:- I think this might only work well if your waist size is 30"" or less, maybe 32"".  Would be nicer to either make two versions of this item (one for smaller sizes, one for bigger), or at least make the band more adjustable for larger waist sizes.  This single complaint was serious enough that I can't really use more than 2-stars for this item.- The weather resistance doesn't mean that electronics in the carrying pouch won't get wet.  The fabric is very stretchy and lightweight, but not waterproof.  I wish it were somehow able to be waterproof, too, so my iPhone wouldn't get wet if I ran in a rain shower.CONCLUSION:  If you have a waist size 30 inches or less, this would probably be a 3-, 4- or 5-star product for you.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  The corkscrew and foil remover are great, the stoppers work well so I don't have to reinsert the cork back into the opened bottle, and the pourer worked as designed (in spite of its distorted, egg-shape rather than round).  But I don't get the whole pump thing, and just tossed the pump into the trash because I don't know how to effectively use it.WHAT I LIKE:- The corkscrew was a little bigger than the one I'd been using, and it was easier to screw it into the cork- The foil remover was surprisingly effective to effortless remove the foil over the cork- As long as the stoppers don't leak (they haven't yet), I find using them to be much easier than re-inserting a cork back onto the neck of an opened bottle of wine.- The wine pourer made it easier to pour wine without splashing any in the process of pouringWHAT I DISLIKED:- This set lacks a case to hold everything, so it just adds more clutter into whichever kitchen drawer you're going to stow everything- There were no written instructions on how to use the pump to effectively remove air from a bottle (just a single picture of someone positioning the pump over the wine bottle).  I made a few lame attempts, guessing at the process, before giving up and tossing the pump into the garbage.- The pourer was distorted; it is a little egg-shaped.  I didn't try hard to re-form it, since it has a rubber collar on the steel funnel, and it works well to more easily pour wine into a wine glass.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- They should have included an instruction to visit YouTube and watch a video on how to remove air from a wine bottle.CONCLUSION:  Overall, it's an okay set.  You may want something like this to get the wine stoppers, pourer, corkscrew and foil remover, and just toss out the pump.  If you really can tell that your wine is being despoiled by air, you ought to get a better wine accessory set than this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0TP2UR0V2HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FATURHC#wasThisHelpful","R3O0TP2UR0V2HM","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  This is my college son's favorite battery pack for his electronic toys, so I'm having a hard time using it for mine.  Highly recommended!WHAT I LIKE:- Huge capacity (13000mAh) is the largest among the many battery packs I have in my home- Three charging ports let you charge multiple items simultaneously, or use the included tri-cord to do that with just one USB port (which will cause the devices charging from one USB port to charge more slowly, though)- Built-in flashlight has been surprisingly handy to have at night when the lights have been turned off in our home- The battery level indicators show how much power remains in the battery pack- The included tri-cord is a hit in my home!  We love its versatility and the just-right length of each cord- The Nationite reCharge A3 is astonishingly inexpensive!  I've reviewed items like this from other vendors and competing products usually cost 2x more than this one costs.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- When plugging in a USB cord, you plug it in upside down, meaning the USB logo (stamped on the end of the USB cord) will face downward rather than upward, which is not intuitive at all.  It would be better to orient the USB ports so USB cords plug-in with the USB logo facing up, as it is for nearly all other devices.- The LED lights for the battery level are too close together, so if it's at 75% capacity, the lights from the three lit LEDs make it appear that all four LEDs are lit (so be careful to distinguish whether three or four LEDs are lit when checking remaining battery level).  That said, this wasn't an issue when the battery pack was at 50% or 25% levels and just two or one LEDs indicators were lit, and my college-aged son thought nothing of this, though it did slightly bug me.CONCLUSION:  This is an excellent battery pack, overall, and an extremely good value.  If you don't already have a high capacity battery pack, get this one -- you'll be surprised at how you got along so long without one!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  These are the BEST earbuds I have ever used.  Period!  They actually make a drum cymbal sizzle and reproduce sound with amazing clarity and crispness.UPDATE:  6/12/2015:  Sadly, these terrific-sounding earbuds broke.  This was the 2nd pair of earbuds I received for a review, as the 1st pair of S5 earbuds broke just a few days after I received them.  By ""break"" I mean that the sound in the left earbud just stopped working.  These earbuds were well-cared for (and frequently used), and I'm really disappointed that they broke just a few months after receiving them, because they sounded so good.  Accordingly, I've knocked three stars of my 5-star rating because if you're spending about a hundred bucks on a set of earbuds, you expect them to last for years -- not months.<< Original review follows >>BACKGROUND:  I have always enjoyed listening to music with accentuated treble and midrange tones more than bass.  And I have used a lot of earbuds over the years, nearly all of which do a poor job with treble.  When I first put on these S5 headphones, I was a little disappointed because they didn't sound noticeably better than other, less costly earbuds I have.  It wasn't until my college-aged son used them and came back with glowing praise for them that I had a second listen.  Taking his advice, I *very carefully* fitted the earbuds into my ear (I usually do this hurriedly).  The result was astonishing.  With the right-sized earbud tip and position, these earbuds sound better than anything I've ever had before.  The treble of a drum cymbal just sizzles.  Vocals are clear and strong.  Altogether, my music sounded bright, lifelike, and undistorted.  Bass response was surprising because I could hear the bass chords very, very clearly, yet they're not emphasized -- there is no strong ""boom-boom-boom"" bass response like you get with a subwoofer.  So, the bass was just as clear as the treble, just less pronounced (which I actually liked).  I used these S5 headphones only with my iPhone and I didn't adjust use an equalizer app, but I'm thinking I'd like to get an equalizer app because with these earbuds, I could have full control over how I listen to music because these earbuds can fully reproduce the whole range of sound.  But to achieve this great sound, you MUST take care to position them correctly, and with the right-sized eargel for your ears.  If you get these and they don't sound great, try a different eargel and reposition them back into your ears until they sound great.WHAT I LIKE:- Amazingly clear sound with sizzling treble and crystal clear vocals- The flat cord resists tangling- They come with a great variety of eargels so you'll get a great fit- They are aesthetically pleasing- The bass response let me very clearly hear bass chords, yet these earbuds aren't ""boomy""- They come with a protective, zippered case that also holds the extra eargels- The audio cord fits into my iPhone with me having to remove my iPhone's protective caseCONCLUSION:  If you are wondering whether spending $100 on a pair of earbuds is worth the high cost when you can get other earbuds that are much, much less expensive, all I can tell you is Amazon has a great returns policy -- try these out and see for yourself!  For me, these have set a new, high bar on how well earbuds can reproduce sound and how much I enjoy listening to my favorite tracks out of my music library.  (Update:  I had given these headphones 5-stars and a high recommendation, but after the 2nd pair broke, I cannot recommend these headphones any longer).

"QUICK SUMMARY: Small scale works fine for a non-scientific scale that costs as much as two or three McDonald's dinners.WHAT I LIKED:- Accurate to within a gram or two (see below)- The backlit LCD display was easy to read- Battery powered, so, no cords- Small and compact, just 5"" x 4""- The ""Count"" function makes it easy to, say, count a jar of coins having the same denomination- Has plastic covers to protect the scale when not in use (it has one cover for the weighing surface, and one for the entire scale)WHAT I DISLIKED:- This scale only weighs up to 500 grams, which is a little more than 1 pound.  Smart Weigh makes another model that weighs up to 2000 grams (4 pounds) but with 0.1g increments instead of 0.01g increments.  If you really need 0.01g accuracy, you need a real scientific scale.  This is a great little scale, but consider the other model that weighs up to 2000 grams.- The instruction manual uses a teensy-weeny font size of about 3 or 4 points- The plastic covers lack a thumb notch to make them easy to remove (and why have two covers?)- After self-calibrating, the scale tended to still bump around +/- 0.010 grams, even when nothing was on the scale. And really, can a scale like this really measure 1/1000th of a gram accurately?HOW TO CHECK SCALE ACCURACY:A cup of water is about 8.3 ounces, or, about 237 grams. Use a measuring cup and the Tare function on this scale to check its accuracy. After turning on the scale, put a plastic cup on the scale and press Tare so it reads 0.000 grams. Then, pour exactly one cup of water into the plastic cup. It should read 237 grams, more or less. My scale read just slightly under 237 grams.CONCLUSION: Great little scale for the money, but a good kitchen scale does everything this scale does. Unless you weigh very light items and/or need a very small scale, get a good kitchen scale instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RF7L7UOLCQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME8VI34#wasThisHelpful","R20RF7L7UOLCQM","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Deeply flawed collection of ""Made in China"" tools are not even suitable for emergency use.  Avoid at any and all cost.WHAT I LIKE:There really isn't anything to like about this three piece tool set.  It is cheap, true, but it is very cheaply made and you're throwing your money away if you buy this set.WHAT I DISLIKED:- The pocket knife tools can't be extended out of the handle without breaking your fingernail- I easily, permanently bent the corkscrew tool (in the pocketknife) by over extending it when I retracted it out of the handle- The multi-tool's handle (when unfolded) is almost knife-like sharp, burred, and VERY painful to use- The multi-tool isn't spring-loaded, so you have to manually open the pliers each time you close them- The wood saw blade is uselessly, surprisingly dull- Like the pocketknife, the toolset in the multitool can't be extended out of the handle without breaking your fingernail- The flashlight uses an inefficient incandescent lightbulb instead of an efficient LED- The flashlight's on/off switch was faulty, causing the light to flicker on and off when switched on- The flashlight's light beam is so diffused and dim that it's nearly uselessCONCLUSION:  You're throwing your hard-earned money away with this set.  It's not wise buying such a cheap set of tools that involve life-threatening things like knives.  Unless you're shopping for a White Elephant Christmas gift for co-workers you dislike, spend the extra money it takes to get a good quality knife, flashlight and multi-tool.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  The knife blade is burred and dull, the multi-tool is uncomfortable to use and I'll break fingernails trying to pry open the tools.  Even the belt pouch has a design flaw.  Not recommended.WHAT I LIKESadly, there is nothing I liked about this product.  I don't hate it - each item does do what it's designed to do, and if I had access to absolutely nothing else, I would use this knife and multi-tool set.  But each item here has flaws that take all the joy out of using any of them.WHAT I DISLIKED:- The knife blade came burred and was dull.  When the blade is closed into the handle, there is a protruding, 90-degree corner of the blade base that sticks out from the handle which could actually be dangerous.- The multi-tool is uncomfortable to hold when it's unfolded and you grasp the handle- The multi-tool has no spring-load, so you have to manually open the pliers each time you close them- The various tools built-in to the multi-tool's handle are nearly impossible to extend without breaking a fingernail in the process- The wood saw tool is uselessly, surprisingly dull- Even the belt pouch is flawed, where the Velcro hooks sewn into the pouch are sewn about two inches too high up on the pouch, so the pouch's cover rises and sags over the tools rather than snuggly securing them.CONCLUSION:  This is a ""Made in China"" set that should stay in China.  Not recommended!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Easy to use, and works surprisingly well to give long-lasting light where you're in pitch-black situations (like camping or during a power outage).WHAT I LIKE:- Cranking the hand-crank for 60 seconds will cast off useful light for 30 minutes, but the diminishing glow will continue for well beyond an hour making it a terrific camp tent light.- The hand crank fits snuggly into the body of the light fixture, rather than protruding from it- The adjustable lantern handle makes this very easy to carry as a spotlight or upright lantern- The two sets of LED lights provide a dim, diffused lantern glow or a tightly focused spot light - versatile!- The black ring around the spot light is notched so, if it's placed face down, the spotlight lens won't get (easily) scratched- It's light!  It only weighs 1 lbs, 2 oz.- The hook/handle above the lantern make it easy to hang inside a tent- You can charge this item using a supplied car charger, too!WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- I wish this lantern could be alternately charged using a USB cord, rather than using the hand-crank or 12-volt car charger- I wish you could alternately install some alkaline batteries for additional versatility- Space-saving features are important when camping.  I wish this overall item were designed to be smaller, more space-saving.- The lithium battery isn't (evidently) user-replaceable, which makes disposing this item more difficultA NOTE TO ALL CHINESE MANUFACTURERS:  Please, please, hire an American to proofread your instruction manuals and item packaging.  This item's packaging included the following product features:- ""Dark Light-up""- ""Farming Usage"" - really?  I'm from Illinois, but I have no idea how farming is helped by this item.- ""Adopt most capacity lithium battery, light weight.  More time with discharging, longer life time."" Okay, good then!- You would also avoid the numerous misspelled words on your product packaging, tooCONCLUSION:  This is a versatile item that would be good where dim lighting is acceptable, such as in emergency situations or where you're working in pitch-black darkness.  The item is thoughtfully designed and it's priced right, too.  Recommended!

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Works well to charge my iPhone, reasonable price, but some design choices keep me from liking this one.WHAT I LIKE:- Fairly small, this would work well to give a device a needed boost of power- Fairly Inexpensive; if you lost it, you wouldn't be too upset- Battery capacity is enough to give my not-fully-discharged iPhone a couple of boosts before this pack needs recharging- The input port for recharging uses a micro USB cord (not included, but you've probably got many of these already)- Charging time (for my iPhone) was quickWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The hard plastic shell won't absorb any impact well without cracking, breaking.  It would be much better to construct this out of a rubberized material that absorbs shock.  See the included keychain in the picture?  Have you ever dropped your keys onto a hard floor?- There is no battery level indicator.  It's just blue = ready, power available, and flashing blue means it's time to recharge the pack.  When charging it, flashing red = recharging, solid red = fully charged.  I much prefer knowing how much capacity is left in a battery pack with at least 25% intervals.- Would be nice if it had rubber plugs for the USB ports so the whole thing would be water resistant.- Relative to competitor products, this item is still priced a little higher than other options with no discernible benefit for the extra costCONCLUSION:  Amazon carries a LOT of 2600mAh battery packs.

I also tested these in the absolute darkness of my garage, to see how much light they cast off in pitch darkness (answer:  enough to see a footpath and things on that footpath, but only within a 2' in diameter).WHAT I LIKE:- Easy to assemble. Just insert the plastic stake into one end of the stainless steel tube, and insert the light fixture into the opposite end of the tube. To turn on the automatic light mechanism, twist off the top of the light fixture, flip the switch to the ON position, then re-twist the fixture on again.- Each fixture came with a rechargeable battery pre-installed- The batteries are Ni-MH, not Ni-Cad, so they shouldn't be subject to a battery ""memory effect"" that degrades performance- I only cared that these lights would work from dusk until midnight, and they do that- They are maintenance free- They are so cheap, if one breaks or otherwise needs replacing, it's not costly to do soWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The stainless steel tube is paper thin and easily bent. I wish the product used marine-quality stainless steel that was thicker, sturdier, since these are going to be subject to the elements. As-is, I have my doubts that the ""Made in China"" stainless steel will stand-up to Florida's heat, humidity, and rain. (I also wonder how the batteries are going to hold up in Florida's summertime heat, too).- I wish the white light was brighter than it is, even if that meant glowing for a shorter duration.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- Replacing the battery involves unscrewing 2 small screws, but the screw heads are so poorly formed, it can be challenging or impossible to unscrew them.- The packaging wrongly says that these lights use a 300mAh, AA-sized battery.  They don't.  They use a 600mAh, AAA-sized battery.CONCLUSION: These are ""Made in China"" and you get what you pay for.

(I also wonder how the batteries are going to hold up in Florida's summertime heat, too).- I wish the white light was brighter than it is, even if that meant glowing for a shorter duration.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- Replacing the battery involves unscrewing 2 small screws, but the screw heads are so poorly formed, it can be challenging or impossible to unscrew them.- The packaging wrongly says that these lights use a 300mAh, AA-sized battery.  They don't.  They use a 600mAh, AAA-sized battery.CONCLUSION: These are ""Made in China"" and you get what you pay for.  If you need dim lights for a sidewalk or step, easy installation, no wiring, and don't expect these to withstand the elements for many years, you'll probably like these solar lights.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  These lights work as designed, but the color change effect was too abrupt for my liking.UPDATED 6/15/2015:  ** DO NOT BUY **.  After six months, most of these light fixtures stopped working.  All of them showed a LOT of rust spots (the ""stainless steel"" is of such poor quality that they began showing small rust spots after just 30 days), marring the appearance of the one light that is still working.  Terrible quality, a great disappointment.  Try another a product - avoid these completely!BACKGROUND:  I installed these lights around the footpath around my backyard pool, where they get a lot of sunlight during the day.WHAT I LIKE:- Easy to assemble.  Just insert the plastic stake into one end of the stainless steel tube, and insert the light fixture into the opposite end of the tube.  To turn on the automatic light mechanism, twist off the top of the light fixture, flip the switch to the ON position, then re-twist the fixture on again.- Each fixture came with a rechargeable battery pre-installed- The batteries are Ni-MH, not Ni-Cad, so they shouldn't be subject to a battery ""memory effect"" that degrades performance- The batteries are user-replaceable- I only cared that these lights would work from dusk until midnight, and they do that- They are maintenance freeWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The light color-shifting is too abrupt, occurring in 1-2 seconds.  I wish the color shifting was more nuanced, even imperceptible.  Instead, the too-quick color shifting draws attention to the light fixture.  I want these landscape lights to be more subtle than what they are.- The stainless steel tube is paper thin and easily bent.  I wish the product used marine-quality stainless steel that was thicker, sturdier, since these are going to be subject to the elements.  As-is, I have my doubts that the ""Made in China"" stainless steel will stand-up to Florida's heat, humidity, and rain.  (I also wonder how the batteries are going to hold up in Florida's summertime heat, too).- The red color is so dark, that it fails to illuminate my footpath.  Only the greenish-blue color does a reasonable job of illuminating my footpath.- I wish there was a way to not allow the colors to change; instead, I wish I could just choose a color to always have lit up.NOTE:  The package boasts ""Color Changing LED Lights"" which is true. But it also says, in smaller letters, ""The lights...have super bright white LED lights"" which is not true.  They don't cast off white light, much less ""super bright"" white light.CONCLUSION:  If the light changing colors were much more subtle, and if you could choose to display just one color (turning off the color changing feature), this would be a 4-star item.  I do worry that a landscape light set that is ""Made in China"" won't hold up to Florida's climate very well.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Fun for kids, this is a good novelty gift to give to an older child (say, 6+) or very early teenager.  Don't expect it to sound better than a transistor radio's speaker, though (but they will sound better than an iPhone's internal speaker).  For me, this is a 3-star item, but my younger kids like it so much, I've bumped it up to 4-stars since they are really the intended audience here.BACKGROUND:  I chose to review this item just because I thought some of my kids would enjoy testing it with me.  I was right.  It was my college-aged son who first got the speakers out of the box, but it was my younger kids who most enjoyed the light effects these speakers gave off.  The speakers are USB powered, so we used a battery pack we use with our iPods and iPhones to supply the power.  Then, we connected the audio to my iPhone.  The speaker dancing light display starts when my iPhone's volume slider is moved half-way to the right.  At two-thirds volume, you get quite a nice, splashing light display.  At full volume, you get bursts of lit water and very distorted speaker sound.  As far as sound goes, these speakers are equivalent to a battery-operated, transistor radio.  They have no bass and they amplify sound without making it sound good.  But young kids don't really care about that (mine didn't, anyway).  They just enjoyed the novelty of this item, and when I suggested boxing these up and donating them after I finished writing this review, they objected.  That says something about the appeal this item has for young kids.WHAT WE NOTICED:- The light display corresponds to the volume of the speakers, but not necessarily to the beat of the music- There are four LED colors in each speaker:  orange/yellow, green, blue, red- One speaker slightly emphasized blue, one emphasized green- The color display cast onto our ceiling above the speakers was blue/green (almost no red and no yellow)WHAT WE LIKE:- The whole splashing, colorful light thing is admittedly cool, especially in a darkened room- This would be a cool effect for a kids' room or if you're having a party and need background music (but not great-sounding music)- We liked the light display cast onto our ceiling as well as the splashy water display- My young kids thought these speakers sounded okay (for the money, they do sound okay)- The audio cable fits my iPhone without me having to remove the iPhone's protective case- The portable design (when used with a USB battery pack) makes these very versatile as to where you can use themWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- Would be really nice to turn-off the speakers and just connect these to an audio system where the music is played with high-fidelity speakers while these do just the whole dancing water show thing- Would be nice to have a sensitivity adjustment so the dancing water display is user-adjusted irrespective of the volume level- Would be nice if the red and yellow-orange lights were not overpowered by the green-blue LED lights (noticeable on the ceiling)CONCLUSION:  This is a great novelty gift for someone who is entranced with colorful lights and sound, and isn't discriminating when it comes to audio fidelity.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Utilitarian basket installs in a minute (if you know how it's done - mine had no installation instructions) and works as intended.  It's a little hard to adjust the adjustable piece that rotates around the bike's steerer tube.BACKGROUND:  I installed this onto my Raleigh hybrid bike, which is painted black.  The white of this basket contrasts nicely with the black, but I'd rather have had a matching black basket than a contrasting white color.  The box containing this bike basket had no instructions, and I'm admittedly dull when it comes to figuring out stuff like this.  If you look at the picture, though, you'll see that the plastic-coated (black) ends of the basket handle face forward on the bike.  The basket bottom has two holes into which two hooks from the basket's support rack fit.  The black, cushioned hooks of the rack fit over your handlebars (meaning if you have any lights or bells on the handlebars right next to the stem, you'll need to relocate them).INSTALLATION:  Start by putting the basket rack onto your bike.  That part is easy.  The big, cushioned hooks go onto the center of your handlebar.  Then, attach the rack's black strap around your bike's steerer tube (once you wrap it around the bike's steerer tube, you thread the strap through a buckle on the strap, draw it tight, and use the strap's Velcro to make it a snug fit.  Now, the bike rack should be fitted on top of your handlebar and against your bike's steerer tube.  To attach the basket to the rack, grasp the two basket handles and hold the basket using just those two handles (they'll be vertically positioned this way).  Maneuver the two holes in the basket's bottom onto the rack's two support hooks intended to support the basket.  Then, position the basket snuggly against the basket rack so when you put down the handles, they lock the top of the basket onto the basket rack.  After you do it once, it's easy to do thereafter.WHAT I LIKE:- It's easy to install the basket, once you've done it one time- It's easy to uninstall it, too, and the handle make it a great as grocery basket, too- It's sturdy enough to hold two gallons of milk or a gallon of milk and a bag of groceries- The finer mesh at the bottom of the basket keeps small articles from falling out of the basket- The basket is covered in a plastic coating to keep it weather-resistant- For the money, it's a reasonable valueWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- My basket came with a yellow, permanently discolored corner at one corner of the basket bottom.  I have no idea why.- A simple installation guide showing how to install the thing would've saved me a moment of trouble figuring it out on my own- Would be nice to have an included, waterproof, attachable pouch to fit inside the basket (for keys, iPhone, etc.)CONCLUSION:  Good value overall.  This item solves a problem I've had anytime I go to the grocery store and buy a gallon of milk, and then I have to juggle holding onto it on one side of my bike (disrupting my balance) while riding my bike back home again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C2AT5WPRE9QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVH6TZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2C2AT5WPRE9QA","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Works well, and works instantly, with acceptable accuracy for most applications.  But some design choices keep this from being a 5-star product.WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:  The product description doesn't mention its stated accuracy.  It's accurate above freezing +/- 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or +/- 1.5 degrees Celsius.  Below freezing and the accuracy declines to +/- 5 degrees Fahrenheit or +/- 3 degrees Celsius.  You can independently turn on/off the backlight and the laser.  At one foot away from an object, the ""spot size"" (area being scanned) is about 1.5 inches in diameter.  At three feet away, the spot size is 3 inches.  At five feet away, the spot size is about 5.5 inches.  You have to guess at the spot size being scanned based upon how far away you are from the object you're scanning.WHAT I LIKE:- It works well and gave read-outs similar to a digital thermometer I regularly use- Extremely fast read-outs, the initial read-out comes up in less than a second- The red laser is bright and excellent for determining where you're pointing, exactly- The backlight display really helps to make the LCD display easy to see in dim lighting- The unit felt very comfortable to hold, and is very lightWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- There is no way to turn-off the audible feedback beeping noise, which you hear after you release the trigger- The unit auto-shuts off after just 7 seconds after releasing the trigger, which in my opinion is much too quick- The unit lacks a Min/Max function that records the minimum and maximum temperature, so you can see the min/max values after you've finished scanning an object's surface- The very small pictures inside the instruction manual use text labels that are impossibly small to see without eyestrain- The unit is not water resistant.  It would be nice if it were water resistant so if it's used outside at a work site or indoors in the kitchen, it won't get damaged by getting wet.CONCLUSION:  For the asking price, this is a very good, no-frills, infrared thermometer.  If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed with this device.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  The mouse hardware is excellent, but the software is the weak link here.BACKGROUND:  We have a gaming computer hooked up to our TV in our family room. Everyone in my family got a chance to use this mouse, but only my college-aged son attempted to use the software (he's the one who built the gaming computer). Like the Corsair gaming keyboard (another review item), my son found the software for the mouse to be pretty unintuitive and dismal.WHAT WE LIKED:- Feels excellent in the hand, smooth top, with textured thumb-rest, pleasantly wide- Good button placement, easily accessible without much effort- Scroll wheel is precise, feels excellent- Lots of configurable buttons- Nice, braided USB cable- High DPI means more sensitivity, important for gaming- Sniper button is cool, drops DPI, making it easier to pull off precise shots- Wide variety of potential colors- Very customizable if software works rightWHAT WE DID NOT LIKE:- The software!  It is hard to use, and difficult to find what you're looking for- The lights are rather weak, especially when you use it during the daytimeCONCLUSION:  Excellent hardware, lacking software.  Hopefully future updates to the software will make the software more usable and user-friendly.

"QUICK SUMMARY:  Video gamers in my home like the lights and sound of this high-end gaming keyboard.  But the software keeps this from being a 5-star product.BACKGROUND:  We have a gaming computer hooked up to our TV in our family room.  Everyone in my family got a chance to use this keyboard, but only my college-aged son attempted to use the software (he's the one who built the gaming computer).  He found that updating the firmware of the keyboard only worked on USB 2.0, not USB 3.0 -- not sure why that was, but it's noteworthy if you're going to update the keyboard firmware to the latest version (which we had to do).  He found the software to be pretty dismal, which is saying something because he's working on a degree in the IT industry (if he can't do it easily, heaven help the rest of us!).WHAT WE LIKED:- Smooth key actuation- Pleasant clicking sound (note:  I personally don't care for the clicking sound, but the youth in my home liked the clicking)- Wide variety of colors- Nice-feeling, braded cable, seems durable, good length- Good traction on smooth surfaces, won't slide away as you're typing- Software is powerful, wide variety of features- Near infinite customizability when software works rightWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- Software is buggy, it's hard to find settings you're looking for- Keyboard backlight, even on max setting, seems dim in daylight (but otherwise seems bright)- Firmware hung on usb 3.0, had to connect to usb 2.0 to update successfully- Darker colors aren't richer, they are simply dimmer versions of lighter colorsCONCLUSION:  Excellent hardware, feels solid and well put together.  Software brings it down.  While powerful, it is poorly designed and hard to operate.  Hopefully the software will improve over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHNNBXSNVWBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2ROO2S#wasThisHelpful","R1VHNNBXSNVWBM","A1QOK9LU90ACF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QOK9LU90ACF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got these for my kids birthday sleep over party coming up.  I plan on putting them inside balloons and letting the kids have a blast bouncing them around or just looking the colors inside the balloon!  Since you get 100 of these glow sticks, I probably will surprise my daughter in her bath with one here and there.  I can't wait to see what all she makes with them as this pack includes things to make everything from bracelets to any kind of creation!  Oh how much fun these are going to be.  I have tried out a couple (just so I could get an idea on the quality and life span of them).  Wow, this is going to be a big hit at the party!  They do glow for a long time ( I ended up going to bed and in the morning there was still a slight glow to it!).  I love that they are non-toxic, non-heat generating, and non-flammable.

"Waterproof 320t Polyester Fabric Shower Curtain with Big Black Tree Design 71inch X 79inchThe easiest and most affordable way to update your bathroom is by changing out the shower curtain.  This 100% satin polyester shower curtain is sheer (see photo showing my hand behind the curtain).  It is also has shine to it, when the light hits it.  The size is perfect for a typical bathroom (see full length photo), it is long enough to go almost to the floor!  I love the simple, yet beautiful design work featuring a leafless tree. The curtain is white and the tree is black, as seen in the listing and my photos. The grommets are attached firmly, one thing I will say is in their photo it looks as if the curtain is stripped, it is NOT.  Now the only thing I dislike are the cheap plastic hooks.  I found these great metal hooks that have balls at the top, you do not even hear the curtain opening or closing.

"DBPOWER Bluetooth Speakers with Transparent Enclosure, FM Radio, Built-in Mic, LED Display, Support 3.5 mm Audio Jack, Micro SD Card & USB Input(black)I am impressed.  I did NOT expect to be excited about this Bluetooth speaker.  It come inside of a hard plastic box and then inside is another hard acrylic box with the speaker and component inside.  I have only had it for a few days, but I have utilized it ALOT.  Now while I tested and enjoyed the sounds and the unique design...

"Sassy red MP3 player!  This is a great little MP3/MP4 player. Of course I loved the price the most, but the quality of this player is nicely designed to be like the expensive version. The sound quality and set up are straight on. Do not think you are getting an iPod for $20, you aren't. If you need top quality, you will have to pay top price. This little MP3/MP4 player is ideal for almost everyone, anyone who loves music will love this. Once you learn how to use it, you will be happy with it. It truly is not hard, but if you used the expensive brand before... you will have to adapt.Overall, this red 16GB MP3/MP4 player is built quite well.  The color is nice and the LCD  screen is 1.78 inch TFT and supports AMV video. A $20 MP3 player to does it all is not a joke. My rating is 5 stars.Sample provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV5D2WM2Z68Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ILV4OC#wasThisHelpful","R2AV5D2WM2Z68Y","A3U0MUSTS8U9JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0MUSTS8U9JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This VERY affordable MP3/MP4 player is quite stylish. I love that it looks just like the expensive brand name ones at an unbelievable price!  If you judge this MP3 player based on what those $100+ ones do, you should not have bothered buying this.  This 16GB player does everything it should do, play music!  It's very easy to operate  and the design is top notch.  It comes in a nice protective packaging with a pair of earbuds and the USB cable. The instructions are very simple to follow, but you really do not need them.  If you have played with an MP3, MP4 player before, you know how to work this one.  I received the ""electric"" blue one and I could not be more satisfied.Overall, this affordable music player is exactly what everyone needs.  It plays music, read ebooks and videos. You can even use it as a flash drive!  Now the LCD is only 1.78"", but for this price you might be tempted to save all that money and just use this great player for it all!  My rating of 5 stars is based on the fact that 1. its under $20 and 2. it does exactly what it says it does!Sample provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZX54UGG3ONF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168FCXCS#wasThisHelpful","R1HZX54UGG3ONF","A3U0MUSTS8U9JR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U0MUSTS8U9JR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is designed nicely and I love that is easy on/off dress.Issues:  Notice the sleeves are full length, not 2/3, see my photos.

I am not OCD about, too much treble or not enough bass. I am more about how the song and sound make me feel, so my review is based on how I perceive this Bluetooth speaker to be. I have been utilizing it for about 2 weeks now and it is MINE. Meaning it is either on my desk playing my music and being used as a speaker phone or it is taken to the restroom with me while I shower. Now my bathroom is not large, but the sound this speaker puts out fills this room quite nicely. The size is so small I am very impressed at the volume and clarity that comes out of it, especially at this affordable price.

"AnpressÂ® 2 pcs battery powered Audio Doorphone Intercom TL-109AC/DC Doorbell Set Villa Non-visual Intercom two-way radio telephone Security System doorbellI have a daughter who has epilepsy and sometimes she gets an aura and needs me ASAP, so receiving these was a wonderful comfort.  The possibly of her being able to alert me with just picking up the receiver and hitting a button, sets my mind at ease.  Now keep in mind that it does not come with the wires, but you will need to hardwire these in order for them to work.  Also, they each need 4 AA batteries, that do not come in the box.

"AnpressÂ® 7 Color Lights Flash + Music Doorbell, Wireless Doorbell, The Deaf/Hard of Hearing Favorite, Music Can Be ChangedI set this doorbell up to allow my mail lady to ring me when she makes her delivery and she left a note how much she loved it using it!  I simply placed it inside my PLASTIC mailbox to allow her to just open the door and hit the button.  Now the inside unit (receiver) can be customized from ring tones to allow color display to volume control.  I like to keep it on just the color display, because it is nice to watch.  My mailbox is a good 40ft from the receiver and I think that is the max it will pick up.  It was difficult to open the outside unit to put its battery in, it is plastic and I did not want to break anything.

When I received these stylish high definition headphones, I automatically let my daughter know. She is my music expert (or at least she thinks she is... (me and my husband tested the headphones to confirm, after her week of testing).Inside the box is: a manual, that really just tells you what is in the box and about the in-line operations.  Also, they included a hard, zipper case and the FLAT, 3.5mm jack input cable, notice it has the in-line controls and mic.  She plugged them into her iPad (and we connected to our Galaxy S5) for testing. All 3 of us agree that the sound quality is wonderful and the quality of the materials is superb.  Taking phone calls with these is the typical in-line set up and the mic location is nice.  Both sending and receiving calls went smoothly for me and my husband.Overall, these are very sturdy HD headphones that fit us nicely and my husband said they are comfortable on his head also. The band is adjustable, the leather ear covering portion is a normal size and take note that these fold up to make them more compact, but also turn sideways to allow for sharing.  The bass comes through strong and the amount of treble balances out very nicely. These are very nice quality $50 headphones, I would recommend them (and so would my daughter and my husband).I am not a professional photographer or a professional of the product I am reviewing.

" 0:45 Mins CUH Ultrasonic Toothbrush Built-in Uv Sanitizer High Powered 40,000vpm Deep Clean Cordless and Rechargeable Long Lasting Battery Life 3 Replacement Brush Heads 5 Brushing Modes Waterproof (White & blue)I was very pleased to receive this sonic toothbrush. I just recently had my teeth cleaned and the dentist suggested I purchase and use a very expensive electric toothbrush, but who truly has the extra money for those?  So receiving this affordable toothbrush to try was exciting.  So, I have been using this toothbrush for a couple weeks now and I have to say my gums are not bleeding  and I feel like my teeth are cleaner.  Plus, I love the fact that my toothbrush does not have the germs anymore.  Now it has a 2 minute timer, which assists with insuring you brush for the recommended time.  The materials used to build this sonic toothbrush are nice, especially for the price.  I do not think this would be a replacement for the highly expensive version, but it is nice for the price.  I wish the head of the brush was larger.I am not a professional photographer or a professional of the product I am reviewing.

"This is a beautiful bracelet!  It has a lovely design:  a square with a gem, a link, a square with a gem, a link etc. This adds up to an elegant looking bracelet. The bracelet I got has a purple gem in it - it is a beautiful color that really stands out. This is the type of bracelet that can be worn both casually (with jeans and a T-shirt) and for dress-up (at the office, theater, dinner etc.) At seven inches, the bracelet is a tad big for my thin wrist, but it doesn't slide around on my arm as much as I thought it would.

"The older I get, the more I have aches and pains even though I exercise on a regular basis. I am on the computer all day long at work which means an achy back and shoulders. Because of that, I am willing to try anything that helps work out the kinks, so I was happy to have a chance to use and review this foam roller.I have been very pleased with this foam roller. It is the perfect size - 18"" x 6"" - which not only makes it easy to store but it fits easily into a gym bag. It is thick and sturdy enough that I feel comfortable using it. There is a learning curve to using it - my first attempts were laughable but once I got the hang of it I found it works very well (YouTube has some great videos that will help you get started). I have been using this on my neck which is stiff from being hunched over a computer screen all day, and my back which is messed up from a fall down the stairs many years ago and I am pleased with the results on both. My neck is much less stiff and my back feels much better.I am very happy with this foam roller.I received this product in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351ALIXA1VVG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CC3TUSG#wasThisHelpful","R351ALIXA1VVG4","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Jewelry set contains a necklace, bracelet, and a pair of earrings.  It comes with a small bag to store the set when you are not wearing it.Necklace: when I first opened the package I wasn't sure I liked the necklace.  The design looked a little bit off and the whole necklace looked kind of bland.  But something happened when I put the necklace on - all of a sudden the chain and stone â€œsparkledâ€ and looked outstanding.  The necklace is nicely designed so you can wear it with all kinds of outfits.  This is truly a case where you really have to try it on to appreciate it.Bracelet: this bracelet is gorgeous!  It has a really cute design and the stone in the middle really stands out.  My wrists are small and I was afraid the bracelet wouldn't fit but I was able to use the clasp on an inside link and the bracelet ended up fitting perfectly on my tiny wrist.Earrings: these earrings are also very pretty.  French hook earrings are my favorite because they very easy to put in and take out.  Again, the pink gem in the earrings is what makes these earrings standout.  The earrings are on the big side but not obnoxiously so.  I have short hair and these earrings work very well with my hairstyle.I really love this Jewelry Set.  It is very cute and really dresses up an outfit.  I get more compliments when I wear this set than I do with any other jewelry set I own (several people asked me what the special location was when I first wore them).  I will be wearing this set often.I received this product in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH18EPNBGGRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3YJVZW#wasThisHelpful","RSH18EPNBGGRM","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pure Guardian 120 Hour Ultrasonic Warm and Cool Mist Humidifier has a lot of features. You can choose if you want a cool or warm mist and how much mist you want to come out (low, medium, high - medium is the default setting). You can choose which way the mist goes by moving the spout. The humidifier has a timer so you can have it run for four, eight, or twelve hours. It has a nightlight feature that you can turn on or off to. Finally, there is an indicator that will let you know when it is time to refill the tank.This is a huge humidifier! I am using this in my living room/dining room and it is large enough that it works well in both rooms. Because it is so big, the tank gets quite heavy when you fill it with water. I needed help holding it so beware of that when using it. The humidifier works really well and, despite the size, it is very quiet. I find the medium setting for the mist is just right - low didn't generate enough mist for my liking and high generated way too much mist. The timer feature works well - I like the fact that I can set it for eight hours and it automatically shuts off after I've used it all night. The tank is surprisingly easy to clean and even comes with a cleaning brush. While the product description says the humidifier is factory reconditioned, the only hint of that I saw of that was in the instruction manual which was photocopied. Other than that, the humidifier looks and runs like it is brand-new.I really like the Pure Guardian 120 Hour Ultrasonic Warm and Cool Mist Humidifier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6296JX3Y873C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6BX2#wasThisHelpful","R6296JX3Y873C","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Solar Motion Sensor Light is waterproof and rechargeable. It has a function switch that offers you four choices: off; a) the solar light turns on automatically at night; b) the light is always on but strongest when people go through the light sensing area and turns dim when they leave the area; and (c) human body induction function - the light is strong when people go through the light sensing area and turns off when people leave the area. It takes about six hours for the Motion Sensor Light to charge.Even before using this Solar Motion Sensor Light I was impressed by the packaging. Besides the light, it comes with a full-sized screwdriver (never had that happen before) as well as a drilling location map so you know exactly where to place the screws to hang the light (again, never had that happen before.)After charging and using the light, I am even more impressed.  I put this outside my front door - before I did that I used to leave the porch light on when I went out at night - I love the fact that this is saving me money on my electric bill. Thanks to the drilling location map, it was very easy to hang the light. I am using it on setting â€œcâ€ - the light turns on when I am in the area and shuts off when I leave. I am very happy with how well that works (you do have to unscrew the cover to change the settings which means you have to take down the light each time you want to change the settings - I wish the switch was easier to reach). The light is very bright and I have no problem seeing the keyhole so I can easily unlock the door. The light lasts long enough for me to unlock the door and get safely inside my house. The light recharges quite well, even in the fall when the daylight is short and scarce.I'm very pleased with this Solar Motion Sensor Light.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJXXB32AASPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0177FWR6A#wasThisHelpful","RJJXXB32AASPM","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Rechargeable LED Lantern has three light settings: low, strong, SOS. It has an external battery pack so you can charge your phone, MP3 player, tablet, and other devices. The lantern has a magnetic base and comes with a hook for easy hanging.I have to admit that when I first received this lantern I was surprised at how small it is and thought for sure it wouldn't work effectively. To my surprise and delight it works really well. Even at the lowest setting, the light is quite bright and lights up a lot of space. I am not using this lantern for camping but to keep in case we lose power (which happens quite a bit in my neighborhood) so I will not only have light but a battery pack to charge my phone when the power does go out. I tested the battery charger on my cell phone and it did a good job. While it comes with a magnetic base it doesnâ€™t stick all that well, but the attached handle comes in quite handy.I am very pleased with this Rechargeable LED Lantern. Besides using it for camping, you can use it during a power outage, keep it in your car to have in case of an emergency,  keep it in a closet to use to search for items, and many more ways.

"Librarian Lindsey Norris loves her job at Briar Creek Public Library and cares about everyone who comes in there. Part of her job involves delivering books to people who can't make it to the library, including eccentric brothers Stewart and Peter Rosen. Much to her dismay, on one of her trips she find Peter Rosen dead - shot in the chest - and Stewart Rosen is nowhere to be found. Stewart seems the most likely suspect, but Lindsey isn't convinced and she, along with her friends, tries to clear his name.â€œA Likely Storyâ€ is the nicely done sixth book in Jenn McKinlay's Library Lovers cozy mystery series. I love the library setting and the cast of characters in this series, including Lindsey, Sully, Beth (I love Bethâ€™s storyline in this book), Charlene, Mary, Violet, Milton, Robbie, even Ms. Cole. The mystery is well plotted (McKinlay does an excellent job of describing the Rosen's booby-trapped house) with just the right amount of suspense and more than a few twists , so even though I thought I had the killer figured out I was completely surprised at events that happened towards the end of the book. The one thing I don't like about this book (and series) is the ongoing Lindsey/Sully/Robbie love triangle. While there are some nice humorous bits between the two men, I find the love triangle to be distracting - often taking me away from the mystery. I wish Lindsey would pick one or the other and get this ongoing storyline over with.Besides the main novel, â€œA Likely Storyâ€ contains a reader's guide to Josephine Teyâ€™s â€œThe Daughter of Timeâ€, a craft project, recipes, and a cute short story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LICL830JXRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026IS#wasThisHelpful","R24LICL830JXRC","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This AGPTEK Cable Sleeve is 59 inches long and 5.3 inches wide.  It has Velcro on the sides to form it into a tube to hold your cable wires.  It is reversible so you can use either the black side or white side - whichever side you like best.I love this cable sleeve!  Since it is so long I was able to cut it in half and use it in two rooms.  I am using part of the sleeve in my living room to hold my cable wires, the wires from my Wii, and my home theater wires - before I got the sleeve the wires were a tangled web behind my TV, now they are neatly stored away and actually make my room look nicer.  I am using the rest of the cable sleeve in my bedroom where I have a second TV, cable box, and DVD player.  Again it makes the room look so much neater!

"I am on the computer all day long at work and consequently my right wrist (my dominant hand) has really been bothering me - to the point that simply trying to twist the cap off a tube of toothpaste can be very painful.  Because of that, I jumped at the chance to use and review Aegend Breathable Adjustable Sports Neoprene Hand Wrist Support.For the most part I have been very happy with the Aegend Breathable Adjustable Sports Neoprene Hand Wrist Support.  It is very easy to use -simply stick your thumb into the hole provided and wrap the wrist support around your wrist (you can use this on either wrist).  It works well - I notice no pain when wearing it and notice pain when I don't wear it.  It is lightweight which makes it perfect to carry around in my pocketbook, pocket, or bag so I always have it nearby when I need it.  Because it is lightweight, I barely even notice it, even when I am typing or writing.  My one issue with this wrist support is that the material around the thumb hole is a bit flimsy and tends to slip a bit while I am wearing it, but that doesn't affect my typing or writing so I have gotten used to it.I really like the Aegend Breathable Adjustable Sports Neoprene Hand Wrist Support.I received this product for free in exchange for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8IQW2VGKHO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CZ2U6S#wasThisHelpful","R3K8IQW2VGKHO8","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Panasonic ES-RT97-S Men's Electric Shaver and Trimmer with Cleaning System has a three blade cutting system with 30 degree blades. It is a wet/dry shaver so you can use it while taking a shower if you like. It has a built-in rechargeable battery, a trimmer combing attachment for your beard, and a protective cap on the razor. The razor comes with a self-cleaning charging terminal and detergent (you can also charge the razor without cleaning it).The man who lives in my house has long wanted this razor but lacked the money to buy it so he was happy to have a chance to use this. He is thrilled with it! The razor gives him a nice clean shave without any irritation (he doesn't have a beard so can't try out the trimmer). He usually prefers manual razors because he thinks they give him a closer shave but was very pleased with the results after shaving with this razor. The razor comes fully charged and a full charge will last for approximately eighteen shaves (three minutes each shave). When you need to charge the razor it takes about an hour to recharge (the charge status light turns off when it is done charging). It is very easy to clean which is nice since it gets quite messy by the time he is done shaving.This is a nice razor and will get much use in my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXGQ49VQRL7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","RGXGQ49VQRL7D","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iHealth HS6 Core Body Analysis Scale does a number of things. It not only gives you your weight, it measures your body composition index, room temperature and humidity, calculates your fat, lean mass, muscle bone mass, water, and visceral fat rate. This scale uses Wi-Fi technology and using the iHealth My Vitals App you can measure your calorie intake and set goals for yourself. The scale stores data for up to ten people.I picked this scale because I was intrigued at all it can do but in the end I think I am better off with a plain old regular scale (do I really need a scale that tells me room temperature and humidity? No.). It took two of us a day and a half to get the scale working - setting up the Wi-Fi technology was frustrating. We have two cell phones and three tablets and could only get the app working on one phone. Once I did get the app activated I found it very hard to navigate and there was nothing on the app that I couldn't find someplace else. Measuring our weight was also frustrating until we figured out the scale will not work on carpeted floors - once we realized that, the scale worked somewhat okay. My weight was accurate but a family member weighed himself after a doctorâ€™s appointment and there was a four pound difference between what this scale said and what the doctorâ€™s scale said. Finally, I have no room on my bathroom floor to keep this and the scale is heavy which means it isn't the easiest thing to pull out when I need it.Some people may like this scale but it has more features than I need.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUD10NZAACFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2N86JI#wasThisHelpful","R3OUD10NZAACFA","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anâ€™gel and Dickce Ducote, along with their ward Benjy, their dog Peanut, and their cat Endora travel to Louisiana for a wedding and what they hope will be a pleasant visit with relatives.  Their hopes are quickly dashed, however ,by the amount of tension among their relatives.  As unsettling as that is, nothing prepares them for the murder of the bride-to-be.  Her death won't be the first one and soon Anâ€™gel and Dickce are once again involved in a murder investigation.â€œDead with the Windâ€ (a great title with a theme that is carried throughout the book) is the nicely done second book in Miranda Jamesâ€™ Southern Ladies cozy mystery series.  (Miranda James is the pen name of author Dean James).  Anâ€™gel and Dickce are great characters - octogenarians who arenâ€™t afraid to speak their mind (especially Anâ€™gel).  Benjy, Peanut, and Endora are also delightful characters with the animals often being better behaved than the humans.  Anâ€™gel and Dickce's relatives are more complicated which makes the mystery harder to solve.  James does a wonderful job with the mystery, planting just enough clothes for the reader to solve the mystery alongside Anâ€™gel and Dickce (I figured out some of the clues; other events in the novel took me by surprise).  This clever plotting and writing, as well as the Gone with the Wind theme throughout the book (I just love the last paragraph!) make this a delightful book to read.â€œDead with the Windâ€ is another great cozy mystery by Miranda James.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9MWTRYGHHD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273059#wasThisHelpful","R3B9MWTRYGHHD7","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the surface, it looks like all Raneh has to worry about is finding a husband.  But Raneh has a secret - she has magic which is forbidden for landowners to have.  She tries to hide it but when the ruler finds out she wants Reyna killed.  Raneh struggles to stay alive but can she do enough?â€œThe Keeper and the Rulershipâ€ is a delightful fantasy for readers of all ages.  Author Emily Martha Sorensen has created a nicely done world in which people freely get to choose their roles â€“ landowner, mathematician, vassal, magician - yet they have to follow strict rules for whatever role they pick. All of this is overseen by a ruler (and to a lesser extent her husband) who likes to collect hairs.  The book has some great concepts â€“ I especially love the author's concept of status (I kept picturing cell phone like bars over people's heads!).  Sorensen has a wonderful way with words not only in creating characterâ€™s first and last names but the food they eat.  While there is certainly a nice amount of tension in the book there is also a great deal of hope in it, mostly due to the actions of Raneh.  She is a great heroine - never acting just for herself but for the good of everyone.  She is one of the best heroines I have seen in a book like this and definitely makes this book worth reading.â€œThe Keeper and the Rulershipâ€ is a nice fantasy novel for readers of all ages.I received this book for free in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMNW76NY3R9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P2OO4K#wasThisHelpful","R3BMNW76NY3R9Q","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mouse I use at work is old, dirty, and it doesn't work all that well, so I have been looking to get a new one.  Trying to get my IT department to issue a new mouse is like pulling teeth so I was happy to have the chance to use and review the Ruban 2.4 G. Wireless Optical Mouse.I have been really pleased with this mouse.  It is my first time using a wireless mouse and I am thrilled with the results - no more wires getting caught up in the papers on in desk!  It is very easy to set up - simply take the USB receiver from the battery compartment and the mouse and insert it into your computer.  Put the batteries into the mouse, turn on the mouse, and you are good to go.  The mouse started working immediately for me and I have been very happy with it.  The only issue I have found is that the mouse tends to freeze up at times but a click of the left mouse button unfreezes it and the more I use the mouse the less it tends to freeze up.  I do shut the mouse off at night to preserve the battery life - the mouse starts working as soon as I turn it back on.I really like the Ruban 2.4 G.

It does an excellent job of removing my nail polish even when I have nail art (including stick on decorations).

"Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder Soft can be used in the morning or at night right before going to bed. It Reduces underarm wetness and is designed to last through the day. It is lightly scented and moisturizes and conditions your skin.When buying a deodorant I am looking for three things: something that will last all day, smells nice without being overwhelming, and won't stain my clothes. Dove Deodorant Clinical Powder does all three things. While the box says the deodorant can be applied before going to bed at night and will last all the next day, I am used to putting deodorant on in the morning ( a habit I have that I can't break although some say it is better to put it on at night) and it has worked fine for me. I have exercised in the hot weather and this deodorant has stood up very well even as I sweat while exercising. The scent is a nice pleasant one - it reminds me of baby powder. Finally, I have lost count of how many times I put on deodorant, put on a shirt, gone to work, and once at work noticed the deodorant hadn't quite dried after I put it on and has stained the bottom of my shirt.

"For the most part, Professor Greg â€œGingerâ€ McConnell is well-liked and well respected. Therefore, his murder shocks the residents of Crozet, Virginia. Like many others, Mary Minor â€œHarryâ€ Haristeen liked Ginger and is upset by his death. Soon she finds herself investigating his murder and once again her prying puts her in very real danger.â€œTail Gaitâ€ is one of the better recent books in Rita Mae Brownâ€™s Mrs. Murphy mystery series. Absent from this book is the preachiness that has infected Brown's later books in the series and this allows readers to sit back and enjoy the mystery without feeling like they are being lectured to. The mystery is well done, although I did figure out towards the end of the killer. Interspersed with the current mystery is a story from the Revolutionary War that eventually ties into the current mystery. Brown does an excellent job with this by not only letting readers know what happened to the people in the older story but adding a nice twist that eventually affects the modern-day mystery. The one thing I didn't like about this book is the absence of many of the characters that have been an important part of the series all along - Boom Boom is only mentioned at the beginning of the book, Harryâ€™s husband Fair is absent for most of the book, and Little Mim and Big Mim aren't even mentioned. And this is the second book in which Harry is referred to as Harriet - what's up with that?A few quirks aside, Tail Gait is another nice mystery by Rita Mae Brown.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XASJDTXK53EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392360#wasThisHelpful","R1XASJDTXK53EG","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to sit outside as much as I can when the weather is nice in the spring, summer, and even the fall.  The problem is, I have no shed and I have very little room to store outdoor furniture inside my house when the winter comes.  Brylane Home Zero Gravity Chair with Canopy and Pillow is just what I am looking for - it is a nice comfortable lounge chair that folds for easy storage.I am very happy with this lounge chair!  I am prone to back, neck, and shoulder pain but haven't noticed any while using this chair (or afterwards for that matter) like I have with other outdoor lounge chairs.  This chair goes from a sitting straight position to reclining to the point where your feet are about level with your head - a perfect position to take a nap. It is very easy to move the chair from position to position and the chair stays firmly in whatever position I select.  I tend to sunburn very easily so the canopy is a must have (I also wear sunscreen and make sure that the chair is in the shade at all times for extra protection).  While the chair comes with an attached pillow, I don't find it all that comfortable so I keep it hanging on the back side of the chair and don't use it.  While the chair is a bit heavy â€“ I wouldn't take this to the beach with me if I had to walk a long distance from my car to the beach - I move it around my yard following the shade with no problem at all.

"While her parents celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary, Nola Mae Harper has returned home to Cays Mill, Georgia to help run the family peach farm.  Nola Mae soon finds out that there are financial issues with the peach farm and wonders if there is anything she can do to help.  However, her family will soon really need her help when a dead body turns up in the peach trees and her brother-in-law is the main suspect.  Nola Mae tries to what she can to clear his name but will it be enough?â€œPeaches and Screamâ€ is the first book in Susan Furlongâ€™s Georgia Peach cozy mystery series and the book is as delightful as the cute title.  Furlong has done a wonderful job in creating Nola Mae, letting little details about her past trickle into the story until readers feel like they know her.  She is an intrepid heroine, reinventing her life more than once, troubled by a secret from her past that caused her to flee Cays Mill, yet willing to return do whatever she can to help her family.  Equally well-done is the portrayal of Nola Maeâ€™s family members - her very pregnant sister Ida, her troubled brother-in-law Hollis, and her brother Ray.  Although I am not overly fond of peaches, I loved reading about the peach farm and the various dishes made with the peaches as well as the general running of the farm. The mystery itself is well plotted with plenty of twists and turns, including a nifty twist towards the end of the book.  Don't be surprised if you think you have figured out who the killer is only to find Furlong has a few tricks up her sleeve -well done!â€œPeaches and Screamâ€ is a great start to what I hope will be a long-running cozy mystery series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQLAE8HVGKUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5DLWSU#wasThisHelpful","R3VQLAE8HVGKUO","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, sometimes I just want something crunchy to eat and decided to try Rhythm Superfoods Kale Chips Cool Ranch. I shared them with family members and I ended up with mixed results as to whether or not people liked them. The chips were all broken up when I got them, so it was very hard to get a good idea of what they tasted like unless I used a spoon to eat them. Once I did get a good sample I thought they were just okay. A bit too earthy and crunchy and not very flavorful for my liking.

"The iHomeset Electric Aromatherapy Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser is very easy to use. Simply add water to the fill line (a small measuring cup is included,) add one or two drops of essential oils, and turn the diffuser on.

The diffuser runs for four to eight hours before it needs refilling.I really like the iHomeset Electric Aromatherapy Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser. I am using it in a spare bedroom where I keep not only my cats litter boxes but my home computer. Because of the litter boxes, the room can get a bit smelly at times no matter how often I clean them which makes it a bit uncomfortable to sit in the room while I am using the computer. This diffuser gives out a light, noticeable but not overwhelming, scent that completely masks the odor from the litter boxes I have been using this on the run three minutes/pause for one minute cycle). This diffuser also has a series of colored lights (blue, red, and green that you can program to cycle with the options of running all three colors, run two colors, run only one color, or not have any colored lights at all. I really like this feature - I find it very soothing, however, I would not use this feature if I were to use this diffuser at night, as it would be distracting and keep me awake. This diffuser is very quiet - you can't hear it running at all. The only thing I don't like about this diffuser are the instructions which can be hard to follow and are a bit odd at times -  I am pretty sure you don't need a bayonet to open the water tank!

The only â€œissueâ€ I have with this is how much room it takes up in the fridge - I end up separating my lunch once I am in work and keeping the nonperishable items in the this bag (which I put under my desk) and transferring the perishable items into a smaller lunch bag so I am not taking up a lot of space in the work refrigerator.The Extreme Pack Cooler Bag with Zip Out Liner is just what I need!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNS2V6IQK4V9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F5IZB2#wasThisHelpful","RZNS2V6IQK4V9","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HP Eco-Efficient Copy Paper is lightweight which means you get more paper in a ream - 625 sheets instead of 500 and the box weighs less. However, lightweight also means thin - at least in the case of this paper - and this paper is very thin. If I hold it up to the light and put my hand behind it I can see my hand right through the paper. However, for the most part the thinness of the paper has not been an issue for me. It works fine in my printer at home - I have had no issues with the paper jamming in the printer. The paper does a good job of printing my documents but I would not advise trying to print two-sided documents. Besides using it in a printer, this paper would also be good for drawing, especially for young children to use. While this paper is fine for the documents I print at home - things like recipes and my grocery list - I certainly wouldn't use it in my office. The paper is too thin to be professional looking.HP E Eco-Efficient Copy Paper isn't perfect but works just fine for home use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB31J8OS0KGB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL06L6C#wasThisHelpful","RB31J8OS0KGB3","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Paper Mate Pencil Pack comes with four mechanical pencils, twelve lead refills, and two eraser refills. Each pencil features a different character from the Avengers.In my spare time I like to do puzzles (crossword puzzles, cryptograms, word search puzzles, acrostics, etc.).  Although I have been solving puzzles for years, I like to use pencils instead of pens when solving them so I can erase any mistakes I make. This can be an issue when I am, for example, at the beach and the lead on my pencil wears down or breaks and I don't have a pencil sharpener with me. These Paper Mate pencils are a perfect solution to that problem. These pencils have plenty of lead and when the lead runs low you just push the eraser and more lead comes down. Lead refills are included and when you run out of lead the pencil is easy to reload. Both the pencil and lead are thicker than other mechanical pencils I have used so, while these pencils are fine for activities like writing and puzzle solving, they might not be suitable for drawing.These Paper Mate Pencils are just what I was looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84YQJS7O17QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJC24G#wasThisHelpful","R84YQJS7O17QC","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Yoga Mat and Hand Towel Set I got from YogaAddict contains a hand towel (15"" x 24"") and a mat sized towel (24"" x 72"").  Both are machine washable and fold up  so they are easy to carry.I have been taking yoga classes at a local recreation center and, while I love the classes and my instructors, I am not so fond of the recreation center.  The floor is dirty and I often feel dirty and grimy after taking a class there.  I can take a shower afterwards but I worry about the dirt and germs on my yoga mat so I was thrilled to be offered a chance to try this Yoga Mat and Hand Towel Set.So far I have been pleased with both.  The Yoga Mat Towel fits perfectly over my yoga mat (there is a pocket in one corner for extra security) and the traction is good - I haven't slid during any yoga poses.  The hand towel does a good job of drying my hands when they start to get sweaty.  The towels wash up easily and come out nice and clean.  With the warmer weather I am taking outdoor yoga classes as well as indoor yoga classes and have been putting the yoga towel underneath my mat to protect it from the grass.  So far it is doing an excellent job!I'm very happy with this Yoga Mat and Hand Towel Set.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1FY5P90L8EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL952RA#wasThisHelpful","R2X1FY5P90L8EB","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The picture for this necklace doesn't do it justice - this is one of the prettiest necklaces I own. It is small, yet delicate. While it is not the most expensive necklace I own, it doesn't look cheap - in fact it looks like it cost much more than it does. The colors on this necklace really shine and stand out. I get several compliments on the necklace every time I wear it. The chain is just the right length - it looks nice with both a top with a high neckline and a top with a lower cut neckline. My one complaint - and the reason I gave this necklace four stars instead of five - is the lobster claw clasp. I have a hard time getting it closed on my own and the male in my house canâ€™t get it closed either as his fingers are too thick. I have been having a co-worker fasten the necklace for me when I wear it. Since that is impractical on a daily basis, I am going to switch out chains so I can wear this necklace without any help.Outside of the lobster claw clasp, I really like this necklace and plan on wearing it on a regular basis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0L24FSZTA4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5VS6IU#wasThisHelpful","RA0L24FSZTA4E","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While she is waiting for the insurance money needed to rebuild her bookstore, Tricia Miles has been volunteering at the Chamber of Commerce. Her work there has brought her even closer to her sister Angelica so Tricia is devastated when she learns that Angelica has been keeping a major secret from her. As upset as she is though, that is nothing compared to how Tricia feels when she stumbles across the body of Pete Rehnquist. Tricia has solved murders before but she doesn't realize this one will cost her dearly and change her life forever.â€œA Fatal Chapterâ€ is the ninth book in Lorna Barrettâ€™s Booktown Cozy Mystery Series and it is one of the best entries in the series. The relationship between Angelica and Tricia has grown throughout the series and it grows even deeper in this book. Angelica has changed much since the first book and we, along with Tricia, continue to learn that Angelica is full of surprises. Booktown (Stoneham, New Hampshire) is one of my favorite cozy mystery locations and I can't wait until Tricia can open her bookstore again. As for the mystery itself, there is little I can say without spoiling the book except to say â€œWowâ€! This book is full of surprises - some happy and some sad (I cried a bit towards the end). I will say that Barrett has tricks up her sleeve that I have never seen another cozy mystery writer pull off - well done. As for what else happens - you'll have to read the book yourself!Long-time readers of the Booktown cozy mysteries will love this book. If you have not read the other books in the series you may not want to read â€œA Fatal Chapterâ€ since it references past events.

They are designed to be stacked on top of each other to save room when storing them.In order to save money, I bring my own lunch into work and consequently I am always looking for storage containers because mine wear out after a while.

The containers hold quite a bit of food and are easy to clean and store when I am done with them. I have been using these containers for a number of things - for example: lasagna, spaghetti, pasta salad, chicken potpie, shepherds pie â€“and they have been perfect for all of those.

"The Super Cat Kitty Condo Starter Kit is made of cardboard and comes with: two condo bases; two condo tops; one condo tube; loop fastener tape (64 pieces); hook fastener tape (eight pieces); and four condo clips. Also included is a play-activated catnip marker. You can put the assembled condo boxes on top of each other or side-by-side with a condo tube connecting them. You can buy more kits to make a city of condos.I would love to buy my two cats a real cat tree but can't afford one at the moment. I thought the Super Cat Kitty Condo Starter Kit would be a good alternative especially because it is made of cardboard and my cats love to sleep in cardboard boxes. So far, however, I had mixed results with this product. It is certainly easy to assemble and you have several ways you can assemble it, including how many windows you want the condo to have. Because it is cardboard, I thought my cats would eventually destroy it with their claws but so far it is still standing. Unfortunately, the reason for that may e because my cats don't seem all that interested in it. One of my cats doesn't use it at all - even though she weighs less than ten pounds the condo is a tight fit for her. My other cat, who weighs about a pound lighter than the first cat, does like to sleep in the condo occasionally. However, that is all she does with it - sleep in it. She doesn't play in it and even if she did there is no way she would fit in the tube connecting the two condos. In fact, I doubt that any cat larger than a kitten would be able to fit in the tube.I like the idea of the Super Cat Kitty Condo Starter Kit but it isn't quite the right fit for my cats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVM2YDPWG4Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEKCEMG#wasThisHelpful","R2VVM2YDPWG4Z7","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first discovered Agatha Christie a long time ago when I was ten or eleven years old. Through the years (more years than I want to admit!) I have read and reread her books to the point where I can often remember who the culprit is. Still, Dame Agatha is a always treasure and, since it had been a few years since I have read her short stories, I eagerly dived into â€œMiss Marple The Complete Short storiesâ€.As I said, I have read Agatha Christieâ€™s works many times, but I still enjoyed rereading these short stories (and wish there were more). I have always gone back-and-forth as to whom I like best, Hercules Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, but I have to admit Miss Marple has a special place in my heart. You just have to love how this sweet, innocent, somewhat flustered little old lady manages to outwit everybody else when it comes to solving mysteries - every single time. For the most part the short stories are very clever although when they are all in one collection you begin recognizing common themes - people do spend a lot of time impersonating other people for example - and one title unfortunately gives away the identity of the killer. Still, there are some nice twists and turns in many of these stories. Some of my favorite stories in this collection are â€œThe Bloodstained Pavementâ€, â€œThe Blue Geraniumâ€, â€œThe Case of the Perfect Maidâ€, â€œTape-Measure Murderâ€, â€œGreenshawâ€™s Follyâ€, and â€œSanctuaryâ€.Through the years, I have read many mysteries by many other authors but Agatha Christie will always be my favorite. She was one of the best at what she did and this collection of short stories is no exception. Well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORKAJFB7NEVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDRWK7Q#wasThisHelpful","R3ORKAJFB7NEVS","A2VZP50FSYD6CO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VZP50FSYD6CO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They can be used separately or together (there are clips included if you want to put them together).These containers may be small but they hold a lot of items. I have a lot of supplies for my fingernails â€“ polish, nail files, cuticle remover, nail art, etc. and I am using one storage container for my nail supplies. They it all fit in nicely in the storage container and I like having my supplies in one location (previously I was keeping most of them in a freezer bag in a drawer inmy nightstand - I love having that drawer space back!). I am using the other storage container to store various office supplies â€“ pens, stamps, Post-it Notes, paperclips, staples, etc. and again, while the container is small, there is more than enough room for everything.

"'''''' 5 STAR REVIEW ''''''Eighteen year old Emily Marcus finds herself face to face with the most gorgeous man she has ever seen. Also she knows he will never see her the way she sees him.Twenty-nine year old Louis Bruel has landed his eyes on this young beautiful girl that he wants to have. How can he get close to her so he can have her the way he wants.Fate had a different story for this two Louis being friends with Emily's brother in law, so when her sister sees how he can't keep his eyes on her she will warned her younger sister about Louis history. However when you now you have found your true love nothing will stop you from being together and that is how this two become one.Love In Rewind is a different kind of love story, first because Louis is older than Emily, but that didn't stop them from making their relationship work.The other thing is how 80's music is a big part of this dialog along Emily and her best friend Sara. If you are a fan of those song you will like this story.Third point is how being so young Emily handles herself in a very respectful matter and is nice to see how a May/Dec relationship between this two will make you fall in love with them. And lets not forget how their intimate moments are so hot and once they finally consummate their relationship it will melt your kindle.I found it lovable and liked the story.

But she still strives to try and be accepted into Gabeâ€™s family.Gabe is trying to make his relationship with Pepper a priority but he soon finds out that he needs to focus on his position at Sea Lab as well. Gabe learns that you canâ€™t always trust people that are close to you. He soon learns that things arenâ€™t always what they seem to be. This comes at the same time an accident threatens to destroy everything.This installment of the Destiny Series really had me on the edge of my seat. Just when you think things will slow down for Pepper and Gabe, more twist and turns appear out of nowhere. Is Pepper and Gabeâ€™s new and fragile relationship strong enough to withstand everything being thrown at them at once? Gabe is truly concerned about his place at Sea Lab and he gets extremely upset when he finds out that Pepper tried to take care of the situation herself instead of letting him handle it.Will they be able to make it through and will Gabe be able to trust her to let him take care of things like this in the future. I have truly enjoyed seeing the growth the characters in this series. With the exception of Pepperâ€™s mother, every person has truly changed from the beginning. This couple has had so many different obstacles to try and overcome, will they be able to survive and come out stronger at the end?

The strong feelings she has for Jackson cannot compete with her need for freedom. However, Hannah is not meant for freedom. Jackson scoops her back to where he thinks she belongs: with him. Can Hannah and Jackson make it work once all their secrets are out in the open? Or will new secrets tear them apart once more?I have to admit I was shocked when Hannah took the opportunity to run from Jackson. At the end of book 2, I really thought she was just going to tell him the truth, before he found out for himself. The chemistry between Hannah and Jackson has such a push and pull, that I honestly had no idea where they would end up.Once the air is cleared, Hannah and Jackson's feelings become much more intense. I didn't think the passion could get any hotter, but boy does it ever!As much as Jackson tells Hannah he is no good for her, she will not give up on him. I am sure we can all relate to that one bad boy that we just cannot get enough of.Lili Valenti has the ability to totally throw you for a loop just when you think you have it all figured out. And I cannot forget the MAJOR cliff hanger this book has dropped on us at the very end. Not in a million years did I ever picture the ending of this book happening!Honestly, I have no idea what is going to happen in book 4, but I cannot wait to see what Lili Valenti has in store for us.

She feels that the only way to protect him is to leave him. O, being the soldier that he is, will never leave a man behind. He loves Des and wants to prove to her how much. It doesnâ€™t matter that him or any of his family members will get hurt in the process, they were brought up to protect their own and that is exactly what O plans to do.I fell in love with O in this serial because you really got a chance to see how passionate he was and the extremes he would go to to protect the woman that he loves. He wasnâ€™t letting his disability get in his way and I really admired that about him. You want O to be happy, he deserves to be happy and you will be rooting for him the whole way.Did I mention that the sex between these two is off the charts?

"**5 STAR SERIAL REVIEW**You canâ€™t always fight what your body is feeling.Des is a 34 year old physical therapist who has been the love em and leave type. After one particularly bad relationship, she doesnâ€™t see the point in settling down. She has her fun for one night and then leaves. All seems to be working well for Des, until she meets Odysseus aka O Kerrigan.We first met O in Trust, Honor, Love when he was injured on a tour overseas and had to get part of his leg amputated. One of the most horrific events of his life turned into a blessing when he laid eyes on Des. O knew there was something between them and that he had to have more.Again, because of a bad relationship, Des has vowed to never date a patient again. That is proven to be rather difficult when the patient is O Kerrigan. As much as she tries to fight it, Des canâ€™t help but be attracted to O. She keeps telling herself it wonâ€™t work but her body is telling her otherwise.I love that Des was an older woman who caught the eye of the young stallion. Being in my thirties it made me feel good that the heroine of the story wasnâ€™t a clumsy, twenty something who just happened to stumble upon a hot man. Des is a strong woman who had her demons and O wanted nothing more than to help her rid her mind of them. Just when we think Des and O might have a future, we find out the reason why Des is so hesitant to let O in.Will Des and O be able to fight past her demons together, or will Des leave O to deal with things on her own?https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9M0LQAA3LGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PHGHSU#wasThisHelpful","RD9M0LQAA3LGY","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are so many books out there now that are told from the maleâ€™s perspective but it is the exact same story using â€œheâ€ instead of â€œsheâ€. Choosing to go a different route, Amy allows her readers to really get to know the man behind the uniform. Who was he before he was a member of the Falcon club, before he met Erica? From the little bit we learned about him in Falling for Him, we know that Jaime had a hard life growing up but we werenâ€™t prepared for how difficult. When I began reading this book I just wanted to jump through the pages and help Jaime and his family any way that I could. Jaime worked to help support his family but it was never enough. After meeting up with a high school buddy Jaime gets more than he bargained for. Trust me, when you meet Javier, you will hate him as much as I did. I want to say that it was Jaimeâ€™s actions that put him in prison, but I canâ€™t. Javier left him no choice and sealed his fate for him.It was interesting to me that this story didnâ€™t have much dialogue in it, only when it was needed. Usually I get sidetracked when a story doesnâ€™t have enough dialogue but Amy kept me interested with her descriptive writing. I felt as if I was a therapist and Jaime was sitting on my couch reliving the last 10+ years of his life.I truly loved everything about this book and I am so happy that Amy decided to give us Jaimeâ€™s story. We know why he wasnâ€™t available when Erica called him at the end of Falling for Him and we can truly appreciate the person that he has become, even after all the struggles he went through. The only thing I am a little upset about is that we donâ€™t learn what happened to Javier. Amy left that open to interpretation and I want to believe that he got what was coming to him.

"***5-STAR REVIEW***At the end of Wrong, we knew that Joe kidnapped Tor as a way to punish and bring down Jude. Joe has a vendetta against Jude and he is determined to use anything and anyone to make him pay. But Joe doesnâ€™t fully understand the extent of Judeâ€™s feelings for Tor and what she has brought to his life. Jude will stop at nothing and no one to bring him down because he knows firsthand what Joe is going to do while he has Tor held prisoner. He just hopes that this doesnâ€™t completely break her, that somehow Tor can survive this without absolutely losing herself.Tor knows that Joe is the worst kind of monster. The things that she must endure would break the strongest of people but she still fights. She fights for her life and for the life she hopes to have with Jude. He is the only thing keeping her going while she is held captive. She knows that Jude will come for her but she is worried that she will just be a shell of the person she became after being with Jude. The person she was before Jude is gone but she is happy with who she is when she is with him. For her, that is what is most important. She knows no one would ever understand and they arenâ€™t meant to get it.This book had me on edge from page one. After reading Wrong, I knew this book would be hard to handle in places but the way L.P. and Stevie wrote this book is absolutely amazing. I know that Jude is supposed to be the â€œbadâ€ guy but I just couldnâ€™t help loving him. Tor completely changed this man for the better but underneath it all he is still bad. But that makes him all the more intriguing. My heart broke for the violent things Tor had to endure but she is truly a survivor. She is so much stronger than even she realizes.After everything that Joe put her through, what Jude and Tor are together never truly changed. She changed and so did he but together they are tragically perfect. Tor described Jude and her beautiful tragedy, her knight in bloodied armor; that is the perfect description of Jude. This book had me feeling so much. Just when you think things are going to slow down and happiness might be right around the corner; these ladies threw some more twists and turns in there that I wasnâ€™t prepared for. This book is dark but you canâ€™t help but want Jude and Tor to find a happily ever after. Well done ladies, five stars isnâ€™t enough for this book.htps://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVR9JVR01SN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0135MRXZY#wasThisHelpful","R2FVR9JVR01SN4","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**5 STAR REVIEW**Conscience is a continuation of Dissident, the story of political figures, Jack and Caroline. Caroline has been taken prisoner and is beaten and tortured beyond what our mind could possibly comprehend, all for information that is believed she has privy to. The hell she goes through is out weighed by the memories she has of her family, her husband Jack and friends. It is those memories, which help get her through the sick sadistic actions of her enemies.The story is done in flashbacks that take us to the past to show us how everything unfolded and how it became to be the America it is now. Thinking that they took all the right measures of sending their girls away and trying to prepare everyone else of what is to come, Jack and Caroline can only pray they did what they could for everyoneâ€™s safety. I know that sometimes flashbacks are a bit tricky, but Cecilia pulls it off flawlessly. It plays out in smooth transitions.The interaction between Ceciliaâ€™s characters play off of each other like a well-written symphony. The villains, hero, heroine and support characters interact in a way that truly bring the book into a full fledge motion picture in your mind. Needless to say, I am completely smitten with Caroline. She is a strong character and a true heroine that takes more than enough for the team.Conscience is still the awesomely written political thriller that Dissident was, however it is much more darker. The mental, physical and sexual abuse/torture that was brought in, depicted just how corrupted, deceitful and under minded the government had become. This book was a rollercoaster of emotions for the reader. If you did not feel exactly what the characters were going through, then you were half reading it. There was no escaping the hurt, pain, pleasure and frustration that was played out on the pages.If you are looking for all the answers in this book, look again. I hate to tell you, it has a bit of a cliffhanger. Politics has never been something I was interested in reading about, but Cecilia has changed that world for me. Conscience is a book that you simply canâ€™t put down. However, if you can manage to pry your eyes from the page, you find yourself breathing hard, sweating and just saying, holy crap! I am eager to read the next installment in The Bellator Saga series.This is one series I canâ€™t get enough of.[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25CEKFCVFE596/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVC88VC#wasThisHelpful","R25CEKFCVFE596","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He has no plans to settle down like his siblings.When James goes to friendâ€™s house to comfort him after a broken ankle, he gets more than what he bargained for. There he meets Remy, a hunk of a man. Only one problem, Remy has a girlfriend. James can't understand why he has such an attraction to this man. He knows Remy feels it too. James does everything he can to avoid Remy, but when the inevitable happens their feelings can't be denied. What's even more amazing is how he's taken with Savine, Remy's girl.Can James be in relationship that he never wanted in the first place? Can he really handle a relationship with both Remy and Savine? Can the narrow minds of the community he lives in just let them be together?This was a great third book for this series, things are really starting to come together for this family and I can't wait to read what happens next! They have found a place in my heart and I can't help but champion them and see the continuation of their stories.This is a first time read for author Natalie Alder and I was very impressed. I think she has a unique style and perspective for families and their shared experiences. Natalie's definitely one to watch for with her new releases and even past books.

It don't matter the age when you love someone since age is just a number.Dave Adams was a respectful and loved man by everyone.

"â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜† 5 STAR REVIEW â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†Twenty-One picks up where Nineteen left off. We are still left with a few questions since we do not know exactly what happened to Jake. Usually when a previous book ends on a cliffhanger, we get our answers right away in the follow-up story, that is not the case for Twenty-One. Ms. Carter makes us work for it, and at times, we think that there is no answers in sight.If I thought E.S. Carterâ€™s debut was great, this one is so much more than that. The writing is beautiful and has a flow that keeps us turning those pages. Her characters, specifically Jake and Emma, go through big changes in this story. In Nineteen we learned about them on their separate paths, but in Twenty-One we see them progress as a couple and work towards that HEA that we feel they deserve. But, true to form, Ms. Carter does not make it easy for these two.I had mixed feelings about Jake in Nineteen, but this book totally changed my opinion about him. Again, the dual POVâ€™s make that possible. I feel for Jake in this book. I want to travel that bumpy road with him and make sure he comes out on top in the end. To me, the fact that Ms. Carter can make us fall in love with her characters the way we do is a true testament to her as an author. Bravo!In Twenty-One, Emma and Jake both have to come to terms with their pastâ€™s in order to have the futureâ€™s that they both desperately deserve. Will that happen for them? Or will we be left with more questions than answers? You will just have to read it and find out.Another wonderful book by a truly talented author. I canâ€™t wait to read more from Ms. Carter and I am patiently waiting the next installment in this fantastic series.https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ET5HB7URNX3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EN5IFW#wasThisHelpful","R3ET5HB7URNX3K","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜† 5 STAR REVIEW â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†Jagger York is the lead singer of a band, who does not have any problems getting girls to jump at the opportunity to spend the night with him. He does one night stands, not committed relationships, and he makes that we'll known.Mali Greyson is a competitive diver who keeps her eye on the prize; the chance to go to the Olympics. She eats, sleeps, breathes diving, which is why she as sheltered as she is.When Mali meets Jagger, everything changes, and not just for her. She has a summer long proposition for Jagger that he just cannot refuse; have her dad listen to his music. The proposition gives Mali and Jagger something they both want, but will they be able to ends things smoothly at the end of the summer?A.D. Justice does it again. I wonder if there is a story she can't write! This novella brings together two people who are total opposites; but you know what they say, opposites attract.I feel like many people will be able to relate to Mali's story, wanting to be something that we aren't. Mali is also a very strong character; she goes for what she wants, but isn't afraid to put her foot down when she feels like she is getting played.What I enjoyed most, is that even though Jagger had the better end of this proposition, he didn't let it stop him from being honest with himself about Mali. It proves that if you find the right person, things you might have wanted at one point, don't always stay that way.If you want a quick, hot read, I highly recommend this novella. A.D Justice can do no wrong in my book!https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11L8VUW6JZCDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OTOGWO#wasThisHelpful","R11L8VUW6JZCDN","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜† 5 STAR REVIEW â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†â™¡â˜†Emma is an average 19 year old, who is ready to make some changes as her teen years come to an end. I felt for her. Being the only girl in a family of boys, her wardrobe reflects that. It doesnâ€™t help that her mother is constantly putting her down and telling her she should be more like her BFF Liv. Thankfully, Emmaâ€™s relationship with her father makes up for the lack of relationship she has with her mother.Jake is an aspiring actor, bad boy, manwhore. There isnâ€™t a night that goes by where Jake isnâ€™t alone in his bed. Although his BFF Harry has settled down, Jake doesnâ€™t see that happening for him anytime soon. That is until he meets Scarlett, aka Emma. With just one look Jake is captivated and isnâ€™t sure what it is that he is feeling.This was one of the best debut novels that I have read in a while. The characters feel real and the dialogue between them flowed nicely. I love that the author took her time to build up the relationship between Emma and Jake. Even though there was an instant attraction between them, she didnâ€™t have them jumping into bed right away. After their first encounter, we are left to wonder if Jake will go back to old ways of bedding anything that walks, or if he and Emma will get a second chance to finish what they started on the dance floor.I love that this book had a dual POV. It allows us to understand the characters when they are on their own and together. Emma was my favorite character and I wanted to leap onto the pages and give her a big hug. She didnâ€™t realize her true potential, but I guess having a mother like hers made it hard for her to believe that. Also, having a best friend as beautiful as Liv, would make any girl feel unconscious. But, eventually, Emma comes to realize that she is beautiful both inside and out. Then you have Jake, what can we say about Jake? Sure he is hot, but there are going to be plenty of times in this book that you are going to want to slap him and others that you are going to want to hug him. Whether you love him or hate him, Jake truly is a great character and the ying to Emmaâ€™s yang.I couldnâ€™t get through this book fast enough I needed to know what was going to happen. Unfortunately we are left with a cliffhanger that leaves you feeling like your heart was ripped out of your chest. Thankfully I had the 2nd book already and was able to start it ASAP.An amazing debut by an extremely talented author. I will definitely be reading more from this author in the future.https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYGAD7XRK2J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLGVHDU#wasThisHelpful","R1OYGAD7XRK2J9","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*5 Star Review*Antoine Chevalier is different than the people around him. He has a secret that no ordinary person can possibly know. One night his world is turned upside down. Is it possible for him to come out of this struggle with the little that is left of his humanity? Will all his hopes and dreams be just a thing of the past?If you ever wondered who Antoine was before his life at the Les Beaux Arts at the Chateau DeRoche, this will fill in all the missing pieces. It is a short story that goes through history before Antoine was turned into his Vampire/Gargoyle hybrid.Lisa Carlisle does a fabulous job going through parts of Antoine's life that were never discussed in previous stories. Through Darkness Rising, we learn why Antoine is the compassionate person that he is, and we learned what made him that way.I loved the struggle for Antoine after he first was turned into a Vampire/Gargoyle hybrid. He could have turned and became a monster, yet, he was able to keep as much of his humanity as he could. That is what makes him so loveable throughout this series.If you want to learn about Antoine's past, I highly recommend this short story.

"âœ°âœ°âœ° 5 STAR REVIEW âœ°âœ°âœ°Diana thought this was her second chance with Leo, but boy was she wrong. She has been betrayed once before, but nothing hurts as much as being betrayed a second time. Her first instinct is to run; far away from Leo and all the heartbreak that comes with him. Little did she know that running would send her into the arms of Angelo; he's caring, and sexy. Could he be a solution to all Diana's problems, or will he just add fuel to the fire?Book 2 allows Diana the opportunity to start over; again. While it is not what she wanted in the beginning, her date with Angelo proves to be exactly what she needs to take her mind off Leo.At first, I was a little surprised with how easily Diana was falling for Angelo; then I began to understand how it happened. He is an extremely caring person, who only wants Diana to be happy, even if he only just met her.Olivia Rigal could have gone either way with Angelo, yet she chose to make him a character that helps Diana with all that is going on in her life. While at times he is very forward and pushy, it is nice to see a male character tell it like it is. Her relationship with Angelo is pure and sensual.Things between them move FAST, and that doesn't stop when Olivia hits us with an ""OH MY GO"" moment. If you thought Leo coming back was a shock in book 1, wait until you come face to face with the CLIFFHANGER in book 2. When it happened, I felt as lightheaded as Diana did. Thank you Olivia for making me sweat it out until I can read book 3!!Again, this is a novella, but in no way is the story between Angelo and Diana rushed. It is packed with excitement, as well as self discovery. I highly recommend this series and can't wait for book 3!https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEO3Q7PBZ22E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH5CWU6#wasThisHelpful","RPEO3Q7PBZ22E","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"âœ°âœ°âœ° 5 STAR REVIEW âœ°âœ°âœ°Years after her heart was broken, Diana is still trying to piece it back together. With her friends there to help her, she thinks an invite to the most exclusive club in town is just what she needs.Diana's mentality is: new city, new men. That proves to be untrue when someone from her past comes waltzing back into her life. Is it fate? Or is it the worst possible surprise?What I enjoyed most about Lost and Found, is that the main character isn't a size 0; she is a woman that has curves in all the right places. Not only that, but she is proud of who she is. There are so many stories out there of women who are a size 0, when in reality, that's not how most women look.This story was relatable in that aspect, as well as the fact that Diana has a painful past that she just can't seem to shake. Most of us have been there; that one person you just can't stop thinking about no matter how hard you try.While this is a novella, Olivia Rigal has managed to jam pack it with action.This book is not for the faint of heart. The D/s sex scenes are intense, and RED HOT! The chemistry between characters is undeniable.This story is not just about sex, but about love, loss, and hope. I highly recommend this series. The cliffhangers will literally leave you wanting more!!https://www.facebook.com/BooksandBeyondFiftyShades","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X690KTNU29BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHV4H3S#wasThisHelpful","R1X690KTNU29BB","A1LGZR2O6G85X1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LGZR2O6G85X1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally ordered these protein shakes for the mornings when my husband doesn't have time for breakfast...We love the Orgain protein powders so I figured these would be good for quick convenience. We'd give them 4 stars for flavor; these are yummy and we'd order them again if they didn't contain the ingredient Carageenan. If you aren't familiar with it, I'd recommend looking it up.My mistake for ordering in a hurry and assuming it was of the same quality that the other stuff is... Won't buy again or recommend to others. Hope this helps.After reviewing them (in the Vanilla flavor), I received a response as follows:Oct 31, 2015 11:38:59 PM PDTOrgain, Inc. says:Hi Mariam, thank you for your feedback. All of our products are now being produced without carrageenan. Please email us at info@drinkorgain.com for more information.Thanks so much.The Orgain Team...

"How awesome are these GoPicnic meals?! Well you probably already know they're super convenient since they don't need to be refrigerated, can be stacked flat in a drawer or on a shelf, and don't even require utensils!Excellent variety and organic to boot! I won't go on too much with what you can already get from the description or see in my photos.This salami and cheese kind is our first to try and we'll definitely be buying more of these! Great value for under $3 each; you really get a well rounded, 400 calorie, variety of snacks!My three year old nephew had such a blast eating one for lunch! Be warned though, there's a picture of a truck with crackers on top (on the packaging) so of course he immediately wanted to drive his sandwich around on one of his toys, lol!He loved building his sandwiches though and ate every bite of the crackers, cheese, and salami. Amazing and adorable! Much healthier than the popular lunchables kids often request!He wasn't having the cashew pack (too early for him but I was happy to help, ha!) except for what he called the, 'chocolate chips' (yogurt chips). And he refused to try the cookie wafers but again, no problem here!! ; )My husband has delighted in these for lunch and I've clearly loved them too! Great for eating while doing homework or multi-tasking or not.... Great anytime!!Dee~Lish! Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. Only taken after it had been eaten though (mandarins not included from pic with my nephew)! Loved that it even ended with a game under the food. Smile.

"Love these little race cars!! So much fun! I ordered these for my God daughter's birthday goodie bags because of the lower price (not pull back and release), Mini Race Car Party Favors, Assorted 4ct and both the boys and girls loved them!I decided to get these pull back ones for my nephew after reading reviews here and these not being much more money. Every time he comes over I have another little race car for him and he absolutely loves these! (He's three, for reference.)  After five months I've not yet seen any tires pop off any of ours.We were all surprised when we tried out the first one I gave him! They're super fast, especially for being so tiny. He couldn't stop squealing and laughing though because it actually zoomed around in circles! No others have since but the first one and no complaints here because he loved it and for me, that's what counts!Great value! Love that they are individually wrapped, making them perfect for individual gifting! Uploading a couple photos of one recently in use so you can get a better look. Smile.

"I bought these styi (color: Pink/ Purple) back in July, after finding that numerous others didn't work on our Google Nexus 7, 2013 tablet...Previously, I'd purchased multi-packs that were a good value but didn't work on our tablet and, silly me, I'd have much preferred a pretty pink or purple too. Now that I've confessed my frugality and my priorities, lol...This works great on our HTC One M8 cell phones but like some other styli, it's just okay on the tablet. It's not a matter of brushing delicately or applying pressure either, with that device, it's just too annoying to want to use at all.Works great with every other device though. We've tried it with iPhones and Nintendo DS with no issues at all. Very responsive, no issues with drag or pressure, etc.This is a definite favorite because of the fine tip! Everyone knows what it's like dealing with a small phone and big thumbs, lol. This stylus makes it easy to make precise selections on a small screen, without constantly having to first zoom in. Much more efficient, in my opinion, than using a wider tip.I also love the weight of these! Not heavy per say but not as light as plastic. This doesn't feel like using plastic cutlery.The top has a tiny hole making it great for attaching to a lanyard. If you need one handy while working, this is a nice convenience!Love that Bargain Depot includes extra replacement tips! After 4+ months of use, my original tips still work as good as new but nice to have for when needed.Hate that the brand name is boldly listed at the top of these styli. Most seem to be labeled here now (and personal preference) but I don't want my bargain advertised, lol.After a few months of use, I did randomly have one tip fall off (not just the rubber part, see photo). When I finally found the missing part, I superglued it back together and haven't had another issue since.Functionality-wise, five stars, except for with our Nexus (and not many work with it!)! Four stars because they're not dual purpose in also being ink pens! ; ) Didn't knock another star for the fallen tip because I do think these are much better than just an okay rating overall.Another I'd also recommend although it doesn't have a skinny tip (but it works well with both our phones and tablet), gives you 3 for close to the same price currently, and also pretty, haha... Fenix - Pack of Three Purple Universal Stylus Pen with Matchng Purple Soft Rubber Tip for iPhone 4/5/5c/6/6+, iPad/iPad Air/iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5/S6/Edge, Kindle Fire, Surface Pro and Much More One lastly, I'd recommend, another favorite! Sold in a value pack, these are dual purpose, both ink pens as well as styli, unfortunately these also do not work on our tablet... They do work on every other device we've tested though, Stylus pen, F-colorâ„¢ Black Ink 2 in 1 Ultralight Capacitive Stylus and Ballpoint for Touch Screen Devices, iPhone 6 6 Plus 5 5s 5c, iPad, iPod, Android, Orange Green Blue Purple Red, 10 PackStill searching for the perfect (to me, lol) stylus...Â  Smile.

"The kind folks at Roybens provided me with this sleep mask in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...This sleep mask is a personal favorite! I've purchased a bunch of different types for my mom but only personally own one other style, Eye Mask Sleep Mask for Men and Women By Smarter Rest - Sleeping Mask for Night REM Sleep, Travel, Nap, Yoga, Meditation - Reduces Dry Eyes, Puffy Eyes, Apnea, Keeps Cold, Better Than Gel Eye Mask - Silk & Cotton, Memory Foam Ear Plugs, Free Ebook - Satisfaction GuaranteedThis mask is pleasing (like the other) in that the strap is wide enough to be comfortable and has a velcro closure, without any plastic or hard parts to rub the skin or hair.I especially like the thicker memory foam mask on this product! It doesn't feel hot (like memory foam pillows can get) and it's a nice firm foam that stays put, comfortably on my face. This product is made in China and (thankfully!) does not have any noticeable scent.This mask gives me nice coverage and is a perfect fit without it's velcro strap needing to be tightened or loosened from lining right up. On my husband's face, a little light is exposed at the bottom but it's so far below his line of site, he says it doesn't matter.Although this eye mask didn't come with a case, it did come with ear plugs (which I can always use!) and it is my first pick anytime I'm trying to shut my eyes during daylight hours. Since my husband's sleep apnea often keeps me up at night, this is unfortunately pretty often!I'd definitely recommend these to others and will update my review should my opinion on them change. I'd say they make an excellent gift except that the box they arrived in was pretty dented up. I'd toss the box and use a gift bag. (I didn't rate them down for that because I feel they are a 5 star product and the box protected them in shipping just fine.)I'm uploading some photos so you can get a closer look of just how thick these puppies are. You'll have to pick one up to actually feel the goodness for yourself though... Pretty nice! See tag in photo for wash instructions. Smile.

"The folks at Lightspeed NY were kind enough to provide me with this RFID blocking wallet in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...This is a really beautiful leather wallet! The only reason I rated it down a star is because I don't personally care for the logo engraved in the leather (definitely a matter of personal preference).This item is made in China. Delivered as pictured and described. The color is a nice, rich brown. The feel is supple and rich and it has the fresh smell of new leather.Arrived in a nice gift box and would certainly make a nice gift for anyone. It arrives carefully wrapped in tissue, wrapped around each fold of leather.This doesn't feel stiff like some new wallets that feel like they need to be broken in to become flexible.Considering this is RFID protecting, we were surprised that it wasn't thicker than most wallets. We found this to be a good size for practical use.The flap that folds out is a nice feature that my husband especially likes. Convenient for when you need to quickly show your ID and don't need to actually pull it out.We've had this wallet for over a month and would recommend it to others.

"It's okay... I keep buying this because it's convenient and a really good value when an added coupon is running here.My husband uses it when I buy it and I think it looks great but it's not his favorite choice. He'll only use it if there's nothing else, lol.I have thick hair and loads of it. Naturally wavy-curly. (I'm from Afghanistan, for reference.) When I go curly, I scrunch the product in wet and then let it air dry without touching it.I don't care for crunchy curls and this leaves a bit of that, the way I style my hair. I will say it's hold is good and it takes care of any fly aways.My favorite use for this is actually for DIY hair mascara, lol. If you mix a bit of this clear hair gel with a bit of matte eyeshadow that matches your hair color, it works great (with a mascara wand) for root touch-ups. Funny but it works between colors!My favorite product for soft curls is TIGI Curls Rock. More money but worth the soft results, no crunchy hair, and no stickiness. A little goes a long ways too.This Aussie isn't my first recommendation but I'd say it's definitely worth trying considering the price! I'll probably keep buying it between our favorite products, smile.

"The kind folks from Maximum Quality provided me with this travel money belt in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...My husband and I were really impressed with this item! It's zippers and design are similar in quality to one of my Baggalini bags, if that gives you an idea of the design! Super nice look and quality for travel or whatever your use might be!Love the size, flat look, and think it would be durable for travel. Being that I haven't had the pleasure of traveling since receiving this, I'll need to update this review after putting it to real use. We all know when traveling, some things can be worn out quickly.This item is made in China and is true to color as pictured. The gray gives it a nice modern look and I think this would make an excellent gift for anyone who travels. Thr pockets are perfect for many different sized items and are not lacking!It has an adjustable strap to go around the waist that seems well made and as strong as a luggage strap. The fit is wide enough to be supportive while a nice, comfortable fit. For reference, my hips are 38"" and I can wear this low with room to spare.RFID protection is a nice added feature but I haven't tested it for that. I have had these sleeves in use for over a month though. Love that the card holders each have inspiring phrases printed on them! Smile. Shared with my mom and husband. They are thick and seem sturdy for our use. The larger one is for your passport.I think this would have good use even for while laying by the pool. Because it's waterproof, lies flat, and would easily wipe clean, it could easily lay under a beach towel to carry the few necessary items while staying at a hotel, etc.This would also on be perfect for use during a marathon or 3-day walk! Often times, on 60 mile marathons, it's super warm out, so people on the streets are kind enough to be spraying water at us to cool us off... And many of us use our phones for music, etc. This would keep funds and important items dry without the weight or bulge of a fanny pack.For currently under $20, I think this is an excellent value and I'd definitely recommend it to others.

"The folks at Haweel were kind enough to provide me with this  6.8 Amp 4 port Car Charger (in Black) in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...This is my new favorite charger! I've owned quite a few car chargers over the years. This one is not very large at all, especially considering it's a four port charger.With 6.8 Amps of power, this product does not disappoint either! It is designed so you can charge four of your devices simultaneously and at full speed, without taking up a ton of space! If you want fast, you've found it here.It includes all sorts of types of protection so you don't have to stress on this product causing some of the common problems caused by older technology.The blue LED lights up when it's plugged in correctly so you'll never arrive somewhere to a dead device you thought you'd been charging! This is a feature I personally find valuable (and it also helps with locating your charger in a dark car at night)!This item is made in China.

"I haven't tried plain millet before to be able to compare this to another but I didn't personally caare for these Millet Puffs. Ordered it because we love this cereal, Nature's Path Organic Kamut Puffs Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) and this Millet version was such a great value...To us, it tasted a bit like a cross between Styrofoam and cardboard but not quite that bad, lol. If you spill any, these tiny puff balls stick like Styrofoam does,.... Static cling to everywhere, ha! Chewy anyway. I rated these up a star because they are organic, low-cal, and healthy but we wouldn't eat it without either flavored protein powder or some sweetener.12 bags is a lot to order if you haven't tried this before but Subscribe and Save savings make for a great deal and we will mix it with our other puffs for better taste. Wouldn't recommend to others unless you know you like Millet, as I've read many people do. Otherwise, the Kamut Puffs are equally light but have a bit better bite and taste, in our opinion...3 stars, we think this is just okay. Uploading photos, lol so you can get a closer look! Smile.

"The folks at Blooming Jelly were kind enough to provide me with this black, large plus, Women's Long Hollow Out Fashion Top in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...First off, these are not plus size tops so the sizing / description should be updated. For reference, I'm 5'2, 32C bust, and wear a women's size 6, curvy and pear shaped.It arrived as advertised and washes up nicely. It is listed to be a Polyester, Cotton, Microfiber, Spandex blend but has no tags to verify. It is soft with some stretch. I washed it cold, in a lingerie wash bag, and hung dry. Didn't experience any fading, pilling, or shrinking.I was surprised when I opened it because, considering it's low price, I thought it looked nicer than online and would be super flattering! I think on most women, it might be...I ordered it according to the sizing in the product description. I normally wear a women's size Small top and accordingly ordered this in a size Large.The top fit nicely across my upper body (maybe not made for broad shoulders), although a little short in front, ending right where my pants start. It's not at all slim cut below the bust so it's not flattering if you want to show a small waistline. Maybe great on someone with smaller hips but not great on me...It just seemed a bit too wide on the lower half to look good with my shape. If I'd gone a size smaller, it definitely would not have fit around the neckline or arm holes as this one fit snugly in those areas.I rated this 4 stars because it appears to be well made, I love the unique design, and there are no loose seams. I think it'd be super cute with shorts or a little skirt but it's not good (on me) with pants.Adding photos to reflect how it looks solid but is slightly sheer in the light.

"Adorable costume! Got this for my 3 year old nephew in a size Small (4-6). He normally wears a size 4T and can do a 5T as well. He is lean but tall for his age and this fit him perfectly. The hat also fit well and he sported his outfit proudly for Halloween this year.Initially wanted the muscle version of the costume but price and reviews had me go with this one and he just loved it.

"The folks at Infinie were kind enough to provide me with this 3.4 Amp USB Car Charger (in Black) in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...Great charger! I've owned quite a few car chargers over the years. This one is not real big, for a dual port charger.With 3.4 Amps of power, this product does not disappoint either! It has automatic detection so you can charge your smartphone or tablet in either USB port.The only thing that would make this item better, in my opinion, would be making it a three port.

"The folks at Dare Color were kind enough to provide me with this box of six pairs of socks in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...Really nice ankle socks! I split these socks between my dad, who hadn't owned any before, and my husband, who hadn't owned any in these colors. The three of us all agreed that they feel quite nice.These are thick enough to comfortably wear around the house but not be too warm. They fit my husband's size 11 foot comfortably but maybe not for anything larger than that, in my opinion.I rated them down one star simply because I prefer when low cut socks have the plastic gel feel on the inside of the back of the heels, to help them stay up better. (Definitely a matter of personal preference!) Neither my husband nor my dad feel like they have an issue staying up.I machine washed them (not according to the wash instructions, see photo for reference), inside of a lingerie wash bag, and dried flat. Came out beautifully; no immediate fading or shrinkage. Nice, soft socks.Should they not hold up well after more time, I'll be sure to update my review. These are not too thin and I'd recommend them!

"The folks at EveryMarket US were kind enough to provide me with this backpack in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...When I initially ordered this backpack, I'd read a couple of reviews that recommended this bag, per the description, only for light use, maybe like a purse but not for anything heavy...I was quite pleasantly surprised with this bag! In the initial packaging, in all of it's cuteness, I'd have agreed but after over a month of use, I'd say it can handle my college work load!This bag's body feels thin but similar to my JanSport backpack, that doesn't mean it won't hold up! If you are familiar with JanSport, you know that it has a lifetime warranty and is built to last.What I love about this bag most are the padded shoulder straps. They are wide and comfortable. Carrying my notebook, some files, three textbooks, and supplies aren't light. Good straps are important for carrying a heavy workload comfortably.The mesh side pockets easily fit my Glasstic Shatterproof Glass Water Bottle - 16oz - Flip Cap Sports Water Bottle - Purple and have a bit of room to spare. When water bottles are in place though, they take away from the inner space of the body of the bag. It's nice having pockets that allow a decent size bottle standing up though!There are two zipper pockets on the outside that I wish were a bit wider. I use a photo case for supplies and it's just a bit too wide for these but fits fine in the body of the bag. It's from another retailer but similar to this one, IRIS Photo and Craft Case, 5 by 7-Inch Having two zipper pockets instead of one is nice though and they add to the depth of the bag.The body of the bag is another favorite feature for me. It's roomier all around than my JanSport and fits all of my books and files with room to spare. The padded pocket that safely protects an iPad is perfect for my Google Nexus 7 (new gen) tablet, again with room to spare. The added two slip pockets are perfect for a large cell phone like my HTC One M8 and some pens or other items you may need quick access to.The zipper pulls have the leather look and thus far I've not had any problems with the zippers. There are no loose seems and the bag appears to be well made. Should my opinion change later down the road, I'll be sure to update my review but I feel like it'll hold up just fine.Overall, I'd say this is a fantastic backpack that looks even better in person and is large enough for comfortable adult use. Highly recommended! Uploading some photos of the bag in use, so you can get a closer look inside. Smile.

"The folks at SilverCloseOut were kind enough to provide me with this ring in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...This is a beautiful and bold ring, especially for the price!  This piece is stamped as 925 silver and is listed to also have a Rhodium plating which gives it added shine and protection. I've had it for about a month now but because I got this in my daughter's size, I've only personally tried it on.So far it's original shine and color is like new. It did not give me the dreaded green finger upon removal, lol. (My skin usually reacts to pieces that are not gold or silver so I'm guessing the silver and coating are the real deal.)Details are beautifully made, as pictured, while larger than I'd expected (sizing is correct, the look is larger than expected). Definitely a statement piece! I managed a jewelry store years ago and of course still have an eye for jewelry.Since my hands are so small (size 4.25 wedding ring), I ordered this one in a size 9 for my daughter who has larger hands and often wears bigger pieces. I love chunky bracelets but prefer rings that sit less tall or large since they can look funny on me. Definitely a matter of preference!This style ring isn't one that I'd be comfortable wearing at a desk without fear of knocking the CZ stones around. Maybe better for someone who works less with their hands, (is less clumsy than myself, lol) or for wearing when out on the town.The cut of the stones give it a simple look and the swirling height make it especially unique! I think it's versatile enough to tastefully mix with other non matching pieces if so desired.Delivered in a small jewelry box that would be nice for gift giving. Would make a really nice inexpensive gift. Excellent value for the current price!Should my opinion on this product change after my daughter gets more use out of it, I'll be sure to update my review.

"I was stoked to find this tee for under $20 on a lightning deal... Love this shirt! It is 100% cotton and is tagged as and appears to be true NFL Fan Gear.It's not too tight and I love the length, not too short! Not boxy either. I ordered a Medium (although I usually wear a Women's Small top) because I wanted to be able to comfortably wear a long sleeve tee underneath. This works well for me with or without the added tee underneath. I think the small would've fit like a glove.For reference, I'm 5'2, 32C bust, and wear a size 6, curvy and pear shaped. It arrived as advertised, a nice navy blue, and washes up nicely. (We washed as instructed, in a lingerie wash bag, but hung dry.) Since it's 100% cotton, I won't throw it in the dryer, to prevent any shrinkage.I rated this 4 stars because it is listed to be made in the USA but the shirt and tag say it is made in Nicaragua.

"The folks at Infinie were kind enough to provide me with this 2.4 Amp USB Car Charger (in White) in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...Great charger! I've owned quite a few car chargers over the years and of all of them, this one is by far the smallest, at just 1"" by 1.8"" in size.

"I absolutely love this long-sleeve tee! I really think it's a five star shirt, especially for the price! I rated it down a star because the heather white (although quite pretty!) is really more of a light heather grey, in my opinion. Darker than what is pictured online anyway.I ordered it to go under a short sleeved tee so I ordered it in a Small which is my usual size. It's perfect for the purpose I bought it for but when I buy another to wear alone, I'll order a Medium for a looser fit. This one fits like a glove.For reference, I'm 5'2, 32C bust, pear-shaped, and a curvy size 6. Love the scoop neck, sleeve length, and overall length is all as pictured on the model. I think for under $10 this is a great basic staple for any woman's closet!I washed it per the wash instructions prior to wearing, in a lingerie wash bag, and hung dry.

"The kind folks at Immortalitea provided me with this tea cup with strainer and lid in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...You really can't go wrong with this tea glass! Perfect gift for tea drinkers, coffee drinkers, or anyone who likes to infuse their drinks. Arrived as pictured and described and the box it comes in is good for gifting it in.We own some Bodum glasses that we love and are similar to this one, in that they're also double wall, hand blown, borosilicate glass. We have broken one of our Bodum ones before, slipped out of hand into a stainless steel sink. This glass feels slightly heavier and less delicate.What's great about this type of glass is that it's comfortable to hold; no cold hands or condensation with ice cold drinks, and no hot hands with hot drinks! Always a conversation piece when handed to a guest (who's scared to grab a hot cup without a handle) and then surprised it's cool to the touch.We only hand wash these because they are generally pricey and, in our opinion, just worth the extra effort. I'll update this review should we have any parts break on us.Brilliantly designed and very innovative! The lid can be used to keep your tea hot and then to put your tea bag in after it's steeped. The glass can be used with or without the infusing glass inside which makes it really versatile.Would recommend to others and feel that, at the current pricing, it is an excellent value.

It doesn't sit too high so I'd be comfortable wearing it at a desk without fear of knocking the CZ stones around.I ordered this in a size 6 to wear on my middle finger and it fits true to size. I originally had hoped to get it in rose gold (because the snowflake isn't really me and I thought it might look less seasonal in the rose) but even in silver, it doesn't just say snowflake to me. I think it's versatile enough to tastefully mix with other non matching pieces if so desired.Delivered in a small velvet jewelry bag that is thick enough to use for travel. Would make a nice inexpensive gift. I already know my God daughter will be asking to wear it, lol because of her love for the Frozen movie.

Training for and participating in those, I wore compression socks that covered from my ankels to my calves and the tightness felt very similar to these. They kept me from getting too much swelling and helped keep my muscles warm to prevent injuries. So I know how valuable these things can be.What I've been most appreciative for since receiving these is how they keep my feet warm. Being that they're made in China and don't have any wash instructions, I hesitated to try them on but wanted to make sure they fit so I went ahead. They felt so good on, these are definitely keepers!I wear a size 7.5 shoe and ordered them in a Medium according to the sizing info in the product description. I'll wash them like my other compression socks, cold wash (in a lingerie wash bag) and hang dry.My toes are still cold, lol but the compression over the top of my foot, under my arches, and around my ankles does bring the blood up and feel nice and warm. After an hour or so wearing these, my feet feel wonderful and I take them off.I've always thought I might be a bit anemic but tests say my iron levels are normal. My whole body can be warm but my feet still freezing so I know my husband will be happy if these continue to help with that, lol. Definitely better than a thick pair of socks because of the compression but it would be nice if they came out with some that cover the toes too. Smile.Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. I'll be recommending these to everyone I know with foot problems or general foot pain. At their current pricing I feel these are an excellent value. Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFD89WHQL81K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IYF1M8#wasThisHelpful","R2WFD89WHQL81K","A1W511P7B2QSQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W511P7B2QSQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The folks at Nonda were kind enough to provide me with an iHere at a discount in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...This product is such a great idea and I can hardly wait for the Android version to come out!! Being that I'm not an iPhone owner, I tested this product out with my cousin's 5S. After about 6 weeks of use, he's gotten a pretty good feel for the product.For him, the distance is too limited. That would obviously be a matter of personal preference but of course, if it went further, would be more convenient. Second, it really needs some type of lock function. Because the button is not deeply recessed, it is easily pressed in his pocket, causing it to often randomly go off.Hopefully iHere is already working these bugs out for their next models to come! Brilliant idea and a small price to pay for the benefits it provides! The charge time is good and when you need it, it is reliable for what it claims. Excellent gift for the forgetful or the lost!

"The folks at Mokale were kind enough to provide me with these spray bottles at a discount in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...I received this product as pictured and described but still have yet to figure out just how I plan to use them. I mix my own essential oils but typically use dark colored glass bottles. My understanding is that the oils are better protected when kept out of light and tend to leach chemicals from plastic.These are listed as UV protected but I think I would still prefer to keep my oils in glass bottles only. I do like the size of these 30 ML bottles though and I'm sure I will find good use for them before long. It might just be to spray water in my hair when styling, lol, or vinegar before laundering some darks, etc. LolI think the price point is currently a bit high for these but am not rating them down based oon price.

"I originally learned about DampRid while in Property Management. I was living on a lake in a townhouse where my master bedroom and bath were in a loft...Although we were careful to use both our bathroom fan and heat lamp (fan pushes air out, while heat lamp dries the moisture in the air going out, so you aren't left with moisture build-up in your vents) whenever we showered, we still occasionally got some mildew on our bathroom ceiling.According to the health department, mildew or mold usually comes from how we live.  I opened windows whenever I cleaned and we lived pretty cleanly. The loft style apartments apparently made it harder to avoid since heat rises from the lower level and our being on the lake.After using bleach to kill off the mildew (1 part bleach and 2 parts water in a spray bottle is effective), using mildew resistant primer, and repainting (two times, months apart), the mildew still came back after some time...My maintenance supervisor finally mentioned DampRid and of course, for just a few bucks, if it helped at all, I was open to try it! I bought it from a local store before finding this two pack available here. I put one in my walk-in closet after reading more about it and one under our bathroom sink. We opened the cabinet door during showers and shockingly never had another mildew problem!It was probably a month before one began to liquify. The salts first start to harden and become one slab of hard goo, for lack of better words, lol. It takes a while before it all liquifies, maybe two plus months but it is effective. Since then, I keep one in each bathroom, one in a linen closet, another in a closet for shoes, and one in our bedroom closet. I only use the fragrance free one but haven't tried any others.Another recommendation by this brand that I also buy here on Amazon (which is scented), DampRid FG69LV Odor Genie, Lavender Vanilla It doesn't eliminate moisture quite like this but does make for a nice air freshener if you don't like anything that smells too strong. It is charcoal based and also available in other scents.If you've got a stale smelling basement or garage, a trick I learned that works well is to cut an onion in half and leave it on a dish there for a couple days. The cut onion will have absorbed all of the funky smell, it won't leave behind an onion smell, lol, and then you can toss the onion.  Or if you're brave and desperately hungry, you could eat it but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look at how these appear at purchase vs after they've been liquifying (the last photo you can see the water level of one that's almost done).

"The folks from Aisxle were kind enough to provide me with this makeup brush set at a discount in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...Great makeup brush set for travel! I was a beauty consultant for over 10 years and used to manage a cosmetic department. These are not the best high end brushes I've experienced but they are nicer than the usual brushes at this price point.Good variety for different applications and nice soft feeling brushes. No excessive shedding of brush hairs when in use. Container is convenient for travel and for keeping them from being exposed to everything else in your makeup bag.Key to washing them, aside from washing gently (with good brush care product or small amount of natural soap and rinse well) is to air dry them on their side. You want the bristles hanging over the counter edge over night. Never dry them standing up because moisture getting into the handles (where the bristles are attached) causes the hairs to fall out.Nice set for the price!

"The folks at Luseta Beauty were kind enough to provide me with this shampoo and conditioner in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...Great shaampoo and conditioner with some good natural ingredients! Smell of the tea tree and peppermint in the shampoo smells like eucalyptus and is quite invigorating to the senses! Conditioner's peppermint is strong enough to clear up my sinuses if sick, lol. Very refreshing and awakening. The lavender is overpowered in my opinion, so I would stick to using this in the mornings vs nights but definitely a matter of personal preference!I only like to use sulfate free haircare because I have thick hair and loads of it; I don't need any added build-up just for better lather. This shampoo provides a nice lather though and you don't have to use a whole lot of it.I only use paraben free products (hand wash, face care, hair care, deodorant, body products, and makeup!) because breast cancer is on both sides of my family and parabens are found in tumors. If you're unfamiliar with them, they're usually towards the end of ingredient lists, like: methylparaben, propylparaben, etc. They are preservatives that make products have a longer shelf life, like 7 years, great for manufacturers but not for me because they are also hormone disruptors! They're actually illegal in many other countries but unfortunately not yet here. Many manufacturers are finally getting with it and removing them, thank goodness!! Off my soapbox, lol. These products are paraben free.My hair is left feeling the same as always after using these products (which is a good thing because I typically use similar good products). My only negative and hense my removing a star, is that the 2nd ingredient in the conditioner, after water, is cetearyl alcohol. Doesn't say a lot for how moisturizing it is when those are the top two ingredients! I will say though, it did not leave my hair feeling dull or dry.Overall, I'd recommend these products and feel they are a good value for the price.

"My 10-year-old daughter saw this online and had to have it. She was checking the mail for it daily and was very excited when it arrived. The pendant is significantly larger than we expected: the ""stone"" (which is a hard resin) is about 1.8 inches wide and 2.5 inches from top to bottom, including the setting. Unfortunately the quality of materials and workmanship is fairly low - the thin copper links at the back of the chain break easily and one of the clasps had to be re-glued as soon as we got it. When I contacted the seller, they asked for a picture of the item and did issue a full refund.Overall, my daughter likes wearing this necklace - and it's inexpensive enough that we didn't expect perfection. But it's really not of the highest quality so we're not expecting it to last too long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDL3R4G6OCDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VECG48K#wasThisHelpful","RZDL3R4G6OCDF","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked these up at a local ACE Hardware store to match the Merry Garden folding Adirondack chairs and they match up perfectly (see picture). I believe the wood is Cunninghamia lanceolata, a.k.a. ""Chinese fir"" and I confirmed this with the company. It looks like pine but is a bit harder and it smells a bit like cedar, though not as aromatic. This type of wood is naturally rot-resistant, but if you're using these outside or in humid conditions, it's a good idea to paint them with outdoor paint or treat them with an oil or outdoor varnish. I used a Pecan colored stain and then three coats of MinWax spar urethane. I found it easier to stain and varnish the wood before assembly so I could get into all the nooks and crannies. Also, I hung the slats on a cord in my shed (through the screw holes) so I could varnish both sides of each slat at the same time and just let them dry on the cord between coats.In terms of the quality, they're quite good for the price. There was some wood filler on a few of the slats, which is annoying as the filler does not absorb stain the same way as the wood. But I use an artist's brush to paint stain onto the spots with filler in them so they're not too objectionable. Once coated with urethane, the ottomans look pretty good.Assembly is pretty straightforward. There are pilot holes where needed and the tops of the slats have recessed holes so the wood screw will be flush when tightened. I used a power drill set to the lowest torque. Even so, a couple of the screws went deeper into the wood than I would have liked. Ideally I would say use a drill or electric screwdriver with a Philips head bit to get the screws most of the way in, then hand-tighten the last few turns to get the screws tight without going in too deep. Also, I would say it's a good idea to screw on just the bottom and the top slats first with *one* screw on each side (leave one hole open on each side of each slat). Then adjust it by eye (or with a level or T-square) to make sure everything is square and the ottoman sits properly on the ground before you screw in the other two screws on the top and bottom slats. If you just go down the line screwing in each slat one at a time from top to bottom without stepping back to look at the big picture, the ottomans might get skewed to one side and they won't sit properly or mate well with the chair.Overall, these make a nice match with Merry's folding Adirondack chairs and provide a nice-looking and comfortable way to kick back and relax.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKK2C4WBL1AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KM6A86#wasThisHelpful","R2YKK2C4WBL1AV","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up four of these on Woot for use on our dock and beach in the Adirondacks. I also picked up four of the matching ottomans from a local ACE Hardware store. It is important to keep in mind that the wood is raw and unfinished. If you're going to use these outside, you will need to protect them with outdoor paint or some type of varnish or oil treatment. I'd strongly recommend doing at least one coat of the paint, oil or varnish *before* assembling the chairs so you'll be sure to protect all the nooks and crannies of the wood.The chairs are not that difficult to assemble if you follow the detailed instructions. One thing that might be a bit tricky is that each of the 31 pieces of wood has a label on the back with the part number. If you stain or paint the pieces before assembly then you will most likely not be able to see the part numbers any more. Most of the parts are unique enough that you can tell visually which each part is and what direction it goes. Also, the front-facing sides of the slats and other parts have indentations in the screw holes so that the screws will be flush when assembled. This allows you to easily tell the front from the back on most of the parts. However, the top slats that create the backrest do look very similar to each other: specifically, parts C2 and C3, and parts C5 and C6 are nearly identical, except in length. To determine which is which, simply line the pieces up with the screw holes underneath (before screwing the pieces in) and visually check the top of the slats to make sure you get the rounded fan pattern. If you put C3 where C2 is supposed to go (for example), the slat pattern at the top of the chair will be jagged instead of the smooth rounded fan shape.My main beef with the chairs is that the quality of the wood parts is less than ideal. There is fairly extensive use of wood filler in areas where the wood may have been damaged during cutting at the factory. If you paint the parts with an opaque paint, this is not a problem. However if you use a clear varnish or if you use a transparent or translucent wood stain, you will see obvious light spots on the chair because the wood filler used does *not* absorb stain or varnish the same as the raw wood. I used a reasonably dark ""pecan"" stain and I ended up using a small artists' paint brush to paint the stain onto the sections that had wood filler. Once this dried, it was a bit darker than the rest of the stained wood (which I applied and wiped with a staining cloth). I found this to look more natural than just leaving the wood filler sections light. Out of 31 pieces of wood per chair, I'd estimate that 3 or 4 pieces in each set had some type of filler visible in various shapes and sizes. On the final product, it wasn't too objectionable but it is annoying to have to deal with this when you're putting several hours into staining, sanding, varnishing and assembling each chair as I did.I pre-treated the wood with MinWax soft wood treatment to assure that the stain was absorbed by the wood evenly. I then coated each part with Sherwin Williams pecan-colored stain. I followed this up with two coats of MinWax Spar Urethane, then I assembled the chairs and added a final coat of Spar Urethane after assembly (three coats total). Once assembled and varnished, I waited about 24 hours before putting them outside. My family says they look great and are very comfortable (particularly with the matching ottomans). The chairs do fold for easy transportation, but not completely flat. Also, with three coats of varnish, the parts rub against each other when folding and unfolding, which does remove some of the varnish. So I expect I may need to touch that up after a season or two. I'll attach some pictures so you can see how they turned out (and see the wood filler I mentioned). I'll also update this review over time when I see how well they hold up to the elements.By the way, for anyone who is interested, I confirmed with the company that the wood is Cunninghamia lanceolata, a.k.a. ""Chinese fir."" This wood is fairly soft, but harder than pine and has an aroma similar to cedar, though not quite as strong. The wood is naturally rot resistant but I do recommend treating it with a weatherproof coating if you're going to use it outside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R288VIMKOAA6E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044FW4RE#wasThisHelpful","R288VIMKOAA6E8","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a big hit with my 10-year-old daughter. While she likes having the ability to defend herself against her brother (with his 3 Nerf guns), she is even more excited about the special ""Secrets and Spies"" message dart with the secret messages on it that can only be decoded using the included sleeve. The crossbow itself is pretty easy to assemble (she did that herself) and simple to load. It shoots with more force than some of my son's Nerf guns, but not enough to cause any real pain, though the darts do hurt a bit more than the standard Nerf suction cup darts.Due to the enclosed nature of the dart slots and their diameter, the standard suction cup-tipped Nerf darts or velcro-tipped ""Dart Tag"" Nerf darts do NOT fit in this crossbow. You can force them into the slots but the tips are too wide to fit through the barrel. You will need to use the Rebelle darts or N-Strike darts with this crossbow. Even properly loaded with the correct darts, it does occasionally misfire, but in most cases when this happened to us, the barrel did rotate to the next dart slot and the next shot worked fine so this wasn't too disruptive to play.We had a little trouble firing the crossbow at first. I think my daughter set and then forgot her ""secret code."" This three-digit code is set on numbered dials on the stock, just above the trigger. It allows the crossbow owner to prevent unauthorized use of the crossbow by an enemy (e.g. big brother). But discovering and then resetting the code is actually pretty simple. Only the middle of the three number dials needs to be in the correct position in order for the gun to fire. So if the trigger doesn't depress easily, rotate the center dial stopping at each number and trying again. Eventually the trigger will depress and you'll know the code. When it's on the correct number you can then hold in the little purple button above the right-most dial and rotate that center dial to a new code if desired (then release the purple button to set the code).Overall, it's a great little Nerf ""gun"" and my daughter now wants her friends to get some.UPDATE (8/25/15): Lowering from 5 to 4 stars. Three weeks later, my daughter still loves this crossbow but it does fail to fire the dart pretty often, which is annoying. We still don't usually have a problem with darts actually getting jammed (unless they are loaded incorrectly) so we can usually just re-cock it and the next dart fires as expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQBWA0WN5YXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4Q3O#wasThisHelpful","R3PQBWA0WN5YXJ","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A toaster that's this expensive should look great and perform exceptionally well. Well, one out of two ain't bad. The KitchenAid KMT2116CU looks elegant, with a matte metal finish that resists fingerprints and smudges but its performance varies significantly depending on what you put in it. We found that the toaster worked reliably and toasted as expected when using plain white bread, but denser sourdough or whole grain bread from the local farmer's market came out looking virtually untouched at even the darkest setting. Really the KMT2116CU is a mixed bag. Here are our likes and dislikes:Things we like about this toaster:+ Nice looking, sleek design, aesthetically pleasing. The matte finish limits fingerprints and still looks good after two weeks of frequent use.+ 3 LED indicators on the feature buttons are helpful (see photo)+ Cord wraps under the base, limiting cord clutter on the counter top+ ""Lift & See"" feature allows you to check toasting progress and to raise smaller items out of the toaster when they're done without having to stick a fork inside and electrocute yourself.+ Beep that indicates end of toasting cycle is loud enough to hear, but not annoying+ Crumb tray is easy to remove and clean. You won't have to flip the toaster upside down, shake it, and have crumbs fall all over the place.Things we don't like this toaster:- Takes up too much counter space and is not ideal for smaller kitchens. The placement of the controls on the front (with the lever is on the side) means it sits lengthwise. Most toasters have all the controls on the side which allows them to take up less horizontal counter space.- Shade control numbers should be bigger and bolder if they want the product to appeal to baby boomers. ""Honey, where are my glasses?""- Though the slots are wider than many competitive models, they still do not accommodate New York City bagels easily. Supermarket-bought bagels do fit.- Regular sliced white bread toasts well, but breads that are more dense are under-cooked every time. Our sourdough bread at the highest numeral setting (6) was still not toasted well (see picture). We toasted this same sourdough bread and English Muffins using the KitchenAid and a basic Proctor-Silex 2-slice toaster. Both were placed on the ""4"" setting and we got very different results. Both times the KitchenAid was done much sooner and the bread was under-toasted  (see picture).- It does not brown evenly. There are dark spots and lighter spots on the toast.- We had to toast English muffins on the ""dark"" setting and then twice more on the ""2"" setting before they were finally sufficiently toasted.- We used the defrost setting with frozen waffles and found that the browning was inconsistent. Sections of the waffles were soggy and under-toasted and one slot toasted much more than the other (see image)- ExpensiveIf you're looking for an elegant-looking toaster with sleek controls to grace your counter top, but will only use it occasionally, or only with plain white bread, the KitchenAid KMT2116CU might make a good choice. But if you want a toaster that actually toasts well and can handle many different types of bread, you're probably best off looking elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSI1OKREZ3WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2KFX56#wasThisHelpful","R3RSI1OKREZ3WC","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves erasable markers and pens so I asked her to help me review these. She says these are fun, easy to hold and easy to erase. She likes the color selection but would have liked to have an orange one. They do include green (her favorite color) so that was important. :) Colors include black, dark blue, red, light blue, purple, green and pink. I tested them as well and also found them easy to hold and very easy to erase. The lower section of the pen has a textured (rubberized) grip so they stay firmly in your hand while writing.Since they are extra fine points, they're better for sketching or writing than for coloring. In the picture you can see 6 hearts (drawn by my daughter) and some short sentences. I also erased the lower half of the bottom sentence so you can see how well they erase (with very little effort). And, as someone mentioned in another review, if you put the piece of paper in the freezer, the erased ink reappears as if by magic, which is a neat trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ97WK81YH5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WMDLCYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ97WK81YH5Q","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up to protect some unassembled/unfinished outdoor wood furniture (Merry Garden Adirondack chairs and ottomans, made of fir). It applied easily and dried fairly quickly so I was able to apply two coats to the wood before assembling the pieces into their finished components and one coat after assembly (sanding with 320 grit between coats). I've included a picture so you can see how three coats look on these inexpensive ottomans. I stained them first with a Pecan stain. The Clear Satin Spar Urethane produces a nice non-glossy protective coat and brings out the beauty of the wood. The furniture hasn't done any time outside yet, but I'll be sure to update this review in the future once we've seen how they fare after some time in the elements.On a side note, sometimes the cost of paint and stain products online isn't competitive with local stores, but in my experience, the MinWax Helmsman Spar Urethane was a bit cheaper at Amazon than at a local hardware store in upstate NY and comparable to the Home Depot price for the same item in New York City.Note: there is an alternate version of the MinWax Helmsman Spar Urethane product that is water-based (instead of this product, which is oil-based). The water-based version is much thinner in consistency and requires more coats (they suggest 4 coats if you are using it on outdoor furniture). I accidentally bought the water-based one after I'd already used a quart of the oil-based one. Since I don't want to mix and match the two, that one is going back to the local hardware store. See attached picture for the difference between this product (left) and the water-based version (right).  Thanks to commenter Athena Thor for pointing out the difference).UPDATE (August 19): I finished two of the chairs and am adding a picture.

"I was surprised to see caffeine as one of the active ingredients in a hair gel (or a waxy paste, to be more accurate in this case). But apparently there may be a very good reason for this, and it's not just to make your pair ""perky"" in the morning. Doing a little research, it looks like there have been some studies that suggest that treatment of the hair follicles with caffeine can actually slow or prevent hair loss due to AGA (Androgenetic Alopecia) which is a leading cause of hair loss in both men and women. I am not a doctor (though I am married to a nurse, does that count?) so I won't make any claims regarding the health benefits of this product, but it's certainly worth doing a little more research.As far as its primary purpose, this product works as advertised, keeping my hair in place for most of the day. My wife says it also has a nice scent which is ""subtly masculine"" (whatever that means). :) I normally use ""Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Finishing Paste"" which is similar in consistency, though the Dove product is slight stiffer and more wax-like. The Dove styling paste also has a dryer look than the Fructis paste. When I use the Fructis paste, people ask if I have colored my hair because the wet look makes my hair look a bit darker. The Dove paste provides longer-lasting styling than the Fructis without drawing attention to itself. If you put the paste on while your hair is wet, then it will retain the wet look for a little while but later in the day, it looks dry but still maintains its shape. In the late afternoon or early evening, if some of the hair starts going rogue, a quick touch-up with wet hands brings those stray hairs back in line. I have included a picture so you can see how it looks once applied (this was just after a shower which is why the hair looks wet).Overall, the Dove Men+ paste works extremely well and may have some hair health benefits as well. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the price, which is a bit high compared to competitive products. But other than that, highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WM5ZZYKM9G6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOUQTJG#wasThisHelpful","R1WM5ZZYKM9G6K","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How does one review cat food? Should I take a little nibble myself? Maybe make little sandwiches for guests and ask their opinions on the ""lovely new brand of canned salmon?"" Or maybe I should just ask Toby (our 1-year-old tabby) his opinion? I opted to go with that last option and although Toby didn't have much to say on the matter, other than, ""meeeeeeow?"" his actions have spoken pretty clearly.Toby likes it! He gobbled up the Sheba Perfect Portions Pate we served him for dinner one evening and has continued to devour it ever since. He doesn't always clean his plate entirely, though. On a couple of occasions, before I started breaking it up with a fork, I just let the whole portion plop onto his plate in one semi-congealed glob, and he (accidentally?) pushed a large chunk of it off his plate while eating. And he wasn't quite interested in it enough to retrieve it. But that was an anomaly. For the most part, he does seem to like it. By comparison, we tried feeding him some ""Super Supper"" (9 Lives), and he simply thumbed his nose at it. Not with an actual thumb... that would be weird, and painful to the thumb owner... but you know what I mean.The ingredients look good: its main ingredient is ""responsibly sourced"" salmon and it includes no corn, soy or wheat, no artificial flavors and no artificial preservatives.  So it seems to be a solid nutritional option, in addition to being a tasty one.In terms of the packaging, it couldn't be much easier to open. Just peel back the foil top and plop the serving onto a plate, break off the used side and toss it. Do peel the top off slowly however, to prevent spillage of the gravy. No worries about refrigerating an open can for later. And the portion size seems about right for one meal for an adult cat.It does bother me a bit that the container is not easily recyclable, at least not in areas that are selective about which types of plastic they accept. The container is not labeled with a recycling number so I contacted the company and they told me that it would qualify as a plastic type of 7 (""miscellaneous""), which basically means it is something other than #1 through #6. Some curb-side recycling plans may take it but it's not as commonly recycled as types #1 or #2.Although we received this free as part of the Vine program, I would definitely buy Sheba Perfect Portions on my own dime. I think I would try a couple of the other flavors and alternate them so the cat's palate doesn't get too jaded. Cat owners (or ""companions,"" if you prefer) know how particular some cats can be. But our particular pussycat prefers Perfect Portions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XROWTNIZV3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLSAVDI#wasThisHelpful","R37XROWTNIZV3T","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say I believe standalone GPS units are still useful. I know iPhones and Android smart phones are getting better for navigation (and many navigation apps include real-time traffic alerts, which this unit does not). But I like to use my phone to play music, maybe play games (when someone else is driving, of course), and potentially even, you know... make phone calls. If your phone is also your GPS, then it kind of limits what else you can do with the phone while it's helping you navigate.This is my first Magellan GPS, but not my first GPS (I've owned a few Garmins, including my current nuvi 2595LMT). Getting started with the Magellan was pretty straightforward. I stuck it up on my windshield with the included suction cup mount and started navigating with it, right out of the box. The POI search and address entry worked as expected, the virtual keyboard was easy to use (thanks to the massive screen size), and directions were clear and accurate. I did miss a destination or two as it didn't seem to provide an exact notification right as we had arrived at a movie theater (for example), but it did warn me that it was coming up in 1/8th of a mile, so I could have figured it out if I kept an eye on the distance to destination. The way the Magellan references landmarks ""turn right just after the car dealership on the left"" is pretty nifty, but I can see that being problematic if those landmarks go out of business and you don't update the map data often enough.After some local driving for a couple of days near my parents' house, I took the unit inside to do a map update in preparation for our 800-mile drive north... which took a while (the update that is).First of all, you'll need to install the Magellan Content Manager software which you can download from the Magellan web site. Next you'll have to plug the GPS into your computer using the included microUSB cable. When I first did this, I had no luck at all. While the cable did charge the unit, the Magellan Content Manager would not recognize that a GPS was attached. I searched for a solution online, found none, then rebooted my PC (when in doubt, REBOOT!). This did the trick: after rebooting, the GPS showed a message saying USB was connected (etc.). At that point, I was able to check for updates in Content Manager, found that the GPS unit was up to date, both for maps and its internal software, disconnected it and set it back on the window for the long drive home.Along the way, I compared the Magellan to my car's built-in navigation (Toyota) and to Google Maps/Nav on my Android phone. The operation of all three was pretty similar, as were the selected routes. I definitely missed having any kind of traffic alerts on the Magellan, particularly as I approached New York City. If not for Google maps and traffic alerts on my phone, I probably would have waited in Lincoln Tunnel traffic (which was backed up, at the time), instead of zipping over the George Washington Bridge which was pretty clear.For the most part, the Magellan GPS works well, however, there are a few caveats. First of all, this thing is *HUGE*. The 7-inch diagonal screen makes it very easy to see the map and instructions, but it can block a fair amount of your view. Personally, I think a 5-inch screen is a better option: large enough to see clearly, but small enough not to block much of your view. Also, I found that the unit frequently chimes in with ""Make a legal U-Turn..."" even when I'm following the directions to a T and no U-turn is required (this must be some kind of software glitch). One other odd thing: I didn't see any indication of state lines on the Magellan map. This is not strictly essential for navigation, but it 's a nice thing to know when you're crossing over a border. Also, though this is no big deal, I didn't see any way of modifying the icon which represents your car. On the Garmin, there are lots of fun icons you can pick (we're currently using a Star Wars Tie Fighter). On the Magellan, you're a big blue triangle. That's it.On the plus side, the 9400-LM does come with lifetime map updates, it does that clever landmark-based directions and it even includes an A/V input. The A/V input is for connection of the optional Magellan back-up safety camera ($149). This is a cool feature as it allows you to add a back-up camera to an existing car pretty easily (the camera hooks into the reverse light wires for power and wirelessly transmits the image data to the GPS unit via a small wireless receiver that plugs into the GPS). I imagine that the A/V input might work as a video input for other devices as well but I didn't get a chance to test that.Overall, I enjoyed using the Magellan 9400-LM for a few days but its large size and lack of traffic updates make it a bit less attractive compared to my current Garmin unit. Those who want or need the larger 7"" screen and aren't as concerned about traffic updates would probably be pretty happy with this unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5CJI95WXF3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJF2VP0#wasThisHelpful","R2E5CJI95WXF3G","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really nice design. Works well to store wipes and keep them moist while providing easy access: one push to open the lid, grab a wipe and one more push to reseal it. The free dispensers that are included with the purchase of some wipes were frustrating to use as they never seemed to work well - more often than not, wipes would get stuck and/or tear when trying to pull them out. That's not the case with this dispenser from OXO. Recommended.UPDATE: a couple of weeks after writing this review, my wife left a Bath and Bodyworks Wallflower plug-in fragrance unit on top of the wipes dispenser. A bit of fragrance leaked out of it while it was on top and sat there for about a day. There must have been some kind of chemical reaction with the plastic of the wipes dispenser because the back hinge plastic cracked into multiple pieces the next time we tried to open the wipes dispenser. Irreparable. Could not be repaired. I'm not changing my score but I would caution owners not to use any chemical cleaners and certainly not to set a Bath and Bodyworks wallflower on top of this thing!UPDATE 2: When OXO found out about the above, they sent us a replacement.

"This SONOS bundle gets you pretty much everything you need to do wireless 5.1 surround sound from your TV, plus the full benefits of the SONOS digital music discovery platform. You get the PlayBar, which covers the front left, right and center channels, the Sub which handles low bass, a pair of Play:1s which handle rear channel surround sound duties, plus a SONOS Boost which allows you to do high quality wireless streaming without having to rely on (or stress out) your current home wireless network.Setting up the Sonos system is pretty straightforward. You plug the Boost into your current network router, and it establishes a separate wireless mesh network in your home, dedicated to Sonos music streaming. Using a boost isn't technically required (Sonos speakers can also connect to each other over WiFi), but it is highly recommended as it will help to ensure that the system runs smoothly without synch issues or buffering. Once the Boost has established the mesh network, you plug in and add the various SONOS components to the system and link them all into a single room in the Sonos app. You then connect the fiberoptic cable (included) from the back of your TV to the PlayBar and that's pretty much it.On the app side, if these are your first SONOS speakers, then you'll also need to go in to add your accounts (Spotify, Pandora, etc.) plus set-up access to your digital music collection within your home network (assuming you have one). You can also search for and set up favorite internet radio stations in case you'd like to tune in to local stations from virtually anywhere in the world.While SONOS itself is primarily a multi-room wireless music system, which makes it easy to play your existing music and to find new music via the various apps, the PlayBar is a little different. It works like any other wireless SONOS speaker, but it also works as a soundbar (with surround) to enhance your TV sound. If your TV is turned on and a source is selected (cable or satellite box, built-in ATSC tuner or video streaming app), the PlayBar will automatically turn on and provide the sound for whatever is playing on the TV. You don't even have to hit an input button on a remote. It's smart enough to detect a signal and fire itself up to provide high quality sound.When you're done watching TV, you can route music to the PlayBar instead, all driven from an app on your smart phone, PC or tablet. And, because it's a SONOS, you can synchronize the music in your living room to other SONOS speakers in a bedroom, kitchen or bathroom (I currently have Play:1s in my kitchen and bathroom and it's nice to be able to listen to the same thing on both, or separate content on each).In terms of sound quality, the PlayBar is very good on its own, with clear dialog intelligibility, a nice soundstage and decent treble response. Its bass response is clean, but not very extended, but the included (in this bundle) SONOS sub greatly improves the low end.  And when paired with the Play:1s (also included) as surround channels, the system can reproduce a nicely immersive surround sound soundstage... as long as you can get it a true 5.1-channel source.And that's the real trick (and main limitation of the system). Because most TVs do not pass a 5.1-channel Dolby Digital signal through from a connected device out through the TV's fiberoptic output, much of what you will hear through the PlayBar is really just 2-channel sound, with matrix decoding to provide some basic surround effects. There are a few (very few) TVs that do provide 5.1 passthrough, but the latest models from Samsung and Panasonic (among others) do not support this. You will get discrete 5.1 if you use the TV's on-board streaming apps or HD tuner, but you won't if you use a connected Blu-ray player or set-top box.You can work around the problem by picking up a fiberoptic switch and connecting your set-top box or Blu-ray player directly to that, but then you've got an additional layer of complexity on something that's supposed to be super-simple. Also, even with the switch, the PlayBar cannot decode DTS sound which is popular on DVD and Blu-ray and even starting to appear on several TVs. If you're interested in reading more about the details of this, then view the PlayBar reviews, also on Amazon, or look up my detailed review on Big Picture Big Sound. But the bottom line is, by keeping the PlayBar simple (just one input, no DTS decoding) they've made it a bit less likely that owners will actually get to enjoy discrete 5.1-channel surround sound.Bottom Line: high marks for sound quality, simplicity of use and robustness of the SONOS platform, but one star knocked off for the difficulty most owners will experience when trying to enjoy real discrete 5.1 surround.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22E06CSXF1XA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVG5SJM#wasThisHelpful","R22E06CSXF1XA3","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I'm updating this review as I've now had a chance to spend some quality time with this ""Diamond Luxe"" Special Edition Blu-ray Disc (I got a copy directly from the studio a couple of weeks ago).Original review (pre-release):""Gravity"" is an intense audio and video experience, and an enjoyable film overall which is enhanced through the use of both 3D and Dolby Atmos surround. So why does the studio make us pick one or the other? The initial release of ""Gravity"" on Blu-ray is available in 3D, but with only a 5.1-channel soundtrack. It's a great-looking and sounding disc, but lacks the immersiveness of Dolby Atmos. This ""Diamond Luxe"" edition of the film will have a Dolby Atmos mix, but is not available in 3D. Frustrating!I saw the film two nights in a row in theaters: first in Dolby Atmos (in 3D), then in IMAX (also 3D). Both were enjoyable, but the pinpoint precision of sound available in Dolby Atmos made certain scenes -- like the opening shot with the sound slowly growing out of the vast nothingness -- so much more effective.  Also, in scenes where there are layers upon layers of sound objects on top of the powerful score, Dolby Atmos helps to keep the mix sounding both coherent and immersive. Little details and spatial cues make it all very believable.As for the 3D, I know the live action shots were shot with a traditional camera and upconverted to 3D, but really that's only the actors' faces. The suits, backgrounds, ships, etc. are nearly all CGI creations, rendered in 3D. I would consider this more ""real"" 3D than ""fake"" 3D. Hey, if the director thinks 3D is essential to enjoyment of the film, who are we to argue? 3D is certainly effective at accentuating the peril when rogue satellites and space shrapnel are hurtling toward the viewer and when one of the astronauts is spinning out of control attached to a damaged space ship. 3D also heightens the feeling of claustrophobia in the tight spaces of the ships and space station, making the experience of what these people are going though more immediate, and more real.C'mon, Warner, let us watch ""Gravity"" the way Alfonso CuarÃ³n intended: in 3D *AND* Dolby Atmos!4/1/15 Update:Having watched this Blu-ray now a couple of times all the way through, and repeating several scenes, I have to say, my opinion hasn't changed much from the theatrical release: the Dolby Atmos soundtrack of the Blu-ray Disc is nothing short of spectacular, but I do miss the 3D. If I had to choose one, I'd pick the Dolby Atmos 2D version over a non-Atmos 3D version, hands-down. If you have a Dolby Atmos-capable system, you simply *must* get this Blu-ray Disc. I've said for a while that ""Gravity"" is the poster child of Dolby Atmos, and this Blu-ray reinforces that.Just sit back and watch the opening scene for proof. Deep bass and effects build to a crescendo as text on screen describes the utter inhospitability of space. The sound peaks at intense levels and abruptly ends, followed by a deep enveloping silence. Out of this audio void slowly come the sounds of radio communications among astronauts and mission control personnel. Only in Dolby Atmos can you pick out the individual voices as they span the entire 3D space, side to side, top to bottom.Comparing to my memory of the film in theaters (I saw it twice in Dolby Atmos), I think the home mix on this Blu-ray is an excellent representation of the theatrical audio. Switching over to the standard 5.1 ""Silent Space"" track, these same conversations sound jumbled. I've never thought of standard 5.1 surround sound as ""flat"" before, but it feels that way, compared to the wide open Dolby Atmos mix.Dolby Atmos is used to good effect multiple times within the film, including that opening scene, the initial bombardment of the shuttle with space schrapnel (at about 11:00), the destruction of the International Space Station (52:39), and the final scene with buzzing insects and the sweeping music (1:22:00). The sense of 3-dimensional space is conveyed well in the Atmos mix.As for extras, there is a whole separate disc of Special Features, but these are mostly carried over from the previous Blu-ray release (with 3 new exclusives, detailed below). The main new thing here is the ""Silent Space"" version of the film. This is a bit of a misnomer, as there are still plenty of sounds and effects (including Dr. Stone's deep throbbing heartbeat). The only thing missing is the music. It's basically what Dr. Stone would have heard from within her own spacesuit (or from inside the various crafts she enters). Frankly, to me, this is an interesting experiment, but not one that I'd enjoy for repeated viewings. The film's score  by Stephen Price is one of its highlights and I miss its presence. Without the music, the film feels a little more like a documentary and is, ultimately, less dramatic.Also exclusive to this release are three new videos, all in HD: ""Looking to the Stars"": a 42-minute homage to space-based SciFi films; ""Gravity: The Human Element,"" an 11-minute featurette on what it takes to be a real astronaut, and ""Sandra's Birthday Wish"" a 3-minute birthday greeting from Sandra Bullock to director Alfonso Cuaron (complete with completely cheesy green screen-based visual effects). Pile on the special features from the original release and it all adds up to nearly 6 hours of bonus materials (including 90 minutes for the Silent Space version of the film). In other words, there's a lot to keep a fan busy, if you're into that sort of stuff.All in all, it's really an excellent release with top-notch video and audio. If they had included a 3D version of the film with Dolby Atmos, it would have been a clear 5-star Blu-ray Disc set, but even without that, it's still worth a purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZWTFX918689/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGHUJOO#wasThisHelpful","R2PZWTFX918689","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Vega Sport protein bars are designed for athletes to build muscle tissue after a workout, but they're also a tasty snack while travelling or will keep you going if you miss a meal.

In terms of flavor, the chocolate mint bar is a bit mintier than I expected, but still pleasant. Consistency-wise, it's more chalky than chewy, so I can't say I'm a big fan of the texture.

"Not a great app. It's awkward to take pictures (scan) the tickets and even with good lighting it still consistently can't read some numbers. For example, it read the number ""67"" as ""57"" on multiple attempts. And attempting to manually fix the number lead to a screen where I could only select a number from 1 to 56 (MegaMillions numbers actually go up to 75). This meant that it was actually impossible to fix the scanned card number. This app is useful for storing numbers and checking winning numbers but for its primary value-add purpose - automatically scanning in numbers to check winners - it's not very good.

"From the write-up, it seems like this book would be fascinating and exciting, but the reality is the author gets too bogged down in detail for there to be much tension or hold my interest. It took me several weeks to get through the book because I kept falling asleep whenever I picked it up after just a few pages. Another pet peeve: please don't reveal major plot points -- like the death of a famous exhibition flyer -- in the image captions before they've been revealed in the actual text!I do admire the author's thoroughness -- it is certainly well-researched -- but I think some of the minor players in the early days of aviation could have been omitted for the sake of focus on the lead characters: the Wright Brothers and Glenn Curtiss. I will say I had no idea how litigious the Wright brothers were about their patents and it's frustrating to see how they squandered the country's lead in early aviation due to pride and greed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RP0NJ6W9C3WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034553803X#wasThisHelpful","R1RP0NJ6W9C3WG","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this rack more but had some serious problems getting it successfully installed on my bike. I removed the two mounting bolts and lubricated them with oil as other reviewers have suggested, then put the mount on my (removed) bike seat post. I tried using all three shims but they did not fit so I went with two. When I was tightening the bolts, the rack just wouldn't get snug so I kept tightening until POP! The metal bolt heads actually both snapped off from the force (the bolts broke in half). I decided to try again with a replacement rack from Amazon. This time I used the two thickest shims of the 3. It felt relatively snug before tightening the bolts. But just when I almost had it secure - POP! - one of the bolt heads snapped off again and went flying across the room.Because I liked the look and overall design of the rack, I decided to pick up a couple of replacement bolts at Home Depot. For anyone who might care to try this, it's a metric 8mm 1.25 thread bolt. I bought the 30 mm length bolt because they had them in stock. A 25mm (maybe even 20 mm) length bolt would also probably have fit. The heads are a little too large to fit into the recessed holes on the mount, but otherwise work fine. They even use the same size Allen wrench as the original bolts.Anyway, with the replacement bolts, the rack seems to be mounted just fine, very secure and the bolt heads did not snap during assembly. I do like the mount once it's secured with better bolts, but really it shouldn't be necessary to pay an extra couple of bucks for hardware just to get it securely mounted.UPDATE (August, 2015). 1 year and a couple of hundred miles later, the rack is holding up well with the replacement bolts from Home Depot. It holds items well and stays firmly in place. It also provides a nice shield against water coming up from puddles or rainy streets. The cord that comes with it isn't great but regular bungee cords work well with this rack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTEQAHBEZJ4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030RS5CA#wasThisHelpful","R1HTEQAHBEZJ4U","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent basket that is easy to install and also easily removable by simply lifting the basket handles (the mount for the basket stays attached).  I had first thought it would be tricky to install as there was a brake cable in the way of the mount, but the guy at my local bike repair shop showed me how easy the brake cable is to move by simply removing it from one of the brakes and clipping the cable back in once I installed the basket mount to the handlebars. Installation should take less than 5 minutes. Also, the padded Velcro mount and hooks stay secure and don't rattle very much except on big bumps.UPDATE: Having used the basket for a few months, I did want to add one warning. The basket stays secure during most casual bike riding, but if you want to ride fast and particularly if the road gets a bit bumpy (which is common in NYC), you should probably remove the basket. I've now had several occasions where the basket has detached and gone flying off the bike. Fortunately it hasn't led to any dangerous situations or damage to other bikes or vehicles (or people!), but I did want to put this warning in there in case people just think that they can leave the basket attached at all times. The basket is so easy to remove that this doesn't really affect my opinion of it (nor the score). Also, it has held up fine even being thrown onto the pavement multiple times. But be aware that it can come detached when riding over bumps and/or at higher speeds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ65QBF0QV78W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YBHONG#wasThisHelpful","RZ65QBF0QV78W","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great lure. Caught a 22-inch pike and a 16-inch large mouth bass within a few casts with the 4-inch pike lure. My 9-year-old daughter tried a couple of casts and a big pike jumped out of the water while pursuing it (got off the hook but still very exciting for both of us). The lure's got great action: looks like a real fish with the tail wagging back and forth. As others have mentioned though, the tail is a bit thin so the lure may not last long. We went through two in about a week of regular fishing in a lake in the Adirondacks. We tried gluing one of the broken tails back together (luckily had both pieces). The glue held but the action got a little stiffer and the lure got no love after that.I'm ordering more though: 4-inch, 5-inch and also going to try out the Storm perch lure.

"We've had bath products cluttering up our shower for years. I hadn't looked into a shower caddy like this before now as we have a jacuzzi-style bath (Bain Ultra air jet tub) and the controls are in the corner where we wanted to put the caddy. But based on the pictures, it looked like this OXO caddy would be close enough to the corner to not interfere with the tub jet controls.  When I unpacked it, this turned out to be true. The support column goes almost all the way into the corner, leaving plenty of space for the jet controls on the tub.Installation took maybe 20 minutes. There are 4 bar sections that screw together. Depending on the height of your shower wall, you may only need two or three of these sections. In addition to these fixed length sections, there is a tension clip on the bottom section that unsnaps to allow you to add additional height and adjust the pole to the exact required height. When you have it adjusted properly, just snap this clip back down to lock it into place (it may take some force to do this).The shelves are very nicely designed with open drain holes to prevent water build up. Some shelves even have round holes the size of your average shampoo bottle top which allows you to store these upside down (which makes it easier to get the shampoo out). The shelves are also completely adjustable in height which allows you to leave room for tall bottles on certain shelves if required. And while they remove easily, the rubberized hook on the back of each shelf holds each shelf securely.So far, it's too early to tell how this holds up to rusting (reviews on this seem to be mixed so far), but I'll update this review over time to note any changes.

"We bought this to replace a utility sink faucet that had broken after only a few years of use. This Delta installed easily using existing hardware with no leaks and decent pressure in the tap. It took a little over an hour and a half for me to disconnect the old faucet, move the sink away from the wall, reattach everything and reinstall the sink. A pro plumber could probably do it faster.  Luckily the compression fittings on the supply hoses we had were still in good shape so I didn't need any new hardware.Installation/removal order is important (and may vary based on your existing hardware). In my case, I already had the flexible supply pipes with compression fittings on each end and our utility sink is light and pretty easy to move so I could easily flip it to remove the old faucet and install the new one. If this hadn't been the case, getting under the sink to remove the old faucet and install the new one would have been really tricky.Here's what I did:1.) turn off the water to the sink2.) disconnect flexible supply hoses from cold/hot water pipes3.) disconnect flexible supply hoses from faucet intake pipes (this may require physically moving the sink to gain access to the bottom)4.) if you need to move the sink, be sure to uninstall the sink drain and separate this from the drain pipe5.) remove old faucet which should be secured to bottom of sink with one or two metal or plastic nuts6.) secure new Delta faucet to sink using two plastic nuts (supplied). Make sure they are tight enough so the faucet does not wiggle7.) attach existing flexible supply hoses to intake pipes on faucet using compression fittings on existing hoses.8.) reinstall sink to drain and secure to wall (assuming your sink is mounted, not free-standing)9.) reattach flexible supply hoses to hot and cold water pipes10.) turn on water supply valves, open the faucet valves and check for leaks.I initially had a leak on one intake pipe (compression fitting wasn't tight enough) and a leak from the drain (had not secured the compression fitting on the drain all the way), but once I sorted that out, everything was peachy.  I attached a hose to the faucet (it comes with a threaded end for this purpose) and was able to wash the car without any problems (right before the rain, natch!).In terms of quality, the Delta seems pretty solid and the valves operate smoothly. The spout is a little wiggly, but I think this is normal.

"After our neighbors came down with a mysterious ""flu,"" we headed down to the bunker and started digging into our stash of Wise MRE meals. The first few weeks weren't too bad. But there's only so much ""Savory Stroganoff"" or ""Creamy A La King"" I could take without feeling the need for something to expand the palate. So I ventured outside to explore.I admit, it was pretty bad out there. The stench of rotting garbage, burning buildings and decaying flesh can really spoil your appetite. But I was able to make my way past the burnt-out hulks of smashed up cars and city buses, sidle past a few mutilated corpses and squeeze my way into what was once our local Costco. Inside, amid the bodies and debris, I found an untouched (extra large, of course) bag of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers! Oh, sweet cheddary, crunchy goodness!Unfortunately, on the way out, distracted as I was by my delicious find, one of the ""corpses"" lurched up and grabbed me, biting out a nice-sized chunk of my bicep. Oh, I managed to escape and found my way back to my bunker, but after a few hours, I got a bit feverish, and lost my taste for food, even the delicious Wise MREs; even those heavenly goldfish crackers. My wife complained that I really shouldn't have left the bunker. So I ate her brains. The kids weren't too happy about that, so I ate their brains too. I feel a little bad about that, but once you've tasted the sweet slimy goodness of warm brains, nothing else matters.By the way, I still have a fair supply of these Wise meals available if you're interested. I've put up a Craig's List post, hoping to lure hungry survivors, but that hasn't worked out so well, what with the power out and no broadband services any more.

"From the item title, ""100 (50+50) PCS #0~#1 7.25x10 ""E-LITE"" Kraft Bubble Mailer Padded Shipping Envelopes"" I thought I was getting 50 size #0 and 50 size #1 padded envelopes. What I actually received was 100 padded envelopes that are sized between a #0 and a #1 envelope. Actual outer dimensions are about 8.1"" x 10"" with the flap open, 8.1"" x 9"" with the flap sealed. Inner dimensions are around 7.25"" x 9"" when sealed. So no matter how you slice it, the description is ambiguous if not just plain wrong. However, they are still a nice size for mailing larger DVD and Blu-ray sets (which is what I needed them for), so I'm OK with them.When I enquired about it, the seller offered to take them back and issue a refund or credit me 10% and keep them, so that's a decent way to handle this.

"We got this book when my son was a Tiger Scout and it has proven its worth year after year. My son has won or placed near the top of his pack races almost every year and even took home third in the WEBELOS division in the New York City all-city pinewood derby race in 2013.The book is well-written both for the novice and for the more advanced craftsman. There are basic tips like proper lubrication and sanding techniques, as well as more advanced recommendations such as using a machine lathe on the wheels to make them perfectly round or notching the axles to reduce friction (both of which were a bit outside our skill levels).But be sure to be involved with your scout every step of the way: I made the mistake of handing him the book and saying ""pick a pattern"" - my boy picked one of the most advanced designs which was extremely tricky to cut and shape using the rudimentary hand tools at our disposal.  I think that particular car ended up being about as much Bondo as it was wood. But it was fast!The author also stresses the importance of letting the scout do as much of the work on the car as possible.  Of course, it doesn't make sense to let a 7-year old boy operate a jig saw without supervision, but let him trace the pattern onto the car, show him how to cut and sand the wood, let him file and sand the axles to make them smooth and get him involved with the final painting and/or stickers that give the car its character. While a strictly parent-made car might win more races, the whole point of the derby is to allow parents and scouts to collaborate and spend quality time together while the scout learns useful skills about woodworking and friendly competition.I'm not sure if the book has been updated since we originally purchased it but the copy we bought a few years ago has definitely served us well in designing and building cool (and fast!) pinewood derby cars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KM11RQMFJSRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565232917#wasThisHelpful","R1KM11RQMFJSRU","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this with a couple of Philips slim LED bulbs in a bedroom light fixture and it works very well. There is a nice range of dimming and a great amount of customization for turn-on and turn-off delays. I programmed mine to turn on with a quick fade to bright but turn off with a longer (5 second) fade to dark so I can make it back from the switch to my bed without tripping over anything in the dark. In addition to programming the turn-on and turn-off delays, you can also optimize the dimming range for your specific bulbs.If you want to do any custom programming, you'll need to download the programming guide from the Lutron web site.  Just Google ""program Lutron maestro c.l dimmer"" to find that.

"This replacement part matched the color, design and size of the original handle which cracked after 10 years of use. This is the ""bisque"" or beige colored handle, not the light grey or dark grey versions which are different part numbers. It did not have the little black sorbothane ""grip strip"" which was inside the original handle, and which makes grasping the handle a little more comfortable.

"These are the latest (2014) model of Samsung's entry-level active 3D glasses. They adhere to the Full HD 3D RF glasses standard, adopted in 2012, and are somewhat backward compatible so they work with Samsung 3D TVs back to 2011. They also work well with recent active 3D TVs from Panasonic and others as well as Epson's latest 3D-capable projectors. Since they adhere to the Full HD 3D standard, they will work with many other brands and models as well. I've personally tested them with a Panasonic 2013 model year 3D TV (TC-P60VT60) and an Epson Home Cinema 2000 projector and they worked great with both. They are *not* compatible with any passive 3D TVs, such as those from LG, Vizio and some Panasonic 3D LED/LCD TVs, nor will they work with earlier active 3D sets (or projectors) that used IR (Infrared) 3D glasses. Check your TV or projector to make sure it adheres to the universal RF 3D glasses standard before buying these.Per the packaging, they will work with any Samsung model that includes the following letter codes: D, E, ES, F, FH, H and HU series. So they'd worth with a UN55F8000 (F series, from 2013) but not a UN46C8000 (C series, from 2010). I've uploaded a picture of the box which lists compatible Samsung TV models.As with last year's 3D glasses from Samsung (SSG-5100GB, now discontinued), these are great glasses for the money. They're not perfect, but they work well and are inexpensive. These glasses are very light, provide an acceptable field of view, and create a solid, stable full HD 3D image. As with last year's model, these ones do not fold, which means they take up a bit more shelf space than folding models, but this is a fairly minor gripe. Also, they allow light in on the sides (which is actually nice if you need to walk around at all) but this does make it more important to keep your viewing room fairly dark so the ambient light will not be distracting or impact 3D viewing.Samsung went with a smaller battery this year (CR1620 vs. last year's CR2025). I guess this makes the glasses slightly smaller/lighter but it also reduces the 3D viewing time from a rated 150 hours to 70 hours.  Still, 70 hours of 3D viewing is a very long time (30+ movies), and the SSG-5150GB comes with two batteries (one plus a spare) so it's not worth worrying about. I'd recommend ordering a few extra CR1620 batteries on Amazon and just keep them in a drawer.In terms of getting these glasses up and running, it's pretty simple. Put your TV into 3D mode, hit the power button on the top of the glasses and you're done. On a Samsung TV, you'll see a notification that the pairing is successful. On some other displays (like Panasonic) you may not see any indication on screen even though the pairing is successful. But it should be clear when you look through the glasses if the pairing worked. If you're having trouble, here are the details on how to get up and running.*Detailed Assembly and Pairing Instructions*First make sure your TV is powered up and you've got 3D content on the screen. The best bet is to use a Blu-ray 3D Disc in a Blu-ray 3D player and get to the disc menu. If you like to watch 3D content at home and don't own a Blu-ray 3D player, then get one! But if you don't have one, then you can also put your 3D-capable TV into a 3D-simulation mode. On Samsung and Panasonic TVs, you should see a ""3D"" button on the remote. Hit this to go from 2D to 3D mode. On other compatible 3D displays, you should see a 3D button on the remote or a menu option to put the TV into 3D mode.If your TV is in 3D mode and you are not wearing glasses, you should see doubled lines on the screen (it will look ""fuzzy""). It's easiest to see this with text. Once you're in 3D mode on the TV, then do the following:* Take the 3D glasses out of the box and attach the arms to the bridge. The underside of each arm is hollow so you can tell the top from the bottom easily and can figure out which side each one goes on.* Open the battery compartment by turning the round panel on the inside center of the glasses (on the bridge) counterclockwise. Use a coin or the spare CR1620 battery in the slot to open the battery panel.* Insert the battery into the recessed battery compartment with the ""+"" side visible and pointing toward you, reinsert and rotate the battery door clockwise to close it.* Remove the protective films from the lenses by pulling up the red and blue tabs on each side of the lenses (these are only to protect the lenses during shipment).* Push the little power/sync button on the top of the bridge of the glasses (it will turn green when it syncs).* Put the glasses on your face and look at the TV screen.If your glasses have paired properly with your TV, you should see depth to the image. The doubled lines will be gone replaced by three dimensional goodness. If you have a Samsung TV or Epson projector, you will see an on-screen indication that the pairing was successful. If you have a Panasonic 3D TV, you will probably not see any on-screen indication (no message or icon) that the pairing was successful, even though the glasses have paired. In any case, if your image now has 3D depth instead of doubled lines, then your pairing was successful and you are ready to watch.Do this once for each pair of glasses, hand them out to your family and/or friends and press play!With Samsung TVs, the glasses should turn themselves off once the TV is turned off or the 3D signal is lost. On other brand TVs, it's probably a good idea to hit the power/sync button one more time at the end of your session to turn the glasses off. The indicator light will turn red then go off.If this works (or doesn't work) for your TV, let me know in the comments. Be sure to specify what brand and model TV you are using.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SVJ6ZCNNGB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INO6JX2#wasThisHelpful","R31SVJ6ZCNNGB6","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a couple of these for use in a ceiling light in our bedroom and have been very impressed. They're as bright as a 60-65 Watt incandescent bulb, but use only one sixth as much electricity. They offer a very low profile due to their slim design. This makes it easy to fit them in most standard fixtures.  Also they dim extremely well and remain stable at low light levels using a Lutron MACL-153M-WH Maestro CFL/LED Digital Dimmer.I have read some reviews that say they buzz on some dimmers but I have noticed no noise at all using the Lutron dimmer which is specifically made for LED and CFL bulbs. Also, the Lutron dimmer itself is programmable so you can max out the dimming range of the bulb.Color temperature is just slightly cooler than an incandescent bulb but much warmer than the stark bluish ""daylight"" or ""bright white"" LED bulbs. The light these soft white bulbs provide is bright without being sterile. The price may seem steep - they were $10/bulb but were lowered to $9/bulb - this is much more expensive than incandescent or CFL bulbs.  But it's actually much less expensive than previous generations of Philips bulbs and even cheaper than some of the no-name (and inferior) competition.  And with the energy savings and longer life expectancy, it won't take too long to recover your investment. I'm definitely buying more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FEUV9Q2V43G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I134ORI#wasThisHelpful","R11FEUV9Q2V43G","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to mount an Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 2000 Projector to my basement ceiling. For the most part, it worked fine, but it did not have enough height adjustment for me to be able to get a geometrically correct screen image without having to use keystone. And when you use keystone, you lose screen resolution (which is bad).  Ideally, you want to mount any projector so that it creates a rectangular, squared off image without any digital keystone. This assures that all of your pixels are being used to create an image, instead of shifting some of your available resolution outside the active picture area. But I digress...First of all, my mount came with all of the necessary hardware (screws, washers, etc.) and the instructions were pretty clear. The only extra tool I needed was a drill for the ceiling mount holes and a Philips head screwdriver.  The mount comes with two Allen wrenches to adjust the rest. The VideoSecu mount comes with an adjustable extension arm. If you want your projector right up against the ceiling, you can mount it without using the extension arm at all, and this will put the top of your projector 5.5"" from the ceiling. For me this was just slightly too high to get a squared off image on my 92-inch screen which is permanently mounted to the wall.So I tried the extension arm, which drops the projector down significantly lower, with a range of around 16.9"" to 25.6"" and this was slightly too low (I feel like Goldilocks!).  At the least amount of extension (16.9"" from ceiling), I was able to square off my projection image using about +7 on the vertical Keystone scale.  This isn't terrible, and did create a nice-looking image for most content, but putting up a 1080p test pattern showed that the view-able image was no longer getting the full 1920x1080 pixel resolution. In actual viewing, this becomes noticeable mostly with text as in movie credits, and a subtle loss of detail on some movie content.The only other issue I had with the mount was due to my projector having three instead of four mounting holes. The mounting interface has four adjustable feet that screw into holes on the bottom of the projector. Most projectors have four holes but the Epson Home Cinema 2000 and 2030 have three holes. The manual that came with the mount suggests that you remove two of the feet and place one of them in a fifth hole that is located between two of the others on the mounting plate. The problem is that the mount I received has no fifth hole - it's simply not there. It is pictured on the VideoSecu web site with a fifth hole, so I'm guessing they may have added this hole to a later version of the mount and I may have gotten old stock. I ended up leaving all four legs on the mount and just used three. Using two of the long feet and one short foot reversed (for the projector's center hole), I was able to get a nice tight mount, pretty close to the projector's center of gravity so it was not pulling in any one direction.It's important to note that this requirement to use Keystone may or may not affect you if you use this or any other projector with the VideoSecu mount.  My issue is due to a couple of things: the screen is already mounted in a fixed location (I can't move it up or down) and the Epson Home Cinema 2000 and 2030 projectors have a fairly unique throw angle. These projectors have 92% of the image above, and 8% of the image below the lens center line.  You reverse these numbers when mounting the projector upside down from a ceiling. On a 92-inch screen, this means the lens must be about 3.5 to 4 inches below the top of the screen in order to get a square image without keystone. If your projector has a different throw angle, or if it has lens shift, or if you have higher ceilings (mine are about 8 feet) or more flexible screen mounting options, then this VideoSecu mount may be a perfect fit.Other than the need to use Keystone in my specific case, the VideoSecu PF12W offers decent adjustability and performance for an excellent price. I was able to adjust the tilt in all directions to hit the screen properly and the projector locks in place pretty well so even the occasional light bump (from my head) does not misalign the image. If it weren't for the need to use keystone to square the image, I would be extremely satisfied with this mount.  As it is, I'm going to try out Epson's own Universal Projector Mount with its optional Adjustable Extension Column to see if that gets me the exact height I need. Based on the specs, I think it will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRQPCLSQA892/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IDC0K2#wasThisHelpful","RVRQPCLSQA892","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, if you already own this tablet, and are having a problem getting your device to charge, turn on or power up, see below for a fix. For those considering buying one, here are my thoughts.Samsung makes great Android tablets (for the most part). I've owned a Galaxy Tab 2 and done some testing of other Samsung tablets as well.  They're responsive, offer a pretty straight-forward interface, full access to the Google Play Store (unlike Kindles), front and rear cameras, Bluetooth keyboard *and* Bluetooth mouse support and expandable storage via the microSD slot. This last bit is important if you want to keep local copies of music or movies (e.g., not rely on the Cloud) for mobile media entertainment.Also, the inclusion of an IR (InfraRed) port on the Galaxy Tab 3, and the remote app allows you to turn your tablet into a full-fledged touch screen home theater controller at no additional cost. For a gadget freak, this is pretty cool.  Overall, the fast processor, expandable storage, relatively low price, and wide selection of apps make the Tab 3 an excellent choice for a 7-inch tablet.But my experience with the Galaxy Tab 3 has been marred by a recurrent problem: sometimes the Tab 3 will become unresponsive: it won't charge, nothing lights up, and it won't turn on. This happened to the white Tab 3 I bought my daughter for Christmas after exactly one day of use. It happened again on the Tab 3 that Samsung sent as a replacement (the yellow kids' version) after about a week of use.  The first time, my daughter ran the tablet until the battery was exhausted and the unit shut itself down. After that, it never turned back on again despite multiple charging attempts from the factory charger plugged into the wall, or the factory USB/microUSB cable plugged into a computer.I looked online and found all kinds of suggested fixes: Hold the power button for 10 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds (no joy).  Hold the power button and volume down button (again, nope). Hold the power button, home button and volume up button.  Still, NOPE! Try a trickle charge - plug the Tab 3 into a computer via the USB cable instead of the wall charger hoping that the lower amp charge from the computer would ""trickle charge"" the battery and fool it into charging. Again (at least for me) - FAIL!  But you are more than welcome to try these approaches as they are pretty simple and completely non-invasive.*HOW TO REALLY FIX THE POWER UP PROBLEM*What did work for me was to disconnect and reconnect the battery, then plug the unit back into its factory wall charger. After less than a minute, I saw the battery icon on the screen, and the unit began charging normally. Hooray! The only bad news about this is that it's not as simple as removing the back of a Galaxy phone. In fact, it's possible that attempting this will void your warranty, so proceed with caution!Getting the back off the Galaxy Tab 3 requires gently prying the edges away from the screen in the little crack between the screen and the case all around the perimeter of the screen. Doing this properly requires a thin plastic pry tool and some patience. I used a small jack knife, but would not recommend it due to the risk of scratches or even shorting out something inside the case. Once you've removed the back of the unit, gently lift the battery connector off its port by prying it toward you. Once it's disconnected, plug it back in by pushing it back down into place. Replace the cover by gently placing the tablet into its shell and pushing along the perimeter, snapping all the tabs back into place.There's an excellent video of this on YouTube by a user called, ""JerryRigEverything"" - search for ""Galaxy Tab 3 Battery Replacement"" and you should find it.  The only part you need to watch is the first one minute and 15 seconds to see how the cover comes off and how to separate the battery leads from the motherboard. You don't need to physically remove the battery or remove the screws that hold it in place to detach the battery leads from the motherboard. Once you've put it all back together, plug the tablet into the factory wall charger and USB cable. Within about a minute you should see the battery icon appear and normal charging should begin.Without this ""little"" issue, I'd rate the Galaxy Tab 3 as a 4-star or 5-star product. But with this major inconvenience, I have to downgrade it to 3 stars.  If it had only happened to one sample, I would have written it off, but seeing it happen to two different samples, and seeing how many other people are saying the exact same thing, I have to think it is endemic to all Tab 3s and it's only a matter of time before it happens to most owners. Let's hope Samsung figures out a software fix for this. Otherwise expect to see a bumper crop of factory-refurbished Tab 3s in the near future.If this helps you get your Tab 3 back up and running (or doesn't!), please let me know in the comments.By the way, in our case, the failures occurred when the app, ""Dragon City"" was running while the battery died. I know that can be a flaky app so am curious as to whether others who have this problem are also running that app.UPDATE: One more piece of flakiness on the Galaxy Tab 3. My daughter was unable to connect to the internet on her tablet the other day, even though it was successfully connected to WiFi and our router was fine. Upon investigation, we saw that the Tab 3 had reset its date to 1/1/2012. Once we went in and manually updated the date/time to the correct values, the tablet was able to connect to the internet again. No idea what caused this, but it's apparently another common problem with this tablet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SV1DOF0TWRPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D02AGU4#wasThisHelpful","R3SV1DOF0TWRPI","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one of our laptops died, I was reminded just how precarious our precious digital memories can be: digital photos and videos can be wiped out if you're not doing regular backups. Fortunately we were able to salvage the hard drive from the laptop without losing anything. But it was the incentive I needed to install an automated network-based backup system.Since this comes with no hard drive, I combined this unit with the WD Red 3 TB NAS Hard Drive from Western Digital. Assembling the unit was a simple as sliding open the case, connecting the ribbon cable from the DiskStation to the hard drive and securing that with a couple of screws (which were included). Getting the unit up and running took maybe 30 to 45 minutes using the included software CD. I then used the Synology back-up software to create a scheduled (daily) backup task.  I also mapped the drive from my wife's Windows 8 laptop and used it as her backup drive for Windows 8's file versioning/backup system. Seems to be working fine on both machines.The initial back-up of all of my documents and media took the better part of a day (16+ hours), but knowing that all of my photos and videos are safely backed up on the network is a very nice feeling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EZ532YPDM51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRB9CK4#wasThisHelpful","R33EZ532YPDM51","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On our car (2006 Highlander Hybrid), this inverter isn't completely snug in the cup-holder, but it feels secure enough.

Energizer says there is a shared capacity of 2.1 amps on the USB ports, but we're not seeing anything near that. When my kids have a tablet and an iPod connected, the charge rate is so slow that it will only actually recharge the battery if the device is turned off.

I also put a bead of silicon around the edges of the spotlight lens and the solar panel itself after reading some reviews that said some moisture leaked into the spotlight - ""an ounce of prevention...""During the winter, with the reduced daylight hours and overcast weather we are only getting a few hours of illumination a night from this light but I'm expecting this to go up during the spring and summer.Update (1/25/14): though this is still winter and days are short, yesterday was a sunny day and when I checked the spotlight this morning, it was still going strong at 5:20 AM.  So this means it lasted over 12 hours. Considering how bright the light is (compared to other solar lights), this is really excellent performance.Update (04/07/15) - 16 months later, still going strong. As expected, the light performs best during the summer and doesn't do well on really dark cloudy days, but most days we still get bright light through the night from this little guy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8KF3C49YLUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5EJRQ0#wasThisHelpful","RT8KF3C49YLUL","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We needed a new shower body to replace a leaking old Pegasus shower body from Home Depot. After looking at several brands, we chose Hansgrohe for its elegance, simplicity and strong brand reputation. Along with the new valve/shower body, we picked up a new spout and trim to match.  This spout with diverter looks very nice but also feels solid in its operation.  Simply push in the button to divert the water from spout to shower and turn off the water (and back on) to disable the diverter and reroute the water to the spout.

"As others have stated, this toy does not hold up well.  It made it through one Halloween party but the trigger mechanism inside broke the second time my son played with it.  This made it more difficult to get the rat-atat-tat sound effects out of it, and made it a lot less fun.  Also, it's really small. This makes it less suitable as a gangster costume prop for an adult.If you want a good sized gun for an adult gangster costume, look at the airsoft pellet guns like the Thompson M1A1 Military Multirail Spring Airsoft Rifle or this one: Soft Air Thompson M1A1 AEG Airsoft Rifle Drum Magazine Version, ABS. The ""drum magazine"" version has that cool round ammo drum like the classic Tommy gun. These are more expensive but have higher resale value too since they are functional pellet guns.

"My kids (8 and 10) *LOVE* these things.  The 12-packs are their favorites as they have a couple of the Trashies visible on the outside but most are hidden inside (which gets the kids excited). They literally tear them open every time they get one to discover what treasures are hiding within.  It's nice to see Amazon actually selling the Trash Packs directly as previously they were only available through marketplace sellers at higher than retail prices. I hope this is a trend and Amazon starts carrying more Trash Packs items.In terms of this specific series (Series 4), my kids do like it, certainly more than the UFT trashies, which are their least favorite. New to Series 4 are the ""Mini Trashies"" which fit inside a Biter Trashie's mouth. Series 4 12-packs include 2 of these special edition Mini Trashies (usually in the lowest bins in the pack). On rare occasion, the Series 4 12-packs can also include Limited Edition Trashies.  These are numbered Trashies that are highly coveted by collectors (and kids), due to their rarity. Series 4 features one of the rarest Limited Editions ever made: Squish Bone (only 250 made), as well as 4 other Limited Edition Trashies (Festering Fowl, Rotting Rat, Foul Fish Bone and Cruddy Cow Skull).After getting *many* 12-packs, 5 packs and play sets from all five series (six if you include the UFTs), my kids are still hoping to find their first Limited Edition Trashie.

"I bought this case for my Galaxy S3 when it first came out and absolutely loved it... for a few months. The case protects the phone well and feels nice and grippy in the hands.  The kickstand is excellent for placing the phone at an angle in horizontal or vertical position.  But the case does not hold up well if dropped (even a short distance, like 2 feet) when the kickstand is open.  Tiny little plastic tabs at the top and bottom of the kickstand snap off if the case is dropped with kickstand open.  I had this happen once (dropped 3 feet onto a rug) then again when I purchased a second one (dropped two feet onto oak floor).I know no case is completely idiot proof, but to have two of these fail within a year under fairly normal circumstances was disappointing.  I've reached out to Aduro customer service to see if they can help.  Their warranty link on their web site appears to be broken.  Will update this review if I get a response.UPDATE: Aduro customer service was very responsive and shipped me a new case after sending them proof of purchase (a screen shot of my receipt).

"I purchased 10 of these to replace incandescent and CFL lights in my basement and other parts of the home.  Although I actually ordered the ""Daylight White"" bulbs, Amazon sent me the ""Warm White"" ones by mistake.  And I'm glad they did as the Warm White bulbs are definitely less blue-ish than the Daylight ones, and more like incandescent bulbs in color.  The color of the bulb is slightly whiter than incandescent but still pleasant-looking (not too stark), and the brightness seems about comparable with a 50-60 watt incandescent bulb with appreciably less electricity usage.  If the bulbs would last as long as their warranty period (or longer), I'd rate them a 4 or 5 star product.But less than 2 months after purchase, the first of the 10 bulbs has failed. It has only been used a few hours per week and now it simply won't turn on. ""Lighting Ever"" (the manufacturer) says they have a 3 year warranty on the bulb so I contacted them via their web site, and was told to fill out a form on Amazon for replacement.  I did that and the seller (Neon Mart) sent me a replacement, but it was a Daylight White bulb, not Warm White.  To be fair, Neon Mart sent me an exact replacement bulb for what was ordered, even though it was not what I received. They said they could only send me Daylight White bulbs because that's what appeared on the Amazon order.  So I contacted Amazon and they issued me a full refund for the purchase price of the bulb (gotta love Amazon!).Having one of the bulbs fail so early has me worried. I know it's a fairly small sample size (only 10 bulbs) but now I'm wondering how long the rest will last. The only way a bulb is worth $10 (to me) is if it saves money on electricity, looks good *and* lasts a long time. This bulb has the first two covered, but longevity is now a question mark. I will monitor the other bulbs and will update this review if/when any of the other bulbs fail.By the way, I expect to get some ""not helpful"" votes from the manufacturer, the seller, or their shills, so please counter these with ""helpful"" votes if you want this review to stay relevant and featured.UPDATES:(3/25/2014): It has been about a year and another of the original 10 bulbs is now flickering instead of staying lit solid. So that's a 20% failure rate after a year. I have contacted the seller about getting the bulb replaced under warranty and they said that they do not expect to have stock for quite a while so they refunded my purchase price. While this is very good service, I'd prefer to have bulbs that work properly. I have ordered a few of the newer Philips 11-watt A19 LED bulbs, for about $1 more as well as Philips 10.5-watt Slim Style Dimmable A19 LED Light Bulb, Soft White. These are both brighter and are dimmable. I've only had them about 2 weeks, but so far so good.(3/30/14): Poof. There goes another one. 3 out of 10 down (30%) after 13 months. I should note that the fixtures these are in are solid (one is brand new) and we have not seen any issues with our electricity service. And other LED, CFL and incandescent bulbs have not suffered premature failure in our home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLXUH3151KRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OBEDSM#wasThisHelpful","R3SLXUH3151KRJ","A24J2Y1O22JYZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24J2Y1O22JYZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, I ordered this 2-pack of Energizer N size batteries on Amazon because it was less than half the price of a comparable item at Radio Shack (and the item ships free). The marketplace supplier I chose was ""MyOfficeInnovations."" A few days later, UPS showed up at my door with a 12-inch square, 6-inch high box. Inside was the single two-pack of batteries! A bit wasteful, I guess, but also impressive! I can't see how the company can possibly make any money on this, paying for UPS shipping and charging under $3 for two batteries, when other stores sell the battery for twice the cost, but I'm certainly satisfied with the service.As for the product itself, I have no complaints: genuine Energizer Max batteries (or at least they appear to be), with an expiration date of 3-2017.

"When my iPad charger cable was lost in an office move, I went hunting for a new one on Amazon. The no-name branded cables were cheap but they seemed pretty hit or miss so I went with the iSmooth 30-pin USB cable.  A decent price, free shipping and lots of enthusiastic reviews.  The cable arrived quickly, and is quite well made, making a secure connection on both ends, with rounded edges on the 30-pin end just like the original cable.But inside the packaging were a couple of things that caught my eye: a plea for Amazon reviews on a little insert card and even an offer of a FREE CABLE for those who do choose to write a review.  So here I am, writing a cable review in exchange for another free cable.  ""There are no catches or asterisks"" the offer says, so even though I'm being completely honest about why I'm writing the review, they still have to send me one.

"My wife says I have a cable fetish. Fiberoptic digital cables, HDMI cables, component video cables, Lightning/USB cables, 30-pin cables, spools of phone and coax cable. You name it, I've got it. Bins full of the stuff. So I guess I'm a bit of a cable connoisseur. When the data/charging cable included with our Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 went bad from being abused (don't worry, the child responsible has been offered up for adoption), I came to Amazon to buy a replacement (cable, not child). This bulk packaged cable caught my eye, mostly due to the low price and other positive reviews.The cable arrived quickly, packaging was nothing special (you can't judge a book by its cover), but the cable itself is indistinguishable from the original that came with the tablet.  It's soft and pliable, yet at the same time supple and firm.  It forms a snug, secure connection on both the USB and 30-pin end, and works perfectly for charging and for data transfer.  In short, a great cable at a nice price.  Excuse me while I explain to the new children how to properly treat a cable.UPDATE (4/14): one year later, this cable is still going strong (and so are the new children). I should mention that my cable was fulfilled by Amazon from a seller called ""HK Seller.""

"After some negative reviews of the larger AP-300PH I was a little worried that this unit might be loud but it isn't.  Even at its ""Turbo"" speed, the AP-230PH generates a not-very-annoying white noise background sound that is easy to ignore.

"This a quick and dirty solution to USB port shortage on a Windows or Android tablet. It is essentially an OTG cable, but with two heads instead of one, and a third head that will let you power your accessories - but not the device itself - from an external USB power adapter.So what's an ""OTG"" cable - essentially it has tricky wiring inside that changes the micro USB power port on Windows and Android tablets into a regular USB port to which you can attach accessories.NOTE: so far as I have found, all Windows tablets will let you turn your micro USB charging port into a regular USB port to attach a keyboard or mouse or both (since this has two active heads) BUT not all Android phones and tablets have this OTG capability, check the details of your phone or tablet first!About the ""charger port"" for your phone or tablet charger: to repeat, that's to deliver power to your ACCESSORIES, not to your phone or tablet. The tablet or phone port probably doesn't deliver much power to accessories - the port was designed to charge the tablet or phone, not to power some accessory - so it's really important to have this third port to power your keyboard and mouse off your charger. Just don't have a heart attack if you plug your charger in, and the battery keeps running down on your phone or tablet.

"This and the Oral B Pulsar are both excellent alternatives to manual brushing and expensive rechargeable, docking electric tooth brushes. They take different approaches - the 3d rotates the bristles, the Pulsar just vibrates them. The 3d is better is your manual brushing technique is a little weak - you just have to move the 3d head around gently. The Pulsar, when fresh, is actually better for dislodging plaque just below the gum line and between teeth - it's a more subtle motion at the tooth. You'll have to - should - try both to see which works best for you.

"This...or the Moto G 2015?Similarity:* Same Snapdragon 410 processor, using the ARM A53 architecture that is replacing the A7 architecture in the venerable Snapdragon 400, in both phones. NOTE: this only applies to the LTE version of the 2nd gen Moto E - the ""USA"" and ""International"" 3g versions of the Moto E are still using the Snapdragon 200 which gets slammed by online reviewers as being underpowered and not even as power-thrifty as the new, more efficient, 410 series. The Snapdragon 410 seems to be turning in 10% better performance than the old 400. This isn't due to the Snapdragon 410 being 64bit - which it is - because Motorola is running it in 32bit mode. It's due to better firmware, better chip design.Difference:*$179 for the Moto G direct from Motorola, unlocked and with both AT&T and T-Mobile 3g (actually 3.5g) and LTE bands.*$75 for the Moto E 2nd gen from AT&T, locked to AT&T for six months of active, paid up service. Then you can generally get AT&T to unlock it. Since GoPhone has the same great coverage and speeds as AT&T, my main reason for an unlock would to use it for travel.Similarity:* Generally the same design cues - shape, color - but the E is 4.5"" vs. 5.0"" for the G, a big difference you will notice right away.* Both can be expanded with 16gb, 32gb, 64gb (may require reformatting) micro SD cards.* Both have single front firing speaker - the E's is hidden in the ear speaker slot, the G's is in a separate grill at the bottom. One online review tested the G at higher speakerphone volumes than the E, but to my ears, the E is louder. Both will play right up to highest indicated volume levels with little to no distortion. Both beat the pants off any rear-firing speaker, if you want to watch YouTube without plugging in earphones.*Both have extraordinarily long active life - like playing a YouTube video in a loop. I tested my E at 8 hours at 85% brightness, the G at 8.5 hours. Online reviewers got in excess of 10 hours with 50% brightness. Standby battery life - in sleep mode - is not nearly as good, nowhere near the outstanding sleep mode endurance of iPhones and Windows Lumia phones.Difference:* 4.5"" screen at 600p resolution (approximate) on the E; 5.0"" screen with HD resolution, 720p on the G. The G is better as a micro-tablet simply for the HD resolution and ability to see a desktop version of a webpage all at once on the screen without scrolling. On the other hand the E is much cheaper, much more pocketable (and fits into more legacy small phone slots in backpacks and other bags), has the same splendid vibrancy and colors as the G, and works really really well with apps like 3rd party messenger apps like Line, Viber, WhatsApp. RECOMMENDATION: if you spend a LOT of time on FaceBook or Instagram and like larger pictures with dazzling sharpness, you really have to upgrade to the G. If you look for what friends are wearing or doing or whether they are smiling or grimacing - the E is perfectly fine. It's just that pictures you take and pictures you look at won't have that ""technicolor impact"" until you revisit them on a tablet or computer at home. YES THE TYPE IS PLENTY SHARP FOR READING, it's not like an old-fashioned computer monitor. You can read Kindle without any eyestrain, forever.Similarity:* Both are super fast if you have a good LTE connection (your area isn't swamped with other users). Unlike Cricket, which limits download speeds to 8mBps, GoPhone gives you unthrottled, full speed downloads. (Go figure - both are now AT&T companies.)Difference:* You can get the G in 16gb; the E is limited to 8gb. Fortunately, Android 5.1 lets you move a lot of apps to run on the SD card on either phone.* No prepaid carrier seems to be offering the G in their lineup, just the E. So pricing is much better on the E - you can get prepaid plan discount pricing, instead of paying full retail. For example, currently the unlocked LTE E is $99 from Amazon, while if you buy the GoPhone version it's just $75. During the holidays, I wouldn't be surprised to see AT&T offer additional discounts on the E. NOTE: the bands on the E from AT&T do NOT, according to AT&T's website, include all the bands used by T-Mobile - but the unlocked, $99-$120 version here does. So study up on the bands you need for YOUR carrier before you buy. I like the AT&T configuration better, since the 3.5g HSPA+ bands they DO include are more compatible with the foreign carriers I use when traveling.Finally - this is a solid, compact, modern ""candy bar"" phone. Motorola has been very good with updating the software, unlike most manufacturers who leave you frozen in time even if Google releases a new version of Android fairly quickly. I love Motorola for that, and for the clean, stock Android interface. You will have about 4gb of app space free when you boot up; I quickly used a gig of that on a minimal app install list. No Google apps will move to the SD card; I'm hoping more of the 3rd party apps will. But keep in mind this is budget phone, aimed at teenagers hanging out on FB, Snapchat, and Line (or similar 3rd party message app).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5GCIF7XJB83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147PORC0#wasThisHelpful","R3V5GCIF7XJB83","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my wife since she doesn't like to take the time to put in earphones. She watches foreign television, streaming, on her iPad Mini. I thought the foreign soundtrack was low quality, but actually the built-in speaker in the iPad Mini just isn't that good for quality extended listening. This is much better, plus it is so compact it is easy to find a place to put it.Don't underestimate the importance of the Bluetooth which means no speaker cord required. When I tried to get her remote speakers in the past, the speaker cords bothered her a lot, getting in the way. Bluetooth solves that problem neatly.Pairing is a cinch. You can't do it on the iPad Mini from the swipe up menu. You have to go into Settings, Bluetooth, then look for the Amazon device to pop up. Once it pops up, you just tap on it and you are done.One cool feature I didn't know about Bluetooth speakers: you adjust the volume on the iPad, you don't have to reach for the speaker.My wife is forgetful about turning stuff off. Since the battery is rechargeable, that's not a problem. It charges off an Android or Windows phone charging cable (standard micro USB).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2628P60C3WU73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLJ5EVO#wasThisHelpful","R2628P60C3WU73","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect fit, no ""flashing"" (untrimmed material from mold) along any edge, cut-outs perfect.This is TPU - cases for phones come in 3 basic material types:1. Hard brittle plastic. The thinnest, mostly useful for keeping fingers off the camera lens, and for providing a ""lip"" around the screen so the screen won't contact the surface of an end-table or other flat surface. Not much phone protection, except for eliminating scratches on the back. Great if you don't drop and want the slimmest, lightest case.2. ""Gummy"" or ""soft silicone"" cases - the thickest of the three, often wrap over the screen front more, because otherwise they can deform from normal hand pressures and slip off a corner. I put one of these on my 8 y.o.'s iPad - much too fat and heavy for me, but essential for some users. I have one on my 2009 iPod Touch, but I don't see these for phones any more - too fat.3. THIS ONE - thermoplastic polyurethane or TPU, which is the in-between style - thicker than hard plastic, much softer; not as thick or as soft as gummy. It's probably the most common type. The best material for cellphones, because there is a lot of protection, but very little added bulk and weight.The Cimo is half-frosted, half clear on the back. As a nice touch, there are some ""dotted"" surface areas along the edges to improve grip. The buttons all operate easily under the cover - the volume rocker and on-off are covered, which prevents dust from entering.If they had black when I got my Lumia 640 - it was a pre-public roll-out at Walmart for $79 locked to GoPhone (AT&T's prepaid division) - I would have gotten one of those instead, since my case is black anyway. You may prefer translucent/clear, if you have one of the brightly covered cases. I see they have black now! :-(BTW, the 640 is great!I ordered mine from CIMO Technologies, the importer and/or manufacturer. Amazon didn't stock and ship this directly when I ordered, but that worked out best for me since I dropped out of Prime ($99?) and CIMO shipped right away by Post Office. Unlike some Asian marketplace sellers, this was stocked in, and shipped from, a USA location - it got here in only a couple of days. Now that Amazon has taken over fulfilment, Prime members can get this in 2 days with no minimum purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NEPAI0C6I2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKVVA1Q#wasThisHelpful","R18NEPAI0C6I2M","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this simply because it was on sale for $79 - you can't beat that, based on the good specs, right? In this case, the build and operating quality exceed expectations, and match that of $300 phones (and $300 phones from Huawei, Alcatel, ZTE are pretty darn good these days).Some set-up notes to help you:1. Make sure you have your old phone backed up - Android and Apple phones back up automatically. If you have photos and videos set to auto-back up on your old Android phone, they will be there for you when you log into your new phone. I wouldn't factory reset your old Android phone right away, though, just in case. If you are coming from an older iPhone, things get a little trickier. Apple iCloud isn't available on an Android or Windows phone, so you need to make sure your pictures and videos are backed up to an alternate service - Dropbox, Box, Microsoft OneDrive, Flickr or the best yet, Google+. Telling you how to do that is beyond the scope of this article, so research it online or enlist a friend's help (it can be as simple as downloading the app, signing in, telling it to upload, and being patient). Once again, don't reset your iPhone until you feel comfortable.2. You need a Gmail account to sign in onto the phone. You probably already have one, otherwise you can sign up on the phone itself.3. You need to put a SIM in. Probably in SIM slot one - read the tiny manual in the box. I'm presently trying this out in tablet mode, so I don't have the answer on the tip of my tongue. But one thing for sure - on most dual SIM phones, only one SIM can use high speed data, so it DOES make a difference. (The other SIM will probably use slower 2G data.)4. I don't recommend backing up from your old Android phone's online Google backup. It may take a little extra time to remember and manually install your favorite apps, but it's a cleaner way to install, never hangs the phone (I've had some phones just stall out), and is like spring cleaning - you'll find some apps you never use, just hogging up space.5. This is a pretty stock Android user interface, thankfully, with practically no bloatware programs. That's welcome in terms of housekeeping, and essential in terms of making the most of your 8gb of storage. I had about 5gb before downloading my apps and 4gb after, no SD card installed yet (I have a card on order from Amazon now).6. If you are going to install a micro SD card, there are good deals on Amazon, with Samsung and Sandisk very popular. 32gb goes for about $16 and 64gb goes for about $32. Class 10 UH1 at a minimum is best, and no biggie in terms of premium. Amazon's own stock - not marketplace - is the most reliable. Install the micro SD FIRST before booting up, and before you download any programs, go into Settings- Storage-Install Apps to SD card and select that option; if you don't, you can't move programs to the SD card later, without re-formatting the SD card AND factor re-setting your phone OR uninstalling then reinstalling the app. You want to use the SD card for apps and storage as much as possible to reserve on-board storage for the many programs that won't install to the SD card.7. For some strange reason, the stock keyboard is AOSP (Android Open Source stock keyboard) but I downloaded the Google Keyboard, which has swipe text entry as an option, from the Play Store. Unfortunately it kept crashing on me, ymmv, but be forewarned. Fleksy worked fine.8. To get rid of vibrate on keypress, you need to toggle options in TWO places: the keyboard settings for your default keyboard, found under ""Language & Input"", and the sound settings, of all places, under ""Audio profiles"". Root around in those two categories and you can un-check the appropriate boxes.9. While you are in ""Sound,"" un-check the box for enhancing the speaker sound; all this does on mine is make the speaker crackle at a middle volume level - with the box un-checked, it sounds like most other speakers in smartphones. It isn't a weak speaker, btw, at least not on my sample.10. In the ""Display"" setting category, turn off ""screen adjust mode"", because this has a nearly 3000 mAh battery and you shouldn't be sacrificing ANY screen quality to eke out a little more battery life. On the other hand, I left ""ClearMotion"" turned on, this is a ""Video fluency enhancer"" whatever that means, but if I end up finding the video a little weird, I'll turn it off. (This is non-standard function, btw.)11. Go into the ""Battery"" setting category and un-check the ""CPU power saving mode"" which throttles your octa core performance to ""conserve battery life and lower device temperature."" If you don't like your resulting battery life, you can turn it back on later. Please note that I turned this feature off, but when I came back to write this review, it had turned itself back on, so keep an eye on this setting.General comments:Phone box included good looking, white earbuds (no soft silicone tips) that remind me of the first Apple earbuds.Phone box also included a translucent, thin, medium soft (not gummy) silicone case with perfect fit, perfect cut-outs, easy to operate volume and on-off covered sections; a spare screen protector (there is also one pre-installed, perfectly, no bubbles); a 5 watt, super narrow (narrower than Apple or Samsung cube) charge; and a white, medium short, USB cable.I got about 27,000 on one Antutu test run and 28,000 on another.The translucency of the included case is just right so you can see the phone color but the BLU logo is subdued.The phone is super narrow for a 5.5"" screen, the side bezels are super narrow. BUT, there is a lot of bezel on top and bottom. Net result, the phone probably couldn't be any narrower, and the slim case doesn't add much to that, but it is much taller than it needs to be.The attached screen protector is clear, smooth, and doesn't seem to affect screen color or viewing quality. Since I distrust these things, though, I removed it after giving the phone an initial workout. Turns out glass underneath is pretty grabby, the grabbiest ever with an Amazon screen stylus. You won't notice this if you use fingertips, like most people. BUT if you like to use a stylus, try for a while before removing the screen protector. Since the glass doesn't appear to be oleophobic (oil hence fingerprint resistant) expect to clean the screen more often than with some phones.Since I haven't dropped a SIM in yet, I can't speak to cellular call quality, but I tried Skype and Google Hangout calls in both regular and speakerphone modes and everything sounded great.Rear cover of phone snaps on perfectly with no mismatched cover-to-body spots.Screen seems of good quality, but give me a couple of weeks and I'll update.My initial reaction is that this is a carefully designed, well-thought out, well-built phone. BLU did a superb job here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLF92HWOCXX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAKR5IQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OLF92HWOCXX9","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Get this one, NOT the ""newer model"" in 24"", the ""newer"" model isn't 100% sRGB capable PLUS factory calibrated (most factories skip individual calibration to match minor variations in electronice and screens). This is the model I am reviewing: VX2370SMH-LED 23-Inch.4 years ago I bought one of the early consumer-grade Viewsonic IPS monitors, the VP2365WB 23-Inch, and it couldn't hold a candle to this VX2370SMH. I got rid of it and replaced it with an LG.And the LG can't hold a candle to this VX2370SMH! I kept reverting to my iPad for quality video watching before getting this Viewsonic. Now, in a dark room, this Viewsonic is ALMOST but not quite as good my my iPad 4 - which is a huge step in the right direction, given the $149 cost of this 23"" IPS, 100% sRGB, factory calibrated monitor. The only better option would be an iMac - Apple puts fantastic screens on those puppies. But trust me, this Viewsonic is the much more ""pocket book friendly"" alternative. I am running mine, ironically, off a Mac Mini, but of course you can turn this monitor off a Chromebox of Windows computer as well - or even off a tablet if you have an HDMI output.Now for some minor pluses and minuses:+ I like the tilting feature. If I am seated on my Swiss ball, I'm eye-level and the monitor is straight up and down. If I (somewhat precariously) kneel on the Swiss ball, that puts my eyes way above the monitor, but compared to the LG I can tilt the monitor back just like a laptop screen for a more uniform distance-to-eyes at both the top AND the bottom.- I HATE the on-off switch button location on the pedestal...at the pedestal TOP, almost buried - I take that back, ACTUALLY buried - under the bottom edge of the screen.- I wish this had a SECOND HDMI port. In terms of VGA and DVI, it's generous, it comes with those ports, but HDMI is so convenient these days, I wish I had a second port so I could switch to another device without unhooking a cable.+ I ""downsized"", very knowingly and deliberately, from a 27"" monitor to this 23"". The RIGHT SIZE is dependent on your sitting distance from the screen, if you are using the monitor for full-screen video watching, which I do a lot. I could have probably gotten by with a 21"". The 27"" was overkill, like sitting in one of the front rows at a movie theater.I don't know how long this monitor will be available. The so-called replacement has one nice new feature - flicker-free backlight adjustment by using an analog power source for the LED's instead of ""digitial pulse modulation"" which essentially means turning the LED's on and off at a rapid rate at the same power to raise or lower illumination. In any case, if you find your way over to the Viewsonic web page to look for different models and sizes, this is the ""magic text"" you should look for, QUOTE: ""sRGB Color Correction Technology Delivers the Most Accurate Color Performance Available ViewSonic LED monitors embedded sRGB color correction technology reproduce 100% sRGB rich color for color performance matching original input sources without decreasing or leveraging color quality. sRGB ensures all displayed images/videos are as natural as the original sources, displaying real color for captured camera and camcorder content.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OY2I1RD8AVSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RM235I#wasThisHelpful","R2OY2I1RD8AVSD","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not as good as your fingertip. On the other hand, never greasy, never smudges.So I make a simple compromise:1. If I am watching videos, I use this to keep the screen pristine. The stylus is more than accurate enough in that setting.2. If I am browsing content, I use my fingertip and just pay the piper and Windex the screen once in a while.So - what are the stylus-related problems I face? Believe it or not, accuracy ISN'T one of them! But ""missed taps"" are, and when scrolling content which is a mix of active (touch to activate) and passive content, I get too many unintended activations - windows popping up! - that I don't get with ordinary ""finger tip"" control.I regret getting this Amazon version with the ""finger loop"" on the end I'll have to remove the loop and find another use for it. Think twice about whether you want this zipper-pull version, I got it because it was the only black one, but if I could do it over, I'd get the one with the pocket clip.If the ""rubber tip"" on this gets oily over time, use some rubbing alcohol (maybe some fingernail polish remover, but it might dissolve the tip) or other degreaser to gently remove the oil or grease.One thing I learned for sure - once you start using a stylus, you'll keep using it, the screens stay a lot cleaner (this works on ANY modern finger tip sensitive touch screen, just not on the old plastic Palm Pilot ""pressure type"" screens).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26B64YAB2GEPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GCJEZU#wasThisHelpful","R26B64YAB2GEPL","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: The scallops on the serrated side of this Mini Pal blade face up, if you are right handed and use this to whittle a pencil tip.This means the flat side is ""down"" for greater control in whittling - Emerson places his serrations on his chisel-ground combat knives on the opposite side, and if I try to whittle with an Emerson, it ""bites"" too deep and unpredictably.Curiously enough, the Mini Pal's ""slightly bigger brother,"" the Urban Pal (1.5"") are also on the ""Emerson-side."" You can see the difference in the pictures I will attach.I prefer the 1.5"" blade length of the Urban Pal over the 1"" length of this Mini Pal - the Urban Pal is closer to the minimum usable blade length of micro-pocket knifes like the classic Spydero Lady Bug or the Cold Steel Micro Recon.HOWEVER, the pictures will show that the Urban Pal is probably just too large for a key ring, while the Mini Pal is much more conveniently sized.Note that this new generation Mini Pal has a purely ""friction"" sheath, compared with the last generation which had a snap lock (released with a squeeze on the side lever). The sheath is nice and snug, however, so don't fear accidental slippage (caution: make sure the blade tip is actually IN the mouth of the sheath while putting it back in, or grip the top ridge of the sheath, so you don't poke yourself if you make a mistake - this actually applies to returning any blade to its sheath or scabbard).Also note that there is no way to tell by ""feel"" whether the blade will be ""up"" or ""down"" when you pull it out. You can fix this by wrapping a tiny rubber band, or some electrician's tape, around one handle side only so you can tell blade orientation purely by feel.No sharpening is possible, except on the very tip of the blade which is plain-edged, since the the serrations are simply too narrow squeeze in even the edge of a triangular ceramic rod to re-sharpen. Likewise, no factory resharpening is offered by Cold Steel. However, the serrations have a long life and most sharpening services I've run into are willing to re-grind this to a conventional non-serrated plain edge at the end-of-life for the serrations, after which you can re-sharpen on your own with ceramic rods or a whetstone just like any other knife.(If you choke up on the blade for opening packages - a good idea anyway to avoid over-penetration into the contents - you will greatly extend the useful blade life, since the tip CAN be resharpened at home.)My best suggested use is attaching this to a Photon light. Really great to have a tiny, bright, long-lived light in combination with a handy utility knife. Unlike a pocket knife (like the earlier mentioned Lady Bug and Micro Recon) this won't accidentally partially open if dropped on the floor or jarred in your pocket.The photos show the Urban Pal and this smaller Mini Pal side by side, both inside their respective sheaths and outside, both sides of each blade, and relative sizes in the hand in the ""utility hold"" position which is more accurate for whittling than ""handle between the fingers.""Usual ""street price"" for this is $18-$19 and, as always, a search engine is your friend in looking for a fair deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G8VJPTEBXG87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WVJCO7A#wasThisHelpful","R2G8VJPTEBXG87","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have both HP Windows tablets, the HP Stream 7 and the Stream 8. I liked the 7 so much, I got the 8, and I liked the Fintie SlimShell case so much for the 7, that I got the one for the 8 too.Note that if the product name or description doesn't say ""SlimShell,"" you will be getting a version that has flaps of material that wrap over each end of the Stream 7 and 8 to hold the tablet in place.In the SlimShell version, the tablets just snap into the hard-shell plastic corners. I prefer the lighter weight and lower bulk of this design. It is very similar in concept and execution to the Apple Smart Case, except the Fintie has a hard plastic shell on the back, which is covered, except the sides, with the same ""leatherette"" used on the front 3-sectioned folding cover.The cover is very similar to Apple Smart Covers - it is leatherette lined with microfiber to be gentle to the screen.The cover also has two magnets, which match to the bottom of the case to keep the cover closed; you can fold the cover into a triangle to act as a reasonably decent stand for the tablet, if you want to watch a video on your desktop or want to have a go at using an accessory BlueTooth keyboard (I recommend the Amazon Basics) for typing. Fintie also makes a Folio Edition with a built-in keyboard, but I haven't tried it.The single big negative of this cover/case is that it makes an already fat and heavy tablet that much bulkier and heavier. However, Windows is all about getting some real work done, and I really trust this to protect either Stream when placed in my daypack.

"Thinner than a gummy case. Not as thin as the new Totallee ultrathin iPhone 6 cases. Clear plastic acrylic plastic, likely to scuff and scratch (I would have preferred frosted, but you may prefer clear).Curious front panel design - it clamps onto the metal band running around the screen edge - so it doesn't rise up over the glass panel. This means there isn't any ridge to protect the screen if you set it face down on a counter. If you carry your phone in a pocket this won't matter, since the screen will just rub against fabric. Or if you use a screen protector it doesn't matter. I'm not sure it the ""below the rim"" clamping position is a feature or a bug - you know how that goes. Some users will welcome it if they like to swipe in from the screen edge.Less protective than a gummy style case. Probably the most compact case out there, at least it is for me so far. I will probably swap this in and out with a wrap-around gummy case, depending on how I'm carrying and using the phone.The lens on the back is of course surrounded by a plastic cut-out.In terms of fit there are no issues.

Once upon a time, pocket knives were ""disfavored"" by a hodge-podge of local laws and descriptions. It was tough to get much more than a slip-joint (non-locking) short-bladed folder that you could legally carry where it belongs, in your pocket.In 1963, though, Buck began internal development which revolutionized what we expected from, what we accepted, in folding knives despite anti-knife laws. Buck's internal mandate was to build a ""folding hunter"" that would be functionally as good for hunters and farm workers as as their fixed-blade approximately 4"" waist sheath hunter.They did it, laws be darned, in 1964 with the 3.75"" 110 Folding Hunter.In order to carry legally, they included a waist sheath.Eventually, municipalities and states came to their senses (not New York, of course), and allowed pocket carry of most folders. Today, we even get ""assisted openers."" Of course if you have a 110 in your collection - and as one of the last of the quality, budget, American made folders, you should - you recognize that the 110 is too darn heavy. (With the possible exception of the PaperStone edition.)Now let's take another detour through history.The next two huge technological changes in folders were the invention of opening holes (give credit to Saul Glesser at Spyderco) and the huge rush to ""tactical"" or at least ""tactical looking"" folders. Since the big, round Spydie hole was patented, other makers moved to thumb studs and disks and later smaller, oval holes. In terms of tactical folders, the blade designs became less useful for everyday chores like kitchen paring (and hunting) and more dramatically (theatrically?) aimed at last ditch fighting - despite the fact that modern armies prefer assault rifles over swords, and side arms over bayonets.Now we've come full cycle. The utility folder, again. AND THE RAT IS ONE OF THE BEST. Fat handle for easy grip. Thumb studs on both sides for ambidextrous opening. FFG (full flat grind) for cutting efficiency, with drop point for blade strength (ever seen Buck 110's with that pointy clip point broken off?). Edge lock for simplicity (I prefer lock-backs, but they are somewhat prone to dirt getting in the lock-joint, and theoretically subject to accidental release from pressure along the spine of the handle).Here are some pros and cons of this particular model:+ Satin finish (not stonewash) blade in classic drop blade says ""working knife,"" not ""tactical.""+ On mine, a solid detent to keep it closed in pocket, but allow relatively easy opening. Very easy once you come off the ball-bearing.+ Comfortable handles.+ Easy to close.+ Incredibly sharp from the factory.+ Well-proven steel that holds its edge well enough, and is easier to sharpen than some harder steels. Well-proven toughness, not brittle.+ Cut-out at front handle is protective.+ Nice thumb-ramp for locating (""indexing"") your thumb.+ Removable fasteners in case you every need to tighten them.+ Bronze, not Teflon plastic, washers are smooth for opening and more durable.+ Blade is centered and doesn't wobble.- Handle isn't very grippy at all. I recommend Gun Tape. But the smoothness helps pulling it off your pants seam if you use the pocket clip.- As with every folder I have except Spydies, if you are in panic mode the thumb studs are not reliable. The Spydie big hole is hard to miss with your thumb, and allows a more secure grip on the handle. You can test this yourself by taping up your favorite folder's blade with electrical tape (for safety) and having your spouse or roommate set a timer - when the timer goes off, your job is to get the knife out and open as quickly as humanly possible, without dropping it or flinging it around. As one reviewer noted, by reversing the pocket clip location you can improve your grip on the handle while opening.- Weighs a lot less than a Buck 110, but almost as thick.AND THE FINAL, HUGE, PLUS:This is a cheap (to buy) folder built like a $70 knife. The quality far exceeds the price. Also, as of the date of this review, it is made in Taiwan, currently a slight step up from the best Chinese folders (like Kershaws) albeit a slight step down from Seki City Japan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVWE4LUJB4AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013ASG3E#wasThisHelpful","RTVWE4LUJB4AD","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a review of the classic Buck 110 Folding Hunter, just of the new handle, Paperstone.Forget the ""paper"". This has more in common with kitchen counters - rock solid, rock like, not paper-like at all. You can Google ""Paperstone"" to find out exactly how it is made; it uses thin layers of special paper soaked in hard resin.The main advantage of ""Paperstone"" as used here is a much lighter handle than on conventional Buck 110's. Buck's earlier effort in this direction, using Bakelite on their all-plastic handled 110 variants, wasn't nearly as successful - those knives look ugly to my eyes, and the handles over thick. The only negative to the Paperstone is the somewhat sharp edges on the open side.Buck appears to have discontinued the Paperstone 110 line, so you will have to find old-inventory, or used, at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V0BW6P9GEEF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037SN8HY#wasThisHelpful","R1V0BW6P9GEEF2","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From my review of the identical (materials, workmanship, finish - but of course made for a different phone) Noot I got for my Lumia 635 (yes, I own a 520 too):Superb - hardshell polycarbonate (not soft rubber or silicone, not thick), super thin, ""rubberized"" treatment on surface feels great and looks great. SURPRISINGLY this looks like ""design school"" work in terms of fine lines and details, not like the typical ""gets the job done"" shapeless blobs - just an ultra-slight curve here and there makes a difference.COMPARES TO the soft, thicker cases, probably less drop protection, but you still get corner protection, and the case ""claws around"" the front of the screen at the long sides so you can now set your phone face-side down on a counter and not worry about scratches.CUTOUTS for all controls and ports, so total sensitivity to on-off, volume up-and-down. Since those controls are slightly recessed, less chance of accidental operation. If your phone lives in a ""linty"" place (think: pocket lint), those open controls are more subject to lint-intrusion than a soft thick plastic ""complete cover"" case. However, I moved to this poly-carb case from a medium thick soft plastic case and honestly, the phone now looks a lot better.The case won't show finger prints (the soft-rubberized surface treatment) BUT will pick up streaks if your face is oily (from making calls). The oil smear will rub out easily.ADDITIONAL to 520 case: the ""claw lips"" that rise over the front aren't sharp like some snap-on hardshell cases I've had before - they feel great, not sharp. Also, the Noot for my 635 made the 635 look better, but the improvements with the smaller 520 are even more pronounced, due to a combination of smaller phone size for the 520 and slightly different edge-rounding on the 520. I fell in love with the 520 because it is a true ""candy bar"" phone with simple, beautiful lines that don't try to hide the fact that it uses modern materials like plastics. This Noot preserves more of that appeal, thanks to its matte black rubberized surface than any other case I've used, while still keeping my fingers off the camera lens, and protecting the lens and front screen whether placed face or back down on a counter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PF1WXX2IXSCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXCC4RK#wasThisHelpful","R2PF1WXX2IXSCZ","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating is based on (1) price - under $20; and (2) made in America factor - one of the few companies that still make knives in America, and there is a charm to that, and they use sturdy steels and have good heat treatment/quenching. The edge is often less than smooth, but sharp (not crazy sharp like Cold Steel) but you can change that if you like. Very little axis wobble. Clip is non-removable, if you want a sleeker profile. ORANGE HANDLE helps you find it.CAUTION: I have an older edition of this, and noticed that the ""spring"" is too weak to auto-close the blade if I pull it half an inch out. This can affect safety if the blade works slightly open in your pocket - it won't close itself and you could poke yourself. This current edition has more ""snap"" and returns to closed position from an accidental partial open. Curiously, both samples I have are too ""stiff"" to ""snap"" open with a wrist flick. I probably just have a defective sample and will return it to Buck for servicing.Overall, though I feel this is one of the best utility knife bargains on the planet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQS51U80PB04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5X9XZS#wasThisHelpful","R1UQS51U80PB04","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never unwind mine, so cord wear and stress is not a problem - the charger cable on the other side of my power brick is plenty long enough for kitchen-counter charging, or floor charging in a hotel room overnight. So there is very little stress ever placed on this retractable's cord. I just wanted something a lot shorter than the ridiculously long, thick, bulky wall-outlet cord that came with the power-brick style charger on my Toshiba Chromebook 2. 1 foot conventional lamp-cord replacements are another alternative, but hard to find.NOTE: this strategy (don't unwind) works best if you have a laptop, like the modern Chromebooks, that has incredibly long 8-12 hour battery life. With this kind of modern battery life (compared to 1.5 hours on an old 15.6"" laptop), you can used your device completely unplugged at a cafe all day, then charge overnight at home, and don't worry about lugging around a power brick to a cafe. If you charge on the floor, the stock lamp-cord that comes with your laptop is fine. On a kitchen counter, I prefer this short, non-bulky replacement. ON TRIPS it's almost an essential, so save space in carry-on.And yes, in a pinch, I can unwind this and use on a business trip if I forgot to recharge my Chromebook before leaving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8P6HV890NMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DWR4A4#wasThisHelpful","R1J8P6HV890NMM","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That having been said, I'd buy another in an instant if it had the microphone hole, it's a near clone of the much more expensive Belkin edition. If Amazon made this in MATTE black to resist fingerprints, it would be superb. Given its shortcomings, it's 3 Star if you have a Mini 2 or 3 (it will work if you can give up one the two built-in microphones) and 4 Star for the original Mini (deduct one star for the finger print issue).BEST ASPECT is thin & light. If you plan on putting it on, then taking it off for Skype/Facetime, be advised you can crack the corners if you put it on and take it off often, or in a rush.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9GE0GJ816J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPKITZC#wasThisHelpful","R1O9GE0GJ816J","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agonized over getting this, since I already have a silver 530, the predecessor with the Zytel handle and ""dagger""-styled blade (sharpened only on one side, but styled to look double-edged). As it turns out, I like the new 531 a lot:+ The non-dagger blade style is so much more ""sheeple"" friendly, although every knife is bound to scare someone, sometime, in some situation. (I'm talking peeling an apple here, or opening a package.)+ The new G10 handles are SO much more solid-feeling than the previous Zytel. Zytel is tried-and-true, but the handles on the 531 are SO slim that they benefit from the stiffer G10.+ The G10 is ""grippier"" and the raised edges around the perimeter are sharp and grabby. Yes, sharp-edged feels good to me, very tactile, if you use this for a lot of whittling, there are knives with ""friendlier"" handles. But the 530/531 Mel Pardue classic has always been about super thin, super light, with an Emerson-length blade.+ The tried and true Axis lock won't accidentally unlock during use, and is remarkably easy to open (you don't have to put force on the blade to move it during unlock, unlike some stiff traditional lock-blades along the spine).- Not recommended for pocket carry if the knife will shift around a lot, I can see the raised perimeter edge being a little abrasive.- Not recommended if you are sane and on a budget. On the other hand -+ Superbly Made in America. Out of all-around quality materials.- Clip pushes the knife up high, if you use pocket-clipped carry. I understand Benchmade has a ""low ride"" clip available as an accessory.If you have questions or need pix, just ask.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4SJF4LOMHDQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT4XNGW#wasThisHelpful","R4SJF4LOMHDQ8","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Better than the stock Apple 5c case. No, it's not as expensive, and it's not as detailed in construction, but it works better. Let me explain.First, the case made by Apple has a series of holes on the back, to give it a playful design. That's ok, but there should be a large central hole for the large central Apple logo on the 5c case. The smaller holes on the stock case obscure, instead of highlight, the Apple logo.Second, the stock Apple case is dual-materials - expensive - a firm exterior plastic lined with a dense felt-like material. Unfortunately, in some samples this makes the push-buttons too stiff to operate without a deliberate and focused effort.Other than than, you can't fault the stock Apple case - the detail spent on the bottom of the case, with three separate cutouts of speakers, microphones, charger, are well made, and, in particular, there is no excessive flex in the ""ridge line"" that protects the front screen on the speaker end of the phone.So how does the Diztronic compare? It's much simpler in construction, made of simple TPU semi-rigid plastic. If the stock Apple case is a pair of exquisitely crafted, but overbuilt, Church's wingtips, the Diztronic falls in between LLBean deck shoes and Crocs.But I don't want to give you the impression the Diztronic is fat and gummy. It's not - it's thin, fits tight, all the openings line up and the buttons push just fine, unlike on the Apple. It's just if you saw the Diztronic and the Apple case side by side, in terms of surface appearances (details of construction), you'd probably go for the Apple every time (setting aside the $30 price difference), and that would be a mistake.Because at ""friend distance"" - a friend seeing the 5c in the black Diztronic case - the Diztronic looks MUCH better. At ""you distance,"" the Diztronic feels good in the hand, operates well, keeps the screen surface off a desk, buttons push well, AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST YOU WILL EVER GET TO A ""BLACK"" 5c since Apple declined to sell a black edition body.IT LOOKS GREAT AND WORKS GREAT. So the moral is, don't get fooled by the better made and more expensive case (Apple) that doesn't actually work as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKYXWOJPKEUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW4EC3G#wasThisHelpful","RXKYXWOJPKEUO","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not an efficient rectangle, like the classic Costco roll aboard (now spinner) or like the Rick Steves branded wheelie. It has that front panel ""bulge"". That is the sole reason I deducted a single star from my rating. In terms of appearance (premium like Briggs & Riley? yes) and construction details, it is 5-star, first class. I will add a paragraph at the end of this review explaining the ""perfect rectangle"" idea.Pros of this bag:+ It passes the ""wheel-it"" test - you can drag it behind you like a two-wheeled roll-aboard, and the wheels won't start oscillating which happens on some lesser spinners.+ It passes the ""reverse wheel it"" test - if you are dragging it behind you like a two-wheeled roll-aboard, you can push it in reverse, and the wheels won't lock or grab or oscillate when you switch from pulling to pushing. (Surprisingly enough, some spinners are very ""pull-able"" but fail miserably when you ""push"" them instead.) Mind you, I'm talking about the situation where you have the bag leaned onto two wheels, which comes up more often than you might think, even with a spinner.+It is like ball-bearings on ice in spinner mode - but almost all spinners pass this test. Easily push it through an airport while it rests on all four of its wheels - if you haven't tried this, it is much easier than using a two-wheeled roll-aboard. The luggage simply won't fight you back and never gets in another traveler's way.+ Maximum size in terms of height, width, depth. Not recommended for regional jets with tiny overhead bins. Fits nose or wheels-end first into a 747 bin and the bin will close just fine. On an Airbus 300, you need to fit it in sideways.+ Handles on top AND bottom, so you don't have to worry about which way you shove it in the overhead. Also a side handle, which is helpful if you are a shorter traveler and it drags on the ground in portrait mode.+ One exterior almost full height drop slot, pretty sizeable; this slot has a zipper pouch at the top. One lid zipper mesh slot, about puff jacket size. A single side mesh zipper slot on the side of the main compartment.+ Zipper expansion.+ For a spinner, the wheels are lower profile, more compact, than many.Cons:- It's a spinner - it's inherently less space-efficient than a traditional lean-it-over wheelie. Of course a traditional lean-it-over wheelie is less space efficient than a simple rectangular cardboard box.(Look at the original shipping carton this spinner ships in. It is optimally efficient - no wheels subtracting available interior space, no thick panels subtracting interior space, no handle in tubes subtracting interior space. A traditional wheelie and a spinner both give up space to a. the handle and b. thicker, more rugged panels, but a traditional wheelie's wheels are more compact and more recessed into the ideal shipping-carton envelope of available space.)- It's technically oversize. Many airline testing boxes are a scosh oversize too, so you should be ok even if requested to sample box it. You WON'T be ok is you overstuff the front drop-in panel.Overall, I like this bag compared to my current favorites - the indestructible last-generation Costco/Kirkland branded wheelie, and the much lighter Rick Steves branded wheelie (available only from his website). I like this compared to my slightly less tall Briggs. It doesn't scream ""cheap"" and yet it isn't a premium brand ""theft & pilfer"" magnet. Hey, it's what a lot of flight crew use - sturdy, utilitarian, well-made, low-keyed.Now for that ""efficient rectangle"" paragraph. If you are going to put a front panel compartment on a MLC (maximum legal carryon) bag, stick as close as possible to the shape of its shipping compartment. Don't have bulges! If a front panel slot is going to add to the depth of the bag's measurements, you might as well have it just uniformly raise the front panel by an inch. What you DON'T want is a ""baby bump"" in the center of the front panel, like this bag. All that will do, is keep the bag from fitting into a luggage tester, while not really adding as much space as you want. AND make sure the front panel has the same width and height as the rest of the front panel - really, a centralized, non-full area ""baby bump"" is horribly inefficient. On my Costco and Rick Steves bags, the exterior front panel compartments are full sized, and add the same thickness at the corners as at the middle. In short, they keep their bags rectangular, not pregnant like the Travelpro.That having been said, this is a fine mid-scale, but quality made, value priced spinner. Travelpro has been one of the most reliable makers out there.A NOTE ON THE LIFETIME WARRANTY: It doesn't cover shipping, at least to the repair shop. You need to find a carton. It excludes ANY airline caused damage seven ways from Sunday - you have to promptly file an airline claim, and if denied have to appeal it to a consumer protection board. If you are denied and the damage is determined by Travelpro to be damage and not ordinary wear and tear, Travelpro promises to repair it at no cost to you. You need your receipt to make a claim. By the time you even contemplate those hassles, you are better off buying a replacement bag, given the $100 approximate cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UIF589Z5MBCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXD64MA#wasThisHelpful","R3UIF589Z5MBCX","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quick negatives:- Thicker than most tablets;- Heavier than larger tablets;- Wider bezels (dead space between screen and housing) than other tablet;- NO Google services (no official Google apps), something we expect on all other tablets, whether Android or iPads.- No iTunes - but this isn't surprising, Apple only makes it for their own tablets. Not for Android, not for Fire.The quick positives:+ MUCH faster processor than other mid-grade tablets, with intelligent power saving design. Instead of four pokey ARM A7 cores as found in competing tablets, this combines two VERY fast, state of the art Cortex A15 cores with ... two pokey ARM A7 cores. The pokey cores sip power, the A15 cores are like a turbo charger.+ SUPERB screen quality. 1280*720p is basic HD quality, but it seems higher because it isn't spread over 7"" or 10"" of screen real estate, it is condensed down to 6"", so your eyes will only perceive sharpness. More importantly, colors are BRIGHT and SNAPPY, in true Kindle Fire tradition.+ Wider bezels (also a negative!) make it easier to hold without touching the screen.+ SHARP enough for extended reading.+ Battery life is equal to, or exceeds, the e-Ink, black and white Kindles. Remember, Amazon specifies ""weeks"" of e-Ink use by assuming modest 15 minute reading periods per day. This tablet goes out 8-10 hours in reading mode, which is equivalent or better, when divided into a similar ""15 minutes a day."" The difference is you don't have to turn off the e-Ink reader to get weeks of use, but if you want weeks of use you need to shut this down after each reading session, because traditional tablets DO consume MUCH more ""standby"" power, whether in Airplane mode or with WiFi active.+ Streams Netflix AND Amazon (no Apple or Google Play). DOWNLOADS select Amazon Prime free streaming content TO THE DEVICE to view later without WiFi (get the 16gb model for this purpose, since there is no memory expansion slot).I RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU READ A LOT OF KINDLE BOOKS, WATCH A LOT OF NETFLIX OR AMAZON PRIME. I do NOT recommend it if you are used to Google apps on an iPhone, iPad, Android (Samsung etc.) phone or tablet.

"Two problems. Continuity and background sucks, since the ""set up"" for these issues is based on having read the separate Justice League Dark episodes - in which Constantine was just a background story. These Constantine episodes would be marginally fun for readers of the Justice League Dark separate comics, but make a Constantine fan simply groan.Secondly - and this applies to Vol.1 - Constantine is simply a strange shadow of his former Vertigo self. A Dr. Strange shadow, to be more precise - all overblown art, pompous dialog, super hero action non-stop. Don't blame Constantine, blame the morons at DC who decided to move him from his singular anti-hero, adult-rated horror run at Vertigo to his current PG with aspiration of boobies-rated tween and teen superhero audience at the more mainstream DC.Now Constantine is de-fanged and snipped and DC's new Dr. Strange competitor, and so beholden to continuity from the larger DC 52-verse than reading this garbage is a sad waste of time.

"I have 3 good sets of bookshelf speakers - Ascend Acoustics CBM 170 SE, Hsu Labs HB-1 (not the Mk II's), and these Pioneers.Initially I set these up to run with our TV off a Class D amp, audio sourced from an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV. I was not satisfied with the sound. They seemed ""clean"" enough but bass thin. A friend who is an audiophile assured me these Pioneers have good bass so I decided to switch out the Ascends from my computer to the TV, and bring these to the computer. At the computer I take the audio off my Mac Mini (playing mostly iTunes Match current quality compressed audio) fed through a Topping TP60 Class D amp. Not high end, but nice to my ears.The Ascends were previously set up firing straight forward, near-field past my ears. Away from the back wall and side walls. Pretty good range, good imaging, solid bass.Much to my surprise, when I replaced the Ascends with the Pioneers, the Pioneers were even better. Same great dynamic range and good bass, equal to the Ascends, but MUCH better soundstage (and the Ascends image well). The only change in setup was angling the smaller Pioneers towards my ears.SO ... all three of these speakers sound great. The Pioneers sound best.

"I started out with these two non-Griffin cases for my iPad 2 and later iPad 3:1. ""Smart Cover Partner Snap On Slim-Fit Case for Apple iPad 2 - Crystal Clear"" sold on Amazon for $4.86 under their ""Add On"" shipping plan (must be a part of a larger order) Smart Cover Partner Snap On Slim-Fit Case for Apple iPad 2 - Crystal Clear; and2. The very similar ""PoeticBasic Smart Cover Slim-Fit Case for the iPad 3rd Gen, Crystal Clear"" at a similar $4.95 on Amazon under their ""Add On"" shipping plan PoeticBasic Smart Cover Slim-Fit Case for the iPad 3rd Gen, Crystal Clear.One of these is probably what you need if you plan on using an Apple Smart Cover with your iPad 2 (or 3/4, but not Air), or the thinner and lighter (but more expensive, although it might currently be on close-out for the iPad 2) Belkin Snap Shield Belkin Snap Shield Case for the Apple iPad 3rd and 4th Generation (Black). All of these have the cut-outs for the Smart Cover hinge.What they DON'T have is the rubber edge protector on the Griffin Reveal, which ""wraps over"" the screen edge on all four sides with no breaks, with the ridge raised slightly so the screen won't pick up dirt, smudges, or scratches from a hard counter or nightstand. By placing the screen face down, you protect it from dust, eliminate the risk of keys dropped on top cracking the screen, and protect the back of the cover from picking up scratches and abrasions from being set down on a hard surface.So:+ Griffin Reveal is thinner and lighter. Easily fits in slide-in slip covers designed for the iPad 2 (or 3 or 4).+ Raised edges around the screen allow putting it down screen-first.+ The rubber on all four edges allows you (most of the time) to prop the iPad up on a kitchen counter without a stand, without it sliding down.+ Since the rubber wraps over the front of the iPad (unlike all the rear clamshells listed above), the case can't accidentally twist off.Couple of negatives:- The rubber front edge deforms if your hands slide against it - this doesn't put the case at risk of popping off, but you should know about it.- As mentioned above, you can't mount a Smart Cover.This will also fit on an iPad 3 and 4, one is mounted on a 4 right now.Overall I like this case a lot, it has been reduced in price to around $10 as of the date of this review from its release price of about $30. At $10 it is well worth the extra money, if you don't need to mount a Smart Cover and don't mind the edges deforming slightly if your brush the edges from the top (there is no such problem from back or edge contact).Finally, the Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Apple iPad 2 remains best, imho, for toddlers, but it is much heavier and thicker and still doesn't provide screen protection. It did protect my kids iPad 2 from a couple of drops onto the carpet, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3QFAA4NZAGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UFDFAS#wasThisHelpful","R1V3QFAA4NZAGC","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Amazon's first effort in the Roku/Apple TV market - a ""single serving pizza box"" that delivers Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and most of the other ""usual lists of suspects"" with the notable exception of iTunes (which is no surprised, that's Apple's tight fist not Amazon's competitive instincts).As a streamer for Amazon content, the Amazon TV is SUPERB. We also have access to Amazon content on Roku, but the interface on Roku is not nearly as inviting. Also, Amazon TV _seems_ to buffer better, there hasn't been any ""adaptive downgrading"" of the stream quality (from HD to SD) to compensate for ""slow internet"" or ""internet bumps."" Image quality has been superb.In terms of design, the ""box"" is high quality in appearance and feel - the bottom is ""soft touch"" coated to reduce slip. Same with the remote control. The remote is ""modern compact"" which is to say, tiny, feels good in my medium sized hand (maybe tiny is good for kid's hands when used for game play), but I would have preferred a large enough device to accept AA instead of AAA batteries to reduce e-waste - AAA have a much shorter lifespan than AA's. But that's a niggle.A more curious choice is the use of an old-tech ""tip"" connector for the power supply, which looks a lot like the Kindle Fire tablet charger (a 10 watt charger, which should  be plenty for this device) instead of a ""micro USB"" connector to power the device.Since the Amazon TV is essentially an ""Android tablet without a screen"" there is no reason why a normal USB charger couldn't have been provided, instead of a ""dedicated"" ""tip style"" power supply. With a normal micro USB connector instead of a tip style connector, we would be able to use this charger for other devices when the Amazon TV has reached the end of its useful life, or breaks. With a non-universal ""tip connector"" the power supply goes into our junk drawer along with all the others of its ilk from past laptops and other devices.Why $99 instead of $49, the cost of a budget Roku, still more than Chromecast?Because this is, finally, what a lot of us have been waiting for - a tablet in a box, optimized for media streaming, instead of a media streaming box with limited RAM, storage, and processor power.Like the Kindle Fire HDX, the Amazon TV has a superb, powerful processing chip with advanced graphics, and a whopping 2gb of RAM. It doesn't run ""pure"" Android, but it is close enough to move Android games over to the Amazon TV.And THAT is Amazon TV's single best feature - game potential - and it's achilles heel, the reason this is rated 4 stars not 5. It simply doesn't have enough storage space to hold very many games. All mid to high grade tablets come with 16gb. This comes with 8gb. You may be viewing this with ""streaming box"" rose-colored spectacles, in which case 8gb sounds like a lot, relatively speaking, but keep in mind even to access YouTube you have to download an ""app,"" just like on an Android tablet, each streaming service is ""app based"" not built in or with functions hosted on the providers servers.Have you checked how much storage space is consumed by Android itself (Fire OS in the case of Amazon TV), even before downloading apps?My kid has a ton of games on his iPad. 16gb isn't enough and he has to cull games then re-download them (for free) if he wants to revisit them again. But at least he has 16gb, not 8gb.I wish Amazon had offered upgrade options to 16gb and 32gb, but I feel they wanted to hit that magic ""$99"" mark with no qualifiers.Within one year Amazon will offer 16gb either stock or as an option, and as these things become the modern replacement for Nintendos, even 32gb will look attractive.I can't recommend waiting for increased storage options since ""tv box as gamer"" is a new concept and tech watchers have been waiting for this from Apple for 3 years. The idea of having the chip and os in a box that is much cheaper than a full tablet or gaming console has been appealing for years, but so far no one has executed on it, or executed well (Ouya). Amazon is poised to change that, but for now they are really selling the ease of streaming Amazon Instant Video, while flying under the radar (slightly under) about the huge potential of gaming with the hardware in this device.But 8gb simply isn't enough!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFJJE4WVL9VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3KFJJE4WVL9VR","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, IBM Notes Traveler, and generic POP and IMAP accounts are your other choices.7. While in Settings use the ""left arrow"" a permanent below-the-screen left arrow to move back to the main Settings menu and set Brightness to High with no automatic control. This works best except in dim settings like on an airplane with lights out, where I use Low for Kindle reading.8. On the same first page of Settings, scroll down to Phone Update and check for system updates. You should already have the ""Black"" update set, 8.1 will come out in a couple of months. Check about once a week.9. Apps will update too, a number will appear on the Live Tile for Store. Sometimes important updates like FaceBook are announced but the Store won't auto update right away - you can force an update by searching for that app, then clicking on it, and clicking manually on the update bar that appears.10. Download these apps (my favorites, YMMV):  - WhatsApp, Line, Viber. Or your favorite message/free phone call solution.  - Most of these require an active phone number to work. If you use your other phone's number, that will erase your account on that other phone, when you use the text supplied PIN to activate on the Lumia 520. That might change someday, but for now linkage to phone numbers is a limitation.  - Skype. Works REALLY well on the Lumia 520.  - Kindle. Works so-so. I read a couple of books inflight so it isn't screen sharpness that is the problem. The problem is a little Amazon software funkiness that occasionally cuts off a line or two of text between pages. To fix, rotate from book orientation to landscape to read your text then rotate back. The rotation seems to fix the problem.  - Facebook. Fine for consumption, not so fine for editing your posts or comments. Much improved over last year.  - Facebook MESSENGER. Yes, it is a separate app, and more and more people use it, is a good substitutes for WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and Facebook doesn't care how many devices you have it on. A mature product on Lumia 520. Be sure to pay attention to the little delta wing that rats out your location - default is on, so you WILL be tracked by friends and frenemies. Well tracked when you answer a message.11. From the home screen - press the Home soft button on the bottom of the screen - flick the screen to the left to see the list of apps, all the apps, and open HERE Maps.  - Choose your state and download your map.  - Going to Dublin? etc? download that map. The maps don't take up a lot of space.  - Yes, GPS works without cellular service, so long as you downloaded the map. Remember, the maps won't download if you didn't put your SIM card in (you can remove it later, but why bother?).12. Some good exercise apps that work well with the LOUD speaker on this tiny phone:  - 7 Minute Scientific.  - Tabatas.13. For music:  - Because it has the necessary licenses from MicroSoft, 64gb and even 128gb micro SD's fit and work fine. I use a 64gb to hold almost all my music.  - It will play current iTunes tracks fine (everything except the early DRM digital rights management copy protected tunes), mp3. it will not play Ogg Vorbis.  - The player is called Music & Videos and comes stock; until updates, it might appear as Nokia Music or as xBox, Nokia Mix Radio is a separate app which provides free streaming music from Nokia. Very cool!REMEMBER, all this is WITHOUT cellular phone service!You have a camera, music player, GPS unit, e-reader, and minimalist web browser, all in a $60 or so package! And the option of using it to back up your AT&T and AT&T driven phone service, if you need it.SHORTCOMINGS:1. Due to the 512mb memory limitation, app switching is painfully slow. NOT unusably slow, but by modern standards PITA slow.2. A few games and rare apps won't run in a 512mb footprint. Before you go ballistic on this memory limitation, keep in mind the iPad 2 and original Mini are both 512mb. Like Apple, though, MicroSoft uses compiled code for its apps - more efficient - than Android, which ""compiles code"" on the fly via an interpreter - hence Android needs faster processors and more RAM (but in current editions and with modern hardware, Android is plenty fast).3. This is DVD resolution, not HD. It is 800x480, not one of the higher resolutions. The type looks crisp, not pixelated, but you don't get as much information per screen on websites or Kindle, and the screen - for resolution AND quality reasons - isn't good for serious video watching.4. No front camera. This is a BIGGIE for many selfie fans. On the rear, no FLASH but the camera DOES autofocus. I don't like flash, I prefer natural light even if the picture goes grainy etc. so I'm ok with this.UNEXPECTED SURPRISE:1. The battery life is absolutely incredible, with cellular radio turned off via the Airplane Mode switch.2. Nokia continues to roll out major software updates for this amazing little helper - even Win Phone 8.1 is coming to the 520, which means being able to run apps from the uSD card and, finally, being able to set ringer and music volumes separately (saves ears, that).So I've found plenty of uses for my Lumia 520, even if it isn't good for travel or TMob. I wish it were unlocked, and would have paid more for an unlocked one from Nokia (if they sold unlocked phones direct, like Google and Motorola and Apple do), but my buyer's mistake hasn't turned into buyer's remorse.You will be blown away by the design, looks, and quality of this little bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NHZCCGYUEEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E45043A#wasThisHelpful","R34NHZCCGYUEEM","A2BX8DDQGCCG2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BX8DDQGCCG2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pleasantly surprised at how good these fruit bars were.  My favorite favors are raspberry, and strawberry, but more importantly they are a healthy gluten free snack with a sweet crunch.  On top of that they are all natural, have no preservatives and no added sugars.

"Disclaimer: I got The Selfie Stick for free in exchange for an honest review.  That being said I probably would had never thought about buying one for myself, but after using it I see how they are kind of cool.  The number one pro is that it's super simple to use.  All you do is snap your smartphone onto the extendable dock and plug in the device into the headphone jack.  The second biggest pro was that my iPhone 6 Plus fit perfectly on the device with the case still on my phone.  If this was not the case I would not consider using this device at all, but luckily it fit just fine.

"I've been looking for a large DVD shelf for a while now, and after the long search I've finally found the right one for the price.  I was able to put all my Xbox games, plus all my Blu-Rays and DVDs.  I actually plan on getting another one, because I still need more storage.  But don't get me wrong this unit holds a lot.  I just own a lot of physical media.  When it came down to putting all the pieces together it was reasonably easy and only took a little over an hour for me to finish it without any help.  The size of the tower is about 6 feet tall, so some might need help putting the back pieces in.  There is one thing every one should know before buying, and that is that this tower requires you to screw it into the wall, so it doesn't fall over.  The bottom line is this is a great tower for the price, and will end up,saving you a lot of space like it did with me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BR62H6Y83FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058O8ES8#wasThisHelpful","R14BR62H6Y83FN","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this free in exchange for a honest review.  That being said I ended up very impressed with the quality of Zeskit's products, and I highly recommend them, especially their 10 ft iPhone/iPad cable.  This car charger by Zeskit is great too.  I love how it has two charging ports, which is great if you have two people riding in the car who want to charge their devices at the same time.  I also liked how the little LED light led up, but that's nothing more than a cosmetic feature.

"Disclaimer: I received this cable free in exchange for a review.  That being said I wasn't sure what to expect from the quality of Zeskit products, but after using this cable I'm happy to report that the quality went far beyond by expectations.  The first noticeable difference I noticed was that the cable was much thicker than others including Apple's.  That's a good feature, because it is less likely for the cable to tear or get cut from extended use.  Next, the length is much longer than any other cable I've seen in stores.  I can see this being very beneficial to me, especially when my battery is almost deal, and I want to use my iPhone or iPad on the coach.

You can control the volume by holding >>| and <<| buttons.  Furthermore, it wasn't completely clear to me on how to pair this device with my iPhone, but after reading the direction a second time I realized that you need to hold the power button for 6 seconds until the LED light flashing blue and red.  People interested in this shower speaker should also know that the Inventiv only comes a USB for charging, so I ended up using my iPhone plug to charge it, but that's not a big deal.

"First off, I was hesitant on whether or not Dracula Untold would be any good considering that it's only rated PG-13, but it turns out that I was happily surprised at how much I liked it.  I'm the type of person who love superhero origin stories, and that's exactly what Dracula Untold ended up being.  That being said, this film is not your typical vampire movie, and instead of focusing on the horror aspects of vampires Untold puts a superhero like twist on the classic legend of Dracula.  Furthermore, Untold showed audiences a side of Vlad that films in the past had never shown, and felt like a refreshing take on a role that's been played to death.  No pun intended.  Film fans finally saw the human side of Vlad before he becomes the monster known as Dracula, but that's not where the good ends in Untold.  I loved the locations the film makers chose, even though some locations were not historically accurate, but they did fit the mood of the film perfectly.  Lastly, I want to point out how good the acting was, especially the acting of Charles Dance (Game Of Thrones) who played the role of The Master Vampire.  The bottom line is that Dracula Untold is not your typical vampire movie, and is more like a super hero action origin story than a film that focuses on the scary side of vampires.  I highly recommend seeing this film at least once, especially if you like Game of Thrones.  I really hope there's going to be a sequel, because they left many questions unanswered, but some times it's a good thing to have questions after a film.Special Features:Digital Copy of Dracula Untold (Subject to expiration.

"Lately, AMC has been pumping out great TV that's just on another level. Turn is now one of my can't miss shows on Sunday nights. The story centers around Abe Woodhull who becomes a spy for George Washington in the American Revolution. The show mixes drama, suspense and never bores.

"If there's one game that worth buying a New 3DS for it's definitely Majora's Mask.  The Major's 3D looks great on the new system but more importantly it feels tons better too.  No more straining your eyes with 3D.  In fact, on the old system I never used the 3D feature, but Majora's Mask on the New 3DS is a completely different story.  Head aches from the 3D effect are officially a thing of the past.  On top of that if you played Majora's Mask on the N64 you should know what to expect, but it is important to note that Majora's Mask on the 3DS feels like it just belongs on the new system.  Just in case if you haven't played Majora's Mask just know that this game is like other Zelda games.  The most important thing for new comers to know is that time is a huge part of this game and you will be constantly fighting against it.  That all being said, the Bottom-line is that this is a must own for old and new players, especially owners of the New 3DS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35G6WOSEU9T0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PB9LZQI#wasThisHelpful","R35G6WOSEU9T0Q","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lately comic book fans have been treated to excellent shows based off of the books we love, and Gotham is no exception to that awesome fact.  I just love the way that Gotham has adapted it's characters to to the Batman universe in it's own unique way.  The thing I love most about this series is that nothing is as it seems, which is great, because the series keeps you guessing each episode.  On top of that the cast was chosen perfectly, but more importantly each actor nailed their roles in a way that went far beyond my expectations.

"It's been years since I've watch a super hero show as good as The Flash.  Every episode feels fresh and fun with a prefect mix of all the elements fans expect from a TV show like this.  That being said, I love the fact that they've introduced the Reverse Flash early on, but he's not the only character that I'm happy made a big appearance.  The first season even introduced the classic Flash vs Green Arrow fight, which was interesting, but I feel they need to bring him back, and I'm sure he will come back.  So the bottom line if you love super hero shows you should feel right at home with The Flash with no disappointments.  On top of that I highly recommend The Flash if you've liked shows like The Arrow and Smallville.Update: 6/18/2015Special Features:The Fastest Man Alive!Creating the BlurThe Chemistry of Emily and Grant Screen TestBehind the Story: The Trickster Returns!DC Comics Night at Comic-Con 2014 Presenting Gotham, The Flash, Constantine and ArrowAudio CommentaryDeleted ScenesGag ReelContent:Pilot for airFastest Man AliveThings Your Can't OutrunGoing RoguePlastiqueThe Flash s BornPower OutageFlash vs. ArrowThe Man In The Yellow SuitRevenge Of he RoguesThe Sound And The FuryCrazy For YouThe Nuclear ManFalloutOut of TimeRogue TimeTrickstersAll Star Team UpWho is Harrison Wells?The TrapGrodd LivesRogue AirFast Enough","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P57OBT4OQ4RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5D4SLU#wasThisHelpful","R1P57OBT4OQ4RT","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a hidden gem comedy anime then D-Frag is what you're looking for.  Kenji is somewhat of a delinquent, or at least he think he his.  He and his buddies are on a mission to rule the school.  That's until he is forced to join the Game Development Club run by four pretty psychopaths.I can't remember the last time an anime made me laugh so much, but on top of that the animation style is one of the best I've seen in years too.  There's just so much color in it that matches the situations in a prefect way every time.  Furthermore, each episode is packed with hyperboles and innuendos, but are never over used.  They are so well placed that all the hyperboles have become one of my favorite parts of the show.  Even the characters all flow together perfectly, which makes them all very likable, especially Kenji and Koka.  Bottom line is if you like comedy anime that exaggerate on almost everything then you'll probably like D-Frag.This Limited Edition Blu-ray release of D-Frag! features all first season episodes presented in 1080p with English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0 lossless audio tracks and English subtitles.Extras include:Actor CommentariesPre-Air TV CommercialsThe New DVD/BD CheerThe New DVD/BD Cheer (Funabori Version)A Commercial within a CommercialMobile Rally CommercialTextless Opening Song ''Stalemate!''Textless Opening Song ''Minna no Namae wo Irete Kudasai''Promotional VideoTrailersPublisher - FUNIMATIONGenre - ComedyMedia - Blu-ray DiscFormat - HybridAge Rating - 14+ (More Information)300 Minutes","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLAREZ9HRMT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHEOOYY#wasThisHelpful","RQLAREZ9HRMT2","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can't beat a value like this two disc set, but on top of that these two movies are some of my favorite comedy films, especially Clerks II.  I still remember how hard Jay and Silent Bob made me laugh the first time I watched Clerks II.  Furthermore, Seth Rogen is one of my favorite comedy actors, so I never miss any of his movies, and Zack & Miri is no execution.  So, the bottom line is if you don't already own these two films on Blu-Ray this is a great option to get them for cheap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHRDL0YKOXKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXKKNXA#wasThisHelpful","R3LHRDL0YKOXKX","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After being disappointed with the last PokÃ©mon strategy guide I was a little hesitant about picking up the guide for the new Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire games, but it turns out I'm actually quite pleased with it.  That being said I'm still not 100 percent satisfied with this guide!  I just wish that they would had included a full PokÃ©mon Index instead of just an PokÃ©mon Native Index to the Hoenn Region.  Furthermore, I don't understand why the full Official Index guide comes out so late!  It's not released until March 2015, and by that time I would had already completed these games.  Now that the Index issue is out of the way lets get into what you'll find in this guide, the pros, and of course the cons.What's In The Guide:ï¶ Detailed Interview with the Creators of Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire.Hoenn Regional Mapï¶ Detailed walkthrough of the two games that include training, routes, cities, and gyms information.ï¶ Belief PokÃ©mon Index of the Hoenn Region.  This Index shows you the PokÃ©mon's type, egg group, ability, hidden ability, and main way to obtain them.ï¶ Adventure Data: Gives players information about items in the games, and and their effects.ï¶ And much more that's too much to list here.Pros:ï¶ Very Detailed Walkthrough with tons of information, and useful tips.ï¶ Detailed maps and images of the games.ï¶ Tips on completing your Indexï¶ Thick book with lots of helpful information.Consï¶ Doesn't offer players a complete PokÃ©mon Index, and the full Index is released way too late.  The missing Complete Index is really the only con, but it's a big one!Bottom line:This guide is a nice addition to the two games, but it's missing some critical information about the Index, but at the same time the walkthrough itself is very useful and is filled with other important information.  I just wish that Nintendo would release the PokÃ©mon Index a lot sooner.  That all being said this guide is still worth getting if you're a completist and want to find every little thing PokÃ©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire has to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VS29OZPSEMIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101898208#wasThisHelpful","R2VS29OZPSEMIF","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm loving Far Cry 4, but this Limited Edition Collector's Strategy Guide looks sweet.  On top of that it looks even better in person, and the colors just pop right off of the cover.  Definitely a wonderful addition to go along with the game, but on top of that this book is very useful.Below is what you can expect to find in this edition:ï¶ Includes 32 extra bonus pages that gives gamers an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the creation of Far Cry 4.ï¶ Detailed walkthrough that includes fully-labeled maps, and step-by-step tactic tips.ï¶ Explains  where to find every tower, every outpost, and every fortress.ï¶ Helps you find every collectible.ï¶ Full stats of in-game weapons.ï¶ Mobile eGuide:  So you can access on a second scene.ï¶ Bottom line: Not all players may need a guide for this game, but it's a very nice addition as a collector's item, and will help a lot finding and unlocking all the little things.Update:I just wanted to let other players know that this book also has mission tips, caution, and notes that has helped me complete missions faster and easier.  On top of that I found the tower tips to be helpful.  The book gives you step by step tips on the best way to take over each tower.  It even tells you exactly where the chests are, and where enemies will spawn.  Lastly, everything in this guide is organized very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338W4H4I1UW3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101897635#wasThisHelpful","R338W4H4I1UW3H","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, the cover art from this premium strategy guide looks very awesome, but I just wish they included some concept art in this book.  Other than that everything else is great, and I am glad that they included additional pages of Behind The Scenes' content, interviews from BioWare, and a Making Of with the Dragon Age team.  There's even an added bonus about the development of Dragon Age the anime, which has a little bit of concept art from the series.Below is what you can expect to find in this edition:ï¶ Full-size poster of the game map.ï¶ 3 digital in-game items.ï¶ Mobile eGuide: Access so you can strategize on another screen.ï¶ Help :Identifying paths, classes, tactics, hidden caves, creatures, combat advice and much more.ï¶ Bottom line: If you plan on playing Dragon Age Inquisition, this Guide will be very helpful and useful.  The only difference between the two edition is that the premium edition has extra digital content and additional  ""Behind-the-Scenes"", and interviews. Other than that the paperback has the same useful walkthrough content inside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2299243OV6NHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804162972#wasThisHelpful","R2299243OV6NHU","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a blast playing Far Cry 3, so naturally I couldn't wait to pick up the fourth installment.  I'm pleased to say that it's holding up to my expectations with all this game has to offer to gamers.  Right off the bat, Far Cry 4 feels fast paced with an excellent story, and of course a crazy bad guy.  Secondly, once you get a chance to explore the landscape you easily tell how large the map is, and I personally already feel myself becoming immersed in the world of Far Cry 4. There's just so much to do, and explore!  Not to mention all the awesome animals, vehicles, and weapons.  On top of that I love how fast things blow up and catch on fire.Weapon and Item Customization: I was very impressed with the amount of items, sidearms, primary weapons, and weapon attachments are in this game.  There's even maps available in the game to unlock some areas.  Far Cry also allows you to craft new items, you make sure you skin the animals you kill, you'll need the pelts.Skills and Tactics: Fry Cry 4 has a vast amount of skill upgrades that will be very useful throughout the game, as well as tips and tactics that the game teaches you as you play.Graphics: Overall the graphics are pretty good, and didn't disappoint me at all, especially how detailed the mountains, and water looked.Other Things I Liked:  I found the radio to be very funny while I was driving around.  Secondly, it's pretty awesome being able to ride an elephant or using them to distract the enemy.  I'm not sure what I like more, rising the elephants, or scaring them so they attack the enemies.  Lastly, although waypoints were in the last game, they are very helpful in finding your way around in the new game.  The map is huge, and without them I know I would get lost searching for my objective.Bottom line: If there is one Ubisoft game you're going to get this month then I highly recommend picking up Far Cry 4, but even more so if you've played the third game you will not be disappointed with the forth.  I can't say enough of how good this game is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C96T86JKV728/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAED7OC#wasThisHelpful","R2C96T86JKV728","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I love the first two seasons I do have a couple problems with season three, but that's only for the English dub.  For starters, the English voice actor for Ranma changes halfway through this season.  Secondly, I really don't like the Hawaiian principle who has an Jamaican accent.  I just don't understand why he has a Jamaican accent when he is Hawaiian.  He's just super annoying, and feels only like filler content.On the other hand the Japanese audio gets 5 stars, and deserves to be in your collection, especially if you own the first two sets.Ranma Â½: Set 3 does have a complete restoration with a frame rate of 4:3, and is presented in 1080p with an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 tracks.

"I recently bought this NetGear router after my old router was getting slow.  I also was experiencing many dead zones throughout my house, so I clearly needed a new router.  The good news is now I no longer have any dead zones in my house with my new router.  Although a strong signal throughout my house was import, it was just as import that it had high speeds for online gaming, and easy to setup.  I can't say enough of how easy the setup was.  All I needed to do was to plug in my Ethernet cable from my computer to my new rounder and follow NetGear's easy 5 step setup process.  On top of that there's no CD needed for set up.  The days of losing the setup CD are over!The thing I like most about this model is that I was able to setup two WiFi signals.  One I solely use for my Xbox Live Account, and the other I use to share with everyone else's devices in my household.  Both WiFi signals have have pretty good speeds.  On average I was getting download speeds around 30 Mbps with the first signal, and over 50 Mbps on the 5G signal.Once you have installed the router, you can view everything in NetGear's Genie program.  From here you can view all your network activity (who and what devices are on your network), router setting, Parental Controls, AirPrint, and Network Support.  It's very easy to change your setting, passwords, and WiFi names from here, which is very important to me.Bottom Line: If you have many device, game online, and want an easy setup, then I highly recommend using this router.  You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R175I4SB7KPIHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEX851C#wasThisHelpful","R175I4SB7KPIHZ","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a blast playing Assassin's Creed Rogue.  Although the campaign was a little short with only seven main memory sequences, it was still a very enjoyable game.  When it comes down to plot, this game was a little better than Unity.  The main differences I noticed were that the controls were very different, and instead of using medicine to heal, your health just recharges.Rogue also was very much like Black Flag in quite a lot of ways.  The first main similarity was that you travel a lot by sea, and of course you battle with other ships when you travel. Second similarity was fort battles.  With these battles you must breakdown the fort's defenses before moving in and killing its captain.  If you've played Black Flag then you know that you done this in Black Flag too.  Remember to collect supplies at sea as well, so you can upgrade your ship.  Over all rogue feels like Black Flag 2, but of course on the side of the Templars.Graphics: The graphics were very good for being on the 360, and not Next Gen.  On top of the graphics being good, there were no glitches that interfered with them, and everything ran very smoothly.  I'm actually very impressed with what Ubisoft has done with the 360 version.Story:  I know my favorite part of the Assassin's Creed franchise is learning more about the Precursers, and Rogue doesn't disappoint in giving the player more background about them.  Although the plot was very good, I did feel that the chacacter development was a little bit better in Unity, but don't get me wrong Rogue's characters aren't bad by any means.Bottom Line:  if you've played other Assassin's Creed games, then you will not be disappointed with this installment, and there's actually a lot to do after you completed the main story, so just give it a try.Update: I recommend playing both games for the main story, because they both are connected to one another.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUYLBQFA5ZJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9TD70K#wasThisHelpful","R2MUYLBQFA5ZJP","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you've never played Assassin's Creed before then this would be a great place to start the series.

"Yura Yamato thinks she has finally arrived at her dream school, but it turns out that it's nothing like she imagined.  In fact the girls of Stella Women's Academy much rather participate in war games then traditional school activities.  It's quite a funny series, especially when Yura starts to daydream.  Her daydreams are overly exaggerated, which will give you a good laugh.  There's not much action in this series, and relies more on the characters and humor to keep the story going.  The bottom line is if you like comedy animes, and girls with guns then you might like Stella Women's Academy.This anime is subbed only, so there is no dub available.  Unfortunately, Section23 Films doesn't provide dubs, so if you're looking for a dubbed anime, this isn't for you.  I personally preferred subbed, so this isn't a problem for me.

"If you like over the top mecha animes that don't take themselves seriously, then you will love Gurren Lagann.  Every episode feels fun and exciting, and truly separates itself from similar animes.  Gurren Lagann takes place in the distant future, and mankind has regressed to living underground, but that's only until our two heroes decide to challenge that belief.  Now, I understand that this set is very expensive, but it's also a limited edition, and looks super slick and nice.  Amazon doesn't carry this edition, but you can find it at Rightstuff.com right now, but I'm sure it will be gone soon.I just wanted to add that I'm a little disappointed in the packaging.  Although this series is great, the packaging is very thin in person compared to the image on Amazon.  I was expecting the packaging to be a little thicker and streadier, but it's very thin and not very strong.Contains episodes 1-5 plus a double-sided poster and a 16-page booklet featuring creator interviews and an illustration gallery!Special Features: Textless Opening and Ending, Episode 5 Preview (On-Air Version).Spoken Languages: English, Japanese, English subtitles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34C8TQC8JRL32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NT6RHGW#wasThisHelpful","R34C8TQC8JRL32","A1BIS6FID9J16M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIS6FID9J16M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these boots at Nordstroms, but will review them here.  I have now worn them around 15 days and feel comfortable giving them a review.  I live in LA, so these were partially bought for 'looks', but I travelled to Seattle when there was rain, and to Denver/Aspen when there was snow (my flight was cancelled because of the snow).  So I feel comfortable reviewing them from all viewpoints.Wool:  I have seen lots of questions as to weather the wool runs through the whole boot.  The first 3 inches on the inside have the same white wool as normal Uggs.  Then the white wool ends, and the rest of the boot is lined with a dark grey wool similar to the exterior of the top of the shaft.  So there is wool throughout, but not the white wool as in normal uggs.Material:  The shaft has a dark charcoal grey speckled wool material that ends at the buckles.  The area around the foot is leather.  It is interesting - the toe part is a shinier leather and the remainder is like a brushed or oiled leather.  It is not shiny, but matt.  When I first wore them I could easily see the difference, but now I don't, as the shininess of the toe has dulled down.  Lastly this is not a really 'black' boot.  It is more of a really, really dark charcoal grey.  But it is fine with black leggings or jeans.  It is just something to be aware of.Warmth and Waterproof:  These boots are pretty darn warm.  When I wore them on a 'cool LA day' (e.g., 70)  :)  my feet were too warm and I was ready to take them off.  But anything around 65 degrees and less was fine.  They were great in rain.  And when I was in the snow I had really nice traction (I was surprised at how good the traction was given that there is no tread) and my feet were perfect.  I have not been in less than 30 degrees with them yet - so I can't vouch for ""really cold"".Size: I have a pretty normal foot - average width and a size 9, but it tend to buy shoes a bit bigger to allow room for my low profile 3/4 orthotics.  So I bought these in a 9.5.  There is plenty of length.  But it is a bit snug on the width.  I wear these with thin socks. They did stretch out on the width just a bit and now I don't notice the snugness.  So I would say they are true to length but not a ""wide"" boot.Getting them on: they are NOT easy to get on.  The area where the buckles are does not have any give.  So it does take me around 10 ""real"" seconds to shove my foot into the boot.  So I wouldn't want to wear them shopping when I would be constantly taking my shoes on and off.  But that said, I don't mind, because everything else about the boot is pretty good!Looks:  as I mentioned, I live in LA, so I want to wear these partially for looks with skinny jeans and leggings. When it isn't snowing or raining I unzip the boot to the buckle is so that it flairs out a bit more to balance out the boot.  This is not a fancy boot, a snazzy boot, a polished boot or a dressed up boot. This is a casual boot.  A run around boot.  If I lived in a mountain town where everyone dressed pretty casual I would probably wear these every day.  They do 'scuff up' because of the brushed leather.  And after all the traveling and being in the snow, although they are well made, they do show scuffs, so it does make them look even more casual.  That said - I get compliments on them!Summary:  These are a great, casual, warm (but not bulky) boot.  I will update when I have worn them longer - but so far I can absolutely recommend them!  I hope this is helpful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZ9T5MMI1V4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ18RTW#wasThisHelpful","R3UZ9T5MMI1V4C","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw all the good reviews - so I was disappointed when I received this product.  Here is why:Quality: They are cheaply made.  For example, the noses are not centered and the tuft on the boy's scarf is literally hanging by a thread. Their hair/bangs is cut unevenly (longer on one end than the other - I was actually thinking of giving them a haircut!)  And finally their ears don't stand up as pointy as they do in the picture.Not Made for Playing: I have 4 year old boy/girl twins (which is why I bought this set).  I was thinking of giving this set to them to play with at Christmas time.  However, it is so cheaply made, they would destroy the dolls in 30 minutes - they are just too fragile for playing with.Not like ""Elf on a Shelf"":  These dolls don't have anything in the limbs or torso to hold the pose.  So the only way they will sit is if they are leaning on something - otherwise they will just fall over.Cute:  Having said all of that - they are cute.  I got them on a lightning deal for $14.  And for $14 they are just worth it.  I guess based on all the other reviews I was expecting a better made doll.Summary:  If you buy them to put out as decoration only, and don't look at them too closely, and place them on a shelf where they can ""lean"" - then they are pretty decent, because again, they are cute.  I guess it is all about setting expectations - right?  :)I hope this is helpful to you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMY8BINSYRTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHZW7UG#wasThisHelpful","R2CMY8BINSYRTV","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, these are comfortable!  I have a couple pairs of NYDJs and I think these are the most comfy.  The corduroy is really soft and stretchy!Color and Material: the winter-white is a nice cream color that I would feel comfortable wearing after Labor Day.  In fact the ribs on the corduroy are small enough that from far away it doesn't look like ""corduroy"", it just looks soft.  So I would feel safe wearing these all year long (I live in Los Angeles) because the white is not ""too white"" and the corduroy is not to ""corduroy'y"" (that would be the first time in my life I have written the word ""Corduroy'y!!!"")  :)Size:  I normally wear a 12.  With NYDJs I always wear a 10 (they say to do a size down with NYDJs).  But with these pants, I accidentally bought a 12.  And I am glad I did.  The 12 fits perfectly.  So with these pants, go true to size - don't buy one size down.The ""Posterior"":  I do not have a 'well defined or accentuated posterior'  (like how I said that?  in other words - ""flat"")!  But these pants gave my rear a nice shape.  Both my husband and I liked how it looked!Bottom:  The bottoms of the pants are not like leggings where they are snug on the ankle as well - instead they flair out a bit.  Not like a boot-cut, but like a straight jean.  Which is surprising given how snug the rest of the pants are.  I am tall (6'), so the bottom pants with the flair hit me in the wrong spot.  I folded them up, to make a long capri, which looked cute.  But normally I would wear these pants with boots in the winter.  Which will be a little tougher because I will have to fold the pants into my socks to have them fit well in the boots.  The sizing says the inseam is 31"".  I did not measure them, but that seems about right (no pun intended!)  So if you are on the shorter side, the flair will probably hit right and you could wear them as shown in the photo.  Personally, I wish they made a ""tall"" version of these or made the ankle snug.  But again, if you are on the shorter side, you won't have a problem with these pants.Washing:  Haven't worn or washed them yet.  So I will update after having washed several times.I hope this is helpful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JYKY8UMOMUWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR9OCOU#wasThisHelpful","R1JYKY8UMOMUWZ","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two other pairs of Cobb Hill sandals (the Gina and the Aubrey) - so I was excited to try this cute boot.

"My sectional couch slides on my wood floors.  It was so irritating to be constantly moving the couch back into place.  After researching the issue here on Amazon, I purchased the ""Dura-Grip Heavy Duty 3/8"" Thick Non-Slip Rubber Furniture Floor Pads"".  I cut them to fit the legs of my couch but inevitably the legs would come off the pads.  To solve this problem, I had to leave around an inch of space on each side of the couch leg.  Which leads me to my complaint: the Dura-Grip pads looked UGLY on the wood floor.  But I dealt with it... For 2 years I dealt with it.  Until now...I was offered to review this product.  And because of the ugly pads I had been looking at for 2 years, I jumped at the chance.And here is what I have learned: these Metric pads keep my couch from sliding just as well as the Dura-Grip - without the ugly pad sticking out the sides.  I am THRILLED!I will update when I have used them for a while.  But in the last 2 weeks my couch has not slid at all and the pads are much more discreet and better looking than the Dura-Grip.  To sum up - I would absolutely recommend these pads, not just to protect your floor, but for me (more importantly) to keep furniture from sliding.  I hope this is helpful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3KMVA5G0AK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123KWF4S#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3KMVA5G0AK6","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an average sized 4 year old.  When he saw this set he was pretty excited.  However, the excitement did not last long.  Here are the issues:Sword: the sword is hard foam.  Which is good for not causing damage.  However, the sword broke in half at the base of the blade/top of the handle after a couple of days of use.  We tried gluing it, but it didn't hold.Cape:  it is a bit too tight at the neck.  There is maybe an inch or two of play.  Which is not that much for a kid running around.  He excitedly put it on the first time, thought it was too tight and hasn't worn it since.Sum:  If you are giving this to a boy with a thin neck that is very gentle with toys - then this is a great set.  However, for the rest of the boys out there, it would be better if the neck was an inch or two bigger and maybe if there was a more solid layer under the foam to keep the sword from breaking easily.

And they are comfortable and don't interfere with phone use or other things against my ears.They are both classy and fun.  I can wear them professionally to a work meeting, as well as out dancing.

"I have used this bag for over a month. And here are my thoughts:COLOR - I actually bought the black, sand, ambrosia and periwinkle colored purses because I wasn't sure which bags I would want to keep. The colors are all true as pictured. But I ended up keeping the black and sand colors just because they are the most versatile. That said - the colors are all nice - so choose the one you will wear most.SIZE: I can fit my iPhone 6, my smallish wallet, and some other small items (lipstick, pens, small bottle of advil etc.) but I am unable to fit my sunglass case or anything bigger. So I can't rely on this as my everyday purse when I will need to carry more items... Instead I use this bag when I am out for the afternoon or evening and don't need to carry a lot. But I use my big purse for everything else. Also something to note, when I am able to stuff more in the purse, it gets too weighted and the thin strap hurts my shoulder. So this purse really is meant to just carry the bare essentials.HANGS: This purse is meant to hang cross body. When you hang it on your shoulder and let it hang straight down, it doesn't really hang right, it kind of hangs on an angle. So this bag can be hung straight down, but it will feel more comfortable hung cross body.LENGTH: I am 6' tall. I have it on the longest length and it does fit correctly. There is around 6"" of play, So this purse will work for most women,LINING / POCKETS: The pockets are nice (I like keeping lipstick, pens in the front pocket; feminine products in the interior pocket; and receipts in the outside back flap). And the lining is cute.SCENT: of the 4 bags I purchased, 2 of them had a strong smell (maybe from the glue?) when I opened them up. But after a couple of days the scent went away.SUM: At this price-point ($30-$50 a bag), you can buy 4 bags for the price of one of the ""nicer"" bags. That is why I felt totally comfortable keeping 2 of them to wear with different outfits. I wish the bag ""magically"" held more, but in reality that would just make it a bigger bag. It is both cute and classy, and I am glad I bought it. I just wish they had designed the bag so it would hang straight when I don't wear it cross body.

"Wow - take a look at my attached photo.  That is a gallon size ziplock bag (approximately 11"" x 9"").  That dusty dirt filled up almost half of the bag and weighed a pound or two, from just 2 rugs!There is so much hype regarding this Shark vacuum that I decided to actually compare.  I vacuumed 2 rugs in my house with my old Hoover vacuum.  And then I vacuumed the exact same 2 rugs with this Shark.  HOLY MOLY!  (And I don't know if I have ever written the words 'holy moly' before!!)  LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRT!!!  (I have 3 year old twins and to be frank it is kind of grossing me out that they have been playing on all that dirt this whole time!)This vacuum is AWESOME!Before buying my vacuum I called Shark to find out about all the differences between their vacuums.  ""NV"" is their normal prefix before their model number.  But like a lot of manufacturers, when they sell items at Costco they give it a different model number.  So at Costco it is a ""UV560"".  Apparently the 750 series is the exact same as the 650 series.  (There was a recall on some of the 650 vacuums.  People got nervous about the 650s even though Shark had fixed the problem.  So as a 'marketing strategy' they now also have the 750s.  Same product, same price - it just makes people feel more comfortable....)  Those are their ""flagship"" vacuums.  But they are also a couple of hundred dollars more.  When I brought up this UV560 at Costco, he looked up the product and all the accessories.  He said that this UV560 at Costco (current price of $199) is a GREAT deal.  He said I would be getting more than a $100 in accessories, the vacuum has the same ""power"" and ""suction capabilities"" as the 650/750  and he said I really couldn't go wrong with this 560.  And he was right!I will update when I have used it longer.  But so far I am thrilled - who knew I could ""love"" a vacuum!  I hope this is helpful to you as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BWSDPGD74U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6P0KKU#wasThisHelpful","R7BWSDPGD74U3","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband bought this case - and loves it.  BUT buy it in brown!He spoke with the folks at the Apple Store, and they said the brown wears down the best.  Because the cases are leather, they do scratch and show dirt.  But if you buy the brown, the leather wears down the best and will look 'purposely scruffy' over time (like when people buy worn in looking jeans).  Whereas the other colors will just look dirty and old.Also, at the time my husband bought it, it was around $45 at the Apple Store (which is cheaper than the price being sold on Amazon), so you may want to compare pricing before buying.UPDATE:  My husband has now been using this brown case for a year.  His phone is still completely protected (despite numerous drops, daily use and kids handling his phone) and he still loves the case.  The case is now an ""espresso"" color instead of brown.  But again - it looks good - I looks like it is 'supposed' to look that color.  So, after a year of use - he can absolutely recommend the brown case.I hope this is helpful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I07KHFREQG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHD9WWO#wasThisHelpful","R3I07KHFREQG5P","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a rolling pin for my 2.5 year old twins to use with play dough.  The problem with most children's rolling pins is that they don't roll:  the pins are connected to the barrel in one piece.  This rolling pin is different - it is just like the one I grew up with - but smaller.Here is the best part - I use it too!  Both for cookies and pie crust.  Now it is not ideal, because it is smaller (so it takes me a bit longer to make everything smooth and perfect) - however, because of the small size it fits in my kitchen drawers nicely, whereas the big ones don't fit in a drawer with other utensils.  Therefore, I would gladly take the tradeoff of the smaller size for its convenience.Therefore I recommend it both for play and for real cooking.

Because it is fairly noisy, and because the bouncy was in a smaller room, the noise was too much for our normally adventurous son.  So after that initial use he shied away from it (until a couple weeks later when the fun his sister was having got the best of him).  So I would recommend, if your kids are at all sensitive to loud noises, to do a couple of things:  - use it outside instead of inside where the noise will not be so 'noisy'  - if you use it inside, try to block the noise of the blower (e.g., place the blower in another room or a closet with the door popped open just enough for the air tube to fit through, but also to buffer the noise a bit.)  - if the noise is too much outside, we did the same thing with the garage door - we put the bouncy right next to the garage door, put the blower inside the garage, and propped the garage door open by 8 inches with a box - this allowed the air tube to work correctly, but the almost-closed garage door buffered the noise a bitStorage: As others have said, it is super easy to set up and take down.  We keep it in our garage covered by a tarp: we have the tarp under the bouncy, we fold the bouncy, and we cover the top of the bouncy with the tarp (picture a pita bread sandwich).  We then just slide the tarp into the garage when we are done with it.  When ready for use, pull the the tarp out, uncover it, leave the bouncy folded, plug it in, and the thing just pumps itself up.  The tarp protects the bottom, allows for easy sliding, and keeps it clean in the garage.We love this bouncy and can't believe the fun our kids are having with it - and what a great way to burn off some of their extra energy!!!I hope this is helpful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV49CDCB11R2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EGYWT4#wasThisHelpful","RV49CDCB11R2E","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have twins and have been using this IKEA highchair for 1.5 years now, and here is what I have learned.If you buy it at IKEA you have to buy the tray and the padding separately, but all said and done I think it was $30 per set-up (highchair, tray and padding). I did not buy this highchair from this particular seller, so I am going to review the highchair and not the seller or the seller's price.I really like the Antilop. It is neutral colored, it doesn't take up a lot of space (or visual space if you know what I mean) - basically it blends, which is good in our smaller kitchen.It is also really easy to clean. Sometimes I just lift the chair up and pour all the cherrios right into the sink. Or there was one particularly messy time I took the chair right outside and hosed it off! Cleaning this chair is easy!Also, because it is light, I will carry it outside for bbqs - or carry it wherever we are eating - it is highly transportable. In fact we have been using the chair without the tray and pushing it right up to our dining room table - it is the perfect height for the kids to sit with us for family dinners.One thing to note, it is NOT easy to take off the tray, you basically have to use some strength and yank the thing off from the front corner. (Put your hands on opposing corners, brace the back corner and yank up the front corner.) You feel like you a breaking it, but you aren't. Because of this, I leave the tray on always and only take it off for serious cleanings and/or when we bring the chair right up to the dining table for a family dinner. I never take the tray off when the kids are sitting in the high chair. Therefore you are not relying on the tray to keep your kids from standing up - instead you are relying on the straps. So make sure the chair you choose has straps and as the kids get older, that you use them (because without the straps my kids will stand up in this chair - luckily they have never fallen).My kids are now 2 and are 95% for height and 75% for weight and they are still very comfortable in this chair (we no longer use the padding) with plenty of room for more growing.I have been very happy with this chair and would recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXA00G3DPO0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBJFGAA#wasThisHelpful","R1RXA00G3DPO0R","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wearing podiatrist-made orthopedics for years because of Plantar Fasciitis - I need both a good heel cup and a high arch.  The problem is, I am constantly switching them between shoes and am forever worried I will lose them (and boy are those podiatrist-made ones expensive!)  So, I decided to buy a pair of these to act as a 'back up' to the podiatrist insoles, and just keep them in a pair of shoes (without switching them out).  And to my pleasant surprise, they are GREAT!I have worn them everyday (for at least 4 hours a day) for the past 6 weeks, and they have hung in there - they still provide great support and are almost as good as the ones my podiatrist made from a mold of my foot and charged me $200!In fact, they are so good, and such a good 'bang for the buck' - I have bought one pair for each of the shoes/boots I wear a lot (e.g., they are awesome in Uggs and other non-supporting shoes).  I currently have 4 pairs (and have bought 2 pairs for my 78 year old mom who has the same issue).On a side note, I also bought the Full Length Envelop Orthotics from Amazon, and I don't like them nearly as well!  The heel cup is less supportive and the arch is not quite as high - so I have not used them at all.Also, if you have not worn orthotics like this before, please know that they do not have a 'slim fit' - for example, I can wear them in leather shoes/boots with a 1.5"" heel, but I couldn't wear them in a narrow dress shoe or a shoe with a high heel.  Also, because I have been wearing orthotics so long, all my shoes are around 1/2 size bigger to accommodate for the orthotics.  But if you are new to orthotics, and your shoe is already snug, then these (and any other good orthotic) may make your shoe too tight.I don't know how long they will last with consistent, daily use, but so far - they are doing great!!!

"We have been using this brush for doing dishes for a month - and I think it has been one of the best ones I have purchased!We have had other OXO scrub brushes (the kind with the soap stored in the lid), but I like this much better, here is why:- The handle is solid - it has a nice 'weight' to it- It cleans well - I can use it on a dirty pot and it works better cleaning than other brushes I have had.- The bristles are more sturdy - so far none have bent or look beat up.- After a month of use it looks the same as the day we bought it - no wear and tear.- I don't like the type of brush with the soap stored in the top - the dispenser never works quite right, I can't control the amount of soap, and they always seem to leak just a little.  So I prefer something like this where I just squeeze the amount of soap I want right onto the bristles.Therefore, I would really recommend this product!

And now the bristles are starting to look a little more worn - but it still cleans great and it looks like it will last another 5 months!

"I bought this as part of the Black Friday sales, so it was inexpensive ($9.99).  However, I feel like it is worth $5.  There is no bottom and it is very light (a pound or two) so when my 2.5 year old twins get into the hut and move around just slightly the tent moves around with them and ends up just falling off them or pushing over.  I note that other people received tents with a 'floor'.  Ours doesn't have one...In addition, it is not a plastic type fabric, but rather a paper-based fabric, which looks like it will last for a couple of days at most.  Basically it is so flimsy that my kids got in it a couple of times, they tent just fell off them, and they have given up using it (despite the fact that they love the Mickey Mouse Club House).Therefore, I would not recommend this unless you get it really inexpensively, you only have one child that will get in it, and when they do enter it they will just sit and not move.I hope this is helpful to you!","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLWWKS8255ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J40660A#wasThisHelpful","R2OLWWKS8255ZF","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am bummed! These looked so cute in the picture, but they are not great on my foot.  Here are the issues:(Let me begin by saying I do not have a big or wide foot.  I am have a size 8.5-9 foot with a normal width.  I ordered a size 9.)- The toe box is very narrow.  You can actually see how narrow it is on the photo to the left (I think it is the bottom photo).  It looks narrow in the photo and it really is narrow on the foot.- There is not enough room for the height of my foot - do you see right beneath the bottom lace, where the 'sock' part meets the 'suede' part - that part is REALLY tight.  So basically it is pinching the top of my foot about 3"" back from my toes.- The laces just seem huge when spread out to accommodate for your foot/leg.  I felt like the laces are sized to fit a Sorel snow boot.- The 'sock' part is 'floppy'.  You really need to lace it tightly to keep everything in place.- It does not seem well made - if you look at the inside, at the seams, there are pieces sticking through.I am bummed because the other reviews are so good, so I was expecting to love these...Now, if you have a very narrow, low profile foot, and you decide to buy these, you should know that they call the boot 'grey', but the photo is the correct color - it is in the beige family (not the grey family).I hope this is helpful to you!","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49JLJUR1R98L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K71QHH2#wasThisHelpful","R49JLJUR1R98L","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed colored duct tape.  So this was perfect!  However, it is not as strong as 'real' Duck Tape.  It does look similar (plastic with the threads woven in for strength like Duck Tape).

"This product looked very similar to another set sold here on Amazon (as of Nov 2014) with the label of ""Grunwerg - 4 pcs Child Set - Windsor"" for around $13.  And the reason - it is exactly the same set!  This set is distributed by Grunwerg (an English company) but is made in China.  Now granted prices fluctuate here on Amazon, but when I bought it, this set was just under $10 and the other set is just under $14 - so I am loving the $4 savings!Also, other reviewers have spoken about the sizing of the spoons.  The 'big spoon' is 5ml or 1 teaspoon.  The 'small spoon' is just a hair over 3.75ml (I used the syringe to measure infants medication to figure it out).  I like that the 'big spoon' has a slightly deeper bowl than the teaspoon that comes with my flatware set.  It makes it easier to keep food in the spoon and out of their lap!I like the look and the feel of this set - I have 2 year old twins and bought two sets to decide if I like them - and I do - so I am going to order 2 more sets.I hope this is hopeful to you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6K12DK31PWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058NW79G#wasThisHelpful","R1J6K12DK31PWA","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before buying this wheely I spent a LOT of time reading through all the reviews as to whether to get the small or large wheely for my 1.5 year old boy/girl twins.  And I made the WRONG decision - so I am hoping I can help others.I have big kids (95% on height) so I figured I should buy the big one so they can grow into it.  When I first bought it for them they pushed it around with their hands, but quickly got bored because their legs were too short to ride on it.  Now that they are 2.4 years old and their legs are long enough, they are more excited to ride a tricycle or a scooter, and this is too 'sedate' for them.So this is what I would recommend.  Measure the inseam of your kid's legs.  If they are 14"" or longer, then buy the large size.  But if their legs are shorter and you want them to ride on it now, then buy the small size.Now, something to think about - I keep the wheelys outside - so my kids have a lot of options of things to ride on.  So they hardly ever choose the wheelys.  If this was an 'inside toy' with no other exciting options to ride on, then they would probably use it more.So, to summarize: - legs (inseam) shorter than 13"" - buy the small. - legs (inseam) longer than 14"" - buy the large - if your kids are already on tricycles, scooters or anything that goes a bit faster, they will be bored with this outside - and I would plan on it being an 'inside toy' where it will be used more. - if you are going to use it inside, then I would buy the smaller one because it will take up less space and will be more maneuverable. - Basically I should have bought the small so they could have used it when they were younger and not yet ready for faster toys.I hope this is helpful to you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R253FGEWJ3TPW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GX0B3M#wasThisHelpful","R253FGEWJ3TPW4","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put these onto my old enamel tub more than 2 years ago - both to prevent me and my 2.5 year old twins from slipping.  I bought 3 packages and used most of the turtles - but I wanted them fairly close together so we wouldn't slip.I followed the directions - and they have not peeled off at all!  No corners are up...  No edges showing wear...  They look as good as they day I put them on!  (I saw that some other reviewers complained that their stickers had come up - I wonder if it makes a difference as to the type of tub you have?  The sticker's adhesive is still strong on my old enamel tub, so I wonder if the people that gave it poor reviews had a plastic tub?  Or, in the alternative, I cleaned it really well (rubbing alcohol and all) before putting down the stickers, so I wonder if that made a huge difference?  I am just trying to figure out the reason for some of the other reviews....)Some things to note - I tried using the lysol wipes to clean the tup after one particularly messy toddler experience, and the bleaching agents on the wipes dulled the color of one of the turtles - so I wouldn't recommend using a cleansing product that has a bleach component.And sometimes when my kids have been playing in the tub for a while their rear is a bit red from the texture of the sticker.  Now granted, they have sensitive skin.  And I would assume it would be the same with all tub stickers, because you need a texture on the sticker to keep from you from slipping.  But just FYI, you may notice your kids skin may get a bit red from too much sliding on the sticker.  I figure their slightly red skin from sitting on the sticker is the lessor of the evils compared to falling!To sum up - these have been GREAT for us.  They are super cute.  They look perfect after 2 years.  And there have been zero slips or falls.  I hope this is helpful to you as well!UPDATE:  My kids are now 3.5 - which means they have been on the tub for 3 years.  And they still look just as great, work perfectly, and have not come up.  I am thrilled with these little tub tattoos!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2408KIT11YSRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LTHV28#wasThisHelpful","R2408KIT11YSRE","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have twins and have been using this IKEA highchair for 1.5 years now, and here is what I have learned.If you buy it at IKEA you have to buy the tray and the padding separately, but all said and done I think it was $30 per set-up.  I did not buy this highchair from this particular seller, so I am going to review the highchair and not the seller or the seller's price.I really like the Antilop. It is neutral colored, it doesn't take up a lot of space (or visual space if you know what I mean) - basically it blends, which is good in our smaller kitchen.It is also really easy to clean. Sometimes I just lift the chair up and pour all the cherrios right into the sink. Or there was one particularly messy time I took the chair right outside and hosed it off! Cleaning this chair is easy!Also, because it is light, I will carry it outside for bbqs - or carry it wherever we are eating - it is highly transportable.  In fact we have been using the chair without the tray and pushing it right up to our dining room table - it is the perfect height for the kids to sit with us for family dinners.One thing to note, it is NOT easy to take off the tray, you basically have to use some strength and yank the thing off from the front corner.  (Put your hands on opposing corners, brace the back corner and yank up the front corner.)  You feel like you a breaking it, but you aren't. Because of this, I leave the tray on always and only take it off for serious cleanings and/or when we bring the chair right up to the dining table for a family dinner. I never take the tray off when the kids are sitting in the high chair. Therefore you are not relying on the tray to keep your kids from standing up - instead you are relying on the straps. So make sure the chair you choose has straps and as the kids get older, that you use them (because without the straps my kids will stand up in this chair - luckily they have never fallen).My kids are now 2 and are 95% for height and 75% for weight and they are still very comfortable in this chair (we no longer use the padding) with plenty of room for more growing.I have been very happy with this chair and would recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6QGPVF83YSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3ABPOY#wasThisHelpful","R3O6QGPVF83YSI","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Garden of Life products and bought this vitamin based on all the great reviews.  However, I have an adult family member that has low level anxiety (not enough anxiety to require a prescription) - and this makes his anxiety worse.I just gave him 2 pills in the morning, and he tells me that within an hour he can feel is anxiety level raise.  So I think what ever the components are in the vitamin that gives everyone else 'energy', are the same components that makes him feel more stressed and anxious (if he drinks too much coffee it is the same thing).So if you have anxiety, maybe start with just 2 pills in the morning and see if it gets worse for you.  I wish I would have known about the possible connection between his anxiousness and the vitamin beforehand so I would have stopped giving him the pills earlier...(Btw, we also bought the Vitamin Code - Family Vitamin, thinking that may help, but it didn't, it was the same result.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJ7QWQ4GVT8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00322DPFU#wasThisHelpful","RXJ7QWQ4GVT8O","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I buy these at Costco for $14 (Although please remember Costco's prices fluctuate). But will review them here in case you would like to buy them on Amazon.Packaging- These are small packages with around 4-5 bite sized pieces in each bag. You will open the bag and think 'this is it???' But those 5 bites are perfect!- Because they are individually packaged I leave a couple extra in the car for my kids when they get hungry. It is a simple and super satisfying snack.Ingredients- Each bag contains 150 calories, 11g fat, 10-12g carbs, and 4-5g protein- 100% vegan / no dairy- No cholesterol- Gluten free / wheat free- No preservativesBlueberry Pomegranate: almonds, cashews, pistachios, pure cane sugar, rice syrup, blueberry, pomegranate, sea salt and natural flavorsCashew Crunch: Cashews, pure cane sugar, rice syrup and sea saltCranberry Pomegranate: almonds, cashews, pistachios, pure cane sugar, rice syrup, cranberry, pomegranate, sea salt and natural flavorsFlavorThey are bite sized nut squares that are sweet (with a little salt to balance the sweetness). Cashew Crunch is the least sweet with a nice pleasant flavor. The blueberry and pomegranate flavors have a distinct berry-ness and are sweeter. I like all 3!To sum up: I love that I can look at the ingredients and recognize every word! I love that they are delicious and my whole family gobbles them up (including my 2 year old twins). And I love that they are in small packages for easy snacking and to control my eating (so I don't eat too many). If I could request one thing, it would be that they are organic (because we try to eat as clean as possible).

"I have 2 pairs of Paige jeans in dark blue (the same fit - Hidden Hills Straight).  What I love about those dark blue jeans is how flattering they are - I actually feel 'thin' (or at least 'thinner' than my other jeans/pants).  So I decided to buy the same size and fit in white.  Wow - just not flattering when I first put them on!  I can actually see the dents of my cellulite (sorry if this is TMI).  Such a shame!!!!!!  Now, I am not fat, but I do have a lot of cellulite - so if you just have a bit, you should be fine.  But if you are like me, then these white jeans are probably not the ones for you - UNLESS you buy one size bigger than you normally would or have very thin legs so the material is not stretched/snug.Update:  I kept the tags on and wore them around the house.  And like any jean they stretched just a bit and I don't see the orange rind any more - much better!  I will keep them and just keep them away from the dryer!  So, when buying, if you wear Paige jeans, buy the size you normally wear and let them stretch a bit before you make the final decision.  For those of you that haven't worn Paige jeans, if you are in between sizes - go one size up (unless you are really skinny - in which case I am jealous!  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WY4H0IPCWQ29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X5BBRE#wasThisHelpful","R2WY4H0IPCWQ29","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these pencils for work - I write a lot, so I need it to be comfortable.  I love controlling the thickness/darkness of the pencil line with the different leads - so I choose the .7mm (over the .5mm pencil) to give a wider/thicker line (and I buy a softer lead to make the line dark without pressing hard on the paper).

"In reading all the other posts, some complained that this comb does not hold enough hair; others say it is perfect.  So I didn't know if it would work for me - it doesn't, but it does work for my mother!This comb is small - around 1 3/4"" x 7/8"".It is too flimsy for my hair - I use the Vidal Sassoon Medium sized combs, and they work for my hair.  I was going to use this in a smaller section of hair, but it didn't hold.My mother, on the other hand, wears her hair in an 'up-do'.  She uses bobby pins (at least 15-20 of them) to hold her hair in place.  She liked using these combs instead of a bobby pin in certain key areas of her up-do - it gave her the right amount of 'lift' to the hair.So, the moral of the story - if a normal size bobby pin would work for you, then one of these combs would replace one bobby pin.  But if one bobby pin wouldn't hold your hair sufficiently, then this comb will be too small and flimsy for you.Because it feels flimsy, I can see it working in a baby or toddler's hair, in VERY fine hair, or in an up-do (along with other bobby pins and combs).  But for everyone else, I would probably suggest the medium size instead.I hope this is helpful to you...","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGWMW37TDTKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OT1RJS#wasThisHelpful","R3GGWMW37TDTKH","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was trying to figure out what size to buy for my babies, so I looked up the info on their website.  Here is what I learned:It is recommended to get the swim diapers according to weight, not age.  (You will notice that the age and weights below do NOT match up.)  If you baby has bigger thighs, and you are in between sizes, then go up a size.  It is supposed to be snug around the thighs to keep in solids, but you don't want it too tight.Here is the sizing from the Manufacturer:12 months = 10 - 15 lbs18 months = 15 - 20 lbs24 months = 18 - 25 lbs2T = 20 - 30 lbs3T = 30 - 40 lbs4T = 40+ lbsI hope this is helpful to you as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKF1JK4OU6I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00820J7KO#wasThisHelpful","R1BKF1JK4OU6I6","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the idea of this hat, but it took me a while to figure out the difference between the Infant vs Baby vs Child vs Youth sizes.  Here is what I have learned:Infant - does NOT have the mesh on the sides or the sizing adjuster on the back (it does have a break-away strap) - 18-20""  (PLEASE SEE 9/14 UPDATE BELOW)Baby - does NOT have the mesh on the sides or the sizing adjuster on the back (it does have a break-away strap) - 19.5-21.5"" (PLEASE SEE 9/14 UPDATE BELOW)Child - does have the mesh on the sides and sizing adjuster on the back (some colors have a break-away strap) - 20-22""Youth - does have the mesh on the sides and sizing adjuster on the back (does not have a break-away strap) - 21-23""I have 18 month old twins.  I have read from other posts that the infant and baby sizes are too big.  Therefore even though the Child size is supposed to be for 2-5 years, I bought the Child size.  When I adjust the Child hat to make it as small as possible, it is 19.5"".  Given the sizes of the Infant and Baby hats - 19.5 works!  I want to be able to adjust the hat, and the 2 inch margin is just too large on the Infant/Baby hats without the adjustment!I used these hats on a 2 week vacation at the beach.  My kids will fight any hat.  When I first put them on, they fight me, but then they forget they are wearing it.  I was worried that the break-away strap would be too 'flimsy' but it wasn't.  It stayed secure when the kids tried to pull their hat off.  Just like the kids initially fight the hat, they also fight sunscreen.  And I really appreciated that they didn't get their face/head/neck burnt at all during that 2 week period - even when the kids 'won' and weren't wearing sunscreen.Now, having said all that - I received a 'defective' hat.  I might not have even known it was defective, except for the fact that I bought two.  On the 'good hat' the strap does not have any loose ends.  On the defective hat, the strap end is not sewed up and away.  The impact: in order to adjust the size of the strap I have to take the hat off and play with the straps to tighten or loosen the strap; and the strap just dangles and hangs under the chin.  Versus on the, good hat there is no dangling and I can adjust the strap while it is on their head.  Can I live with it because I don't want to deal with sending it back?  Yes.  But I am slightly irked...  I bought the defective one for around $14, and I am wondering if that was the reason for the price difference?9/30/14 UPDATE:  I just spoke to a Customer Service Rep at Sunday Afternoons - here is what I learned:  They are discontinuing the Infant hat (specifically because it doesn't have the adjustment in the back).  Therefore if you find an Infant hat, it will probably be on sale.  By 2015 there most likely won't be many Infant hats left.Instead they have added an adjustment to the Baby hat.  So now ALL of their play hats have adjustments on the back!!  That is great news!  The main difference now between the Baby hat and the larger sizes is the mesh on the side.  The Rep said there is no mesh on the sides of the Baby hat to give better sun protection.That said, it is possible if you order a Baby hat online that you may be sent an old version of the Baby hat without the back adjustment, so you may want to contact the seller first to confirm it is the new version with the adjustment and they aren't selling you an old version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U59BFD1D412R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018TRSEI#wasThisHelpful","R2U59BFD1D412R","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am particular about my socks.  I hate when I can feel the seam near my toes, and this seam is comfortable.  I wear these socks daily for work.  Because I give lectures where I am standing all day, my feet need to be comfortable.  And lets face it, if you are thinking about your socks something is wrong!  These socks stay up, never bunch or have hot spots.  And because they are a liner, they are not thick and they keep my feet a pleasant temperature - not too hot, or wet or smelly!

"I have 16 month old boy/girl twins.  I really like the brush for my son, in fact when I go to brush his hair he sits very quietly and really enjoys getting his hair brushed!However, my daughter has slightly longer (not yet at her shoulders), very fine hair that tends to knot in the back from sleeping, so she wakes up with knots at the back of her head.  This brush does not touch those tiny little knots.

"I have 16 month old boy/girl twins that are in the 95% and I was hoping these would work given the other reviews.  They kind of do, but the fit is still too large.  At the top there is almost an inch gap between their head and the headphones.I would recommend measuring your child's head where the headphones would rest and looking to see if their head is close to 14 inches from ear to ear, if so, this should fit your child well (as it will expand as they get older).(I used a cloth measuring tape and put the measuring tape where the earphones would be along the top of their head for a correct measurement - if you don't have that, you could use a string, see the fit, and then measure the string.  When I measured the headphone, I did it from the center of each earpiece, i.e., the center of the ear.)We can use it now, but only if the kids sit quietly and don't move their head, because when they move their head the headphones fall off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38C2XV8YXHYKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PYD8SI#wasThisHelpful","R38C2XV8YXHYKX","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have bought the horse barn, the puppies and the tree with the forest animals.  Kids love these.  I saw the negative reviews for the kittens so I called the manufacturer before ordering.  Here is what I learned:- The photo here on the Amazon website is still incorrect (as of Oct. 2013).  The photo shows short-haired cats and they have pointy faces (some other reviewers said they looked like rats).- Because of the complaints the manufacturer changed the product.  Their fur is now longer (around 1/2 inch) and their faces and bodies are fuller.- They are slightly bigger than the puppies and the horses- The carrier now has a back-door- Apparently there are some retailers that may still have the older model, but most now carry the newer model.Things to know about the carriers for all the animals:- When the carrier arrives it is slightly squished - I just stuffed in some clothes and let it sit a day or two, and when I removed the clothes the carrier was fine.- The velcro on the back door isn't great, I wish they used more to keep the back door shut properly.  But my kids were fine with it.To sum up:- If you are giving it to a child that likes kittens, then they will love this.  Likewise, horses to a horse lover, puppies to a dog lover.  Between the puppies, horses, kittens and tree with the forest animals, if I had to choose, I guess I like the kittens the least.  However, again, a child that likes kittens will really like this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCMNJ7PBRUBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MX5E56#wasThisHelpful","R1HCMNJ7PBRUBP","A18LSLYBRPCNT4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18LSLYBRPCNT4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that they are getting both Omega 3s and Vitamin D3 (which is great for their immunity).  As others have commented the flavor is great, but some don't like the 'oiliness'.

"Pros :(1) Excellent for preventing constipation.(2) Gritty textureCons :(1) Very high in oxalates like other brans like rice brans, oat brans. Oxalates combine with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate in kidney stones, joints, etc. Because calcium oxalate crystals have sharp edges, kidney stones and crystals in joints can be ""very painful"".The pain can be BAD enough to land people in the emergency room.Doctors suggest eating high-oxalate foods with high-calcium foods at the ""same time"" to ""reduce"" the absorption of oxalates into the blood and urine, some of the insoluble calcium oxalates can then be excreted in the feces.(2) I take ""dextrin"" powder like in Benefiber, Equate Fiber Powder (16.7oz for $9.5 at Walmart), etc..

"I  have bought 2 Philips 210641 - TUV PL-L 18W from Light Bulbs International, 1 worked for about 12 months, 1 flickers continuously and causes the red light on the Swordfish UV air purifier to flicker also. The second bulb appears to be defective or damaged in shipping. So I bought a new one sold by Amazon.This review is for Philips 210641 - TUV PL-L 18W Germicidal bulb bought from Light Bulbs International------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My old non-Philips bulb has 4 squares inside the bulb, this doe not. This comes in a rectangular retail box with the word ""Philips"" printed on the box and on the base of the bulb.I highly recommend this Philips bulb because :(1) I replaced the old non-Philips bulb which has been used for 6 months and is still working, with this Philips bulb. After 1 to 2 days, the smell in the kitchen is no longer noticeable.(2)My old bulb has a useful life of 5000 hours, this Philips bulb, 9000 hours.5000 hours / 24hours=208 days=7 months  9000hours=12.5 months(3)It produces little or no ozone(4)According to Philips' website, this bulb produces a bigger percentage of 253.7 nm (UVC) light which is the best for killing germs or damaging the DNA of germs. Other brand bulbs may produce less percentage of the 253.7 nm light.It takes time and research to write this review.

"According to SUNBEAM customer service, all the different types of heated blanket use the same electrical system and control.They differ only in the fabric like terry cloth, fleece, or plush fabric, and in the stitching.The label stitched on the blanket and pasted on the electric control do not tell the model or type of the blanket.My electric blanket caused an electric shock after 5 or more washings and stopped working after multiple washings. It had to be dried without HEAT.If you want to buy only the SUNBEAM brand heated blanket, buy the cheapest model, the Quilted Fleece, since it uses the same electric wiring and control as the more expensive models.Instead of washing the heated blanket, wash the bed sheet inserted between the blanket and your body.Buy the softest bed sheet you like such as the one with  flannel cotton or fleece.Please click ""Yes"" below if this review was helpful to you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1CW3JJY8Q5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009G7Y55O#wasThisHelpful","R3E1CW3JJY8Q5T","A2F81U787R2BZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F81U787R2BZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Do not buy the HRF-F1 HEPA filters because :(1)Kaz Inc bought Honeywell home air purifier many years ago and uses the Honeywell trademark under license. (stated on the box).Kaz does not make a one-piece HEPA filter.(2) It is a ""3-inch"" high circular filter. I stacked 3 of these for my Honeywell 50250 HEPA air purifier leaving a 3/4-inch gap . You fill the gap with a very porous dark foam provided in the box, like the one used for shipping small appliance.The foam provides a BAD seal. All 3 of my hepa filter became moldy with a strong smell after about 2 months and had to be thrown away.(3) I have to use the black foam supplied with the replacement filter to fill the gap. The gasket is made of an 1-inch thick, 2-inch wide roughly circular very porous foam like the kind used inside boxes to protect the contents during shipping. You can easily compress it to 1/4 inch or less with your fingers. This gasket is so porous it allows particles 50 micron or bigger to pass through. The air purifier is no longer ""true HEPA"" which filters out 99.97% of particles 0.3 micron or bigger.(4) I recommend buying a one-piece generic HEPA filter because you get a much better seal than porous foam against dirty air and a lower price than the price of 3 HRF-F1 filters. You can search ""honeywell hepa filter replacement"" on Amazon or google.Just make sure the filter is HEPA and fits your air purifier by comparing the replacement filter with the original filter.Warning : Honeywell sold its home air purifier business and Procter & Gamble sold its ""Pur"" water purifier business to Kaz many years ago.

"I highly recommend the Filtrete 2200 MPR filter because :(1) 2200 MPR(micro particle rating) is the highest quality AC filter 3M makes, after the new 2400 MPR.

"Oreck ProShield is not recommended, not rated by Consumer Reports magazine.  The removable assembly of metal plates and wires is called ""Truman Cell"". The cell has wires to ionize the air particles which are then captured by electrically charged metal plates.I do not recommend Oreck ProShield because :(1) Cell produces ozone, which is converted to oxygen by the non-removable zeolite panel after it. This panel gets clogged with dust after 6 months and stops converting. Vacuuming does little good.Ozone increases in concentration inside your house, damages your lungs and can cause lung cancer. Ozone is an air pollutant and health hazard reported daily by the weather service.Search on the internet about ozone generators. The instructions will tell you to ""close off and vacate"" the area to be treated. ""Make sure the unit has been turned off for about an hour"" before reoccupying the space. That is, people or pets should not be in areas with much ozone.(2) Cell ""must"" be washed with cleaner and water every 2 to 3 weeks or whenever the red light comes on or when ""annoying"" sparking occurs. A dirty cell lets the dirty air pass through it with little filtration.(3) Cell must be ""completely dried"" after cleaning, for 6 to 24 hours, depending on humidity, otherwise the air purifier will not start.(4) Cell captures a smaller percentage of particles with each pass as fan speed increases.(5) Percentage of particles captured by Cell varies from 0% to 80% depending on how clean the Truman cell is. A ""true"" HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles 0.3 micron or bigger, even when dirty.I recommend buying a ""true"" HEPA air purifier made by IQair, Whirlpool, Honeywell etc. No cleaning every few weeks. No drying for 6 to 24-hours. No downtime.

"I have had several brands of Goji berries and Healthworks versions are near the top.  These are very flavorful, not at all stale, and the packaging is ideal.  A quick rip of the top and you can get into the bag while counting on the zipper seal to tighten things up again when you've gotten what you want from the bag.The berries are fresh from this year and properly and uniformly dried.  I'd have to guess about 10% moisture remains, giving them a nice chewy texture while keeping away any potential to go bad.  I use this product in my green smoothies to add some earthy notes and to pack in as much high quality nutrient food as possible.  These are amazingly high in antioxidants and other nutrients.  Truly a super-food.  I will also take these things along on a hiking trail.  You can get a lot of nutrients in just a few handfuls and a couple of ounces.For those who complain about the stickiness, that's just the nature of the product, and not much different than raisins or dried cherries.

"This is a really nice little dog collar.  I wasn't expecting much because it's very seasonal and you might not expect such a thing to last long.  However, this one is far better than anticipated.  I got the middle one in the product picture with the gold border for our Jack Russell terrier, and we have already sized and adjusted it so that it can go on right after Halloween.The bow is a bit much for me, but my wife likes it so it will probably stay.  If not, it is easily removable by human hands, though not at the whim of the dog.The buckle is strong and will take abuse.  It's a snap lock like you'll find on most dog collars and camping gear.  The strapping is strong and will take a lot of abuse, and overall it's very attractive and will stand out to be noticed.The only semi-con that could be said is that the tag ring seems a little lightweight.  I don't think it will break under normal use and it's hardly worth mentioning except for those who might be tempted to put the collar on a big dog that lunges on a leash.

"I got this one for myself, but I know there will be several more given away for Christmas presents.  This is one of the nicest I've seen and better than the Young Living version that I've had before.Within seconds of turning this on, there was a nice flow of mist coming from the unit.  It just happened to arrive on a day when we had some people getting sick and so I started the unit using Thieves Oil to help fight off infections.  It holds 300 ml of water and uses 2-3 drops of aroma oils per use.  There are a total of 4 timer settings including an always ON setting, so you don't have to worry about leaving it on at night.There is also an optional LED night light.  I normally don't care for those, but this one is pretty soft and relaxing so it's nice.  It's bright enough to be well seen in a room with the lights on or during the daytime, and yet serves as a very nice nightlight as well without risking waking you up.  And because the light shines through the water, there is a water ripple effect that plays rather peacefully in the room and makes you feel like you're in an aqua zone.  There is also a very relaxing white noise sound that comes from this unit, and it sounds like air flowing with some bubble sounds.I don't know if the seller intended it or not, but there's also a slight output of negative ions.  You can feel it when you are close to the unit and if you know anything about negative ions, you'll understand that they are beneficial for your mental and physical health, helping to remove contaminates from the air.I received this unit as a promotional allowance for my evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLNHLE9OF0VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ENRQU4#wasThisHelpful","RFLNHLE9OF0VW","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic bed for our 13 yr old Jack Russell terrier.  He's a mix so fairly large in size and therefore we got the large version.  That plus our family is a ""dog family"" and all our kids bring their pooch in during visits.  We wanted one that all the dogs could take turns laying down in the bed and they do.  One gets up and another one slides into place.What we didn't anticipate was how humans love this as well.  We got it in while 2 of our grandkids were in town visiting, and I walked out in the living room to see a 3 yr old and a 6 yr old all cuddled up together in it sleeping.The fabric is both plush and yet very durable.  And we have found that the hair from our dog vacuums right up instead of getting stuck in the fabric like the other beds that we have had.There is also a zipper on the back of the mattress portion and the inside can be pulled out and washed if necessary.I didn't think that the pillow would be worth much or that any of the dogs would like it, but it is a prize possession.  We did however think that should our daughter's pit bull get her teeth on it, that she'd shred it.  To our surprise, this hasn't happened.I've never bought a dog bed in this price category before, but this one is worth the extra money.  It is highly recommended and that's my best rating and recommendation.I received a sample of this dog bed for my assessment and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MDWOBEYNVVH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MZ7SVO#wasThisHelpful","R2MDWOBEYNVVH0","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't expecting anything so nice when I ordered this watch, but it far exceeds my expectations.  I was quite pleased when I opened the shipping box to find two surprises.1) A very nice gift bag in case you are buying this as a gift for someone else.  It's got a great feel to it and has a quality closure cord.  Add a gift tag, and you're all set.2) A very attractive hair clasp.  It has nothing to do with the watch but my granddaughter loves it.  It's a bit small but strong.But on to the watch:The overall look and feel to this watch is very nice, and something I would have expected to pay more for.  It has a nice heft to it making it feel like quality, and the overall look to it backs that up.  With a leather band and a perlescent finish dial with a slightly oversized face to the watch, this is something you can wear every day but can also wear with a suit.The watchband is black, has very nice stitching, and it feels like it should last a year or two.  The face markings, hands, and rim are silver colored and nicely polished, probably chrome.  The bezel [back of the watch] appears to be stainless and has the key slots for a jeweler to be able to remove the back and fix it if it ever becomes necessary.When I first got the watch it wasn't running.  This is because it is an automatic watch that depends on movement.  It also has a winding stem to get it cranked up and into the automatic mode.  Within 3 spins of the stem, the watch was functioning normally.  According to the instructions, 30 twists of it [10-15 seconds], it will be wound up for the next 36 hours, even if it is sitting on your dresser.  When it's on your arm and so long as you are a relatively active person, it should not need winding again.Setting the watch is easy and has some nice features, though it is different from any other watch that I've had.  Fortunately, there is also a very well written and nice looking set of instructions that also comes with it.  Once you learn a couple of secrets, it's no big deal.  There are 3 positions on the watch stem, and this is how you set the time, the day, and the date.  Days are also in both English and French, making this a great watch for Canadians.So far this watch has kept absolutely perfect time.I generally include any cons that I see for a given product, but so far this one doesn't have any in my opinion.  I'll write back more after I've had this watch for awhile and give updates.I received this watch sample from the seller for my evaluation and an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24D8770TE6YCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153IMS7G#wasThisHelpful","R24D8770TE6YCG","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful mug with an incredible polished finish both inside and out.  The overall weight of the mug and obvious thickness of the material was far greater than I expected. I was expecting to see something that looked nice on a shelf but had no real user appeal. However, I have no hesitation in using these mugs for a variety of purposes.  Every mug sits flat and are perfectly matched with each other, which is a no small feat with handmade products.There are essentially 3 parts to this mug. The outside body which is copper and at least appears to be seamless, which is important over time since it can not leak. The inside is a nickel or nickel allow that is designed to protect the copper and prevent corrosion if you leave acidic drinks inside, and the handle which is made of brass. Overall, it gives quite a sophisticated appearance of something that could be sold for much more than this gem retails at.The rim or lip of the cup is rolled which means that there is no sharp metal exposed to your mouth. This is a critical factor that is sometimes not even noticed until it is too late. The other feature I've seen here is that the connection points for the handle are very solid, but they are neither spot welded or do they go through the wall of the cup. Others that do the latter will inevitably lead to leaks as acids play havoc on welds.This is perfect for either hot or cold drinks, though super hot drinks will get that handle a bit warm. However, I make coffee at 205 degrees and while the heat is noticeable, I've had Starbucks cups that are harder to handle.

"This is a great idea.  Now I can leave one cord at home when I travel because this one serves multiple purposes.  It is APPLE CERTIFIED (MFI) so you don't get those nasty messages popping up saying the cord isn't supported, you don't have to wiggle it around, and you don't have to be concerned that it may damage your appliances.  This would be good enough for me at this price, but there's more.Pros:  One cable - two ends.  It has both a micro-USB end and the MFI lightening end, meaning that it covers a lot of what you might carry around.  Even if you don't have multiple units, chances are that like me, you get asked by family and friends to help them out with a charge.  Problem solved.The ends on this are VERY solid and they aren't going anywhere.  The cord is staying put, the ends will not be separating, and it will take quite a bit of abuse.  The cord is also pretty tough.  It's a braided silver fiber cord.  It's tangle-free and crimp-free, won't get tied into knots that are hard to separate.  It's a little stiff, but still not hard to work with, and that keeps it safe from minor incidents.  Being silver, it also looks pretty cool and matches your equipment far better than most of those white and black cords.A nice little feature is the little pouch with a drawstring.  It's just enough to hold this cord and help keep it from from any other cords that might be in your bag or to keep it from unwinding.Cons:  None that I can see at this timeOverall, this is a very high quality piece of equipment and I have paid bigger prices for a lesser cord.  Overall I give this my highest rating.  I received a free sample of this product for my evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BW4EZTV904D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZHCTC0#wasThisHelpful","R33BW4EZTV904D","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice set of lights, and perfect for installation around steps or those random dark spots where footing or other security might be an issue.  I installed this on the steps going down to the driveway where the area is shielded from other lights by a tree and part of the deck.  It has been a little treacherous for my wife who doesn't have great night vision.These lights are auto on and recharge, meaning that I don't have to bother with them.  However, I have learned from similar lights in the past that it's a good idea to wipe down the solar cells that recharge the battery.  Pollens, general debris, and pollution will land on them and make them hard to charge, and that stuff can be acidic and shorten the life of the solar cell.The lights put out more light than what I thought they would and more than other similar solar recharge lamps that I've had.  They installed easily and I see these things lasting me for a very reasonable amount of time.I received this product free of charge for the purposes of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LJHK0BANSK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155II1CA#wasThisHelpful","R19LJHK0BANSK7","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the Xulis 13.3 Inch Portable Laptop bag.  While listed as a laptop bag, it's a bit small for my laptop and will be better suited for carrying other electronics such as my tablet and Kindle, with plenty of room left over for various cords and accessories, and even a couple of magazines for light reading.It is a classy looking unit with a brown leather exterior [love that leather smell], heavy woven straps and leather handles, white heavy duty accent stitching, and a cream colored accent edge on the bottom.  The zipper on it has cloth edges and a very fine tooth comb that gives a smooth feel when you open/close it.  The zipper grip is also accented with a leather and white stitch strap.  The inside is a woven vinyl product that doesn't pucker or bunch and is designed to allow things to move in and out very easily.Most of the case is just one big open area with no dividers.  However, there are a couple of small pockets on one side that are big enough to hold a couple of small cords or flashdrives.  Better than having bigger pockets though is the fact that they include a second case for cords and chargers.  It also is made of leather and seems like it will hold up.  This will start making some trips with me and is easily worth all 5 stars and a very high recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJKPBNMLYUGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D0ZZWY#wasThisHelpful","R1HJKPBNMLYUGF","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the iNeibo Kitchen Olecranon Decanter.The purpose of this product is to introduce air into the wine right before service, and thus improve the flavor and the bouquet.  With varying wines, you will get varying results, so your experience may vary from bottle to bottle.  I find it much more beneficial for red wines than white ones.Whatever the wine, it will not hurt your wine experience unless you let the wine sit too long.  By lifting those aromas and flavors out where they can be experienced, it also exposes those same things to exhaustion.  Left too long, an aerated glass of wine will start to become flat.  That's where this unit comes in handy.  Rather than decanting an entire bottle of wine, you only aerate that which you will be drinking shortly, thus preserving the flavor of that left in the bottle.Tip:  Prior to inserting the aerator into the bottle, put just a drop of a very light flavorless oil on the rubber part and run your finger around it to distribute it.  I recommend grapeseed oil as it doesn't change anything.  While there isn't a need to do this for lubrication to get the aerator into the bottle or back out, it will help to seal it off so you don't end up with a leak around the rim.The aerator also comes with a sleek looking base to store the aerator on your counter.  It's nice, but not necessary for the unit and mine will probably go in the drawer instead.  The only reason for deducting a star didn't have anything to do with the function, but instead with the appearance.  While it looks okay, I think it would take very little effort to really class it up with a band of silver or gold.  Otherwise, it's a very nice unit and one that will be used well around my house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S05QY0PQUAAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRRJST4#wasThisHelpful","R1S05QY0PQUAAR","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the iNeibo Kitchen Meat Claws.It's a bit difficult to get a relative size for these just by looking at the picture, but they are big enough to allow my fairly large hands to fit very comfortably.  My wife has fairly small hands, yet she also was able to grip them well enough to lift a roast as well.  Grip ridges on the bottom of the handle help to prevent them from turning when in heavy use.The inspiration from these things had to come from the design of a bear claw, and that's the very thing you think of when you're holding one.  It's nature's perfect design for holding and shredding meat.  Living in NC, I've pulled many a pork butt over the years, but none so fast as I did with these.  However, there was also a surprise in store when just naturally and while using them to cross shred against each other, they nicely separated out some of the fat we like to get rid of.  The real test came in how it works with some of the bark and chewier pieces of meat that carry so much flavor, yet they don't rip very easily.  These meat claws made quick work out of them, ripping them down to nice little chunks ready to be blended back in.Wash up is easy.  30 seconds with a bit of dish detergent and they are all clean.  But of course if you're not so inclined, dropping them on the top shelf of your dishwasher does a great job too.These are well packaged for gift purposes as well.  They come together in a cellophane envelop and the whole thing is then put in a very attractive rustic looking box.  For this price, it's just one of those things that everyone that operates a smoker or a grill will appreciate and even having a second pair around would be welcome.I received a sample to evaluate the product for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCFNX6H78O81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLZHKT2#wasThisHelpful","R3BCFNX6H78O81","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These potholders are incredibly versatile and belong in every residential and commercial kitchen.  This is a very nice assortment of colors that I can see assigning specific tasks based on colors, or just to liven up the presentation.  Unlike the old fabric ones, these are the kind of utilitarian pieces of equipment that you can bring out when company comes and not be embarrassed by their shabby condition or dirty appearance.Why?  Because no matter what you do to them, they clean up like new.  Silicone is amazing stuff and it bounces back, stays fresh looking, and it washes up to look like new in just a few seconds.  Or just toss them on the top shelf of the dishwasher, hook the hole onto one of the prongs and let the dishwasher clean them up for you.On the old style, if you got them wet with a bit of gravy, they didn't protect you anymore and you had to go through a wash dry cycle for a few hours before you could use them again.  And they looked messy.  With these, all the water essentially runs off and it wouldn't matter if they are wet.  They still protect your tender hands just like they were dry.  If you mess them up, a quick rinse running water with just a drop of soap and they are clean and fresh looking.  If you leave them out to get full of food that dries on, it's still no problem.  Again, toss them on the top rack of the dishwasher, and they will come out looking like new.But of course, what's a hot pad if it doesn't protect from the heat, right?  Well I use nothing but antique cast iron pans, and those handles get very hot, and they are sometimes hard to grip if the pan is heavy and my hands are soiled.  iNeibo pads the rescue!  Where other pads still allow you to feel the heat and you have to make a judgment  call as to whether you want to pick up that pan, these have no such deficiencies.  The pan can be a screaming sear pan and your hand will never know it.  They are also serious grippers.  Even oily, the gripper pads on these things allow you to maintain control.That's not where the function on these pads end either.  If you've ever tried to open a jar of pickles and found yourself beating it with a knife handle and still your hand slips, give these a try.  Obviously they don't add any torque to your arm, but they do allow your hand to grip that lid so that at least slippage isn't your issue.  A set of these will be going in Christmas stockings for my adult kids this year.I received a free coupon for a complimentary sample provided so that I could test and evaluate the product.  However, I was not asked nor do I offer to write reviews that do not reflect my opinion and I don't recommend products that I would not buy. This is not a barter deal.

"This is a very nice little tea bell that adds a twist and a bit of decoration to the typical stainless tea ball/bell.  It's silicone handle is securely fastened to the ball and has no risk of falling in like those with the chain.  Silicone does not react with food and doesn't not get hot no matter how hot the food or liquid that it comes into contact with.For myself, this is a great little unit to keep on my desk at work.  It has a little silicone drip pad to allow it to drain and it has little risk of rolling anywhere or getting papers or the desk wet.  I also happen to be a mug drinker for tea and so need something that holds a bit more than your average tea ball.  This fits that bill.I'll predict this one sells quite a few and especially for stocking stuffers for Christmas.

"This is a very flexible oven mitt.  I have one other one but this one does a far better job and it allows you to grab pans much easier than the one that I've had.This is a one-size fits all, but with my large hands and my wife's very small hands, it doesn't really make any difference.  It's all good!  The little grippers on both sides mean you can grab a hold of just about anything without any risk of getting burned.  It also means that you don't have to pay attention to how you're putting it on and which side you use.My grill grates were low level red hot tonight and even putting my hand on that grate for a few seconds caused no discomfort.  However, I will note that the fingertips of the glove are not as thick.  Normally this shouldn't be an issue, because this part doesn't come in direct contact, but it is a point worth noting.  It's the only place where the glove got warm on the inside.  But again, this was a red hot grate, which is far hotter than you'd normally use.There are a couple of other uses that you might also wish to consider that aren't normally thought of with an oven mitt:1)  The grip is so good that you can honestly use this to get a good grip on a jar lid to twist it off.  No slipping plams.2)  Use it on your table or counter to avoid heat caused surface damage when you have to put the screaming hot pan down.  It's not fancy like a trivet, but it gets the job done nicely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170SBZQ2A33UX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NG5IMK#wasThisHelpful","R170SBZQ2A33UX","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically and as far as I can tell at this point, these are high quality replacements that fully meet my expectations and more. Both of my current lights had been installed for a number of years and one had recently gone out so I was glad to get these. At first, I only replaced the one that had gone out and had decided to use the other as a backup. However, I immediately noticed that it did not match with the original bulb on the other side. the LLCJ was probably twice as bright and a bluer tint that is quite noticeable.  In the end, this is the bulb you put in if you want people to really notice that you are turning.So having replaced the other light now, I have two very bright brake lights that are LED and should therefore last a very long time. The materials they are made of are easily just as good quality and I will look forward to many years of use.

"This is a tough bag to be sure.  That's the first impression and the one that sticks with you no matter how long you work with it.To be fair it's not absolutely perfect for everyone.  Up front the cons if they are cons for you... though these don't apply to me.1) It's not extremely supple.  Think inner tube tough and texture.2) It's not extremely light as bags go.  It weighs 800 grams/28.2 ounces.  If you are looking to shed every gram, this might not be the right bag.That's it... now the pros:1) Did I mention it is tough?  Sure you can put a knife through it, but why would you?2) It has padded adjustable shoulder straps for carrying3) It will carry several days worth of clothing and dry gear.  This is the bag I'll be using next time on the Colorado River when we are out for a week.4) It holds substantial air... or not... at your choice.  After the bag is folded over and buckled, you can choose to release the screw on air relief valve and mash it like one of those space bags.  Or leave the air in to protect delicate things or to keep it (or you) floating if the raft capsizes.5) In addition to the buckle on shoulder straps, there are handles on each side.  If you're in the water, wrap your hands through these and secure it to your body.6) I also envision this thing working well in the inverse.  If it keeps water out, it would also keep water in.  And it's black.  Most of you know where I'm going with this, but for those that don't, imagine how great it is to wash up with 80 degree water instead of 45 degree water right out of the river.  That's right, this is a perfect camp solar water heater, and the fact that it holds about 7 gallons of water is going to make for a happier clean up.Overall, this bag is more than recommended.

"Most jack cable tend to be a bit flimsy and I fear damage when they are used in the car and can get pulled.  I have no such fear about this cable.  This is the most solid 3.5mm jack cable that I've seen, bar none.It's laminated braided cable is solid, and perhaps even almost too solid.  It's not something you can just wrap up and stick deep in your pocket.  But that's good because it's tough and it will be the cable that is left when all your other ones have been crimped, cut or the ends come loose.The 3.5mm ends are solid and well built, encased in ends that have a fair amount of finger grip.  These ends aren't coming loose, even if you foolishly yank on your cords.  You may damage your device, but not this cord.  The jacks also fit extremely well into several devices, snug enough to stay with no slop and yet not too tight either.  Just a perfect fit.My other concern was how well these super ends would work with a phone case.  My iPhone sports an Otterbox case, and this sometimes doesn't work with connectors that bump into the case.  The ends worked just perfect and while there was no gap between them and the case, it wasn't an effort to get it in there either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWFRCSRCFJZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYGJB9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWFRCSRCFJZ8","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice braided cable.  Granted, it's a bit stiff, but not so that it affects performance.  In fact that slight bit of stiffness due to quality construction may well help it to be more resistant to abrasion and other potential damage.  Fit to appliances was tight, ends are well build with much to grab onto, and there is zero risk that the cord will separate from those ends with even some rough handling.But of course what's important is how it performs when used.  I tested this running various units to a 55"" TV.  I was concerned because I've had similar cords in the past of such length that the signal tended to be a bit grainy and weak and needed a booster.

"I wasn't sure what to expect for quality with this GoPro camera handle.  The price is low enough that it could have been far less, but I was actually pleasantly surprised.The handle is light but solid.  And yes, it floats... I checked.  It also has a nice adjustable wrist lanyard on it that allows you to fit it to your hand, making that a truly valuable part of it.It's the standard GoPro connection and that screws onto a 1/4"" bolt on the handle.  I was concerned that it might not stay tight as such parts often tend to slip.  However, I discovered a bit of genius in the design that prevents this.  Both the connector and the handle interface plates have microgrooves the are reminiscent of the old vinyl records, only finer.  They are in fact ""friction plates"".  When these microgrooves come into contact with each other, it provides enough friction that you don't have to crank it to tighten it, yet it can break free when you want it too.

"This review is for the Comsun Universal Bicycle Bike Mount Holder.  I've had a couple of bike mounted cell phone holders before, but none were quite this nice, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the package.  I also didn't expect several of the features for the holder because they aren't included in the description.The only downside to this product is that they don't include any instructions other than what's on the box and that isn't really sufficient.  However, this is a small thing because it's overall pretty easy to figure out if you just stop and look at the unit.  Also for the record, while they specify certain phones that this will fit, this cradle will fit just about any cell phone out there because it's highly adjustable.The unit is comprised of two separate pieces that fit together, plus an allen wrench for installation.  The attachment piece comes apart and must be fit around the bike handlebar and then reassembled using the allen wrench.  This is basically a one time thing.  Also on that part is a tension screw to allow you to position the phone where you want and then tighten it in place.  There is also an elastic cord that acts as a backup safety device for the phone when it's put in place.The other major part is the cradle itself.  What they don't tell you is that there are two swing out feet that secure it on the bottom and that pressing a switch on the back allows the sides of the cradle sides to expand.  Open up the cradle, put your phone [including any phone case you have] in place, then compress the sides to where it grips the phone.  They are on a ratchet system so there is some clicking as it goes into place.  As a last step, just wrap the elastic cord over the top as a security measure.  Now, loosen the tension screw, adjust the phone to your desired angle and tighten it.If you want to just run into a store or take a phone call, you can simple lift the entire cradle off the mount, do what you want, and then just click it back in place.The only question I have is how long the mechanical portion of the cradle will last.  It seems pretty solid for now and I can't complain about the overall quality, so I won't speculate further.  Whatever I find out on that issue will eventually become a part of this review.  However, at this price, it's kind of hard to fault it if it doesn't last forever.I received a free coupon for a complimentary sample provided so that I could test and evaluate the product.

"This review is for the Protectif RFID blocking bi-fold leather wallet for men.  The stated technical purpose of this wallet is to thwart identity and credit card thieves from using RFID scanners to read vital personal information from new credit cards that contain the RFID chip.  Attached are pictures to reference my notes and review of this wallet.I received this wallet in a very nice presentation box.  There are no markings of country of manufacture anywhere on the box, and the only printing anywhere on the wallet is the stamped name, ""Protectif"" both on the outside and inside lower corner.  Overall impressions right from the start are that of a high quality leather wallet that will last many years.  Protectif technology against reading RFID chips is buried somewhere in the wallet, and not visible or destroying the outside visible appeal.  RFID blockers use something called Faraday technology that essentially foil the ability of electronic readers to affect or even see what's on the other side.  Getting this into a wallet will increase the cost of the wallet, but compared to what losing your credit card information can do, it's not much.Opening the box, one of the first things you notice is the great smell of leather.  Single stitching is found around the perimeter and well matched with the color of the wallet.  Stitching is further bolstered in corners where the greatest potential for wear and abuse occur.  Inside the wallet, there is room for up to 8 credit cards, though I suspect that with some effort, at least a few of the slots could manage to hold more than one.On the left side is a fold over flap with a window pocket in it designed for driver's license or ID.  Fold it out to present it to a clerk, then back in and again and close the wallet when you're done.The inside of the back of the wallet where the bills go is lined with a vinyl fabric and it has a bill separator to allow you to keep large denominations separate from smaller ones or as I do it, to keep receipts that I need separate from bills.I typically look for cons for every product or at least things that I think some people may not care for.  I can't find anything that even picky people wouldn't care for.  Overall, I would highly recommend the product and as a man, suggest that it's one of those gifts that you're pretty safe on for most of us.  Even if we have one that's relatively new, it is still something that we know we will eventually need.

"These are great medium size jars.  It's hard to get a perspective on size, so I included a picture of one in my fairly large hand.  While the bottom fits in my hand quite easily and securely and with adequate grip to support a full jar, it would be a bit more than an average size female hand could handle.The glass jar is exactly as seen in the Nakpunar photo and are reminiscent of old style ceramic bean pots.  To avoid confusion, the little side lips on the side of the jar are there for gripping and do not have holes.  That would be a bit of an optical illusion in the photo.  The lip handles do however, help when gripping the jar on the side, particularly if you had wet or otherwise slippery hands.The glass is pretty heavy duty, and about the thickness of a mason jar, though I don't believe these were designed to afford the same level of duty.  I'll suggest they would be more than adequate to be used with hot syrups and jellies, but I don't think I'd water-bath them and I definitely wouldn't put them in a pressure cooker.  The lids aren't really designed for that anyway, as these are commonly known as gold lugs.  Gold lug lids are typically what you find on pickle jars.The glass has got a bit of a blown glass look to it, giving it a bit of look of antique glass, kind of like you see in windows in old buildings.  This makes it look a bit more special than the standard utility jars that you'd buy food in.  This is definitely something that doubles as both a utility and a presentation piece.  There are two seams in the glass, but you don't see them unless you look hard.  For those who might put a label on this jar, there is enough of a flat surface going up the side, between the two lips that it could hold a 1.5"" label and have it lay flat.These gold lug caps have a non-removable plastisol liner that is perfectly designed for sealing off the jar from contaminants including air.  When cinched in place, the liner seals the jar perfectly.  To remove the lid, a simple turn of about a half inch is all that is necessary.  While  these lids will hold a vacuum, this particular lid doesn't have a vacuum button on top, and that probably wouldn't be appropriate for the average use of this jar.Ideal uses for this jar would be for those making candles, sauces, packing large volumes of dried herbs, potpourri for gifts, candies, trail mix, or anything you want to give to someone and have just a little bit extra flair.  I'll be putting some homemade toffee in these as Christmas gifts this year.These jars were received as part of a promotion to help me evaluate them and write a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVE31NE1ENLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EF616O#wasThisHelpful","RQVE31NE1ENLI","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the 10pcs 23"" Premium Polyster Neck Lanyard and it was provided to me free of charge for my review.I have quite a few lanyards from various  events over the years, but these are some of the better ones.  There are a total of 10 in the pack in a variety of colors.  The lanyards arrived in a zip open pack, neatly folded, and along with a nice and separately packaged cleaning cloth that will be going into my camera case.There are several reasons why these are better.1) there is a very strong quick release buckle like one that you would find on a backpack.  With a quick pinch, you remove anything that is on the end of that lanyard for temporary purposes without having to take the thing off your neck.  This is pretty smart thinking by someone who has been in one of those situations where someone needs your badge for a second, but you're wearing winter jackets or carrying a bunch of stuff and it is a bother to put it all down.  When the need has been fulfilled, it's just a quick snap to hang it back on the lanyard again.2) There are two attachment mechanisms on the end.  The first one is a J hook on a swivel that has a very strong spring for security and a large access lever for people with big thumbs like me.  The J hook would be ideal for hanging a camera, phone or whatever.  The second is a strong loop cord attached with a second quick release buckle, and this one is probably more ideal for a name badge.  Unhook the quick release, string the cord through the badge hole, and bring the buckle end back through the string to attach it, and then push the buckle back onto the lanyard.One review concerned me about the strength of the loop cord.  Even though this is probably never going to hold much weight, I tested it for strength.  I attached a 20# weight and bounced it a few times with no problems.  That's good enough in my book.  Note that the picture attached not only tests the strength of the looped cord, it also tests the two quick release buckles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SG90L2MY4SI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012NBA3P0#wasThisHelpful","R3SG90L2MY4SI0","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I acquired a couple of these things about 2 months ago and have used them through some of the hottest parts of the summer, and I am quite impressed.I was worried about the potential for the straps to break on these, but the straps support the entire bag, and are not just sewn to the top.  Where they join the bag from the handle, they are sewn to the bag with a crossed stitch for strength, but then the stitching continues down both sides of each strap, so that the bag it self rests in and is sewn to the straps that are basically forming a sling for extra support.The inside of the bag is silver lined, plastic impregnated woven cloth that wipes out wonderfully if there's ever a spill.  Also provided is a transparent and removable plastic insert that lays down on the bottom and provides some extra support.  It wouldn't absolutely be needed but, its there just in case.The zipper on the bag isn't extremely strong, but it probably doesn't need to be.  If the bag isn't overstuffed to the point where it pulls hard on it, I think it will last as long as the bag, which should have many years of service.So far I've had about 25# in this bag and it carried easily.  And keeping foods cold and frozen has been easy.  Normally the ice cream is soft by the time I get it home.  However, I had two containers in one of these bags with no secondary source of refrigeration, and in the middle of summer temperatures, there was no appreciable amount of melting in those containers after an entire hour.I also take a fair number of hot meals to people who are sick and some are 30-40 minutes away in heavy traffic.  In most cases, when I pull the container out, it is still too hot to just hold onto and within food safety zones of 140+ degrees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4QELLUKP8NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFOQ2SG#wasThisHelpful","R2B4QELLUKP8NJ","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this assortment of glow sticks in exchange for an honest review.  However, just because something is free doesn't mean I won't be critical of problems.  This wasn't a concern with this product because this is a wonderful addition and they will go well at any celebration where there are kids or even older kids like me.  I love these things.There are a total of 100 of them.  The colors I received were hot pink, yellow, green, and orange.  Just snap them, shake them, and watch them light up instantly.  They are only about 8 inches long which I initially thought was a little short because you see others that are a couple feet long.  However, I realized that this is a perfect size for kids of all ages because with the connectors, they can turn these into chains, necklaces, etc.  And they are small enough to fit around even the smallest kid's wrist as a bracelet.  The one caveat is to watch the connectors around little kids as they could be a choking hazard.  It even mentions this right on the box.About 10 minutes in, most of them had lost some of the initial glow.  This is not uncommon with these.  As you can see in the third picture, the ones on the inside were snapped about 10 minutes prior to the ones on the outside.  However, then the brightness stabilized and they are still quite bright well over an hour later, as shown in the last picture.  Now two hours later, these things are still bright.  Kudos to the folks who put this package together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIF4KT1H0X6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQJ2DBG#wasThisHelpful","R2DIF4KT1H0X6Q","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for Norwegian Fish Oil Premium Omega 3 Complex.  I received a sample bottle in exchange for my honest opinion.  However, just because it's free doesn't mean I'll hold back if there's anything about it that I don't like.I currently take Omega 3s  for cardiovascular reasons and to control cholesterol and triglycerides.  In doing so, I have dropped my cholesterol from 259 to 119 and triglycerides from 389 to 146.  While I've been successful in doing so, I simply won't take anything that is less than a pure product or that I might have trouble digesting.So far this product has passed all my tests.  I've included pictures so that you can see the size of the capsule because Omega 3 capsules can sometimes be a little large and hard to swallow.  These however, were on the small side of medium, very flexible, and easy to swallow.  I have put a sample capsule right next to a pen cap and an M&M for comparative purposes.The capsule itself is a one piece unit so it won't break or leak.  On hitting the tongue, it has a very slight sweetness to it, but not sugary.  I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't purposely tasting it.  It's just enough to get a slight bit of saliva going to make it easy to swallow.I also held it in my mouth to determine if there was any fish oil flavor at all, and there is none whatsoever.  Also, despite taking it on an empty stomach, there's been no gastric reaction such as burping or any flavors coming back up.  Overall, it's quite a success and I suggest this will probably be a strong seller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQO05L2W073O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJDJGIM#wasThisHelpful","R2OQO05L2W073O","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this set of marbles as a test in exchange for an honest assessment of the product.The marbles come in a net bag along with a shooter marble that is about 3-4 times the size of a normal marble and a velvet bag with a drawstring to store them in.  The marbles are a good solid weight, made of solid glass, and there aren't very many bubbles in them, so they are fairly solid.  That said, they are glass so they will break.  One was broken upon arrival but it didn't shatter or anything dangerous - it was just broken in half.  That actually is a good sign to me because glass that shatters would be a problem to have around kids.All the marbles roll quite well including the shooter.  Though there is a slight surface defect in that shooter, it doesn't affect performance and it will probably still outlast me.  This is going to be a treat to teach my grandkids how to play an old school game that doesn't require a power source.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HX5IRE7CDYSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNS4L9C#wasThisHelpful","R3HX5IRE7CDYSX","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use Healthworks Cacao about 5 times per week as an addition to green smoothies.  The flavor is consistently good from package to package, and the quality of the product can't be beat.  It's a much deeper richer flavor than many other brands out there and there's none of that woodyness that you'll find in a few.The grind is consistent and very fine in order to yield the perfect flavor.  The product doesn't seem to absorb moisture and clump like some products, but I find no trace of nor is any flow agent specified.  Regardless, I keep all packages closed until I'm ready to use that package, and then dump the contents into a air sealed jar to avoid contamination and contact with oxygen in order to retain the flavor and nutrient value of the product.Overall, this product is highly recommended and I will continue to purchase for myself and my family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LYHL3OHC9W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVWJR70#wasThisHelpful","R10LYHL3OHC9W8","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd been trying to find wheat to grow in small trays for the purpose of the grass to be used in smoothies and had little luck.  However, when purchasing some Palhouse Brand garbanzo beans, I noticed this product as well.  This has an excellent sprout ratio and my first sprouts were visible in about 10 days in my inside tray.  The first harvest was ready about 7 days later and I've found that it's got about a 5 day regeneration period.  In other words, I make my cuttings and 5 days later I can make a second cutting.  The third cutting came about 8 days later, and the final was just pulled up from the roots and ground whole.For planting purposes I acquired Soil Moist pellets that absorb water and release it as necessary and just mixed the wheat seed with it after soaking it overnight.  Doing it that way allowed me to have the seed constantly have moisture available and in contact without dealing with washing soil off the roots at the end.  The Soil Most was then rehydrated and used with the next batch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QP56YIW5VNCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PEZLCM#wasThisHelpful","R2QP56YIW5VNCU","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a saw that just cut wood and that I could drag from place to place without being concerned that it would break down when I needed it, yet still not spend a lot of money on it.  I didn't need LED lights, digital readouts, or a lot of settings that I'd never use.Presenting the B&D JS515, an uncomplicated model that sells for under $25.  One gets the B&D brand value and you don't have to dig deep.  So far I've had this saw for over a year now and probably used it 100+ times without a hitch.

"We have a medium coat shedder of the Jack Russell line, and he produces a lot of hair.  Typically we use a horse rack on him to remove the hair and it does a fine job, but doesn't get the last 10% or so.  Within hours, he will be shedding again, but just in smaller volumes, and we decided for the sake of those who watch him whenever we travel that we needed to make some adjustments.The MIU COLORÂ® Pet Deshedding Tool is a great thing, but like anything else has its limitations and needs to be used properly.  For us, it clogs up quickly and pulling the hair out of the teeth takes a second hand and some time.  This adds up.  What we found is that we should continue to use the rake to get rid of that 90% and then use the MIU COLORÂ® Pet Deshedding Tool to clean up the balance.Doing it this way gives us an very well groomed furry friend with a lot less hair to dump all over the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V7EJLGVNYD0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM1DDBW#wasThisHelpful","R2V7EJLGVNYD0F","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frontier does it again!  Stevia powder comes in a mylar bag, perfectly dried, ground, and sifted.  If there are stems in there, they are so finely ground up that they can't be detected.  Stevia doesn't attract moisture like some other products, but it's still better to keep it in the mylar bag until you are ready to use the product.  Then pour the contents into a glass canning jar with a lid to keep the oxygen out and the freshness in.This isn't stevia extract - the white stuff.  That stuff is an amazing product, but the process of pulling the sweetness out of the natural product like this is.  The white stuff involves dissolving the natural product in resin, and that's where they completely lost me.  I'll stick with the nice green product which is nothing more than stevia leaves that have been dried.Use about a half tsp of stevia per gallon pitcher of your product and work from there.  Don't drink it immediately as it takes about an hour for the liquid to fully pull the sweetness into the drink.  Once that happens, the remaining part of the plant will sink to the bottom and join the dregs of the rest of your product.  If you try to drink it right away, the sweetness won't be there, but there will be a bit of flavor that reminds you of dry wheat grass - not particularly pleasant.  After an hour, there won't be that flavor any more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGXQRPTYUMBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SJTKUG#wasThisHelpful","R2BGXQRPTYUMBV","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently been cooking some gluten free items for a couple of members of our family who recently discovered may have problems with gluten.  I found some great gluten free flour at Sams Club, but you need gluten or a replacement for it when making bread.  I won't say this is a perfect replacement for gluten, and it is more expensive, but it does get the job done and it makes a very acceptable product at a lower cost than some of the other alternatives that are out there.It wasn't until after I got this however, that I discovered what a great thickening agent it is.  I used to be strictly a flour and cornstarch cook, but have switched over to arrowroot and now have xanthan gum as an alternative.  While it does an amazing job in thickening things like gravies, it's not a perfect replacement for flour there either.  But it's a different product so I don't expect it to be exactly the same either and it makes it no more deficient than stevia is deficient compared to sugar.

"For the money, you can't ask for a better little lock box.  We got this one for our daughter who lives in an apartment with roommates.  Despite the fact that you try to avoid having roommates of ill character, one never knows if someone will be tempted when seeing a bit of cash or other valuable items just laying around.  The idea behind this isn't that they couldn't break in if they wanted to, but to create a substantial barrier and avoid offering that temptation.  Because it isn't burglarproof, we advised her to keep her cash and valuables in it and store it under a blanket in the closet, out of sight.  It would also be quite useful for anyone who had a small side business where having a little cash around to make change is needed.  It will fit in most drawers and again would simply be a barrier to sticky fingers that would otherwise try to lift a few bills without being noticed.The lock on this isn't like the one you had on your diary when you were a kid.  It's a real lock and just pushing and prodding on the box itself isn't going to open it.  It really is a lockbox and it does require a key if you aren't going to force it open with a prybar.And of course for this kind of money, you certainly shouldn't expect that this is either water or fire proof. Both would damage the contents, and it says so right on the package.Buy this for the right reason, to basically be a lockable storage area that is a barrier to other people putting their hands on your property.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VAO8GIMZ8KEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GOZZJG#wasThisHelpful","R1VAO8GIMZ8KEU","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used blood meal before, so I know what it can do for crops.  But the animal repellent aspect was new to me and quite a nice bonus.This is largely what I use as an organic fertilizer component for my green crops such as spinach, swiss chard, kale, and my herbs.  It's fantastic but you have to watch how much you put on.  I haven't ever had any burn issues, but you can over fertilize and have things grow faster than they should.  Just top dress the crop before a rain and let nature take it's path.The upside of course is that the deer and raccoons that have been pestering my garden are now warded off.  I could live trap the coons and try to fence out the deer, but not always with great success, and certainly with quite a bit of time and energy.  So far this year and to the best of my knowledge, I haven't lost any crops to the woodsy friends.  The coons stayed away from the root crops and the deer left the spinach alone.

"I used to be in the business and have installed hundreds of these on pumps where the motor has failed and the cost of repair was not justified by age.  When installed properly, they are a solid motor and will last on average 6-7 years of constant summer use before anything needs to be done.  And when it does need something it is usually to replace the capacitor on the back end, something that a teenager could do with a screwdriver and a pair of needle nose pliers.  The capacitor is basically the starter battery and they wear out.Also be sure to keep the area under the motor clear of leaves, debris, and dirt.  These are motor killers because they end up going up through the vents and onto the windings [copper wire coils] and the motor can't vent properly.  Even getting 10-15 degrees over normal operating temp will wear out a motor faster.When installing these, it's not tricky but you need to know two things about doing so if you want the motor to work properly and last:1)  Install a replacement shaft seal and do the whole thing, not just half of it.  They are cheap and there's no reason not to.  It will take you two minutes.  Old seals fail and when that happens, the motor will be subject to spray coming from the pump end of it.2)  When tightening the mount bolts, don't crank down one and then move onto the next and crank that one down.  Tighten all 4 fairly evenly, moving around the motor to tighten each one another couple of turns and keep going until they are all tight - - but only hand tight.  There's no reason to strip them out.  If you don't tighten the bolts evenly, the motor will sit in at a very slight angle, and this causes tremendous wear on the motor.  If you install them evenly, you will have years of service from the motor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJJVG85ROG0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TSAZOC#wasThisHelpful","RMJJVG85ROG0G","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When receiving this pan, there are a couple of steps that aren't immediately made known, and these are very important to follow before making your first paella. Of course everyone will remove the sticker and most will wash the pan. BUT.... be sure to wash this pan with extremely hot water and lots of soap, making sure to flood the pan and wash it with a stiff cloth or a 3M cleaning pad, inside and out. There is a factory film on there that is easily removed and should be, but it takes more than a quick rinse out. I think it's part of the production process or something to help protect the pan till it gets to you. It's not going to make you sick, but just doesn't need to be in your food.Of course be sure to dry the pan immediately, preferably with a little heat to remove all traces of moisture before the next step. After the pan is dry, use a paper towel and rub a very light coat of shortening on the pan while it is still warm. I use Crisco. Then with a dry towel, wipe every bit of shortening residue off it. A slight film will remain. Do this inside and out to make sure it is well seasoned and protected from elements, and be sure to do this every time you use the pan for the next 5-10 times you use it. By then it will have started to build seasoning on it and you won't have to do it as often. However, I still put a little on my pan from time to time, and particularly if you know you aren't going to use it for awhile.This pan is pretty heavy duty and will hold up for my lifetime and more so long as you aren't throwing it around or bang it up too badly. Treat it with respect and it will serve you well for a long time. There are dimples in the bottom of this pan, and this is pretty typical of most top quality paella pans. I have never researched it in depth, but I have heard from several sources that it helps create the socarrat. â€œSocarratâ€ is that delectable, scrumptious crust that forms at the bottom of the paella pan when the fat is rendered, the liquid absorbed, and the rice has reached its peak.This pan is highly recommended for beginners and paella experts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22G65ZQED51T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VH6UT6#wasThisHelpful","R22G65ZQED51T3","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the #3 size for my 6 yr old grandson who has been playing with but overwhelmed by the size of his dad's soccer ball.  Size three is perfect for little feet to allow them to learn the fundamentals of ball control and moving downfield.  Unlike with the large ball, little feet can also find the thrill of a little air time with this size.The colors are great and the kids love it.  Despite having several other soccer balls on the field, day after day, the Adidas ball is the favorite.  There are several other complaints of wear, but a month after starting to use it daily, this ball still looks like it is fresh out of the package.  The stitching on it is fine, the material seems pretty heavy duty, and overall, I don't think they could have made a better ball.The one thing I would suggest to the manufacturer is that they don't fully inflate the ball prior to shipment.  We had to let a little air out to bring it down to ideal pressure, and that potentially could affect the bladder and longevity of the ball in higher altitudes or if it has been shipped by air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWC99N8ELQIJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SV4ZOWG#wasThisHelpful","RWC99N8ELQIJT","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this product out for several trips now and am quite happy with my decision to purchase.  The bladder holds a full 70 oz and there are several other pockets to make this far more than just an insulated water bladder with a shoulder strap.  The design was well thought out with keeping the bladder off your hot skin but also protected from the elements, to help keep it as cool and refreshing as possible.Comfort padding, straps and buckles are well placed and designed to breathe, yet stay cinched and working in sync with your own movements without binding.  Any pack that doesn't do this moves on it's own and can shift weight at the wrong moment, stop you from moving as necessary, or just slip and slide around and add wear and tear to your day.Pockets and access points are well thought out and designed to allow you and others access to every portion of the pack quickly and without having to disassemble anything, as well as to allow you options in how you pack and what you carry.  Though this is not an expensive unit by any stretch, I've seen far more costly units that haven't been as well thought out.That said, be aware that you are buying a water bladder and it needs to be conditioned before you use it.  Don't plan to pull this out of the closet the in the morning and just heading out.  Putting it bluntly, water going in will taste absolutely horrible the first few times you use it, kind of like you are chewing on a tire.  And it isn't as simple as rinsing it out either.  This is vinyl and it will give off flavors for awhile.I pulled it out a week ahead of time and am glad I did.  Just take the bladder out to make it easier to condition, and don't forget about the hose either.  The whole thing needs some advance planning.  What I did was to first rinse it out a few times just to get anything out that might easily just rinse.  Then I filled it with about 100 degree water and let it sit for an hour, dumped it and did that again several times.  Already it was getting much better.  The next steps were to let it sit full of water overnight a couple of times, dump it and fill it again before going to work.  That way it would have a chance to leach out any flavors out of the vinyl into the water.  My final step was to add a couple of tablespoons of baking soda to water and fill it up.  Baking soda helps to remove odors and flavors elsewhere, so it makes sense that it might help here as well.The results were that the first trip out there was a slight flavor and odor, but nothing that would be noticed if you weren't looking for it.  By the time I hit the Appalachian Trail, I couldn't come up with any trace odors or flavors.  Problems solved, and nothing more than what I've experienced with other water bladders by other names.Also make sure that you are drying this thing completely out before putting it away.  Dampness can lend itself to formation of mildews and you just don't need these in your bag.  I solved this issue by pushing a few paper towels into it and massaging them around to absorb those  few remaining drops, then leaving a dry paper towel bunched inside to keep the bag separated while I laid it in the sun and let it vent any moisture out.  This isn't a big issue if you're going to be using it again in a couple of days, particularly if you fill it with chlorinated tap water.  But if you're only using it on weekends or longer, it's better to be safe than sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R681CIRQ4Y2Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JYHG3U#wasThisHelpful","R681CIRQ4Y2Z4","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is now on my subscribe and save list.  It is so delicious!  However, I'm not particularly wild about the bags it comes it and so I immediately dump it into an air tight canning jar to keep it fresh longer.Keep in mind that wild rice takes a longer time to cook than most white rice and even longer than some brown rice.  However, it can also be a hard thing to eat straight.  If you are just trying wild rice, it is recommended that you use it in combination with other rices, cooked separately, and then added to your final rice dish.  But you will LOVE the nutty flavor and texture it imparts to other dishes.  It also makes an interesting addition to a mushroom risotto.I've also found that cooking this in chicken broth is a phenomenal treat that is worth trying.  It softens the rice slightly and brings in another flavor that complements the rice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUN6LVEBMWCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044B6ZBY#wasThisHelpful","RKUN6LVEBMWCJ","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe this is essentially an extremely fine ground maple sugar.  But it really delivers and gives an intense maple flavor without the graininess of sugar crystals.  I tend to look at this as a ""finish"" rather than an ingredient, because it's best value is found in adding flavor and aroma to the outside when it would be lost by mixing into whatever you are cooking.So far I've used this on smoked porks such as shoulders, ham, ribs, and bacon.  But I've also used in several baked goods, the most interesting of which was a ""bacon cake"".The one caveat on this is to keep it dry, as like with most powders, it will absorb moisture, and then of course you've lost the purpose in having a syrup ""powder"".  All is not lost however, as several others have noted, it can be reconstituted into maple syrup, and actually serves as a great item to take on camping trips for just that purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF3OE2C6A68C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UYFKRY#wasThisHelpful","RF3OE2C6A68C6","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The people at Marvel Comics should probably look into the licenses they grant and the quality of the merchandise it is applied to.

"The cherry flavor on this is pretty intense and it has become one of my favorite things in the spice cupboard for use on pork.  I've tried a bit on some veggies as well but haven't been able to make that same connection, but it certainly isn't going to take away anything from the really good experience.The other way I've found that this really works well is as an application to buttered Texas toast right before it goes into the broiler.  Oh, that is amazing!  Fats like pork and butter just seem to melt into this rub and take it from 5 stars to the moon.

"The first thing you need to realize is that there are two options on this mouse pad.  You must choose between the foam backing and the self adhesive strip.  If you don't, it will default to the self-adhesive version.These are thin and I'm not a fan of the texture.  It takes some getting used to.  The self adhesive does adequately stick to the surface, but my concern is how well it comes off when that time comes.  I'm hoping it doesn't turn into a gluey mess, but since I'm not ready to make that happen yet just for the sake of a review, we shall let that idea remain a mystery for the time being.  The one thing that is nice about this particular pad is that it is thin enough that if you put it on a slide out desk shelf like mine, it won't hinder the ability to slide it back in.  It is about as thin as a cheap paper plate, and hardly worth being called a ""pad"", and the texture is about like that of a shower curtain.I have had the thing applied to my desk now for about a year now and there is no visible wear to it.  However, in running my hand over it, the texture found at the edges is no longer to be found in the middle where the mouse is most used.  So despite appearances to the contrary, it does have a lifespan of maybe a couple of years tops.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNAWB75K6X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2AN9PK#wasThisHelpful","R1DNAWB75K6X3","A44SF144F9ALL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A44SF144F9ALL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this mold for making chocolate bombes.  I picked up one for my grandson's birthday party and the first go around was slow and tedious, but that was a matter of developing a technique.  From there on, it has gone fantastic. The key here is to learn to use a pastry brush and not really care that much about perfection.  The mold will take care of the outside, and that's the only part that anyone else will see.  If you're having a hard time getting full coverage or you have holes, just pop the mold into the fridge for a few minutes and let it harden up, and then paint over the hole.Leave enough of a lip so that when you extract the units and fuse them together, there's enough of an edge to do this with.  My first mistake was accepting a feather edge when in fact this is the part you need the most coverage.When you are ready to put the parts together, use the bottom of a slightly warmed pan to melt one edge and make it even.  Insert your ingredients in this half, then melt the edge of the second one and fuse them together.  Don't spend any time trying to clean up the edge.  It doesn't work and doesn't matter.

"I've now got two sous vide cookers including this one and a Polyscience Pro version, and have been using both for well over a year now.If you're reading this far, you already know the process and about the excellent end product.  What I'm here to tell you is that the product will last and has a good service record.  Having used the Anova now for well over a year and usually 2-3 times per week, often for 24-48 hours at a time, I don't have a single complaint.  It hasn't done so much as a hiccup or failed in any way.  And aside from some digital things and a slightly lower water volume limit, I haven't found much difference in service between this and the Polyscience at about 5 times the price.Now I do know that Anova has come out with a couple of new models between this version, but I don't see many advantages, and certainly nothing to spend an extra $100 to have.

"I've been eating maca now for about 3 years and have tried a variety of packagers and products during that time.  Overall, I go through about one package per month, consumed almost entirely in Vitamix smoothies and as an additive to Greek yogurt.As with all the products from Maca Team, I've found this product to be top shelf stuff and worth continued buying.  It is always fresh, very well packaged, well ground, and it is well flavored.  I've well tolerated every produce I've received from them and that includes this one, their Yellow Maca.As for how it has affected my health, since adding it to the diet my overall energy level has improved dramatically.  There have been a few times that I've gone extended periods of time without and I noticed far more lethargy no matter what I did.  Getting back on maca provided a better sense of well-being and health and a stronger and more lively libido.I won't lie and say that I don't wish it was cheaper, but you're going to pay for what works, and it is more than a fair price for the product and compared to what else is out there.

"If politics,intrigue,and skullduggery is your fort,this novel will meet your expectations from the first page to the end. International politics,particularly when the CIA and Unions get involved is sure to provide lots of secrecy,people getting disposed of,anytime they foul up the government plans,because they are always less important than the mission.Don't look for characters that you would like to befriend,because this business does not attract that type.When any group sets out to overthrow a government,you need to enlist evil minded,egotistical,dishonest,people . This novel can be looked at as fiction or non-fiction but with the names changed;changed,that is to protect ,not the innocent ,but the guilty. As you read this novel,you may want to compare it to the Mafia and the Underworld;and wonder why anyone would get involved in it if they didn't expect to be killed,double-crossed or hung out to dry,when their usefulness becomes a liability. It is a well constructed story with several well developed,though not particularly likeable ,characters.There is some violent action,but that is somewhat minimal,as most of the novel deals wiht clandestine manoeuvering behind the scenes. There are a lot of organizations mentioned throughout and often referred to by their initials such as CIA,AFlL,ClU,CIT,CTAL,OWS,COO,UCV,UCAB ,CUT,NED,etc. so you might wish to keep a legend of them to keep them straight.Also,there are many individuals coming and going ;and since there is no list of characters included,you may also want to make your own.

"We all tend to think of the team of Simon and Garfunkel and what is probably their best known and loved song ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" I had moved my family to New Jersey in January of 1970 and that song never stopped playing on the radio that year.Yes,those born in the 80's and later can't remember that was where most got their music.It was just  the era when pop music and ballads were what music was all about..Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel broke up at the height of their success in 1970.Rock 'n Roll was also big and Rock was just starting to take over,especially for the young.Today the music of artists such as Simon and Garfunkel simply isn't being published any more,nor has it been for several decades. This is a wonderful collection of Paul Simon's music from his earlier days Although he became an accomplished Singer, he was also an accomplished Songwriter( ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"");though all the songs on this album were written by others.Paul Simons was born in Newark N,J. on October 13,1941.He started his career in 1957 at the age of 16 and continues active to today at the age  of 74.He performed songs of Folk,Rock and Pop,and sang ,wrote songs and played Guitar;both alone and with his friend Art Garfinkle. The tracks are listed here,on the album and by other reviewers. This Stereo ,Vinyl,LP was released by Kapp Records (KS 3550) in 1977.Paul was 36 at the time.The sound quality is excellent and the tracks are also excellent and songs that you will only be able to hear from recordings. The album cover is more than excellent.It is a fold- out ablum with a pensive portrait of the youthful Paul on the front cover and a relaxed shot ,more like a snapshot,wearing jeans ,a vest and open shirt collar ,on the back. However; what is really special is that when you open the album cover;you are presented with the complete lyrics to all the tracks.As the tracks were not all recorded at the time of the album's release;the recorded dates and musicians involved are all there.

"There are two kinds of ""standards"" in popular music.There are the great evergreen songs that began to pour out of Tin Pan Alley,Broadway and Hollywood beginning roughly in the  20's and continued through the 30',40's and the 50's.At that point,new exciting teen-age rythms seemed to take over,and the flow of enduring ballads slowed to a trickle.Then,in the 60's,with rock 'n' roll,the twist , assorted rhythm,blues and dance style continued to hit at the same pace,there began to appear on best-seller charts a number of sentimental ballads that had all the earmarks of standards...songs which would survive beyond the all-too- few months of bestsellerdom.Then along acme Rock ,Reggie ,etc,but if you still love the ballads of past decades;this is an excellent album.You may not recall any of the singers ,as this is one of those albums where the songs are sung by other that the artists who had big hits with them.

"I am writing this Review after watching this classic Western on Video released by Warner Brothers in 1967.As far as I know it is a complete reissue of the original B & W movie released in1939 which won 2 Academy Awards,and lasts the same time of 97 minutes.I also can't say if other versions such as DVD or BlueRay are different in quality or otherwise.As I watched the Video,I was quite impressed with the quality and the fact that it had been released in 1939,that's now 76 years ago.Who would have believed that in future years,that one would buy copies of these movies and be able to watch them at will in one's own home.I was also highly impressed with the fantastic scenery shots that had to be done in B & W as color was only in the future at that time.I must admit though,that the sound left much to be desired,particularly when compared to what was to come in later years.However,I still found watching this version to be very enjoyable ,and I really felt like I was experiencing what viewing the movie would have been like in 1939The storyline and the acting is superb,especially considering when it was made.It is no surprise it won 2 Acadwmy Awards and set a whole new standard ,thus becoming a classic.

Timing the time you or your opponent needs to complete a puzzle adds excitement to the game.Also there are literally thousands of figures that can be constructed;even more when using both sets of tangrams.iThe game has been packaged in an ingenious way that makes it very convenient to carry around with you ,even when travelling.It is also a game that can be played by all ages,and even if you solve all the puzzles;all you have to do is to put it away for a while and when you get it out again,the puzzles will be just as challenging as they were when you first tried them. I have many sets of tangrams and books of Tangram puzzles.If ,after playing with this set awhile,and you want to pursue this fascinating game further;I suggest you read the review I wrote on ""The Tangram Book"" by Jerry Slocum.Jerry Slocum is one of America's most popular puzzle collectors and writers about puzzles.My review was written on Amazon on January 6,2004.This is a beautiful book with hundreds of illustrations,and gives the whole history of the Tangram Puzzle as well as an unbelievable array of hundreds of puzzles to do as well as an amazing Bibliography and Reference section.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQO5JCCW9KRW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TEXZY4#wasThisHelpful","RQO5JCCW9KRW5","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent album of both the 12 String Guitar and Folk songs from the 60's. It was released by World-Pacific  as a Stereo Vinyl LP (ST-1814) and the sound quality is superb.Although the tracks are listed on the front of the album cover,the songwriters are not.The notes on the back of the album cover are exceptionally good and informative.I can do no better than quote what is said about each track:  DON'T THINK TWICE,IT'S ALL RIGHT..  One of the finest instrumental versions of this contemporary ballad by America's young folk poet,Bob Dylan.The guirarist utilizes the flat pick  technique.  EAST VIRGINIA  This traditional folk ballad provides a unique vehicle for the manner in which the TWELVE STRING GUITAR and FIVE STRING BANJO  complement each other  THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND  This Woody Guthrie composition is fast becoming the folk singer's anthem.A  melody with easy lilt and a memorable line,is given a modern and  heretofore unheard syncopation..  IN THE PINES  A sad,wistful melody in the Southern tradition.The TWELVE STRING GUITAR provides a voicing that is  reminiscent of the pathos that  mountain singers have given this song for many years.  HARD TRAVELIN'  This Woody Guthrie classic has been given every known treatment in recent years. This rendition provides a happy marriage between the  TWELVE STRING GUITAR and THE FIVE STRING BANJO.  GET TOGETHER (AMOR A TODOS)  Almost a Latin beat.A delightful new melody line that displays the amazing range of  the TWELVE STRING GUITAR.A little quiet ""funk""  provides a quiet pleasure.  FREIGHT TRAIN  A ""blues"" instrumental,akin to ""Railroad Bill"".Another of the many songs that have crossed back and forth across the ""color line"" of the  south.the charm of its original ""blues"" tempo is retained.  GREENBACK DOLLAR  This is one of the many contemporary folk ballads that fall into the ""hit"" category. The TWELVE STRING INTERPRETATION has the same  power that composer-singer Hoyt Axton gave the original rendition.  WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE  A truly lovely contemporary folk melody composed by Pete Seeger. The lyrics were inspired by ""And Quiet Flows the Dawn"" by the  Russian writer,Mikhail Sholokov. The song is fast becoming a world wide favorite in the plea for peace.  LEMON TREE  This Will Holt composition is, like others in this collection,among the best of the contemporary folk songs.Almost child-like in its simplicity but  the simplicity coupled with its lasting beauty has already placed the song in the realm of ""Standard"" folksongs.  GOTTA TRAVEL ON  TWELVE STRING  and FIVE STRING play a delightful musical ""tag"" with this familiar Paul Clayton folk standard.  SEE SEE RIDER  An old Negro blues that receives the original treatment here.Recent interpretations by such outstanding artists such as Judy Henske and  Ian and Sylvia have departed somewhat from the old blues  manner of presentation.This TWELVE STRING voicing of the traditional blues  retains much of the original charm.  MICHAEL,ROW THE BOAT ASHORE  This lovely melody has been sung for generations by  the inhabitants of the Georgia Sea Island .The TWELVE STRING  arrangement  retains the Sea  Islanders delightful simplicity.  TWELVE STRING SPECIAL  You will recognize a traditional hoe-down melody line.The skilled performers utilize this familiar piece as a superb showcase for their  instruments and their talents.  Also,there is lots  more informative information on the album cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXTHKHYGJTJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F6QE9O#wasThisHelpful","R3VXTHKHYGJTJY","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this episode,Longarm gets sent to Salt Springs,New Mexico, posing as a Land Speculator to investigate a fellow lawman who may just be crooked.Salt Springs is such a small town there is not even a jail,but that is only the half of it.There is no hotel for Long to stay at,so his only choice is the high class whorehouse called the KW ,owned and operated by Kay Wallace.The KW is well appointed with a total of 42 employees,.Half are beautiful sporting ladies, and the rest are support staff of cooks ,laundresses,and such.Custis is not usually one to pay for his female company,but since he has no choice ,and is on expenses;he makes the best of things. The story is well constructed and there are lots of interesting characters.There is some gun action,but all are short-lived and there is really no competition for someone with the skills of Longarm.In the end several are headed for jail  in Las Cruces .,and Longarm is on his way to Santa Fe by stagecoach...but hold on, a young woman joins in as a traveller with Longarm,,which appears to make the trip very pleasant indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBTA93A6XPQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515153796#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBTA93A6XPQ4","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glenn Yarborough was born in Milwaukee,Wisc on January 12,1930.He is a Folk Singer,Songwriter and Guitarist.He began his career in 1951 at the age of 21 and was one of the most popular of the Folk Singers.He was the lead singer of The Limelighters.This is a Stereo Vinyl  LP released in 1966  by RCA Records (LSP-3661) It was re-released as a CD in 1997.Glen has had an amazingly long career,and is one of the very few of the Folk Era still performing.This is a very unusual album as it was performed live at The Hungry i.This was an imagnitive idea by Glen and they issued song sheets to the audience for the recording. The sound quality is excellent and this vinyl album perfectly relives  the music as it was recorded during the Folk Era.

"This is one of my favorite albums by a female singer.For what it's worth,my favorite female singers are Judy Collins and Nana Mouskouri.They can both sing any song and make it their own.There is little I can add  to the many Reviews already posted here on Amazon ,starting on January 19,1999 and continuing up to July,19,2015.To think that an album can continue to be praised for 15 years attests to the brilliance of the album and how much it continues to be loved.Two songs ,""Bird On the Wire"" by Leonard Cohen and ""Sometime Soon"" by Ian Tyson are classics,but you've never heard them better performed than by Judy Collins;and that is on this album released by Elektra Records (EKS-74033) as a Stereo Vinyl LP in 1968.Judy was only 29 when this album was released. By the way ,it is interesting to compare her singing of ""Someday Soon"" on her new album ""Strangers Again"" released in 2015,as well as others songs on the album,particularly ""Send In Ihe Clowns"".Judy is now 76 and still as enchanting as ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCV1QOPIU0FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M7BDL0#wasThisHelpful","R2VCV1QOPIU0FQ","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that this is one of the best books I've ever read on the Kennedy Assassination.That's saying a lot for me,because I'veread  a plethora of JFK books as they were published,and are still being published today.I don't consider myself a conspiracy addict;but I've never believed that the public has ever been told the full story on the Assassination.I have held that opinion from the day i saw the Assassination happen in real time on TV.The reason for my doubt is that I spent time  in the Army,did a lot of rifle shooting,and even won a couple of awards.First,the manner in which the back of Kennedy's head was blown out,could only have been by the exiting of a bullet by a frontal head shot.Secondly,even the idea that someone with mediocre marksmanship skills,particularly using such a mediocre rifle could even begin to accomplish the act,in the time taken,or even a much greater time.Also,any marksman would never have planned a shot of JFK moving away rather than approaching ,as was the case,and the shooter (s) had far better choices available.At the time it happened,I was convinced it had to be an expert sniper,who had the rare ability,and top line rifle to do the act..Also.the shooter would have had the ability to accomplish that act from  a Kilometer or more distance.,from any number of high points,and would have done just that.Also,if a conspiracy was involved,there would have been more than one shooter,placed in different locations as a triangulation to ensure absolute success;which ,by the  way,was what happened.I must admit,in the early days after the Assassination,I had no idea of what a widespread,complicated,personns involved,organazations and different factions from the CIA,Secret Service,Cuban interestsRussia and Communists,,Mafia,|Politicians,Military  Defence manyfacturers;and other Government enitities had good readon  to see JFK as well as RFK removed from power,even murdered ,if necessary..The other side of the coin was the insistant effort on the part of the Media,Government,Warren Commission,etc. to debunk any theory,witness,evidence,or logic other than that the idea adopted and perpetrated from day one that the Assassination was the exclusive act of a lone,unconnected,individual;namerly Lee Harvey Oswald.  After reading so many,other books,and watching so many movies , documents and information from various people and studies on the Net,as well as this late 2013,book by Ventura ,Russell and Wayne;I still hold with my original opinion;but only more inforced as the years and information unfold. What this book does that is so good is that it covers pretty much everything that has been covered over the years;but in short accurate detail.If one were to start from scratch today,and try to read all that has been published,the task would be humongous.What Ventura and all have done is to sum it up in an easy to follow book that pretty well tells all that is known today,and gives excellent references.Of course,there is still much more  that is to be known about the who and why of Kennedy's Assassination,;and we may learn more as secret files and information is released;the one thing that is for sure,is that the idea that LHO was a lone killer will be shown as a total fiction and that a comjplicated conspiracy of the highest level was involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLRY0P7HG8NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626361398#wasThisHelpful","RBLRY0P7HG8NE","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The most interesting part of the whole novel is when Longarm really finds out what happens to Lucy.There's not a whole lot of action except that Custis takes an Apache arrow that pierces his arm.There is also little in the way of good Old West descriptions or expressions.Even so;it is still a good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38H6CBSKEX5K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=051515380X#wasThisHelpful","R38H6CBSKEX5K9","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most unusual novels I have ever read.I have never been much of a fan of Sci-Fi,Fantasy, etc. but I love history.Also,Historical Novels are among my favorites as I find they are a great way to understand the culture,trials tribulations of the people during times in the past.I guess that is what made ""Gone With The Wind"" a classic,as it conveys what life was like and how it affected the upper class of society in and around Atlanta during the Civil War.I am not going to try to summarize the book because several other reviewers have done that very well.However;I srongly suggest that one read the reviews before even starting to read the novel.For those who read the book before reading any reviews;I think the reviews are still very interesting to read after.The very idea of a novel that has characters that ""travel"" through mankinds 's history starting 200,000 BC and carrying on until 2000+ ADis mind-boggling.Well,hold on for a trip that will capture your imagine in a way that dozens of history textbooks can never do,nor do they even try.  All through the ages and cultures of mankind,there have always been Gods,Spirits,Elves,Leprechauns,Trolls, Witches,Shamens,.Guardian Angels,.In other we have lost our wonder.You name the periods of history,and you will always find them.I'm ' not sure if the author has created Lumins,or that I have just never come across them;but they are central to the novel.. In other words,the people of modern society are the most spiritually starved people in history.In our age of science,we What this novel really drove home to me is that our modern society through advances in Logic and Science has tended to triumph ,or at least replaced Myth,Magic and Wonder.Not only that,this change has really taken place over the last 300 years.Modern society now tend to analyze,rationalize,define,and calculate;but we feel little wonder and awe.We no longer believe in magic,so we've lost the wonder that inspired our ancesters.Lumins give us guideposts.In every land and culture lumins are what represent things that mystify mankind.In ancient Egypt,they're sphinxes and talking basboons. In Greece ,they're satyrs, and nymphs.In Medieval Europe they're fairies and saints.All these creatures take their shape from myths and legends,and from the magic that inspired their people,.

"No doubt about it;this episode strays greatly from what we have been getting over the years.On rare occasions ,Longarm has had to put up with a ""partner"" who attaches himself ,or in this case ,herself,to him as he goes off on assignment.I might have expected somone like Ned Buntline;but a lady,dime novelist,and a real looker,.However;as the storyline progresses,Longarm is slowly finding out  having Delia Walker tagging along has some benefits and in the end she actuallyb becomes a real worthwhile partner. The story really reads more like a Mystery than a Western;something that usually turns me off;but this time the storyline and characters actually make it a good read.Also;the normal length of an episode in this series is about 180+ pages;but in this case There is a lot of blank full and part pages ,which makes it a very short read. Even at this point,longtime fans can sense something brewing and that all comes to pass with Episode 436,when the series abruptly ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JR5PNS2YAD8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515154318#wasThisHelpful","R1JR5PNS2YAD8C","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When Yomega came out with this High Performance Transaxle ,they set a whole new standard.It gives three times the sleeping time of ordinary or fixed wood axles and makes tricks easy to accomplish, that previously none but experts could perform. When you own one of these High Performance Yo-Yo's you'll never be wishing you'd bought something else.This is a very good and popular YO-YO and you'll see it is offered in different colors and prices.However;they are all identical except for the color ,which doesn't matter,as long as it is a ""Yomega Fireball"",regardless of the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GCVSMUE53UFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QGRCJA#wasThisHelpful","R2GCVSMUE53UFO","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another great puzzle in Puzzle Masters collection of wire puzzles.It is a high quality puzzle made of fairly heavy,3mm Nickel plated wire and two wooden balls.There are 2 rings,each about 1 1/4 "" in diameter,1 ring slightly larger and heavier,and 5 other pieces .The object is to remove the heavy ring from this tangle and later put it back.As with all such wire puzzles ,this can be accomplished without using brute force,which will only ruin the puzzle. The puzzle has a Difficulty Level of 9 out of 10;making it a more suitable challenge for a fairly experienced rather than a novice puzzle solver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83HBSQ9YSNPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XNMWSY#wasThisHelpful","R83HBSQ9YSNPZ","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a real gem of an album by the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem for any longtime Clancy fan or anyone who is just getting to know this most popular Irish Group.This album was released in the earlier days of the group.Although there is no date on the album or cover,here,or at Diccogs.I surmise it was about 1962 or '63.This is early as the group was active between 1956 and 1998. The Clancy members of the group were Liam,Paddy,Tom,Bobby and Finbar.On this album we get to hear as well,Peg,Makem's Mother Sarah and Grandchildren..The album contains a wonderful collection of Traditional songs that were part of the Clancy family sing-songs passed down through generations.The album was released by Tradition (Everest) Records) (2083).It is a Stereo Vinyl LP and has good sound quality.The sound quality reflects how it was made and not like the reissued Audio CD in 2007 nor does it have the same songs.If you want the authentic sound of the family singing,this is the album you want. The notes on the back of the cover describes the album perfectly.""Whenever and wherever the Clancy Clan collect there is sure to be music-and wherever there is music-they sing,as that is their way of life.Add to this the warmth of each individual of the clan-and you would sing too.  This collection of Irish Folk Airs,is the second of two sing-songs which started with Tradition #2060 ""AT HOME WITH THE CLANCY BROTHERS AND TOMMY MAKEM AND THEIR FAMILIES"" and features the singing of Peg,Bobby,Tom ,Patrick,Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem and his mother Sarah. (and Grandchildren) Though all of the songs were originally sung unaccompanied,the guitar,harmonica,tin whistle,and Irish harp are now widely used.Often in the evening around the fire,the grown-ups would lead in a song while the children would join in on the chorus.Out of this atmosphere of freshness and beauty,the happy mornings,the wintry evenings ,the loves and tragedies of the people,has come a great wealth of songs and music,as presented in this latest offering by the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem.""Songs on the album are;  PAPER BAND PINS  I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING  AS I ROVED OUT  THE COBBLER  WHISKEY YOU'RE THE DEVIL  ALL AROUND THE LONEY O  THE MOONSHINER  ME GRANDFATHER DIED  (A) SHELLEY  (B) AROUND TO THE BUTCHER SHOP  (C) ONE TWO THREE  THE LITTLE BEGGARMAN  THE REAL OLD MOUNTAIN DEW  THE WOMAN FROM WEXFORD I'LL TELL MY MA","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W23N5AOYJXP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIAE1I0#wasThisHelpful","R1W23N5AOYJXP0","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patrick Baker takes a demented look at the performances of 44 U.S.Presidents.Although this little tome consists of only 52 pages,he leaves no stones unturned.Actually he completely exposes all the stones be they small,medium,large,or WoW.There are many ways to rate a President;,and everyone knows that the supreme prize has to go to ""Tricky Dickie "" Nixon.However;Baker doesn't let the rest of the Presidents simply hang around,but presents them all front and center.Since many people manage to go through life without knowing much at all about many of the Presidents,and certainly anything about what they did or didn't accomplish during their terms;Baker lays it all out for you,in a totally different way than your History teacher did.He has done a great amount of research to find,explain and inform the readers of the ""Dickiest"" things each President did to allow us to remember him.He is not satisfied to leave it there;he decided to put it in a book and supplied us with stickers so we could do the honor of presenting them ,or if you prefer,attaching them ,not on their chest where most honors get placed ...but right where they belong. Since this book will likely take its place among the important History books of the nation;I am sure Baker will update it with each new President.We'll all be waiting with baited breath when the first woman gets elected  as Commander-in Chief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQUY5O5S75UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942099037#wasThisHelpful","R3BQUY5O5S75UJ","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a longtime fan of The Trailsman Series,I really enjoyed this episode.Though not written in the style we're used to,it has a great storyline,lots of well developed characters and all kinds of action;fast,wild,savage,surprising and even diabolical.Poor old Fargo,,as usual,didn't ask for any of this,but he decides to see it through to the end,whatever that may bring.The torture scenes and descriptions would put to shame anything the Apaches or even Dracula could stage.They make a pirate scene of  ""walking the plank"" look civilized,and all this from a 15 year old ""kid"". We have yet to find Fargo confronting a woman he couldn't or wouldn't dare to trifle with;but the banker's daughter,Amanda,is something to behold;even her beauty is overshadowed by such spunk and outright bombast ,that our hero Skye decides he can do without.Too bad the author didn't see fit to give us the scene and descriptions of the funerals that were sure to be taking place in the Boot Hill Cemetery of Horse Creek,Wyoming, in the next few days.But then again,maybe that was best left to the reader's imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBXMO0FPMAOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467213#wasThisHelpful","R1NBXMO0FPMAOH","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the more difficult wire,or disentanglement puzzles from the large collection made by Puzzle Master.I suppose it gets its name from the shape of the large piece,which somewhat resembles a Yak along with the second largest piece which resembles a rider.It is an intriguing looking puzzle made of fairly heavy wire that won't bend out of shape,unless brutal force is applied.There are actually 5 pieces to the puzzle.The object is to remove the handle,or what looks like a cross or man.What complicates this puzzle is the two diamond  -shaped brass pieces,one which needs to be removed along with the handle and the other,which only serves to complicate things.,As to difficulty,it deserves a Difficulty Level of 10 out of 10,;in other words very difficult. This puzzle was designed by Dick Hess,a well known puzzle designer from California. If you get stumped,and there is a good chance you will,Puzzlemaster.ca  will give you a solution ,or if you prefer, there is a video on YouTube to assist you.All is not lost even after yo have solved it and put it back together;as all you have to do is put it away for a while and it can be just as challenging once again.Wiree puzzles are many and varied and have entertained and challenged puzzlers for generations.They come in all prices,quality and difficulty.This Yak Puzzle is more suited for someone with some experience in solving disentanglement puzzles rather than a novice just getting started.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMPKCE6GS9K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00110L9TO#wasThisHelpful","R2NMPKCE6GS9K2","A18OBUSMXVE8R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18OBUSMXVE8R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game called ""Dolphin Solitaire"" is basically the same game that has been popular for many years.comes in many versions and made by many companies.Normally it goes by names such as Peg or Marble Solitaire (see my review dated May 25,2015) This is a very different version in that it comes in a cardboard box,the board is a fold- out cardboard ,rather than wood or plastic,and the playing pieces are wooden Dolphins .The game can be played solitaire (1-player) as the classic version.  However; there is another great difference,it can be played by 2 opponents or 4 opponents or teams.this is called a Bonus Game of Migration Checkers,and It is played in much the way moves are made in the classic game of Checkers.

"This is a very interesting book in the collection of puzzle books published by Sterling.They have books that cover the gambit of puzzles.Some are quite simple and others are difficult.This one is more suited for kids who tend to relish this type of humor ;whereas adults would probably consider it(,I really can't think of an appropriate word ) trifling.Lateral Thinking puzzles can be very thought provoking,but these puzzles are so off the wall,that few if anyone will ""guess"" the answers,even when using the Clues.The answers are almost so unusual,that they are even ridiculous. Just to show you what you can expect; here are a couple of examples;  .Walter spent three days in the hjspital.He was neither sick nor injured,but when it vas time to leave he had to be carried out..

"Elena is an opera by Francesco Cavalli, the star composer of 17th-century Venice. He wrote 41 operas, and 27 of them survive. Elena was penned in 1659, and was never performed since. The Aix-en-Provence Festival dug it up and give it a full blooded performance at the small ThÃ©Ã¢tre du Jeu de Paume, a relic in the Italian horseshoe style that is perfect for Baroque opera.Cavalli's score calls for no fewer than 23 different characters, which might explain why it has languished in obscurity for so long. With its European Academy of Music, Aix-en-Provence has a  pool of excellent young singers on which to draw; 13 gifted principals take the 23 main roles.Elena aka The Abduction of Helen by Cavalli is of course not about the life of Helen of Troy but about racy attitudes towards sex and marriage in 17th century Venice. All of Venice had been excommunicated when Cavalli was four years old, not for its free and easy morality but rather because this rich city had the confidence to ignore playing by rules imposed by others. Elena, the thirty-second of his forty one or so operas, is also about playing harmlessly outside the rules, those of restraint or civilized conduct in particular.Elena of the title is none other than Helen of Troy but that was in the future. The show in Cavalli's version is very nearly stolen by Menelaus, King of Sparta, who slips into a frock early in the first act as `Elisa' and spends the next three hours stealing his own share of male hearts before disrobing to win Elena's. The opera deals with Helen's marriage to Menelaus. The plot is full of twists as various suitors vie for the hand of the most beautiful woman in the world. There are some wonderful melodies and set pieces and the whole thing eventually ends in happy marriages.The opera opens with a Prologue which presents a version of the Judgment of Paris and Director Jean-Yves Ruf treats the Prologue as a burlesque.The convoluted plot centres, more or less, around the wooing of Helen by Menelaus, Theseus and Menestheus. Menelaus cross-dresses as an Amazon called Elisa in order to get closer to Helen. A bunch of men fall in love with Elisa. Theseus's real Amazon wife Hippolyta appears and she wants to kill her husband. The libretto was started by Giovanni Faustini and finished by Nicolo Minato. The plot is convoluted and long, but grab what you can of the central plotline and listen to the music and the singing and you will discover that Cavalli is unfailingly melodic, inventive and simply beautiful in his musical settings.The 13 young singers are all outstanding. In the two biggest roles, Hungarian EmÃ¶ke BarÃ¡th who sings the roles of Helen and Venus is a pretty blonde with a beautiful voice. Cavalli gives her some lovely melodies and her ringing and luminous voice delivers them to perfection.Rumanian countertenor Valer Barna-Sabadus is tall and rangy and is artlessly wonderful as the cross-dressing Menelaus, with all the bloom and agility of a top-drawer countertenor. His singing is simply gorgeous. Both he and Barath are at home on the knife edge between sentiment and comedy, in turn meltingly beautiful and cuttingly funny.Swiss-Chilean tenor Emiliano Gonzalez Toro also shows impressive range as the buffoon Iro, while Christopher Lowrey is impressive in the smaller countertenor roles. Portuguese tenor Fernando GuimarÃ£es as Theseus with his deeper voice provided a nice contrast to the countertenor pursuers of Helen. Theseus is betrothed to the Amazon Hippolyta. The latter is sung by mezzo-soprano Solenn'Lavanant Linke, a woman of some stature well suited to the role.Argentinian conductor Leonardo GarcÃ­a AlarcÃ³n and his Cappella Mediterranea offer us every opportunity to love Cavalli's fluid, inventive, witty, moving, clever music, with an organic musicality that gives every word expression, keeps every dance beat airborne and makes every lament affecting.Director Jean-Yves Ruf had some tough choices to make with a problematic opera. The opera has a problematic plot, but the performance is well worth its revival.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20L6D1JP6U2T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS8SV7I#wasThisHelpful","R20L6D1JP6U2T8","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johann Adolph Hasse (1699-1783) is one of those composers whose importance in the history of opera has never been questioned, but whose own works have long since disappeared from the repertory. Born near Hamburg, Hasse studied with Nicola Porpora and Alessandro Scarlatti in the 1720s in Naples, and, when he returned to Germany, settled in Dresden as court composer to the Elector of Saxony.  As prolific composer famous for his opera seria that established his reputation across Europe, Hasse composed more than 50 of them.â€˜Didone Abbandonataâ€™ was first performed in Dresden in 1742 to celebrate the birthday of Hasseâ€™s patron the Elector of Saxony August III. Beginning with Aeneas's decision to leave Dido and Carthage, to fulfil his destiny of founding a city, the opera plunges straight into the action, and conductor Michael Hofstetter ensures that the dramatic tension never slackens. â€˜Didone Abbandonataâ€™ is perhaps the first opera seria to adopt a tragico fine, as opposed to lieto fine, with the suicide of Queen Dido in the final Act.  Hasseâ€™s arias are the predecessor of the rococo style galant.  As in Purcellâ€™s famous treatment of the same story, it is Didoâ€™s anticipation of the personal catastrophe which will befall her, expressed in her desperate efforts to prevent Aeneasâ€™s departure, that is of most interest, and this part is being left out in Metastasioâ€™s libretto.  It is therefore only during the operaâ€™s final scene â€˜Fuggi, O Reginaâ€¦Ombra Cara, ombra traditaâ€™, the great monologue of Dido, that the intensity of emotion surrounding Didoâ€™s character and her music reaches its height.  Here Hasse employed versi spezzati (broken verses) to reveal her deep insecurity.  At its heart lies the short cavatina, whose music derives from the surrounding declaimed accompanied recitative. Through this Hasse emphasizes her helplessness through the contrasting natures of accompanied recitative and the more lyrical aria, a contrast which serves to highlight her desolation, and the tragic style prevails. This scene is reminiscent in style to Handelâ€™s â€˜Alcinaâ€™ in which the sorceress laments in an Act 2 monologue ""Ah! Ruggiero crudel - Ombre pallideâ€ her abandonment by Ruggiero.There's something robust and purposeful about both the playing and the singing of this live performance taken from a stage production in the Munich Prinzregententheater in 2011.  While not totally polished, the best parts of this live performance represent the finest available.  Dido is sung confidently by Theresa Holzhauser, mezzo-soprano, while both Aeneas and Iarbas, the African king who attempts to blackmail Dido into marriage, are sung by two counter-tenors, Flavio Ferri-Benedetti and Valer Barna-Sabadus.  Iarbas, a role created by Hasse for Farinelli, gets the best aria in the entire opera, â€˜Cadra fra poco in cenereâ€™, just before Dido's final scene, and Barna-Sabadus delivers it with great vocal control and technical finesse. The sung parts are dominated by high voices, and only the minor part of Osmida (baritone) is allocated to a broken voice.  Both Theresa Holzhauserâ€™s Dido and Flavio Ferri-Benedettoâ€™s Aeneas are well done enough. The latterâ€™s heroic departure aria in Act Three â€˜A trionfar mi chiama un bel desio d'onore â€˜ is a tour de force, so is Didoâ€™s final scene and her important solo at the centre of Act Two â€˜Ah! Non lasciarmi, noâ€™, which has music of beautiful and deeply felt sincerity. Other sopranos are more variable in vocal level, and Seleneâ€™s aria â€˜Ogni amator supponeâ€™ is passable without being outstanding, with pitch problems abounding in Hinterdoblerâ€™s singing and in similar vein the Act III aria of Araspe â€˜Gia si desta la tempestaâ€™ of Maria Celeng.The orchestral playing of the Hofkapelle MÃ¼nchen under Michael Hofstetter is highly effective, allowing the range of Hasseâ€™s orchestration to make its mark, with the opening sinfonia splendidly done. The sound is no more than acceptable, with stage noises and the applauses, but at Naxos's bargain price this is a rarity that's well worth investigating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36SMR55SWA9EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARL9QD4#wasThisHelpful","R36SMR55SWA9EY","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Lane (Mezzo Soprano), Karina Gauvin (Soprano), Melissa Fogarty (Soprano),Nathaniel Watson (Baritone), Stephen Stubbs (Chitarrone), Stephen Stubbs (Guitar),Margriet Tindemans (Viola da gamba), Maxine Eilander (Harp), Byron Schenkman (Harpsichord)Conductor:  Ingrid MatthewsOrchestra/Ensemble:  Seattle Baroque OrchestraRecorded in 2001 at Bastyr University, Kenmore, WA, this baroque work was written when opera was banned in Rome (1683), so this work takes the ostensible format of an oratorio. This is convenient since the famous Abraham/Sarah/Hagar/Ishmael story is from the Book of Genesis, chapter 21, and the opera takes the point where Abrahamâ€™s wife Sarah insists that he must banish the slave Hagar and her son Ishmael to protect their own son Isaacâ€™s inheritance.  In Genesis, Ishmael was fathered by Abraham at the urging of the then barren Sarah, who later (at an advanced age) to everyoneâ€™s surprise bore a son, Isaac. The anguished father very reluctantly agrees to banish the two, who end up nearly dying in the desert but are eventually, at the oratorioâ€™s end, saved by an Angel.This work offers an excellent example of Alessandro Scarlattiâ€™s vocal and dramatic facility and his engaging manner of setting melody to appropriately varied, effectively complementary accompaniment.All of the drama in this two-part work centres on the interaction of the four main characters (the Angel delivers the final aria). There are no choruses or significant orchestral sections save for the opening Sinfonia.  It contains wonderful arias (both accompanied by continuo and by orchestra), flowing recitatives, and occasional duets. Itâ€™s a very compact, tightly constructed piece of theatre that moves right along, and itâ€™s filled with lovely music.Canadian soprano Karina Gauvin heads the cast as the mistress Sara.

As the banished son Ishmael, American soprano Melissa Fogarty not only delivers her arias with a marvelous range of color and nuance, conveying the victimized boyâ€™s array of emotions, but her timbre, well-cored with its crystalline quality of utmost childlike spunk, befits the boyâ€™s role to a â€˜Tâ€™. Her performance in Part Two, in the duet where Ishmael and Hagar desperately face death in the desert, is outstanding, and really steals the show from even as eminent a performance as Gauvinâ€™s.  As Agar, American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Lane is also excellent, especially in the sombre second half.The only one who pales by comparison is baritone Nathaniel Watson, who sings well enough but puts little emotion into it and doesnâ€™t give us a real sense of Abrahamâ€™s character or his conflicted state throughout the work. Luckily, most of the singing, however, is done by the women and the action moves swiftly.The instrumental playing is excellent, and the continuo players are particularly notable for their sympathetic accompaniments.

"Jennifer Lane (Mezzo Soprano), Karina Gauvin (Soprano), Melissa Fogarty (Soprano),Nathaniel Watson (Baritone), Stephen Stubbs (Chitarrone), Stephen Stubbs (Guitar),Margriet Tindemans (Viola da gamba), Maxine Eilander (Harp), Byron Schenkman (Harpsichord)Conductor:  Ingrid MatthewsOrchestra/Ensemble:  Seattle Baroque OrchestraRecorded in 2001 at Bastyr University, Kenmore, WA, this baroque work was written when opera was banned in Rome (1683), so this work takes the ostensible format of an oratorio. This is convenient since the famous Abraham/Sarah/Hagar/Ishmael story is from the Book of Genesis, chapter 21, and the opera takes the point where Abrahamâ€™s wife Sarah insists that he must banish the slave Hagar and her son Ishmael to protect their own son Isaacâ€™s inheritance.  In Genesis, Ishmael was fathered by Abraham at the urging of the then barren Sarah, who later (at an advanced age) to everyoneâ€™s surprise bore a son, Isaac. The anguished father very reluctantly agrees to banish the two, who end up nearly dying in the desert but are eventually, at the oratorioâ€™s end, saved by an Angel.This work offers an excellent example of Alessandro Scarlattiâ€™s vocal and dramatic facility and his engaging manner of setting melody to appropriately varied, effectively complementary accompaniment.All of the drama in this two-part work centres on the interaction of the four main characters (the Angel delivers the final aria). There are no choruses or significant orchestral sections save for the opening Sinfonia.  It contains wonderful arias (both accompanied by continuo and by orchestra), flowing recitatives, and occasional duets. Itâ€™s a very compact, tightly constructed piece of theatre that moves right along, and itâ€™s filled with lovely music.Canadian soprano Karina Gauvin heads the cast as the mistress Sara.  Her clear and captivating of voice with abundant musically intelligence shine through in the various arias of Sara, like â€˜Caro, Isac amato figlioâ€™ and â€˜E folle chi paventaâ€™ as well as the aria of the Angel (final) â€œChi lo sguardo, e constanteâ€™.

"This is a complete recording of Verdi's 'Il Trovatore', made in 1977. People complain against Sutherland and Pavarotti's portrayals as Leonora and Manrico.I find nothing wrong with their more bel canto style. Actually, Pavarotti is to be preferred to other big voices who inevitably gave Manrico an almost brutal vocal portrayal.Despite the heavy dramatic thrust of the script, the musical score is still basically bel canto. To treat the score as verismo is stylistically uninformed.That said, Bonynge here is only marginally alright, and could have fared better if he gives his singers more momentum by adopting a briskier tempo, such as in 'Ah si, ben mio'. His recitatives were also too bland at times.Pavarotti has sufficient squillo to bring off 'Di quella pira', no frills. The timbre is focused and the high notes well hit and well held and brought off in real bravura. If he could not, then there is really no place for the like of a Domingo (with lowered pitch).Pavarotti is musically more nuanced than Franco Bonisolli, who otherwise would be a perfect Manrico.The main draw for this album not being awarded 5 stars are first Horne and second Sutherland.Horne's timbre is hardly resplendant in this recording, and she pressed her voice at the mid range to an unpleasant squeal quite often. Her `Stride la vampa' suffers as well as ensemble work from this inadequacy.Sutherland after the mid-1970's began her slow but gradual vocal decline, and this is sadly evident in this recording at critically lyrical moments. Contrary to what other reviewers said, it is her soft singing that posed most problems here. 'D'amor sull'ali rosee' is a sad example of a great soprano showing signs of a past-prime vocal state. She is still very capable in the ensembles, though.Wixell is a vocally effective Count, more so than Milnes at any point of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249CXDVQWRRLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005SJ7#wasThisHelpful","R249CXDVQWRRLX","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both Handel and Hasse did not come up with first rate music for this libretto, but by comparison, Hasse fared slightly, though very slightly, better. Even so, the opera is not representative of top rate baroque music and George Petrou and his highly capable cast managed to salvage the wreck without bringing it to illustrious height.The piece is very misleading, for in its premiere, two of the greatest castrati of the time sung the title role Siroe (Farinelli) and Medarse (Caffarelli).In this recording, Siroe is undertaken by Max Emanuel Cencic and Medarse by Franco Fagioli. Both singers gave solidly capable performances, but it is the music that forbids them from offering truly inspiring performances. The same thing happened with Handel's 'Siroe', for sure, for though the two lady leads in Handel's premiere were sung by Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni, the uninteresting music precluded the work to attain the status of a 'Giulius Cesare', ;'Alcina', 'Tamerlano', ""Rinaldo"" or a ""Serse"". The Spering recording about a decade ago was a good testimony of Handel's piece, but it also showed the limitations of the score, with much less colourful music as in Handel's greatest operatic outputs, the chief reason of which may be accounted for by the composer's attitude towards the libretto.So there is no use whining over the production, which in nearly all respects are perfect - the sound is pristine, the voices of the singers blend well with the orchestra...On the whole, the surprising upstaging performance comes from the minor role of Arasse, a role transposed for soprano voice and sung by American soprano Laureen Snouffle in a clear, silvery tone with spot on high notes sung free and clean.The other soprano Julia Lezhneva did not come off as well as Snouffle, and the same problem as in Pergolesi's ""Stabat Mater"" permeates here in 'Siroe'. Her Laodice sounds shrill in high notes and the registral integration is less than perfect. Otherwise, there is not much to fault her singing, given that Laodice is given the most complex music to sing as compared to Arasse or even Emira (the last solo aria is really a hell of a piece for any singer).The heroine Emira is outstandingly sung by Greek mezzo-soprano Mary Ellen Nesi, an underrated singer in the same calibre as Joyce Didonato and Magdalena Kozena, owning a more interesting timbre than either Elina Garanca or Vivca Genaux.Her Emira is beautifully sung and dramatically vivid, and Nesi handles the fiorature capably if not perfectly..The parallel libretto of both Handel and Hasse's works can afford an interesting comparison. I find Hasse's to be more interesting in almost every turn, though only very slightly. Assuming the title role of Siroe in Handel's case was Senesino. While Farinelli sung Siroe for Hasse, Cencic's timbre has grown darker than a couple of years back and arguably would have made a better Siroe in Handel's. Farinelli's competitor and collleague Caffarelli's role of Medarse is undertaken by star countertenor Fagioli. Fagioli gave a technical display of Medarse's rather terse and harsh music to almost perfection, but arguably the pieces are less than enticing in musical terms.Overall speaking, the most pleasing vocal performances belong to Nesi and Snouffle, but the result is brought to bear by the score more than other considerations.For those interested in a scholarly comparison, this is still warmly recommended, hence recommended with slight reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWNPVQDIG21U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6VVGV4#wasThisHelpful","R1WWNPVQDIG21U","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very fine production and wonderful performance of 'Don Giovanni' back in 1999.Riccardo Muti has conducted a number of Da Ponte's Mozart operas in Vienna, and this, together with the 1996 'Cosi fan tutte', are musical winners through and through.The reason is simple - the casts in both productions are GREAT.In this 'Don Giovanni', for once, we have a Spanish 'Don'. Carlos Alvarez - who is both a fine actor and good baritone, though most of the time, he got 'muffled' in costumes and wigs that are not really becoming the Don. Visually he could have fared much much better had a more sensible art director been around.He handled the vocal parts with aplomb, though the 'Serenade' could have been a bit more sweet and alluring. But generally speaking, he has the vocal prowess to depict a roguish Don, and the looks to convince that this Don is a real charmer and seducer.As the 'counterpart' to the Don, D'Arcangelo is a funny and lithe Leporello, so rarely found in terms of comic capacity. HIS costumes are surprising effective, and he makes good use of his capabilities in this important role. The Catalogue Aria is a real winner.The ladies are all very good, with the vocal crown to Adrianne Pieczonka, whose Donna Anna blows the listeners away through and through, though visually more stolid. Anna Caterina Antonacci is very convincing as Donna Elvira. While her earlier entrance isn't that 'fiery' as the role demands, in the latter two Acts she is able to conjure up all the sympathy for this role.While the soubrette role of Zerlina is being sung by Austrian mezzo Angelika Kirchschalger instead, hers is both a vocal and acting winner. The Massetto is Lorenzo Regazzo, who has since built up a major baritone career. And even the Commendatore is none other than Selig!This production offers wonderful chance to see ALL these big operatic names in their youthful state, and with Muti at the pit, nothing can go wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVIBZTDTQTUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009F7G30#wasThisHelpful","R3TVIBZTDTQTUE","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katia Ricciarelli and Luicano Pavarotti: Arias and Duets is a program of scenes from Giuseppe Verdi's operas `Aida', `Macbeth', La Forza', `I Lombardi', `Il Corsaro' , :Falstaff' and `Otello' recorded live at the Teatro Pegio, Parma, on July 30th, 1976.TRACKS:1. La traviata: Lunge da lei...De' miei bollenti spiriti (Pavarotti);2. Aida: O patria mia (Ricciarelli);3. Macbeth: Ah, la paterna mano (Pavarotti);4. La forza del destino: Pace, pace, mio Dio (Ricciarelli);5. I lombardi: La mia letizia infondere (Pavarotti);6. Il corsaro: Egli non riede ancora!...Non so le tetre immagini (Ricciarelli);7. Falstaff: Sul fil d'un soffio etesio (Ricciarelli);8. Otello: Gia nella notte densa (Ricciarelli/Pavarotti).The entire LP last for about 45 minutes, and as far as this reviewer is aware, has been re-mastered digitally by Decca in another double CD issue, but not individually.Recordings of these two singers' collaborations are relatively few. Apart from a video of an early Metropolitan 'Un Ballo' performance, this live recording is about the only collaboration of these two singers in formal issue.In 1976, both singers are in their absolute vocal prime.  The tenor and soprano are about the best operatic voices to have emerged from Italy in the latter part of the 20th century.  In this live recording we do not hear applauses as we often hear today in digital recordings.  The sound is very clear and clean. The Orchestra of the Parma Opera House was conducted ably by Giuseppe Patane.  One thing is evident - while both singers sung the Otello duet at the end of the programme, Pavarotti did not, throughout his illustrious career, made Otello one of his signature roles as he did Mantua, Alfredo, Radames, Manrico, or other earlier Verdian tenor heroes.  Katia Ricciarelli, a celebrated Verdian in her time, was most adept at the earlier Verdian soprano roles with a heavy bel canto flavor than the more dramatic or spinto roles like Aida, as is evident also in this programme. Her Nannetta and Desdemona are clearly more than memorable, with a juicy lyrical soprano timbre capable of manoeuvring the finest dynamic changes and with her crystal clear idiomatic enunciations. In similar vein, in Verdi, Luciano Pavarotti, with his absolutely glorious timbre, negotiated the various numbers with highest musical elan and verbal incisiveness that pales every other tenor of his generation.While Ricciarelli had, during those years of her rather short vocal career, partnered the Hispana tenros Placido Domingo as well as Jose Carreras, this album with Pavarotti represents one of the desert island recordings of these two great Italian singers.Patane's orchestral support is also superb, and the vinyl LP released some years after the live performance by Decca offers great sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T886DQQM987N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYLEX4M#wasThisHelpful","R1T886DQQM987N","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Giovanni Gualberto Magli, the castrato who took part in the premiere of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, was a pupil of Giulio Caccini and who spent most of his life in the service of the Medici family in Florence.Some very fine performances of 17th century baroque music directly or indirectly associated with Magli is being presented by the young Italian Counter-tenor Raffaele PÃ¨, with harpist Chiara Granata and theorbo player David Miller.The group take us on a journey from Monteverdi's Mantua and Caccini's Florence, to Naples and Brandenburg, with music by Monteverdi, Caccini, Sigismondo d'India, Francesco Lambardi, Giovanni Maria Trabaci, Girolamo Montesardo, Alessandro Ciccolini, and Johann Nauwach.When Claudio Monteverdiâ€™s La favola dâ€™Orfeo was first performed at the Mantua court of Francesco IV Gonzaga on 24 February 1607, Magli is known from contemporary correspondence to have sung the roles of Musica and Proserpina, but probably Speranza as well.For a â€˜historicalâ€™ project like this success will only come if it has an artist for whom the music is an experience rather than an experiment. On top of a beautiful voice, the singer must connect with his audience on a level that transcends ego, intellect, and even musicality.This album starts with Monteverdi's L'Orfeo. Here PÃ¨ sings Musica's prologue, Speranza's solo from Act III and Proserpina's from Act IV, linked by instrumental interludes based on other material in the opera.The young Italian countertenor PÃ¨ uses a direct style, recitar cantando , in which he combines plangent tone with a strong feeling for the text.  His account of the Monteverdi arias very much creates sung speech and the results are brilliant.Amarilli mia bella by Magli's teacher Giulio Caccini (1550 - 1618) is more elegantly lyrical, but here PÃ¨ sings both Caccini's version and the highly ornamented version by Johann Nauwach (1595 - 1630). It was the composer Nauwach who produced the earliest known collection of arias for solo voice published in 17th century Germany.  In 1612 Nauwach visited Italy, and his ornamented version of Caccini's aria probably pays tribute to this PÃ¨riod.What follows is an imaginative journey of Magli. This album is almost a travelogue that documents the geographical progress of Magliâ€™s career. The selectionsâ€™ scene changes are audible in the musiciansâ€™ playing: the pieces composed in Mantua differing from that of music written in Florence or Naples.While perfecting the recitar cantando style, Raffaele PÃ¨ is nonetheless capable of singing in the most elegantly lyrical terms. He is poised to make his name among those of the finest modern countertenors like Fagioli, Davies, et. al.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH3YGVI70JOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW5FBPA#wasThisHelpful","RKH3YGVI70JOP","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He lived through most of the seventeenth century,  particularly noted for his poetic texts.When Monteverdi died before completing his final opera, Lâ€™incoronazione di Poppea, a colleague â€“ now believed to be Benedetto Ferrari â€“ supplied the workâ€™s final number and most famous duet, â€œPur ti miroâ€.  Ferrariâ€™s own operatic scores are lost, so it si impossible to verify that the music Ferrariâ€™s, but the text most certainly is his. Savour Jaroussky singing the fifth number here, â€˜Avverti Ã² corâ€™, and youâ€™d probably be convinced that it was Ferrari who supplied the final duet to Monteverdiâ€™s swansong.The solo vocal works of Benedetto Ferrari formed the contents of a recital of Philippe Jaroussky in October 2002.This recording made in the same year with his own Ensemble Artaserse found a perfect medium for Jaroussky's art--and it's quite formidable in both purity of tone and subtlety of expression as well as the near-inhuman technical feats he brandishes as naturally as breathing.  Jaroussky was barely 24 years old at the time of this recording, and the voice is as fresh and pure as crystal.The melodies, accompanied by various instruments, including viola di gamba, theorbo, and harp, demand an amazing capacity for ornamentation, for super-florid runs and whiplash-inducing turns--and Jaroussky conquers all with unruffled ease.  Although the 14 selections sound somewhat similar, along the way Jaroussky and his partners certainly will hold your interest, often astonishing you with their virtuosity. The sound couldn't be more complementary, and the notes provide substantial background on both music and performers, along with texts and translations. Of the entire set, the main composition is the Cantata Spirituale called â€˜Queste pungenti spineâ€™, accompanied here serenely by an organ. Jarousskyâ€™s ethereal timbre provides the perfect medium for such piece.It is a pity that this astounding album has since gone out of print. Unreservedly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBJ0DAF9R91J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008RUTU#wasThisHelpful","RUBJ0DAF9R91J","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a recording back in the mid-1980's of Pergolesi's highly delectable piece.The late Claudio Abbado gives his reading of this masterpiece, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in a non-period period, so HIP insistents need not apply.For the general music lovers, this recording does have its own high points and allure.First of all, the Scottish soprano Margaret Marshall is every bit as outstanding in the soprano parts as Emma Kirkby, though Marshall owns a much fuller and juicy soprano voice than Kirkby. In terms of agility, Marshall never yields a single decimal point to Kirkby. Marshall's trills rivals that of Joan Sutherland, and her ability in coping with the most demanding pyrotechnics are second to none. Her highly pure and silvery timbre tops that of other much more illustrious sopranos in this work, viz. Freni (Gracis and Berganza), Ricciarelli (also with Abbado and Valentini-Terrani), Anna Netrebko (Pappano), Barbara Bonney (Roussett and Scholl), and needless to say, Julia Lezhneva (Fasolis and Jaroussky).Her alto partner the late Italian contralto Lucia Valentini-Terrani owned the most perfect timbre for this work - the voice is dark and shimmering, with a subdued yet gleaming hue that brings forth the alto parts in the best imaginable light.  No other mezzo-sopranos or countertenors ever managed to come close to Valentini-Terrani in this work, including great ones like Teresa Berganza, Jochen Kowalski, Andreas Scholl, Philippe Jaroussky.The argument against the choice of two women for this work as being running counter to the original intention is forever present, especially in the present HIP era. However, the voices of Marshall and Valentini-Terrani both embodied the most pure and neuter gender timbres for this piece - Margaret sounding appropriately boyish in most, if not all, the time, and Lucia sounding plush and deep as any alto castrato imaginable.With such two full-bodied yet distinctive voices, the forces of LSO seem just right. If one wishes for a period ensemble, the combination of vocalists would rightly demand two male voices to do justice to the original score, as exemplified in the more recent recording by Hofstetter with Wey and Barna-Sabadus.Abbado gave a grave and broad view of this religious piece. The reading is both inspirational as well as musical.  Many people slashed out against his `romanticised' treatment, arguing against the excessive vibrato, the jarring harmonics et al. Having said that, in the light of the recent rave reviews of Fasolis and Jaroussky/Lezhneva's most dissonant and jarring new star rendition, such arguments against good old Abbado in the 1980's hardly hold any more water.The conclusion, hence, is simple - the best conventional recording is this Abbado/Marshall/Valentini-Terrani, and the best HIP the Hofstetter/Wey/Barna-Sabadus recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJK7PQR06C7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001G5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3KJK7PQR06C7H","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ms. Zhu is one of the foremost contemporary pianists that I have unreservedly recommended to friends in the PRC.China has lost Gu Sengying, a foremost lady interpretor of Chopin. For those who do not care for humanity, such loss is only a loss among a million.  For those who care, it was an irreparable loss.As such, Zhu Xiamei, a rough contemporary of the ill-fated Gu and also from Shanghai, bursted onto my scene of contemporary Chinese musicians like a real whirlwind - her lucidity in this piece, her multi-faceted expressivity, her deep insight into the entire set, the psychological coherence she imbues into the 32 parts of the theme and variations, all bespoke of a musical mastery of the highest order.I was overjoyed.  I rushed out to obtain all her Bach recordings. She does not disappoint at all.  And as I listen to her recordings of Bach each time, the conviction that great art is inevitably linked with human joys and sufferings becomes greater and greater to me.There aren't too many artists in our era that have lived through a life experience such as Zhu's.

"French contralto Nathalie Stutzmann has been well acquainted with the works of Handel at the very onset of her illustrious career as a contralto.  In 2009 she established her own ensemble Orfeo 55, performing often as both conductor and vocalist.In this Handel album, Ms. Stutzmann assembles a highly individual compilation that is rendered possible solely by her extensive exposure and unique acquaintance with the works of this great composer.Titled Heroes from the Shadows, the disc seeks out secondary characters from Handel's prolific opera outputs, selecting arias that rival the best compositions in the baroque operatic oeuvre.Stutzmann focuses equally on the symphonic as well as vocal aspects of the chosen material.Each solo aria is preceded by a short and terse, yet dramatically highly affecting sinfonia from Handel's various operas: Poro, Orlando, Partenope, Scipione, Serse et al.The arias following are either highly viruosic and florid, or dramatically profound. The characters involved range from castrato roles to contralto roles, like Ottone in Agrippina, Arsamene in Serse, to Cornelia in Giulius Cesare in Egitto.As solo vocalist, Stutzmann still holds a firm grip on the reigns of Handel's high demands, and she is even more dramatically alert than in her early recording years in this repertoire. As conductor, she is way up her alley in this oeuvre, conducting with great verve and alertness.Particularly worthy of mention is the ability of Stutzmann in alternating the instrumental pieces and the vocal solo arias.  The musical and dramatic as well emotional contrast are astounding, and this aspect alone makes this disc one of the best ever all-Handel operatic albums to have been recorded.Unreservedly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AG3ZOZ4J8KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LW2KAFU#wasThisHelpful","R26AG3ZOZ4J8KB","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mozartâ€™s concert arias were composed either as additions to opera scores or as substitutions or alternative arias. In her Mozart album, Gauvin chose two composed specifically for concert performance: â€˜Misera, dove sonâ€™, composed for Countess Baumgarten and â€˜Châ€™io mi scordi di te?â€¦Non temere, amato beneâ€™ which was originally intended for insertion for performance in Idomeneo but adapted for the farewell concert of Nancy Storace, a singer much adored by Mozart. It is the latter version that we hear Gauvin perform here. The orchestration calls for piano obbligato and it is deftly handled by Benedetto Lupo.  Here, Gauvin imbues every question and response with weight and passion. The same goes for â€˜Misera dove sonâ€™, aria for Baumgarten, in which Gauvin employs an entire rainbow of tone colors to express the sensation of being torn apart by misery.The opera arias featured are also marked by a superb sensitivity to the deeply emotive undertones in Mozart. Not many soprano who can make an experienced listener hear Susanna's ""Giunse alfin il momento,"" from Act IV of Le Nozze di Figaro, with fresh ears, but that is precisely what Gauvin succeeds in doing. Her highly expressive declamation opens up a unique thought progression for this character, one the audience had been watching for more than two hundred years. Gauvin's subsequent ""Deh vieni, non tardar"" is no less irresistible.She continues this personal approach with all the arias. In Die Zauberfloteâ€™s famous aria of Pamina ""Ach, ich fÃ¼hl's"" Gauvin drives home Pamina's utter desolation with her pianissimo iterations of the phrase ""So wird Ruh' im Tode sein"", which become an intimate confession. Just when you think she can't get any softer, the final phrases of the aria diminish to a stunningly sad finish. The returning of orchestra in plush tones underlines the depth of her loss.Another wonderful exchange between instrumentalist and singer occurs in Vitelliaâ€™s aria â€˜Non piÃ¹ di fioriâ€™ from the opera La Clemenza di Tito with AndrÃ© Moisanâ€™s gorgeously expressive basset horn obbligato. It is only in â€˜Non piÃ¹ di fioriâ€™, Vitellia's rangy rondo showpiece from La Clemenza di Tito that spends a fair amount of time in the rich middle of Gauvin's voice, that her lowest chest tones are comparatively underpowered.She integrates the low register more successfully in ""Come scoglio,"" which manages simultaneously to be ferocious and a thoughtfully considered argument.Bernard Labadie and Violons du Roy, an outstanding ensemble, achieve the perfect balance between supporting Gauvin and taking the spotlight.Indeed, this recording demonstrates that Karina Gauvin shares a trait with Mozart: the ease and grace with which it falls on the ear of the listener belies the true complexity and supreme artistry inherent in the crafting of a truly exquisite performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29P56RJZN9GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN3PTHA#wasThisHelpful","R29P56RJZN9GL","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the most recent years see an upsurge in recordings for baroque masters Agnostino Steffani and Leonardo Vinci, Antonio Caldara remains a perfect bet for splendid baroque vocal compositions.In the present album of over 72 minutes, we are treated with arias from six of Caldara's operas and three cantatas.The three cantatas, 'Begliocchi adorati', 'Rotte l'aspre catene' and 'Creda Niso' were composed in 1712 and 1715 respectively.  The operas range from a later period, between 1729 and 1736, and are to be considered Caldara's mature works.  The cantatas follow the 'standard' pattern of a Sinfonia, two arias preceded by recitatives.American lyrical soprano Robin Johanssen sings the pieces in a seamless silvery tone, agile, bright and with a juicy middle voice, fully capable of painting the varied vocal hues demanded in the diverse oeuvre presented in this album, all of which are world premiere recordings.  The voice is some what akin to a younger Karina Gauvin, with the same flexible vocal allure throughout the range.She is very capably accompanied by the Academia Montis Regalis, conducted by Alessadnro De Marchi. The liner notes include full texts for the lyrics of all the excerpts.This is an artistically outstanding as well as highly substantial recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLXY8MN69XPL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I595BO8#wasThisHelpful","RLXY8MN69XPL1","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album of Antonio Vivaldi's secular cantatas was made about one and a half year earlier than the French countertenor Philippe Jaroussky's 'Virtuosic Cantatas of Vivaldi' album, and two cantatas overlap - 'Alla caccia dell'alima e de' and 'Care selve amici prati' in these two albums.I have owned both albums for some years (they were recorded in around 2003/2004), yet Cencic's album issued by Capriccio was difficult to follow for the tracking of the pieces was all messed up until the last cantata (track 14 onwards). This aspect deterred me from frequenting this otherwise very well performed album, especially when one compares Jaroussky's (recorded when he was of the same age as Cencic, i.e. a year and a half later).While one would say that Philippe's timbre is sweeter (this is very subjective, mind you) and his intonation is right on (this is indisputable), Cencic has clearly more depth of interpretation (compare the final aria in Alla caccia dell'alma e de), and loads of more vocal virtuosity (compare the final aria in Care selve amici prati).The other cantatas include the popular Cessate, omai cessate and Amorel hai vinto (Rv 683), widely recorded by contraltos and countertenors alike.Cencic sung a lot of Vivaldi works during those years on stage, yet the only recorded production is Farnace (under the direction of Fasolis). His appearance in 'Orlando Furioso' as Ruggiero was not videoed as he sung in the alternative cast to Jaroussky under the direction of Spinosi (the Jaroussky performance was commercially released). I would only say that for operatic singers, there is no going back in time. The 'lost' Vivaldi years of as great a singer as Max Emanuel Cencic is the lost of all operatic audiences.This early album affords but a glimpse of Cencic's great interpretations of this composer's works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTUBMVC4QCFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002EXKFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YTUBMVC4QCFK","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ranking among the best operatic outputs of the great G. F. Handel, alongside the likes of Tamerlano, Alessandro, Rhodelinda, Rinaldo, Alcina, Amadigi di Gaula, Orlando, this opera is among the earliest revived masterpiece of Handel.  As early as the mid-20th century it was being regularly staged, though not in the historically informed mode as in the latter part of the last century.  The work is therefore widely recorded, both live or in studio, and on video as well.  The early revivals of Giulio Cesare in Egitto saw a 're-casting' of roles in the romantic operatic style - Cesare is reserved for a bass-baritone, and great singers like Cesare Siepi and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau both assumed the role to distinction.Before and since the HIP movement, this opera has posed no small casting problems over the past decades of its revival. The titular hero Cesare is composed for alto castrato (Senesino) and so is the villain Tolomeo. In this production we have two countertenors filling the bills for these two major male characters, and this is a dramatically convincing arrangement.Sesto, on the other hand, was a trouser role in the original version, being sung originally by a mezzo-soprano Margaretha Durastanti. In the early revival period, divers tenors have assumed this role, including Peter Schreier(under Karl Richter). In this production we have new American mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard singing Sesto. The original Cleopatra was Francesca Cuzzoni. Conductor Haim chose here French compatriot Nathalie Dessay.  This is a wise choice, even if Dessay is no longer in her absolute vocal prime in 2012. She is in more healthy vocal state than a year later at the MET. The young contralto Varduhi Abrahamyan is a rich-voiced Cornelia, if not out right as refined as Patricia Bardon (in the MET version).In the title role Lawrence Zazzo competent, if not outright great. Certain enunciation problem with vowels impeded an otherwise powerful and dramatic performance. Christophe Dumaux is a dramatically outstanding Tolomeo.but both he and Zazzo did not toss the coloraturas and fioriture as they might otherwise would if the conducting is less hectic and angular.Suffering from a similar plight is Abrahamyan's Cornelia. The pathos of her role was not being given full elaboration. New comer Isabel Leonard owns a voice to die for, but has yet to polish it to bring forth real vocal focus in the big arias.  Her stage presence is great and her portrayal of a young boy is very convincing.Tremendous stage activities impede the dramatic flow rather than enhancing them, alas.Nathalie Dessay's attire as Cleopatra is also controversial, but her acting is always pristine and shiny despite all distractions on stage.Veteran character countertenor Dominique Visse is also dramatically oustanding as the eunuch Nireno, though the intonation has flagged some what.New singers like Leonard and Abrahamyan are the main reasons for getting this DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT42OS6Y7UV0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK77VLE#wasThisHelpful","RT42OS6Y7UV0F","AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has a few prose pieces at the end including the 'Gettysburg Address' 'The Ten Commandments' 'The Magna Charta' 'The Declaration of Independence'.How different this Anthology is from the great majority of anthologies  which have been published in the past half- century.

"This is one of the best books about sports I have ever read. Lipsky was a rabid fan and player in childhood. He did not make it to the big leagues of his dream, but he remained passionately involved. He writes of the greatest moment of his life being when the Knicks led by an injured but heroically determined Willis Reed defeated the Lakers and took an N.B.A.championship. Lipsky knows about all the major sports but his writing goes in a sense beyond Sports. He understands the role it plays as refuge and escape in American life. How the battles on the sports field provide clear victory and decisive outcome in a way much of more murky everyday reality cannot. He understands the special space sports heroes are given, and the drama and intensity of their on-the-field conflicts. He shows how being a fan is for many the great meaning of their lives. He is excellent in quoting outstanding sources in Sports knowledge, including the remarkable novel of Frederick Exley 'A Fan's  Notes'. He shows how the discipline of sports teaches certain basic values including those of cooperation and teamwork. He too shows the secret underbelly of 'Sports' which pretends to be an innocent world apart and is in fact a big business.Lipsky knows the stuff from inside but also knows the way the Sports world tries to sell itself.He writes in a clear and fluent way.

"Ferris is concerned with the connection between the vast world of the cosmos and the vast world of the human mind. In the course of his exploration he presents an exposition of the current scientific knowledge (As of the early nineties of the twentieth century) and many interesting thoughts of his own. One such thought which he outlines in the final chapter of the book struck me as especially interesting. It is the idea that humanity might help other 'minds' or 'civilizations' in the cosmos enhance their understanding of it. i.e. That our messages and information might conceivably be of use to 'others' in developing their own understanding of the cosmos. This idea contradicts the general feeling that other 'intelligent civilizations' are likely to be far more advanced than we are, and not in any way need what we know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVF4QBNTHGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553371339#wasThisHelpful","R2XVF4QBNTHGG","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After Kristallnacht on November 9 1939 the British Government allowed 10,000 unaccompanied Jewish children from Germany Austria Czechoslovakia into Great Britain. The Kindertransport saved the lives of these children who would almost certainly been murdered by the Nazis.The children were taken in by various groups some Jewish and some not. Fifty years after this  two of those taken in Bertha Leverton and Shmuel Lowensohn contacted a group of these children and asked them to relate their stories. This book consists in short individual accounts of what happened to these children.Each of the stories is in itself fascinating. Some confine themselves to what happened at the time of their separation from their families and through the war. But others contain reports of the subsequent life stories. Many of the stories are inspiring  tales of lives rebuilt, of  people who did  not allow the horrors of their youth to break them. Not a few of them tell of making new lives in Eretz Yisrael and building families there and contributing to a Jewish society where they hope to find a kind of security they could not find in their native countries.But there are all kinds of stories including that of a wanderer of the world whose security is in his own ability to move on, and of a young man who found his security in enlisting in the British Army and fighting in some of the major battles of the war.The stories are deeply moving as they express in clear and straightforward terms the deepest human feelings and relationships. Love of parents, loss at separation, loneliness and isolation in new worlds, homesickness, sadness and longing for friends and family, appreciation of generous and kind strangers , difficult with harassing and ungenerous 'step-parents'  determination at being able to make new lives.I had the sense that each of the stories, each of the people is worth thinking about and remembering.Through one of the most evil times and experiences humanity has known a remnant was rescued and went on to build new lives and contribute to the building of new worlds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN29RP9X6W2XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0863325661#wasThisHelpful","RN29RP9X6W2XU","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turnbull organizes the letters according to Fitzgerald's correspondents. He thus has sections on Fitgerald's letters to his daughter Scottie, to his wife Zelda, to his editor Maxwell Perkins, to his contemporary and friend Hemingway, to assorted others. I found the most interesting section the one in which Fitzgerald works to encourage support and educate his daughter. In the course of this we learn of many other things, including Fitzgerald's devotion to his sick wife Zelda, his constant sense of struggling to make money, his giving great parts of his time to writing screenplays. He is  strict at times and it seems to me unusually honest in trying to educate his daughter. He values hard work and worries very much she will fall into a world of privilege and worthless hedonism. He at the same time reveals his own strong desire that she make it somehow to the world of the privileged.In his letters to Maxwell Perkins we see him struggling with the writing, the correcting of the work, the making of money. What is astonishing is that he seems to have no idea that 'The Great Gatsby' is the one work of his that really makes it into the canon. He spends a lot of time fussing over 'Tender is the Night'. He apparently hated writing stories, but these could be money-makers and so he forced himself at them. My own sense is that they are far from his best work.His letters to Hemingway are a bit deferential. He recognized Hemingway's value and wrote to Maxwell Perkins that Hemingway was the 'real thing'.There are in certain pages of the work the kind of graceful beautiful writing Fitzgerald could be wonderful at. In other passages there are hints of prejudice.narrow-mindedness and pettiness.Money and the struggle for it pervades these letters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZ0ZLE4AM25H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LZHOTE#wasThisHelpful","R2KZ0ZLE4AM25H","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the first part this work are collected some of his most important essays including a major one on Flavius Josephus.

In these he writes about Jewish scholars of the classial world (Bernays Bickermanand Finlay)and well- know representatives of modern Jewish thought( Leo Strauss, Gershon Scholem and Walter Benjamin.). He shows a great appreciation for his fellow scholars. One of the best essays in the book is the introduction written by Silvia Berti.

"This is far from being the best and certainly not the most entertaining or humorous of Roth's novels but it is a work of very great and wise perception of human character and situation. Roth is a master at analyzing complex human situations, and characters. In this work his analysis of the character Eve Frame and her dependent relationship with  her daughter is one of the best parts of the work. This relationship many have suggested the relationship between Roth's former wife the actress Claire Bloom and her daughter. Here what is  quite surprising and interesting is the way Roth on the one hand shows the pathetic quality of this dependent relationship while showing in various other connections the great virtues of the characters.

She was also as this very detailed biography makes clear a tremendously hard- working and devoted actress who put her own work and career before anything else in her life. The story of her leaving her first husband and daughter and going off with director Robert Rossellini was one of the great Hollywood scandals. But this tell-it-all biography indicates that 'scandal' was a small part of Bergman's romantic adventures. Leamer's main contention however is that none of these could compete with her own devotion to career and self.This book will tell its reader more about the details of Bergman's life than they will probably want to know. But it also tells a long and complicated tale of a  person's struggles and transformations in life.It is written with true  narrative and dramatic skill. It gives us a sense of the vulnerability and fragility of even the most 'famous' and celebrated.The great physical beauty was not very beautiful in much that she did. But toward her work she had integrity and dedication.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DQG5TFI7C2HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060154853#wasThisHelpful","R3DQG5TFI7C2HB","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Edge Question series are invariably interesting and original. They bring together usually about one- hundred eighty or so  individuals most of whom are experts in some scientific or technological area. They provide an opportunity for rich speculation. The question 'What should we be worried about?' is no exception to this.If any reader thought they had a full understanding of the problems humanity is facing this collection should disabuse them of  that notion. It is possible to take tens of examples and illustrate this but I will take two only - the answers of Martin Rees and John Touby.They both talk about possible catastrophic scenarios that could eliminate humanity. Rees speaks about the possibility of a few wicked individuals being able to create viruses there is no way of stopping. Touby makes a long list of cosmic events, from gamma ray bursts to supernovae events which could lead to disastrous consequences for humanity.This  question and its answers like the others in this series provide an intellectual feast, a whole menu of material to think about.The problem is of course that there are so many worries that one has difficulty knowing which are most important to worry about.Another problem is that worrying (At least the worrying that most of us do) will not help provide any answers to the problems.To illustrate the fact that no thought about humanity and human history can be complete I will point to the fact that one of the world's major worries these days, the disintegration of the Middle East, and the ongoing violence between Shiites and Sunnites which is accelerating that disintegration is not even mentioned in this volumeHowever great and varied the worries are given in this book there are no doubt new and surprising ones to come. This by the way is a thought a number of those included in this volume-mention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AJAVP57THYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEGJ59O#wasThisHelpful","R28AJAVP57THYI","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with many memoirs of the Shoah one cannot read this work without wondering what it is to be a human being, without wondering how human beings can be so cruel and evil, without wondering how other human beings can endure horrors and yet remain truly caring and good people. Zev Birger tells the story of his happy childhood in Kovno with his harmonious family two loving parents and an older brother friend. He tells how their world is shattered by the Nazi takeover and formation of the ghetto.He tells of the struggle for survival  in the most inhumane conditions, of his family's trying to stay together, of his losing one by one first his mother then his father then his brother. He tells the story of how he survives the cruelty of the work- camps and the death- camps. He tells of extraordinary incidents of courage, and of one anonymous 'boss' of his who helped him survive through illness. He tells of his liberation by the American Army, his recovery and working with them in the war's aftermath. He tells the story of his meeting with the woman who would become his wife, and the decision to come to Eretz Yisrael.He gives us a picture of how his Zionist and hume ideals helped him and his friends survive. And he relates the story of the new life he makes in Israel and his contributions to the society and world being built there. There he would become an important government official and at some point becoming the movie spirit of the Jerusalem International Book Fair.This is a chilling read a heartbreaking read and yet too evidence of greatness in bearing and overcoming affliction, in working for and loving the good. Birger suffered much from the inhumane treatment of others but never lost his essentially positive and constructive nature. He lost a world, and found and helped build a new one. He lost a loving family and made in Israel a new family of his own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309QF0786EKJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557043868#wasThisHelpful","R309QF0786EKJQ","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eileen Simpson the first wife of the poet John Berryman tells the story here of their meeting and their marriage,  and of  their time spent with the  many poet  friends of their youth. Berryman's closest friend in the early days was the legendary Delmore Schwartz. But Berryman had other important literary friends Robert Lowell and his wife the writer Jean Stafford, Theodore Roethke, Randall Jarrell. Saul Bellow .An atmosphere of adventurous exploration is part of the story, but the greater part is desperation and loss. Simpson  details her difficulty with Berryman's drinking and suicidal impulses, and explains her decision to leave him despite their mutual love. She re-echoes a theme of Schwartz on the sufferings wives of poets seem to necessarily be overburdened with. She has a generous attitude to others and the story of her relationship with Berryman is written in a moving and credible way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L7EICHO6AS8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374235597#wasThisHelpful","R3L7EICHO6AS8T","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is about a war being conducted against Israel and the Jewish people. It is not a war of one single power or source, but rather of many different sources, the `million cuts of the book's title. It is a continuation of war of Nazi Germany which attempted to annihilate every single Jew on earth. This present war does not however focus on destroying individual Jews, but rather aims at destroying the representative and heart of Jewish collective identity, the state of Israel.Manfred Gerstenfeld who is the world's leading expert on European anti- Semitism has in this present volume provided a detailed map of those who are engaged in this campaign of hatred and destruction. While pointing out that the decisive stage of such a campaign would have to be military he indicates two prior stages the first of which is already well under way. The first stage is the total defamation of the state of Israel, the attempt to paint it as the greatest threat to and Evil now facing mankind. This campaign has been waged now for many years, and certainly one major element in this has been the United Nations. Of the over one- hundred eighty countries in the world the one which has been subject to over half of its resolution of condemnation is Israel. Engaging in the kind of inversion of reality which is characteristic of the world- wide anti- Semitic campaign democratic Israel is time and again accused of crimes its totalitarian enemies commit against it.Still the most powerful source of violence against Israel is from the Islamic and Arab world. Here one can point to more than fifty years of anti- Semitic propaganda and hate- messaging. The massive influx of Islamic immigrants to Western countries has given new strength to traditional European anti- Semitism.In the West however there is a development so absurd and hypocritical so frightening that it leads one to wonder what has happened to common sense and common human decency. It is not only the traditional Fascist right, and Islamic fascists who have focused on vilifying Israel it is also their worst enemies the Progressive forces of the Left who have joined this campaign. Those who should support Democracy, human rights, equality, religious freedom, freedom of speech and expression, equality for women, have united with and are supporting the most reactionary and murderous Jihadi forces on earth.Hypocrisy in the West in joining the campaign against Israel is also displayed by other groups .Gerstenfeld devotes separate chapters of his books to other sources of the hate- war. There are chapters on the Media, Social Democrat inciters, Christian inciters including NGO's those engaged in Lawfare against Israel, Academic promoters of boycott against Israeli scholars.The effort to boycott and exclude Israel and Israelis from cooperative and productive effort in all areas of political economic social and cultural life is another major aspect of campaign of destruction. Gerstenfeld makes a strong argument for a counter- campaign which would be promoted by a special Israeli government office aimed at countering such efforts. He believes that the Israeli government and people have not taken the threat of boycott seriously often as they have focused on what has been the greater and more immediate danger, the various military challenges Israel has faced through the years.An Israeli offensive strategy which makes skillful use of the new media is for Gerstenfeld a sine qua non for winning the battle.Thus Gerstenfeld also devotes much space to showing how the Internet and modern means of communication have facilitated the spreading of Hatred. Another reason why there are 'a million cuts'is that the haters can so easily distribute their lies. And Lying as Gerstenfeld repeatedly points out is an absolutely  essential element in the war against Israel.He also indicates albeit indirectly how this how Culture of Lying and Hate so pervasive today constitutes a threat first of all to Israel but also Democracy and human decency for humanity as a whole.The book is powerful and wide-ranging and truly displays the extent and danger of the war of defamation now taking place.It is a must read not only for those who care about the Jewish state but for all those who care about the future of humanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4KEHLDPFJUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618613413#wasThisHelpful","R1M4KEHLDPFJUW","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his introduction to this book Francis O'Gorman describes a number of systematic theoretical approaches to the subject which he refrains from using. Instead he tells us that he is going to grope his way to an understand of a very commonplace and common reality which a great share of humanity lives and suffers with. As a great worrier myself I appreciate very much the attention he gives, and the insight he has on the subject. Take one thing which has always bothered me. Perhaps it is because I am a traditional religious person. But I am always worried that if I do not worry the thing I do not worry about will happen. O'Gorman explains that this kind of need to worry as a kind of sacrificial payment to prevent the thing worried about from happening is also most commonplace. Worriers worry that if they do not worry they will be punished for not worrying.Worriers as we all know also waste enormous amounts of time tormenting themselves and others with needless worries. They also often discover problems which others ignore. Worry can also help.This is a book which I believe will help most readers better understand ourselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232ZEL6Y4U1X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144115129X#wasThisHelpful","R232ZEL6Y4U1X0","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nabokov is one of the most brilliant stylists Literature has known. Every sentence of his contains a surprise. His  descriptions are metaphorically rich, and make everything he perceives more than it is. This is true of Nabokov as storywriter as well as novelist.His stories are less well-known and satisfy less. This particular collection is rich in stories of disaster, and disappointment.The opening story 'Spring in Fialta' is the story of a married man's affair with an elusive and unfaithful lover. The stories which most impressed me were 'Signs and Symbols' and 'The Aurelian'. The first is the story of two parents contending with a mentally- troubled son who they reluctantly bring home from an institution. It is perhaps the only story that I found myself having some real sympathy for the characters. Nabokov is often a cold precise and exacting narrator whose irony and brilliance make it somehow less possible to feel for his characters. Often he himself has ironic distance and seems to simply be playing with them. His surprises in this sense are not simply in his language but in the turns the stories so often unpredictably take. In another favorite 'The Aurelian' a small shop owner dreams of a global- circling butterfly hunting expedition. This story gives insight into the world- famous lepidopterist Nabokov. The story has a disastrous ending which nonetheless seems to point beyond the everyday to a kind of transcendence Nabokov seemed to preserve for the aesthetic imagination.These stories are set in the thirties and they contain tales of exile, and violent displacement. Nabokov showsin them his anti- Fascist and anti- Communist , his anti- totalitarian sympathies. A supreme individualist with an elite sense of all that is wondrous in sensual reality he time and again brings the reader to amazement at his  literary genius.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYE1GKK2GXW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140014934#wasThisHelpful","R1SYE1GKK2GXW8","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pnin is in many ways my favorite Nabokov book. Its bumbling awkward humorous endearing hero is the Russian expatriate teaching at an American university. At his core he is a person of great integrity and intelligence who carries with him a weight in suffering from his European past. Pnin is a vulnerable suffering and generous hero. He is manipulated by his former wife Erica Wind but his love for her persists. In his frequent recollections the story of his love for Mira Belochkin a Jewish woman murdered in the Shoah is revealed.Pnin is kind to a stepson who he treats as a son. .The language here as always with Nabokov is brilliant but I found it clearer and more understandable than in some of the more famous American works.This is the work that introduced Nabokov to the United States and first firmly established his reputation in it.To my mind there is no more purely enjoyable Nabokov work than this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CTKF8UNOPZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038000819X#wasThisHelpful","R8CTKF8UNOPZS","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rabbi Shlomo Riskin is one of the most important  figures in the Jewish world today. His contributions to the Jewish people and Israel are by this time legendary, from the work he did in Lincoln Square Synagogue to the work done in Israel, founding the city of Efrat and the whole network of Ohr Stone Torah religious institutions. He has done courageous work in many other areas including work for the liberation of Soviet Jewry, and for the enhancement of women's role in religious life.Rabbi Riskin is a popular speaker and columnist, writer and thinker. In this work he touches upon a whole list of subjects which are at the center of Jewish life today. For instance in the question of whether it is religiously permissible to cede parts of the land of Israel in order to make peace he distinguishes between an ideal situation and today's present reality. In a situation where there would be a true partner for Peace compromise he suggests is permissible. But given the reality at this present historical juncture he sees that ceding of land now would now save lives but rather endanger Israel itself.Rabbi Riskin in each of the essays uses his deep knowledge of Gemara and traditional Jewish learning to address questions such as "" Authority versus Autonomy: On Parents and Children,Masters and Disciples,  Who's an Apikoros?  Aguna Problem in our Time, Women and the Torah Scroll, Judaism and Democracy, the Significance of Israel's Return to Zion: Tikkun Olam.This book is a treasure of Jewish thought for all those who care about the Jewish situation today. It could not be more highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QDWH0IG1JJVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592644082#wasThisHelpful","R1QDWH0IG1JJVZ","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pearce begins by taking on the gloom of Malthus ( and Paul Ehrlich) and points out that in many areas of the world population is in decline. He does extensive traveling to investigate what is going on in population development in many different parts of the world. His writing on the subject is informed and detailed. I checked this in regard to one area of the world I know best, Israel. His writing on the ultra-Orthodox community and its unusually high - rate of population growth is by and large fair and judicious. As Pearce believes the true villain in the ecological struggle for a  better planet is consumption rather than numbers alone, he is not particularly critical of the Hasidim. After all they are generally very poor, value spiritual attainment rather than material attainment and so are not great consumers. For Pearce the ecological problem comes from that seven percent of the world's population that consumes fifty percent of its product.As he sees it not only in Europe but also in China, India, the Americas population growth has either slowed down or gone negative. The one continent where it continues at a  rapid rate, Africa, is the continent of poor people and low consumption.This book is valuable in the detailed picture he gives of dozens of local fertility and demographic developments.His generally optimistic view is that a world which has a more middle- aged older population will be a wiser one. These elderly people will have to work for more years but they will be encouraged in this by their improved medical situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GXJOOAZFCPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807001228#wasThisHelpful","R35GXJOOAZFCPM","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In writing this work Tuvia Tenenbom  displayed a remarkable amount of initiative, energy and courage. A Jew living in Germany who was born in Israel he presents himself as a German Christian so as to be able to speak openly with Palestinians of all different stripes. His disguise also helps him sometimes in speaking with Israelis. The fundamental finding of his work is the enormous prejudice, and even hatred held by the Palestinians for the Israelis. He also reveals the superficiality, the historical ignorance and the hypocrisy of many of the Palestinians. Foremost among them is Hanna Ashrawi who does everything to try and get out of explaining why the Christian population of Ramallah and Bethlehem has disappeared, and why the Muslim majority tolerates no one with a different religion.But Tenenbom is  also highly critical of Israelis both of the Left -Wing and the Right. Perhaps his  most fierce criticism is for Benedict Arnold-like creatures such as Gideon Levi and Uri Aloni who without speaking any Arabic and so knowing Palestinian culture in any significant way nevertheless have devoted their careers to stigmatizing Israel and worshipping the Palestinians.Tenenbom does meet people he respects, but overwhelmingly his interlocutors are shown to be fanatical and hate- filled.He too has special venom for the European would- be-do-gooders especially the Germans who constantly work to undermine Israel.Tenenbom has an unusual sense of humor which is at work throughout and which very occasionally got a laugh out of me. The book is long but is an easy read , a piece of colloquial journalism.My great reservation about the book regards the kinds of people he spoke with on the Israeli side. He does not really get to a broad- section of the people but focuses on extremists from both sides. He underestimates it seems to me the strength of Israel's people though he often expresses admiration for the accomplishments of the Jewish state.I have lived in Israel for close to forty years but I nonetheless learned quite a bit from this work.This is an amusing take on a very sad and difficult situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28N2T9L3TD7YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9652297984#wasThisHelpful","R28N2T9L3TD7YY","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book's title is misleading. It is not 1001 books from all areas of the world of books. It does not contain non- fiction. It does not contain the great religious classics of humanity. It focuses very much on imaginative literature from the year 1800 or so. It contains a disproportionate number of British works. It mixes up works of enormous value and significance with minor works very few have heard or will ever hear of. It does however try very hard to describe the works in a positive way, show their unique value. It too includes a vast variety of literary works from throughout the world.I used the book not only to refresh my memory of books I have read but also to learn about books that I had heard of, and was curious as to the character of. The book is enjoyable and interesting in this way. However I would again protest against the notion of 'must read before you die'. I have in many years of reading read a small percentage of these works, and there are very few I would call 'must reads'. Why is it always necessary to 'hype' things? This book involved a great effort by its editor who should be applauded for the work done. Most of the entries are very well written and provide information and enjoyment as things in themselves.PS I must add something in strong favor of the book. I have been reading it now off and on and in small doses for about two months. I make discoveries of books that are new for me all the time. I take great pleasure in reading once again about books that I have read and thought about in the past. There is a great amount to learn here.

"This is a survey work consisting on groups of columns on twenty different subjects related to brain science. There is much valuable information provided in each of the sections but there are also far-ranging conclusions and generalizations which are questionable. I found the section on Alzheimer's with its descriptions of various paths to dementia, its account of the seven stages of Alzheimer's, and its sense that at least in one sense it can be seen as a speeded up form of the process of aging- most interesting. Swaab who is a senior neuroscientist in Netherlands contributes to this work the knowledge and understanding gained from a lifetime of study and research on the subject. He does however have biases. His justifiable condemnation of hard contact sports especially boxing, American football and rugby for the brain- damage they cause is overshadowed by his wholesale condemnation of Sport and Exercise in general. His one-sided analysis of religious behavior totally ignores the findings  regarding the beneficial aspects of religious worship. His rightful emphasis on the importance of genetics in determining much about human character and identity becomes at a point a downplaying of the significance of external factors in shaping  human character. But again there is much to learn here about subjects such as human aggression, autism, schizophrenia , addictive substances, puberty love and sexual behavior,sexual differentiation of the brain in the womb, moral behavior, memory. et. al.

"Bret Stephens is one of the world's most astute analysts of American foreign policy. In this book he presents the present day position of America in the world and argues that radical transformation of present day policy is needed. He believes that President Obama has retreated on all fronts and adopted a view of America's role in the world which will lead to disaster in the decade ahead. As he understands it the Obama policy of retreat has enabled forces inimicable to Democracy, and Freedom to advance. Yet his argument is not for an ideological-based kind of foreign policy advocated by the Bush Administration. Rather he proposes that America once again take on the role it  often has been blamed for having, as world's policeman. Stephens shows that the U.S. alone is capable of adopting such a role. He also argues that a more forceful and interventionist when necessary foreign -policy will be to the benefit of others as well as to the U.S. Observing the Iranian takeover of areas of the Middle East, the Russian expansion into Ukraine and potentially other Eastern European areas, the aggressiveness of the Chinese in the South China Sea he argues that all of this has happened in part because of American weakness. He also speaks about the downsizing of American military power and how this presents a danger to future security. In making these arguments he is critical not only of Democratic liberals but also of Republican conservative isolationists. He argues that a strong involved America is good for the world, and be of ultimate benefit to all of Mankind. Only American can do it and if it does not do it he sees more chaos and disaster ahead for humanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C18YL6Q5UWFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846625#wasThisHelpful","R3C18YL6Q5UWFT","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a layman's review of pocket guide to Clinical Medicine which is directed toward health- care professionals. Its language is a mixture of the very technical and the commonplace so a layman can use it to enrich both their medical knowledge and vocabulary. I of course cannot comment on it in professional terms, but as a general leader I find it informative.On the other hand and in another way it is distressing to bit to read through the too rich chronicle of possible human ailments.Almost all of what is written here I believe most laymen would rather not know about.I suppose there are more up-to-date versions of this guide which professionals need not schlep around in book-form but rather have on their electronic reading devices.Sic passit gloria the hardcover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EA6AU652BVJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0702028339#wasThisHelpful","R1EA6AU652BVJ5","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book reveals yet another set of evidence to confirm the general contention that  Abraham Lincoln is American President whose best embodied its democratic values. In detailing the story of Lincoln's connection with the Jewish community of his time,  they also show what a generous, warm, fair- minded and kindly human being Lincoln was. Lincoln never indulged in a common discriminatory attitude of his time toward the Jewish community. He had a number of important Jewish friends including one Abraham Jonas who played a role in moving him toward the Presidency. He cancelled Grant's infamous decree expelling the Jews from the war zone during the Civil War.Lincoln was inspired by the Hebrew Bible throughout his life and its language and concepts inform his writings and speeches.This book is a special treat both for those who take an interest in American Jewish history and for all those who cherish the legacy of Lincoln.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WICI857NIEAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059534#wasThisHelpful","R2WICI857NIEAV","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will cite here only a few of the subjects I especially appreciated her writing about. Her account of her mother's passing from the world, her family history in relation to longevity, the story of her coming out of nowhere and winning the Observer story-competition and in a sense being recognized and encouraged as a writer, her writing about 'mortality' in general, her exuberance in describing the way she reads, the story of her love life and her disappointing great love affair, the joy she found in sexual experience, the pleasure of 'seeing' as she describes it in her travel experience, her vignettes of many different individuals she encounters in her life, her description of her own 'laziness' her description of hunting and how those who hunt somehow know animals best, even those she also deplores the practice.

"Athill is a remarkable writer and a remarkable human being. She sees and appreciates Beauty in life, and enhances the readers sense of life's richness and possibility. She brings her own unique way of seeing and feeling things to all her experience. In  a sense the center of this book is the story of her broken engagement to Paul, the great first love of her life. How this led her to the world of book-publishing, and an independent life is one part of the story. But the story also includes the record of her growing up at her grandmother's estate Beckton in East Anglia, the record of her three gloriously free years at Oxford, the years of working in London with Andre Deutsch in creating a respectable list of books. When she writes about her love of reading, about her experiences in travel she does so with clarity and grace.As a struggling woman largely alone she made one decision she shows no regret for, which I believe she should have, the termination of her only pregnancy. Her way of writing about this I found objectionable.This marred for me what would otherwise seem to be a Masterpiece of Memoir writing","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUU851GKI4YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393338576#wasThisHelpful","RFUU851GKI4YG","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It gives special attention to the tools of cooking and shows how they have altred in history.

Pots and pans have their own history as do forks and spoons. There  is a chapter on the kitchen and its special role in family life. Coffee making too is given in its own special chapter relating on how the once most in-technology of the big machines has been at least in some places superseded by hand technologyWith all this  the book is missing something, and the feeling is it could  be more humorous and pleasurable than it is.

"This book presents an idea and ideal of human aging that is different from the one most people hold. As Anne Karpf most people believe aging begins at a certain specific age, forty, fifty, sixty- five, seventy. In fact we begin aging from conception and our ideas of this aging are transformed in time. The young eager to grow up and have the freedom from restrictions are one pole of this. The young dreading the responsibility of adulthood and wishing to remain in a childhood world are another aspect. Karpf details the dread of going old so pervasive in our culture, and the various means we try to halt or reverse this process. The negative view of aging and the old is she claims very strong in our society. The Aged are those doubly condemned , first for being useless, and second for taking up the resources that the young might use. This view is increasingly prevalent as the numbers of those and percentage of those in our society over the age of seventy increase.Against the negative views of aging so commonly held Karpf argues for a more positive and balanced view. Each age of life according to her as its gains and losses. The benefits of aging can be a new kind of freedom, a freedom to be more truly oneself, a freedom from fear of the opinion of others, a freedom to give one's time and energy to those activities one loves. Without in any way minimizing the difficulties and even horrors that can come with old age Karpf shows how for many it is a most satisfying time of life. Realizing there is an end to come may very well deepen one's sense of life's pleasures and meaning.This  is  a highly recommended, excellently written and important work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XDJBK3Z6WYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230767753#wasThisHelpful","R27XDJBK3Z6WYU","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Heller writes with intelligence and insight about his illness, and about the support he receives from friends and family.There is a no-nonsense realistic quality to the writing. On the other hand the book was hyped as especially funny but I did not find it so.Being funny is different from talking about being funny.I found the book informative but not especially interesting or exciting.

"Athill opens this memoir of her childhood by giving an account of her mother's last days. The Athills or many of them live into their nineties with their mental facilities intact. When Athill comes to see her fading mother, the mother awakes and gives her a tremendous happy smile. Her death is difficult for some hours but is largely a 'good one' surrounded by loving family. Athill then chronicles the story of her childhood in the estate of her grandparents in Suffolk. Wealthy and isolated, closely connected with nature, the love of reading and the love of horseback riding are prominent parts. Athill give a gripping account of her parents' unhappy marriage. She then tells us of her first gropings at romance, and how the world of her imagination develops.She  is a clear, forthright writer whose writing is pervaded by a kind of aesthetic grace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KS52OBKENHD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1847084265#wasThisHelpful","R3KS52OBKENHD0","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wolfe is always interesting.In the opening and title essay of this work 'Hooking Up' he amusingly and it seems to me dismayingly chronicles the new sexual morality that 'liberated' the United States from any sense of moral restraint. He shows how 'everyman and every woman too' has thanks in part to the Internet turned into a kind of hedonistic narcissist. He shows how the lover middle class working America has become more luxurious and corrupt than ancient Rome. He does not however clearly foresee the kinds of economic strain and disintegration that will come to this class, and make it far more unhappy in the years to come.In for me the most interesting essays he writes on  the new Neuroscience and the way Evolutionary Psychology has become the first intellectual fashion. He somewhat exaggeratedly (But what is Tom Wolfe without exaggeration?) refuses to the biologist Edward Wilson as the 'second Darwin'.He tells the story of how Wilson and Marshall Macluhan made use of the cosmic evolutionary vision of convergence made by Teillhard de Chardin. In the course of it he tells the story of the Church's  prohibiting the publication of deChardin's writing and this great man's death alone in a small New York hotel room. He too writes about MacLuhan and his ideas, as well as in one long essay detailing the story of Robert Noyce the  somewhat unheralded pioneering figure of the whole Internet revolution. In the course of this he writes about the small town mores of mid-America and Grinnell College. Wolfe often repeats himself and he more than once exalts Neitzche for having prophetically foreseen the post-modern and post-moral mentality of the twentieth and twenty- first century. Without the restraint of Divine morality and punishment Neitzsche saw humanity as grouping itself into fierce warring mercyless tribes. Instead of Teillhard's convergence in ascenscion there is the precipitous decline into barbaric amorality. Wolfe describes and opines on much of this, also showing great concern about the neuroscientific effort to map the self, and in doing so doing away with the autonomy of consciousness, human freedom and the soul.Wolfe does not go deep in exploring these subjects but is an excellent and enjoyable guide in briefly outlining what is at stake.On more familiar ground for him he in two other essays takes apart two journalistic sacred cows, the New Yorker and the New York times. It is well to remember Wolfe once wrote for the now defunct ""NY Magazine' In another essay he gets his revenge upon three writers Mailer Updike and John Irving who have called him a 'no novelist'. His success in full he thinks is envied by these three to him literary dinosaurs.Again he amuses and entertains and informs and excites the reader. Even if some of it is the same stylistic tics we are long familiar with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GYICZ66JFR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312420234#wasThisHelpful","R35GYICZ66JFR9","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Diana Athill writes with clarity, directness, and modesty about the last chapter of life. She tells the story of the consolations she finds in 'making things' in gardening in driving her car. She speaks about her family's history of longevity and tells us about the ways people she has been close to have died. She relates her own first experience of encountering a corpse.She writes too about her own personal affairs, her romantic and sexual life, the story of her one great romantic disappointment and the more practical attitude she took afterwards. She writes about caring in old age for a long-time friend of hers who was once her lover. She speaks of how she was educated to modesty and how this has stayed with her. She also apparently was educated to competence for she seems to do all she does in a reasonable and clear way. She tells about her religious or loss of religious feelings, and her relation or absence of relation to any idea of an afterlife, or the consolation that might come with it. I feel differently from her on this but at least she does not 'preach' her non-belief but simply and honestly reports it. She writes about a stage of life which there once was little written about but which there is now more and will be much written about. As the world ages and as more and more people face the various crises of longevity the literature on this subject will certainly grow. But this is certainly a respectable contribution to the literature made by someone whose writing clearly deserves the great respect it is given.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE3BGRYXFKHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393338002#wasThisHelpful","RGE3BGRYXFKHU","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a tremendously moving story in this book. It is that of Yitta Schwartz a survivor of the concentration oung children there. After the war and time in Belgium she came to America. As her small Hasidic group had been destroyed she joined the larger Satmar group. When she died she had over two- thousand descendants. In one of the chapters of the book Berger tells the story of her life, a life emblematic of the great Hasidic demographic recovery after near total destruction by the Nazis.Berger's broader purpose is to give a portrait of Hasidism in America. He focuses a lot on one group the Satmar who are in certain ways atypical. He briefly recounts the story of their leader without speaking about his dubious escape during the War, and the leaving of his Hasidim behind. He describes the insular life style of the Hasidism and explains their way of life in largely sympathetic terms. He notes that their rapid growth means that they will be in the future a much larger and important segment of the American Jewish community. He notes that they are already thirty percent of the Jewish population of New York City, and with their numbers doubling every twenty years as the secular community assimilates will constitute a much larger percentage of the total community in the future.He writes too about their conflicts with various governmental bodies related to their own special demands for public services of certain kinds, and this when they have their own independent educational system. He writes of their conflict in upstate New York with poorer populations when the Hasidism who do not use the public school system insist on lower taxes which means poorer education for others. He too writes of their insular and inappropriate dealing with sex offenders in their midst. He shows their insularity often means lack of consideration for the broader  American community. Another element of this is that the male population devoted to traditional Gemara learning has poor command of English and does not have full participation in the work force. At one point Berger contrasts the remarkable success of the broader Jewish community in the past century. They were able to enter and make contributions to almost every area of American life. The Hasidic groups will being so insular make no such contribution.Berger closes with a chapter on the way the Hasidic groups spend their summers in the Catskills. He talks much about Kiryat Yoel near Monticello New York. He again contrasts with this with the very different kinds of Jewish immigrants who populated these areas in the thirties, forties and fifties of the twentieth century. The Hasidim show no hunger for this kind of participation.One senses that Berger has mixed feelings about the Hasidic groups in this regard. I too have concern that the Jewish people not lose itself to living wholly isolated from the world. Self-exile is also Exile.Berger does not really go into this, but another problematic element at least of Satmar Hasidism is their negative relation to the Jewish state. Here too the question is of whether a group wholly focused on its own need , oblivious to the wider community can be truly seen as a positive and beneficial force.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDE9ZBF2223J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062123343#wasThisHelpful","R3PDE9ZBF2223J","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is Robert McAfee Brown's attempt to describe and present in the most sympathetic way possible the work and message of Elie Wiesel. As a highly respected Protestant theologian Brown makes a genuine and to my mind successful effort to understand the world and experience of one of the most important Jewish witnesses of the Shoah or Holocaust. He speaks of Wiesel's being a messenger for the dead victims, as being the one who tells their story and in this sense keeps them alive. He speaks of Wiesel's being a messenger to the living in teaching the consequences of the Shoah and in warning against Man's inhumanity to Man in the human future. He shows how Wiesel has been an important witness to other human tragedies, a spokesman for those seeking to prevent future evils. He speaks of Wiesel's being a messenger to God in questioning contending and arguing with God. He shows how Wiesel is first and above all a storyteller and a seeker, one who believes more in the questions than in the answers.And in showing this kind of sympathy and understanding , Brown too reveals his own deep humanity.This is in a sense a work of literary criticism but in another way it  is a religious one, and one whose message is not for the Jewish people alone but for humanity as a whole.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MTU5UDSLM4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0268009201#wasThisHelpful","R21MTU5UDSLM4U","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was published in 2003. Much has happened in the world of Hillary Clinton since including her Senate term, her unsucccessful run for the Democratic nomination  for the Presidency, her serving as Secretary of State. What is interesting is that in all these roles she has been true to the picture given of herself in this memoir. She is responsible, competent, clear-thinking and principled. She is forthright and assertive, and she deals with problems rather than running from them.She is also methodical straightforward and without tremendous charisma or charm. She is a hard- working politician and this memoir is filled with stories of her actions and decisions.  If I compare it to the autobiographical memoir of the candidate who defeated her for the nomination and later became her boss, it is clear that he is the far better writer and storyteller. As she apparently hopes to be the candidate for the Democrats in 2016 and eventually the President it is to be hoped that if elected she would do a better job  than he has done.In this memoir we learn of her childhood, her relation with her parents, her acquiring of political and religious principles. We learn of her education at Wellesley and Yale, her meeting with and relationship with her husband, their years in Arkansas, when he becomes a popular governor, loses an election , makes a great comeback. We learn of the way she has dealt with the various scandals regarding herself and her husband. We learn of her being a real people person who expresses by and large positive evaluations of a very wide circle of people. She is very smart, and also savvy politically. We also learn about her handling crises, both family and political. She says her role as mother has been most important to her.The book is not an exciting read but an important one if one wishes to know about the person who may well become the most powerful person in the world, and the first woman President of the United States.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2FV2YV41RH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144237554X#wasThisHelpful","R3B2FV2YV41RH4","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the last volume of Leonard Woolf's biography.It centers on the period after his wife's suicide but does include a description of the conditions leading to the suicide, and reflections on his wife and his work. However most of this work involves description of Woolf's own work, especially his managing and directing Hogarth Press. Here his relationship with his some time business partner John Lehmann is given extensive analysis.Woolf includes in the book  a copy of his wife's most moving suicide note. She thanks him for the great happiness they have had together and tells him that no one could have been a better husband than him. Clearly she considered him and wished to free him of any guilt for her decision.Woolf details the horrible period leading up to the Second War and the destruction of the bombing of Britain. The desolation of this time clearly had a major effect on Virginia Woolf.Woolf gives a quite amusing account of his work-life detailing the many hours he spent. He attributes his work ethic to the example of his father and his father's drawing his strength from the Jewish religious tradition. Woolf was I believe the most prominent Jewish figure of the Bloomsbury group. He relates to his own Jewishness with understanding and pride. He is not religious but values the Jewish religious tradition and what it has given humanity in terms of standards of morality and justice. And in fact it is his sensitivity to injustice which is clearly the strongest motivating factor of his work life.He shows understanding of his wifes work arguing that the straightforward, fact -anchored works , the biographies for instance limit her imagination. And that her freedom of imagination was much greater in the works focusing on inner worlds and consciousness.Woolf in quite modestly evaluating the good done by his work life sees it as very little. He does not mention that posterity values him not for his own business or political activity but for being the nurturer and supporter of one of the twentieth century's major writers.One more point. Woolf has a very cordial and modest tone. He writes about himself with competence and it seems to me objectivity.A good person who enabled a great one to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72U1KB6ECCZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=015646523X#wasThisHelpful","R72U1KB6ECCZN","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Herb Keinon has been a writer for the Jerusalem Post for over thirty years. In between his writing on political and diplomatic matters he has written lighter pieces usually related to his family story. It was the story of American immigrants in Israel and the kinds of adjustments and surprises they found here. Keinon collects in this book these domestic columns and groups them in  four sections, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. In these columns there is a lot of comparison between American and Israeli realities and social customs. There is also much written about the differing perceptions of Keinon and his wife's generation, and that of their Israeli native born children. Many of the experiences written about here will be familiar to Israelis , including the major one of worrying about one's children in the Army. Keinon 's voice is a quite calm and normal one.It is as if he is showing despite the wars and struggles there is nonetheless ordinary life going on in Israel, in which many of the same problems families face everywhere are faced here. A very pleasurable read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPBOSXFKQWTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496089510#wasThisHelpful","R2UPBOSXFKQWTG","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a very rich collection of essays that focus on the attempts to boycott and sanction one state out of the world's close to two -hundred the state of Israel. Its first section deals with the general  question of academic boycotts and why and how they oppose the first principle of academic life i.e. freedom of inquiry and investigation. Open dialogue in search of the truth. Martha Nussbaum makes a strong defense of academic freedom using a case in the India province of Gujurat as extreme example.. Paul Berman writes of the century long story of  economic boycotts against Israel. In her essay Emily Bucick shows the absence of proper academic values, the failure to do proper research and pay respect to the facts displayed by supporters of the Boycott. At their heart has always been an effort to delegitimize and ultimately destroy Israel.And in fact many of the essays show the false face of the BDS movement. It claims to be a human rights movement but in fact is not a supporter of two states for two peoples, but rather aims at destruction of Israel. Its ideology is one which denies any national or even human rights to the Jewish people. It is in fact an anti-Semitic movement as some of the essays in the last section of the book clearly establish.The book has over thirty essays in four sections. There is a tremendous amount of information on Israel , on the experience of academics in Israel, on the whole character of the Middle East conflict, on the aims of the boycotters and the forces in the world which support them.The book also provides a history of what has actually happened throughout America in terms of the various boycott resolutions. They have had some success in undergraduate resolutions but none at at all in leading to institutional boycotts of Israel.This book is a must read for all students not only of the Middle East, and Israel, but of all those who care about academic  freedom , and in fact human freedom in general.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163LLZY97OT39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990331601#wasThisHelpful","R163LLZY97OT39","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This anthology focusing on the last days of Socrates contains the Platonic Dialogues 'Euthrypho' 'Apology' 'Crito' and 'Phaedo'. Plato tells the story of the last days of his teacher and hero, Socrates. Socrates in defending himself against charges of corruption shows a courage in the face of death, and a moral integrity in standing for the Good in spite of the price he will pay for it. In 'The Apology' he makes a statement of defense for himself which involves his admitting his uncertainty as to what  is to come after the grave. This  is in true keeping the model of wisdom that he has presented and been condemned for . For this most wisest of Athenians is deemed so for repeatedly breaking down the mistaken certainty and false assumptions. The great questioner who knows that he does not know for certain, whose wisdom is an understanding of the limitation of wisdom provides an example of intellectual and moral integrity that still resonates with us today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OOA4NT50OPXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140449280#wasThisHelpful","R1OOA4NT50OPXI","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her preliminary remarks Daphne Merkin tells of her adolescent dream of having long luncheon conversations with famous yet broken inside figures who she would heal and be healed by.In this collection of her essays, and book -reviews she may not achieve the healing but conducts the meetings and makes of them especially interesting and probing encounters. She writes with great intelligence and perception about a whole list of diverse characters  Marilyn Monroe Virginia Woolf Alice Munro , Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath John Updike Michael Jackson, Henry Roth Princess Diana .Forty-six pieces in all are in the collection with the literary world and the Hollywood world especially well represented. She writes too very candidly about herself , her lifelong struggle with depression, her own particular struggles within and without her family.

"I have not read the award-winning historical fiction of Hilary Mantel. She has a huge reputation and so my expectations for this collection were very great. I was disappointed. The stories are competently done and not without interest, especially'The Heart without Warning' a story of a dysfunctional family trying to help an anorexic daughter. Also the opening story 'Sorry to Disturb' with its detailing the confines of life in Saudi Arabia also was of interest. The title story on the other hand which involves the relationship between a wealthy householder and an IRA gunman who comes to assassinate the British Prime Minister did not really grip me. There are surprising endings in the story and a smooth surface of narrative but I missed deep feeling , strong love of character, humor, and a deep connection with the struggles of life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KIAL69ICTFIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792104#wasThisHelpful","R2KIAL69ICTFIF","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This look at the cultural and social meaning of a decade was actually written in the decade following it. Dickstein sees the sixties as a transformational decade in American  life and surveys its meaning in poetry and fiction, in politics and journalism, in the general social life of the United States. In doing this he mixes his analysis with autobiographical experiences and reflections, indicating his own inherent conservatism opened up to many of the new developments in the Age. The transition from the staid conformist fifties to the radical sixties is one which left in Dickstein's analysis a lasting effect on American culture. For the idea of the all importance of 'personal self- fulfillment' which was a leading idea of the Sixties has  persisted in American life. Dickstein is at his best in his analysis of Literature, and I found the chapter on Rock Music a bit shaky, though I am no means a maven myself in this area. He writes with clarity and perception, and for those interested in knowing about this tumultous decade in a deeper way this book is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUQP2XL9IJ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465026311#wasThisHelpful","R1PUQP2XL9IJ7W","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Borges first collection of stories. It is clear that he is searching to define his distinctive voice. And yet that voice is in this collection and the unique way he combines his vast knowledge with his imaginative power of recreation his evidenced already in the opening tale 'The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell'. In the very first page he takes one event' a scheme for importing blacks , so that they might languish in the hellish workpits of Antillean gold mines and from what he ironically calls 'this odd philanthropic twist' imagines there has come endless things from W.C. Handy'sblues to the mythological dimensions of Abraham Linoln, the five hundred thousand dead of the Civil War and its three thousand three hundred millions spent on military pensions' etc. The fabulous conconting of strange realities from high life and low, from history and daily life give the sign of a remarkably unique writer. The  collection might seem uneven with certain tales 'Monk Eastman Purveryor of Iniquities' and 'Streetcorner Man' being more interesting than others. But for me any Borges work is a source of interest and real entertainment.  As Kierkegaard once indicated there is a kind of writer who even the errors of become part of the composition and bring to it revelatory delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9V441D6DZL5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525226702#wasThisHelpful","R9V441D6DZL5L","AHD101501WCN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHD101501WCN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heidi has the perfect husband. Tucker is kind, loving, honest and he loves her unconditionally. In fact, he loves her so much he invites her fantasy, rocker Ransom Reed into their bed for a scorching hot night she never dreamed would happen. Only that one night makes Heidi realize just how much she wants more. It also makes it even more obvious there are problems in their marriage. Not to mention Ransom wants more of Heidi as well.I enjoyed this book, yet I had mixed feelings about it. I hated that Tucker was being hurt by Heidi's obvious feelings for another man. He loved her so much he'd give her anything, even another man. While Heidi fought with her conscious over what she should or shouldn't do - I didn't feel like she fought hard enough. I also felt sorry for Ransom. He was a lonely man who had everything but the one thing he truly wanted. I felt Heidi used him as much as she did Tucker.The last chapter hints at the next book in the series. I hope he'll get the HEA he deserves. As an added bonus, it was good catching a peek of Justice again from Taint.

Their relationship is moving forward and Celia is becoming more comfortable in her own skin.  She and Jack are seriously considering Elle and Drew's proposal to be watched versus being the watchers.  It's obvious Jack will do anything to make Celia happy -- but how far will he go and at what expense to himself?Jack adores Celia and genuinely cares about her feelings.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that Celia is willing to be as unselfish.  In this volume she appeared to lack maturity and I'm concerned her actions may cause problems.

"This is one of those great stories that you need to read to truly appreciate all the twists and turns and secrets. I'm not really sure how to write this review without giving away too much, and I don't want to do that because it'll take away from the suspense and enjoyment of the story.Erika has been in love with Michael for as long as she can remember, only he acts as if she doesn't exist. She finally gives in to the pressures of their families and agrees to date Trevor, his younger brother. But she doesn't feel anything for Trevor but friendship and eventually breaks up with him.Micheal and his best friends Kai, Will and Damon are known as the four horseman. They're all from rich families and get away with doing things most people wouldn't. Michael has always been aware of Rika but stayed away because of her age and the desire to keep her safe. One night Michael ignores his rule and brings Rika along with his friends for their night of pranks. One night changes everything and sets the events of this book into motion.Corrupt takes you on a slightly dark and suspenseful ride switching back from the present to that night three years ago. Revenge is a strong emotion that can turn your heart black. It's also an emotion that each person handles differently and you see this first hand in Corrupt.I loved Michael! Hot, broody, mysterious. No matter how bad he tried to act, I still loved him and saw behind his mask. Rika was both stupid and brave with her trust, but under the circumstances I understood each of her decisions. She just couldn't fight that pull.I really enjoyed this book. I loved all the secrets and trying to figure out what would happen next. The secondary characters will keep you on your toes wondering who you should or shouldn't like and trust. It's a game of sorts where the winner continues to play and the loser taps out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTC31M8CW224F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0181ONKDU#wasThisHelpful","RTC31M8CW224F","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! What an amazing story. I loved Raze, book one in this series, and was honestly a little skeptical as to whether or not I would like this book as much.  I was so wrong!! I loved it equally as much as Raze and cannot wait to get more in this series.You'll remember that Luka/Raze made a promise to his friend 362/Anri when he was forced to kill him in the cage. Luka swore to get revenge on his friend's behalf by killing the man who killed 362's family. When Luka discovers that his friend had a twin who is being drugged and forced to kill, Luka rescues him and takes him to the family beach house in hopes he can be saved. Although Luka's sister Talia is there, he knows she will be safe with her guards protecting her.  Luke never expected his sister to fall for him.212/Zaal is a broken man. He's been drugged, beaten and treated horribly for over twenty years. All of his memories have been tortured out of him, and he knows now is how to kill when Master speaks the order. When he awakens in a dungeon, he doesn't realize that he's been set free. As the drugs start to wear off, Zaal is captivated by the beautiful woman who comes to his cell.Talia is a strong character and being Luka's sister and the crime boss' daughter, she's a true mafia princess. Taking a trip to the beach house, Talia is planning on relaxing and enjoying a vacation - until Zaal is brought there. Day after day she watches him until she finally makes the decision to go in his cell and tend to him. His eyes capture her and she notices that her touch calms him.  Both of their life's will now be changed - but for good or bad?My heart broke for Zaal. I simply cannot imagine how someone survives what both he and Luka were forced to endure. It just saddens me. Yet both Zaal and Luka were similar in that they still had a tiny part of themselves still alive inside just begging to be shown a slimmer of kindness. Kisa did it for Luka in Raze.  Talia does this for Zaal in Reap. She's exhibits bravery and forces her guards to back down so she can gain Zaal's trust. Watching them fall in love pulled at my heart strings and was beautiful. You cannot help but hope that they can find some way to be together.I loved that Luka played a major part in this story, and another added bonus was getting to see Kisa again and seeing first hand that she and Luka are doing great. I'm loving how these characters are coming together and how the story is progressing, and I cannot wait for the next book in this series. The hint we are provided at the end proves the next book will be just as exciting.This was truly a wonderfully emotional story about finding your one true love and never giving up no matter what.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDXR2486SNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5LN4#wasThisHelpful","RZDXR2486SNZ","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifth book released in the Stripped series. Unfortunately I didn't like it as much as the others and I've been waiting on Ivan's and Candy's story knowing there was something going on. It starts with Candy having just been rescued by Ivan when she was a sixteen year old runaway from the religious community/cult where she was raised. Since then, she has lived with Ivan where he has protected and provided for her. Everyone assumes there is more to their relationship, however that doesn't happen until Candy starts trying to leave - only to be brought back. At the same time it appears Candy's past has found her and Ivan does what he has to in order to keep her safe.I liked Ivan's character. He's cold and quiet, but he's been that way from the start. Yet when he's with Candy, he's softer in a dark and brooding way. He opens up about his childhood which in turn allows us to see why he has such a strong wall built around him. The only person he allows inside is Candy.Candy is another story. I got sick of being in her head and listening to her whine. She's nineteen I believe at the point of this story and has been working as a stripper at Ivan's place. There is no way she is as naive as some of the scenes depict. I did feel sorry for her, but she pushed away everyone who cared about her, so it was hard to feel anything for her but annoyance.On a good note, Clara's and Gio's story will be next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11046ED512CO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R11046ED512CO6","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Elena married her high school sweetheart Dominic, she never realized he'd end up being such a hateful man. He is constantly saying hateful and degrading things to her and has caused Elena to think she doesn't deserve better. When Dominic ends up not having the cash he owes the loan shark he's bored money from, he trades Elena for three months. Ashton is astounded that any man would treat his wife that way and only allows the trade to happen in order to teach Elena she's worth more. During the time Elena spends with Ashton, they get closer and closer and both fall for the other. What will happen when the three months are over and Dominic makes it clear he wants his wife back?I loved Ashton. He may be a loan shark, but he also owns several restaurants and was a great man. He cares for Elena immediately and did everything he could to teach her how beautiful she was and show her the ways a woman should be treated. Poor Elena had been brainwashed by her husband and thought everything she did should be for him. What's sad is that you know there are really relationships that exist like that.This was a standalone story where Elena slowly learns about herself and what she's worth. It was a story about finding love where you least expect it and for Elena about second chances. It's told from dual POVs and has a happy ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46LATW2G1MKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017EKHROA#wasThisHelpful","R46LATW2G1MKX","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack's mother is killed when he is only nine years old. Her dying wish was for him to agree to take care of his younger brother. He's thrust into the terrible world of sex slavery. Unspeakable things happen to Jack throughout the years, but he does it all to keep his brother safe. At the age twenty-seven he's saved by River and her friend Adam. Her father ran a slave business and since his death, River has made it her life's quest to save as many slaves as she can. Both Jack and River are broken souls with emotional scars. Together they are able to heal each other.This book contains a warning indicating that it contains dark material. With slavery being a theme, be prepared for a couple of scenes with non consensual sex.I felt sorry for Jack. I can't imagine what his life was like living where he did for nearly twenty years. It's terribly sad knowing places like this exist in real life. Although River did suffer a lot growing up, it was nothing compared to what Jack went through.

"Belle meets Albie in Vegas right after she learns her fiancÃ© has been sleeping with her best friend/maid of honor for over a year. She and Albie end up spending the entire night riding around, drinking and talking and on a whim are married by Elvis. They never dreamed two weeks later they'd be standing in front of their parents being informed they were going to become step siblings.Albie is a cocky yet very loveable character. He's interested in Belle and gives her a hard time but it's obvious that's he's attracted to her. They're still married and up to that point they had not consummated the marriage. Albie takes every chance he can to let Belle know he's all for correcting that. Belle is an okay female character. She tries a little too hard to push Albie away and her sarcasm and constant denying of her feelings grated on my nerves. It caused her to come across as childish a few times and unfortunately wasn't funny to me. But my sense of humor must be off because a lot more readers enjoyed it. To each their own. There are more hot scenes in this one, but Albie is good at what he does and deserved the page space.Overall it was a cute fast read. As a bonus, another book in this series, Tool, comes with the purchase of this story. I've read it already and it's a good book worth reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RSLJ46V1LGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01770XZC0#wasThisHelpful","R10RSLJ46V1LGO","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Autumn grew up in a troubled family and never knew the identity of her father.  It was common for her mother to date and bring home different men and her siblings were known for causing trouble around town.  In the end, her mother became a drunk who drank herself to death. The only good person Autumn had in her life was her Gran. Autumn went to college, made good grades and left town to make something of herself and to make her Gran proud. When she passes away, Autumn is forced to come back home to small town where she believes everyone thinks she's trash.Jude is the hot and single local doctor who took care of Gran while she was sick. The minute he sees Autumn, Jude feels a possessiveness and draw towards her that he can't shake. He's never been one to have a girlfriend so the feeling is unfamiliar but not unwanted.  The problem is, Autumn doesn't think she's worth Jude's attention. He came from a good solid family with lots of money and Autumn believes he can do better than her. Jude is determined to prove to Autumn she's the woman he wants and that he knows what's best for him.I really liked Jude. He's a great character. Nice and caring, possessive and alpha and so very sweet and tender. He treated Autumn as if she was the only woman in the world. Autumn drove me a little crazy with her I'm-not-good-enough mentality.

She tries her best to fight her own feelings, but the attraction and chemistry between she and Ryland is too strong.There's some drama and suspense and the secondary characters were good. I'd love to see what happens between Jules and Jase if there's another book written. It's told from Jade's POV and I was happy with the ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27HWOMLSR0QWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161Z7LHM#wasThisHelpful","R27HWOMLSR0QWH","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsLara has always adored her father. After graduating college, she went to work with him and is now the CFO of their company, a company which needs to be updated before it goes under. Her father however is old school and set in his ways and doesn't see the need to make the necessary changes. Determined to save the company she loves, Lara turns to the one man she knows can help.Conner is a successful businessman and is interested in Lara and her company. When she propositions him to marry her in order to become a board member for assistance in making good decisions to help save her business, Conner has his own proposition. He'll agree to marry her, but Lara has to agree to be his submissive. It will be a marriage for business yes, but it will also be a marriage of loyalty, honesty and sex. The only thing he doesn't want involved is love. Lara isn't sure how she can do that without her heart getting involved.I really liked Conner. He had a messed up opinion of love because of events that he watched happen to his parents. He's never been in a relationship and he's never loved another woman. The Dom/Sub lifestyle enables him to keep his heart uninvolved. But the more time he spends with Lara, the more he likes her. The closer they get, the easier it is to see them together. He's stubborn and sexy and sweet all rolled up together. The sex scenes are nothing too extreme for those who are uncomfortable reading about this lifestyle.Lara is a great character. She adores her dad and will obviously do anything to protect him and the company he started. She's scared of the feelings Conner brings out in her and terrified by how much she loves the things that Conner is teaching her. Her body responds to just his voice and the more time she's around him, the more she realizes how impossible it will be to keep her heart protected.This is the first of three books in his series. Each are standalones. The other two books will be about Conner's brothers Cade and Nathan. Brand is already released and Boss will be out early 2016. This is the first book I've read by this author and I'm looking forward to reading more.Told from dual POVs and has a good ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22D1EEK15BRA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZJESSO#wasThisHelpful","R22D1EEK15BRA7","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsKade is a Navy Seal home on leave to take care of his grandfather who is dying from cancer. On the day he gets back, he ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time and is convicted of a murder he didn't commit.Harley works as an inmate dog trainer at the prison where Kade is sent to serve his sentence. She's had a crush on him for years and knows he's innocent of the crime he was convicted of. She gets him involved in her dog program and is surprised to learn that Kade has been interested in her since high school. Once his fellow Seals get home, they will do whatever is necessary to prove Kade's innocence and get his named cleared. But the ones guilty don't want the truth to come out and they threaten Harley's life in order to keep Kade quiet. Harley and the Seals have to find proof to get him released before it's too late.Kade is a really great guy. He's fought and served to protect our country and is loyal to all those he cares about. He cannot believe he finally has a chance with Harley and of course wants her safe and protected. He makes his feelings for her very clear and her safety is extremely important to him. He's been through so much and doesn't want to lose anyone else close to him.Harley tried my patience. I'm all for being an independent woman, but her stubbornness and childish actions were annoying. I mean Kade and his buddies are flippin Seals who are trained in taking care of themselves, know what they are doing and have the help of the district attorney to find those responsible. She made stupid decisions and let her pride put her in danger when she should have used her head. Granted it panned out one time when she went searching on her own. But the other times, especially the time with her bossy friend Bette, I was shaking my head thinking train wreck ahead. Personally, I have a hard time when this particular kind of storyline happens where the leading lady seems to lose her brain cells and struts herself around doing whatever she wants when her life in danger. Consequences be damned. Seriously, do these women actually exist? Obviously it was needed for the story to work the way it did - but still...Overall, it was a good book and I did enjoy it. It's told from dual POVs and has an ending that works great. Kade and Harley worked well as a couple and I liked the other two Seals, Kyle and Harley's dad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6ZHORC5JEE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HNX9QO#wasThisHelpful","RL6ZHORC5JEE4","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book two in a series but can be read as a standalone.  I suggest reading book one first because not only is it a good book, but it lets you know in advance who these characters are.Macey is Cameron's sister and Reese is Cameron's best friend.  When Macey was a teenager, she and Reese had a relationship that they kept secret since she was the forbidden little sister.  When she got ready to leave for college, Reese broke it off.  Six years have passed and Macey is back.  She's ready to see Reese again and hopes to start back up where they left off.  Unfortunately, after losing Macey, Reese changed.  He's closed off and doesn't get to close to women anymore.  Seeing Macey again brings back all the old feelings he had and Reese tries desperately to push her away.  Will he finally give in and realize they are each what the other needs?This was a quick read. I liked both characters well enough and was pulling for them to get a happy ending.  Although Reese is a Dom and owns a sex club, the few scenes they share are pretty basic. I liked The Gentlemen Mentor better, but this was an okay story too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A77UXWS45J50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLC73JG#wasThisHelpful","R2A77UXWS45J50","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six years ago Charlie met Ava while helping to start a church in a remote area of Peru.  He was immediately attracted to her and found himself feeling things he hadn't felt in years for a woman.  Charlie is a priest who took a vow of celibacy and has devoted his life to the church.  He knows the way he feels for Ava is wrong, but the draw is too strong.  In the end, he knows that even though he has fallen in love with her, it can never work and he leaves.Six years later, Ava has come to finally confront Charlie.  She doesn't have any idea what his reaction will be, but she has never loved anyone else but him and has missed him terribly.  They are both surprised by their reactions when they meet again.This was a story of a forbidden love that was written in such a way that their falling in love felt nature and right.

"3.5 starsElizabeth experienced a traumatic experience in high school that changed her outlook on life.  Now in college, she no longer believes in love and is content living only half a life studying, working and  making herself believe she's happy with the occasional one-night hookups.  Then she sees Declan.  He's a British hottie with a sexy accent and Elizabeth is instantly attracted to him.  To make matters worse, it's obvious he feels the same way about her.  But Elizabeth just can't risk her heart with someone else and does her best to fight the attraction.  Declan knows there is a strong connection between he and Elizabeth.  She's beautiful and makes him feel things he hasn't ever felt for another girl.  He's protective of her and wants her happy and next to him.  If only Elizabeth would give them a chance.I absolutely adored Declan.  He was such a sweet man and you could tell he genuinely cared for Elizabeth and was struggling with her constantly trying to push him away.  He was a strong character and worked hard at making his gym a success, even though his father wanted him to do something different.  He explained his feelings to Elizabeth more than once and had no problem making himself vulnerable.Elizabeth was a likeable enough character.  We learn in the prologue what happened to her and my heart broke for what she went through.  Unfortunately, my feelings for her never developed.  She drove me crazy with her back and forth and her constantly pushing Declan away.  Earlier in the book when Blake, a guy she'd been friends with since high school, tells her he's in love with her, she ignores him and never mentions it again.  This was pretty much her response to Declan when he expressed his feelings for her.  Her way of coping with everything was to ignore it and pretend it never happened.  Same thing she did with Colby.  I guess it just annoyed me and caused her character to seem immature.Another character I loved was Declan's twin brother Dax.  He's gorgeous, has a wonderful personality, is funny and I can't wait for his story to be released next year.  He needs to meet a feisty girl who'll bring him to his knees.Overall, I enjoyed the book and found it an easy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A9CCJSNOESKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R1A9CCJSNOESKG","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsWhen Juliette's mother died, her father became a drunk, started gambling and basically gave up caring about anything including his two daughters.  When he dies owing the wrong person a whole lot of money, it unfortunately becomes Juliette's debt to pay.  She works three job trying to pay her bills, take care of her little sister and pay the debt she inherited.  Getting the money is becoming increasingly harder and when she doesn't have it, she's given a choice - either her or her younger sister Viola.  Knowing she'll do whatever she has to protect Viola, Juliette goes herself to Arlo.  Just when the unthinkable is about to happen, Killian McClary, the city's Scarlett Wolf walks in.Killian took over his father's business when he was a teenager after both his parents were murdered.  He's feared and has a reputation for punishing those who hurt anyone he cares about.  The problem is, Killian no longer cares about anyone and won't allow himself to get close for just that reason.  When Arlo give him Juliette as partial payment, he thinks it'll be just one night with a women he'll forget the next day.  Only Killian doesn't.  He finds himself thinking about her all the time and finally offers her a deal.  He'll pay off her debt to Arlo if she'll agree to spend the year as his anytime he wants her with the understanding feelings cannot get involved. Hesitantly, Juliette agrees because she knows that Killian is the lesser of two evils. But feelings do get involved - by both parties.  Past threats appear and both Juliette and Killian could lose everything.This was a really good book told from Juliette's and Killian's POVs.  It has romance and sex; danger and secrets; surprising twists and a hot alpha lead character who you'll love one minute and want to strangle the next.  I really liked Juliette and hated that she suffered so much loss in her life.  However the loss that Killian suffered was worse that hers, and I think part of the reason they both so perfect for the other.  Viola is a fun character and I also liked Frank, Killian's bodyguard.Be prepared to spend a little extra time reading because this is a lengthy book.  However, It's well worth it since it's complete and there is no flippin cliffhanger in sight!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VL9AFZ66HU6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014NGXDWS#wasThisHelpful","R3VL9AFZ66HU6Y","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 StarsThis is the fourth book in the Cravotta Crime Family Series, and for a limited time on Amazon, all four books are included when you purchase this one.Luc works for the mafia and ends up spending a year in jail after Claire, the woman he loved, testified against him. Now he's out and the mafia want her dead. But what Luc discovers when he finds Claire is not what he was expecting. It turns out Claire had a huge secret and a good reason for what happened. If only Luc could forgive her, maybe they could work things out. Yeah, right after Luc takes care of the cop from the witness protection program who wants Claire for himself.Loved Luc and understood his feelings completely. I always have issues with women who do what Claire did, but in this case I understood her reasoning somewhat. Luc is a little more bad boy than the other men from this series, so be ready for a little more kink.Overall, I enjoyed it.

"Wow! What a thrilling conclusion to a great story. This is part 2 of King's and Doe's story. Before you read this, you first need to read King to get caught up.I didn't think it could get any better, but Ms. Frazier just blew me away. You just think you love King in the first book. Our boy steps up his game and I fell even more in love with him in Tyrant. He's determined to get Doe back and doesn't mind getting his hands dirty to do it.Doe has finally grown into herself and she's become stronger and more determined to fight for what she wants. I won't give away any spoilers because you have to read this and suffer through the tenseness and racing heart just like I did to get the full effect. I will tell you that at some point Doe starts to remember and there's this one strong memory that was nothing at all what I had guessed would happen. I imagine my mouth was hanging open and my eyes were crossed as I was reading and soaking up the words. Seriously great writing. Did not see that coming for sure!I also fell a little more in love with Bear and cannot wait until we get his story later this year. I know Lawless will be just as great as King's/Doe's and Jake's/Abby's stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ZPY5WVNLY4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGEWUWQ#wasThisHelpful","R17ZPY5WVNLY4I","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I HATE cliffhangers and have actually stopped reading them until the series is complete and I can read the entire story without forgetting parts and having to wait.  That's right ... I'm one of those annoying inpatient readers.  If you're like me, it's safe to get started on this great story because the sequel Tyrant is out so there's no waiting for the ending.King just finished three years in prison and is not the same man he was when he went in.  He has one thought and that's to get Max no matter what he has to do or who he has to hurt.Doe has no idea who she is and remembers nothing about her life when she wakes up badly beaten in a hospital.  When the police are unable to figure out who she is, she ends up living in a foster home but leaves for the streets instead.Doe meets King at a welcome home party his best friend Preppy has thrown to celebrate his release from prison.  It's not a happy meeting and after what happens, Doe ends up in King's possession where for the most part she's offered food, shelter and safety.King is confused about the way he feels about Doe.  He's never done the girlfriend thing or had a relationship.  However he finds himself wanting to be near her as much as possible and spend time with her.  Doe knows she should be frightened of King or probably hate him, yet she's drawn to him and the way he makes her feel.  Unfortunately, there are secrets about both the past and the future that threaten what could be between King and Doe.Doe is a sweet character and I hurt for what she was going through.  I can't imagine waking up not knowing anything about who I am or where I belong.  Doe had to have been terrified living on the streets with no money and no memory.  King is definitely one of those bad boy alpha characters we love we hate.  He could make me mad one minute and then swoon the next. I was right there with Doe going crazy with King's back and forth when it came to his Pup.  Preppy, King's best friend, was a hilarious secondary character who added so much to the story.  He was able to lighten any situation and make everyone smile.  I like Bear's characters as well and am looking forward to seeing what happens next.Yes, there is one heck of a stressful cliffhanger - but as I mentioned above, Tyrant has been released so there is no reason not to start this great book and enjoy.By the way, it was told from both King's and Doe's POV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHTKN1WA0NXFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT5QTJS#wasThisHelpful","RHTKN1WA0NXFA","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack is a member of the Cravotta crime Family and his boss Johnny is trying to work out a peaceful alliance with the MC club they recently were at war with. The MC offer up one of their own for Jack to marry to serve as both an alibi and a peace offering. The chemistry between Beatrice and Jack is just too hot and no matter how hard they try to hate each other, they're unable to fight the feelings they have. When Beatrice gets pregnant, you'd think their happy ending would be smooth sailing, but of course that's not the case. During the war, someone from either the MC or Jack's own family killed his brother and he wont rest until he finds out who it was, especially now that it looks like they're after his wife and unborn child.I liked this book the best of the series so far. Jack was broken by the death of his brother who was the only family he had. Beatrice comes into his life and comforts him before he even realizes that's what's happening. They seem to balance each other and are perfect together. We get more Johnny in this story and there's a number of fairly stressful situations.This story is told in both Beatrice's and Jack's POV and we get one of those endings I love.

He realizes he'll have to step up his game to be worthy of Lexi even if it means changing his lifestyle and career.I just loved Trent.

"3.5 StarsI acquired this book as a bonus story attached to the end of Heat (f/k/a Bang) a purchase I made by this author.Nevada grew up living in a mansion where her mother was the head maid. She's never had much money and struggles to pay for her college. As long as she can remember, Nev has had a crush on Clayton, the boss' son who basically ignored her growing up. Returning home from college, she hopes that Clay will finally notice her now that her body has matured and she's grown up.Clay can't believe how beautiful Nev has become and doesn't understand the protective feelings he now has for her. He sets out to win her, only to discover that she's ignoring and avoiding him. Once he learns she still has her V-card, he's determined that she's going to be his and will stop anyone who gets in his way.I liked Clay although he was a little arrogant at times. But he did grow up with a family worth millions and had people waiting on him, so to me part of his attitude was expected. He changes though when he goes after Nev so I found I couldn't help but root for him to get the girl. I though Nev was seriously naive and I couldn't understand how she was so oblivious to the men who looked at her or wanted her (i.e. situation with Matt). What Nev ends up doing for college money came out of nowhere and I had a hard time believing she'd do that, especially since her mother had to have known.This was an easy read with a HEA and a few heated scenes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144X02Q0AT4I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH1K9QA#wasThisHelpful","R144X02Q0AT4I2","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I acquired this book as a bonus story attached to the end of Heat (f/k/a Bang) a purchase I made by this author. We first met Frannie in Bro, another book released by this author. You don't have to have read Bro to enjoy this story, although characters from that book, Clay and Nev, make an appearance in this story.Frannie comes from an extremely wealthy family but she has never cared about the money. What she wanted was attention from her parents who basically treated her as if she was invisible. Growing up, she was apparently a little overweight and was teased about her appearance. Frannie's therefore shy and has never dated, nor does she realize how beautiful she's become. When her car breaks down, the most gorgeous man she's even seen shows up.Jace is a bright mechanic who has seen his share of trouble over the years. He loves racing cars and as a result is doing community service for getting caught. When he goes on a call for work, he's dumbfounded by his immediate attraction to Frannie. Once he learns she doesn't have a boyfriend, he's determined to make Frannie his. Problem is she has no confidence or experience and can't believe that Jace would be interested in someone like her. He's determined to prove to her how beautiful she is and how much he wants in her life.Jace is a protective alpha from the beginning. He's really patient and kind with Frannie considering her lack of experience and confidence. I liked him instantly and was rooting for him to get the girl. Frannie is very naive for her age (she's graduating college). However, I found myself really liking her and wanting her to open up and trust Jace. The ending is nice with Clay and Nev and I enjoyed seeing them more happy than they were in Bro.Overall, this was an easy, stress free HEA with a little heat thrown in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SS0VM6ZEBTX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3W1A40#wasThisHelpful","R3SS0VM6ZEBTX4","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 StarsCameron is a tattooed MMA fighter with a horrible temper which has gotten him into trouble a number of times throughout the years. He's dad has always been hard on him and nothing he did made him proud. With his family owning a gym, fighting is all he's ever known.When Cameron was younger, his father surprised everyone by marrying his best friend's ex-wife.  Her daughter Victoria pretty much stole his heart at the age of six.  Over the years, Cameron has watched after and protected Victoria. No boy got near her without going through him and those left in bad shape.  Cameron eventually left town because it hurt too much to be around her and not own her.  After six months, he decides it's time and goes back to claim what's his.  It doesn't matter that she's his step-sister, she's just his.  When he gets home, he learns that his father and business partner (Victoria's dad) owe money to the wrong person and have involved Victoria.  He also discovers he might have some competition where Victoria is concerned and plans on proving to her that she's his life.I liked this story well enough.  It got a little long winded at times and is a fairly long book.  Cameron loved Victoria almost to the point of obsession.  He would never hurt her, but he made it clear it was his way or no way.  Victoria was a little naive and didn't have a clear understanding of what her father and Cameron's dad were getting her in to. Although Cameron could be pushy and a jerk, he expressed his concerns for her safety pretty clearly. It was obvious that she was the most important thing in his life.The story is told from both Cameron's and Victoria's POVs which would sometimes switch in the middle of a chapter.  It was confusing at times but I caught on eventually.  It is a standalone and does have a happy ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LT3RI1Z9Z3ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Y9GE5O#wasThisHelpful","R1LT3RI1Z9Z3ZD","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can always count on this author to give you a great story that you'll enjoy and hate that it has to end.Blake is the owner of a tattoo parlor named Blurred Lines.  He has a number of addictions and has been working hard at getting past them.  When Riley walks in his shop wanting her first tattoo, Blake knows there's something different about her.  She calms him in a way no one ever has and being around her makes him want to be a better man.  Doesn't hurt that she's the most beautiful woman Blake's ever seen.Riley recently left an abusive relationship with a man she'd been with since high school and is determined to start living her life for herself.  She wasn't planning on starting anything with another man so soon, but Riley is drawn to Blake and wants to get to know him better. She thinks about him constantly finds excuses to stop by his shop.  Soon, Riley is as addicted to wanting to spend time with Blake as she is with her desire to get more tattoos.  Plus, Blake is gorgeous and makes her feel safe.Blake suffered a major loss when he was a child that resulted in a traumatizing childhood.  My heart broke for what he went through and I was extremely proud of the man he had become.  There is a connection between his and Riley's life which just proves further that they are absolutely perfect for each other.  Additionally, the fact that Riley was strong enough to leave behind her old life with no plans whatsoever, proved she was strong enough to be the person Blake needed in his life.I loved that in addition to meeting these new characters that we also got to see some of our favorite Selected Sinners MC men.  It's nice how the characters all weave together from the different series this author has given us.This was an amazing story of moving forward by accepting and shutting down the demons from your past and finding someone to love and have a wonderful future.  It was really a beautiful story with great characters that I fell in love with instantly.  I hope to see more of Stevie in the future and I'm thinking she'd be perfect for one of those sexy Selected Sinners.Loved it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOY2RBQR9CZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N930YA#wasThisHelpful","RDOY2RBQR9CZL","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We met Cash in the first book Hard, and remember him as a playboy bartender and part owner of the club.  Cash has no desire to settle down with one woman, especially since there are so many that he can choose from each night.  Heâ€™s become good friends with Savannah (Ryderâ€™s girlfriend Cassieâ€™s best friend) and looks forward to the nights she comes in the bar.  It starts with a little innocent flirting, but soon becomes obvious that both Cash and Savannah are interested in one another.  They agree to keep it as a friends with benefits relationship.  Both have secrets and both begin to have feelings for the other they try to fight.I loved Cash and thought he was a hot sweetheart.  I liked Savannahâ€™s character as well and was glad she had a backbone when it came to her past.  I understood the reasoning behind Savannah keeping her secret, but I had trouble believing Cashâ€™s secret was that big of a deal.  Yeah, it was bad I guess, but I just didnâ€™t get it or why he kept it from his friends.  No big deal since it doesnâ€™t take away from the story.Overall, good book told from both Cashâ€™s and Savannahâ€™s POVs.  The epilogue is pretty quick and vague but it does end in a good place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6PPMAEQ4ZCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EHJ71Q#wasThisHelpful","R1C6PPMAEQ4ZCM","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gemma is a woman comfortable with her life. Although a little heavier than most, her parents taught her to be happy with her curves and most of all, to be happy with herself. She works as a chat line operator to men and talks them through their fantasies. She meets Jason on the chat line and they begin an online relationship of sorts. They've never met in person, never spoken by phone and have no idea what the other person is really like. But there's an attraction between them that as time moves on, becomes something more. Jason finally gets a phone number from Gemma and from there he gets her to agree to meet him with Gemma agreeing to be blindfolded to keep it anonymous. But feelings develop and things get complicated. Jason is married, but not happily. It's also public. He has a lot to lose if his and Gemma's secret comes out. Sometimes meeting the right person is worth breaking all the rules.I really liked Gemma. She took a lot of heat and received a number of snide remarks about her weight, but she stayed true to herself and met some great friends who were able to get her to embrace her curves and be proud of who she was. Jason was really a great guy and he never in any way made Gemma feel anything other that wanted. They really were perfect for her each other. As with the first two books in this series, there's some kink and intense scenes. I wished we'd seen what happened to April and Chelsea - I wanted them both run over! Saying they weren't nice is an understatement.Told from both Jason and Gemma's POVs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RDBLSIETOETX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HN8TSY#wasThisHelpful","R2RDBLSIETOETX","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ayden's life changed on the day she turned six years old. In a terrible tragic accident she lost her father, the person she loved most in the world. Now nineteen, her mother reminds her often and harshly that it was her fault. It wasn't of course, but over the years the blame thrown her way from her mother has taken its toll and Ayden believes it. Her birthdays are a harsh reminder of what she lost. On her eighteenth birthday, Ayden approached a handsome man at a bar and lost her virginity to him. They never exchanged names and she never thought she'd see him again. Two weeks earlier she met a younger man who reminded her of him and she had an amazing night. Again no names and she left before he woke up the next morning. Although she's been thinking about the stranger a lot, she doesn't think she'll ever run into him. But life has a way of throwing you curve balls and Ayden had no way of knowing that the two men would be returning to her life. One as her future stepdad and the other as her soon to be stepbrother.Wow! This is an intense, antsy read. Mason is a really great man. He cares for Ayden but obviously also for her mother. It's awkward, but he and Ayden are able to keep their secret. Hunter is another story. He's not happy that Ayden left him the next morning and knows he's not finished with her. The chemistry between he and Ayden is off the charts and he has no problems pushing her boundaries to make it clear he wants her again. The tension between them is so strong you can feel it as you read each page and you know at some point it going to blow, and it's going to blow big.The step sibling thing - although it was there - it wasn't really weird because they met before Ayden's mom was involved and I never got the sibling feel from the characters at all. As much as I loved Hunter, he did make me mad a couple times with reactions to situations, but Ayden did too when she assumed the worst of Hunter without talking to him. Secrets kill and this story will show you that while some are worth keeping, others are not.Overall I really liked this story. You get dual POVs, although most are from Ayden. It also ends at a very nice place which will leave you with a smile. And yes, it's a standalone with no cliffhanger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOXSDWTZFPCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BHRQXK#wasThisHelpful","R1NOXSDWTZFPCL","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a powerful and stressful story.  We only hoped Javier and Luisa were on their way to a happy ending.  Dirty Promises starts out with us discovering that Javier's sister Alana has been killed and as a result, he's treating Luisa horribly and pushing her away.  He believes that loving her and having her near him will be a sign of weakness so he treats her badly instead.  Javier disappoints us further by being unfaithful, although in his mind it's to protect Luisa from his vengeful anger.  But we can't be too quick to judge because Luisa is not innocent of fault either.  Este goes after her hard seeing his chance to be there when she's suffering.  You can't help but wonder if the King and Queen will be standing together at the end.This was an intense and highly emotion book.  KH didn't hold any punches and yet everything that happens in this story was needed in order to get the desired effect and to cause the events that happened.  There is love, there is deceit, there is hatred, there is revenge and there is forgiveness.  Even when I was annoyed at Javier, I still loved him - have from the very first book in this series.  Luisa loses her backbone for a short time, but she gets it back and comes back swinging.This was a great book told from alternating POVs from Javier and Luisa with the occasional chapter from Este.  BTW, I had Este pegged from the beginning and I'll just say there is no love lost there!I understand we may be getting another book in this series which will be about Evaristo.  He was a new character we met in this story and I immediately liked his sarcasm and confident attitude. So hopefully this wont be the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330A0DOVIP0Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D8LL3S#wasThisHelpful","R330A0DOVIP0Q6","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 4 and the conclusion of the Bittersweet series. You need to read the previous books because not only are there spoilers, but the other books tie into this final one and you'll miss important details and not know the characters as you should at this point. This is Sofia's (Marcela's) story about how she came to be Hector's possession and about the years she lived in the Florez mansion.Sofia's real name is Marcela and her sister was Sofia. They take a trip on a super yacht with Sofia's boyfriend Alex and his friend Xavier. For several days the group lounges around, swims and enjoys their time together. On several occasions, Marcela feels as though the others are hiding secrets from her, but she decides to ignore it and concentrate on having fun. This all comes to a tragic end when the yacht is boarded by unwanted visitors. There are deaths, drugs, Marcela loses her name/identity and her nightmare of becoming a cartel leader's slave begins.I felt so sorry for Marcela. She was a wonderful character and even though anyone else would be broken by what she endured, Marcela never gave up on the hope that one day she would leave and have her freedom. Just like in Laughing Eyes, we are able to gain an entirely different perspective of books 1-2 by seeing the events from Marcela's eyes. She is not the cold uncaring slave you think she is and we now have a better understanding of her actions and attitude. Marcela lived through years of many unthinkable events and is treated horribly over and over again. Hector and Juan really are monsters. Once again I fell in love with Aiden and his protective and caring nature.I won't give away specific spoilers, but I will tell you that this story continues after the scene where Hector and Juan are killed. (That's not a spoiler since we witnessed their deaths in an earlier book.) There is a beautiful ending, one that I could not have dreamed up to be better. Great conclusion to a good series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ETWX01D2BLDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010D4LSRG#wasThisHelpful","R2ETWX01D2BLDC","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 3 of the Bittersweet series and tells the story of Danny prior to the events that occur in books 1 and 2.  We already learned that he and Aiden served together in the Marines.  We now get his heartbreaking story and fall more in love with the wonderful man.  The first 65% of this book is Dannyâ€™s back story, but the remainder is an entirely different POV of what occurred in books 1-2 since we see it from Dannyâ€™s role behind the scenes.Danny and Aiden are Marines sent on a top secret mission to Costa Rica to locate and destroy El Leon, a man responsible for killing men, women and children in the surrounding villages.  When they arrive, they discover a group of doctors and nurses there who are trying to help with the devastation and injuries left behind by El Leon and his men.  Danny has an immediate attraction to one of the nurses Anna, and they quickly form a close friendship.  Through the weeks, their friendship becomes more and the two of them make plans for a possible future together.  Sadly, they learn that El Leon has also set his sights on Anna and heâ€™s not a man who likes losing.This is really a good story.  I knew going into this book that Danny had suffered loss and I was prepared to not get the happy ending I usually require.  However, Iâ€™m so very glad I read it because I would have missed seeing this side of Danny and discovering the wonderful man underneath.  He and Aiden were sent alone on what most would consider a suicide mission after El Leon, the monster with the beautiful eyes.  They are both great men and did what they could considering the circumstances.  This was an emotional story, but worth the read.Iâ€™m planning on reading Sofia next, the last book in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYIAFCCSJBM39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W43VCQW#wasThisHelpful","RYIAFCCSJBM39","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laila hasn't always had a good life, but she had a brother Ethan she loved and she was happy. When Ethan appears to be missing, Laila goes in search of him. She had no idea that Ethan had gotten involved working with a Mexican Cartel and she was therefore placing herself in danger. Taken prisoner by Juan, one of the cartel leader's sons, she's held captive and promised a life she cannot imagine.Aiden is the other brother and although he tries to hide it, he's nothing like Juan. He had a plan and seeing the beautiful Laila now held captive changes things. He'll have to improvise but he'll do whatever he can to keep her safe and get her out.I knew from Aiden's first scene that he was notthing like the monsters that Juan and his father Hector were. There's a harsh intensity to him but also a softness that he only showed Laila. I began pulling for their escape immediately and wanted them together.Laila is tough. She never backed down and her mouth got her into trouble more times than not. Although I understood her reasoning completely, it still annoyed me when Aiden asked that she trust him and she didn't. She's a likable strong lead female character.There are tense moments and twists and turns. There are also some dark moments and uncomfortable scenes, but not near as bad as other books I've read regarding kidnappings. This book ends on a cliffy, but book 2 Crimson Desert is already out so there's nothing to stop you from reading this. Oh and the next book is the conclusion of Laila and Aiden's story, so even more reason to get started.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6QB0Q1V646E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNMP9SG#wasThisHelpful","RJ6QB0Q1V646E","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tiffy is the daughter of a billionaire who owns a hotel where a male stripper show performs. She comes to town to check on things and meets Fletcher Novak, the sexy lead dancer of the show. Their attraction is immediate, no matter how much Tiffy tries to fight it. But she is determined to win Cole's heart, a guy she has worked with for several years. She's determined to think the worse of Fletcher and deny her feelings for him. There are secrets that both characters keep and things don't come together like either were expecting.I loved Fletcher from his very first scene. He's sexy, confident and there is no doubt that's he's a great guy. Tiffy goes after him with hurtful accusations and insults again and again. Fletcher shakes it off and distracts her by bringing her true feelings to the surface. Being the man he is, he's really hard to push away or forget. I'll be honest, I didn't care for Tiffy. At all! Not even by the end of the book. Fortunately, my feelings for her didn't take away too much from the story and I was able to enjoy this book.Claudio is Tiffy's best friend and assistant and he's a great character. He was good at balancing and acted the way we all want our best friends to act.Overall, I liked the book. Even though Fletcher is a stripper and Tiffy is technically his boss, there's so much more to the book than that. It's a reminder to look beyond the outside of a person and see what's inside and learn the facts before making a wrong judgment.3.5/4.0 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFV97CJ0HE11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01069Z99Q#wasThisHelpful","R2NFV97CJ0HE11","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5/5.0 starsI genuinely love this series. The men of the HRT are all hot military men with special training who would not only die for each other, but also for the women and others in their lives that they love and care for.This is Ethan Cruz's story. The team is in his hometown of Miami tracking a man with connections to the most dangerous drug lord currently in the country. When he runs into his old neighbor Marisol, Ethan is shocked at the possessive feelings he has towards her. He always looked out for her growing up, especially since she was several years younger. Now, she's all grown up and is an Assistant U.S. Attorney working on the same case he is. Ethan struggles with his feelings knowing he'll be leaving soon and doesn't want to start something and hurt Marisol when he has to leave. However when she becomes a target and her life is put in danger, he'll do anything to protect her.Marisol has always had a huge crush on Ethan and has a hard time as fighting her affection for him. She knows he'll be going back home soon and knows she miss him. When it becomes obvious they each feel the same way, the sparks fly. But danger is closing in and the case she's working on is getting closer to trial and people want her stopped.Ethan such a great guy. All of these men are. I've loved every one of these stories and I especially enjoy getting to see them all again in each book. Marisol was a great fit for Ethan and like the other women in this series, she was stubborn and stood her ground. I hope Vance's book will be next. I'm curious as to how he's going to be able to successfully keep fighting that attraction he's developed for one of these guys' sister.I hope we'll see more of Georgia and there's a part of me that hopes Miguel will be back too. I'm hoping I interrupted that scene correctly and he'll be back - maybe....Overall, loved it and can't wait to see what happens next time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PK6OESDFAK3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014C4JPT6#wasThisHelpful","R2PK6OESDFAK3I","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I enjoyed watching these two fall for each other and thought they were perfect together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUHYJHSYK2WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z753MR6#wasThisHelpful","R1XUHYJHSYK2WL","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I made this purchase solely for the novella included entitled Alternate, since I previously purchased each of the books individually in the Gypsy Brothers series.  For those of you who haven't read it, this a great price to get the entire series because I paid a whole lot more.  Alternate is pretty short, but it does give you a few insights into things you didn't know about Jase, Elliot and Dornan.This was an intense, suspenseful series that kept you on your toes fighting for Julz (Sammi) to get her revenge and hoping that she gets a happy ending with Jase in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39H8DUPZLGTW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137QJXZQ#wasThisHelpful","R39H8DUPZLGTW1","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the story of Kristine and Garrettâ€™s daughter Amy, and her love/hate relationship with Noah, the adopted son of Justin and Riza.  Back when Amy was younger, she smarted off to Noah about him being adopted and since that day, the two of them have fought and not gotten along.  Now Amyâ€™s going to college and their parents want her to live with Noah to help keep her safe.  They still fight and then something serious happens that will change the paths of their lives forever.Iâ€™ll just say, the event that happened caught me off guard.  Itâ€™s a seriously WTF moment. I had a hard time connecting to Amy and thought she acted immaturely and childish.  I liked Noah well enough and was glad he was there to help Amy.  Then something else happens and I wasnâ€™t even sure where that came from.  The story ends in an okay place and sets up the next book in the series, Twisted Boundaries, which appears to be scheduled for released later this month.Overall, this was an okay book to me.

"3.0/3.5 StarsI really enjoyed Tag so I was looking forward to reading Youâ€™re It.  This Novella takes place four years later and life for Tango and Cali has been good.  They have a beautiful daughter Tyler and have adjusted and made their life as normal as possible.  Now the men responsible for the drug that cured Tango want to test Tyler to study the effects his injection may have caused in her. Tango and Cali are not happy and will do whatever is necessary to prevent it from happening.I loved Tango and was glad to see he was the same protective hot man I remember.  I wasnâ€™t as happy with Cali.  I remember her being tough and independent, but I thought she pushed it a little close to being obnoxious in this book. Donâ€™t get me wrong, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with protecting your child, I just didnâ€™t recall her being so rude and edgy.Bottom line, it was nice for the catch up and Iâ€™m glad Tango and Cali got their happy ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J17IGLCMBQVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131HIPDC#wasThisHelpful","R2J17IGLCMBQVZ","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking forward to Jacob Decker's story. He's Chase's best friend from the book Breathe and I couldn't wait to see what woman would catch his heart.Years ago, Deck had his heart broken by the woman who he thought was the love of his life. Emme was his ex'es best friend and they've always shared something deep. Until Deck walks back into her life, he didn't realize what it was. Now he knows and he's going to do what he can to make her his.Deck is an absolute dream. He's so sweet and wears his heart on his sleeve. He'd do anything for Emme and is determined to keep her safe and have a future with her. Emma suffered a traumatic event in her childhood that she's really never dealt with and it keeps her distant. Deck knows this and is patient and does what he can to bring her around. But I'll warn you... around 60-75% Emme's gonna make you mad. I was not a happy reader and was not thinking nice things about this girl! Yeah she's got problems, and yeah she was having problems dealing with the problems, but I did not like at all how she was handling them. She's redeems herself completely, I'll say that, but during the bad time in the book- no! She did not do right. (Just my thoughts of course).Hoping there's more in this series and if so I'll definitely read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325JXEQMUKW00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5YWZFQ#wasThisHelpful","R325JXEQMUKW00","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will admit, this story started a little slower than some of the previous ones in this series, but once it got going, it was good. I adored Ham.

"There are a number of books that I've read which have touched me and Breathe is one I will definitely remember as being special.Faye had secretly crushed on Chace, a local police officer and town hero, for thirteen years since he moved to town. She never thought she'd ever attract his attention until she did. It was bumpy at first. Chace knew the minute he locked eyes on Faye that he wanted her to be his wife. Unfortunately life along with dirty cops and his father's mistakes didn't allow that to happen. Trying to discover who murdered the woman he was forced to marry, Chace struggles to fight the long term feelings he still harbors for Faye thinking he's not good enough. But there's only so much fight a man can have before he gives in, and Faye makes it too hard to fight.Chace is unquestionably a jerk at first. He's hurt and struggling with demons because of what's happened in his life over the last six years. However it's clear he wants Faye and it's also clear he wants her bad. Once he goes all in, he does just that and he becomes a wonderful, caring and protective man. He was so broken, yet he was also so sweet. Faye is amazing. She may be the towns quiet librarian but she has a fire and determination in her that helps Chace in a way no one else could. The side story to them falling in love is boy who changes their lives. I won't give away much but to say that this part of the story is heartbreaking and beautiful. He will touch your heart and make you feel deep inside. I badly wanted to hug this child and take away what he'd been through. Faye and Chace give him something that not many would. It will make you think about what you'd do in the same situation and wonder if given the chance, if you'd have the strength to go as far as they did.Although this is a standalone, it's helps to have read the previous books to know the characters and also to know about the murder that happened. It's not necessary, but the other books are good, so they're worth the read also.This was another great story by this author and I'm looking forward to the next book Jagged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZ6FLCQ1L8JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJABI#wasThisHelpful","R1AZ6FLCQ1L8JY","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a long book, but it was so good and filled with twists and turns and good ole romance.  Hot romance with a hot man!  Ty was imprisoned for five years for a crime he did not commit.  He's thought of nothing by vengeance during his incarceration and now that he's out, it's time for payback. Lexie hasn't lived a great life, but she's determined to one day make that change.  When she's sent to pick Ty up the day he's released from prison, her luck begins to change.  Ty makes her an offer, marry him and he'll pay her enough to start a better life.  The only problem, once they're married, neither want the marriage not to be fake.  Soon, they're falling but Ty still needs his revenge and he may lose Lexie in the process.I absolutely loved this book!  Lexis is a wonderful person that no matter what happened in her past, she lived in the moment and had a great personality and was beautiful.  She brought Ty back to life and made a cold angry man smile.  Ty is damaged but he's soft around Lexie and begins to see the light and love around him.  They have some bumps in the road, but Ty proves himself and his love for Lexie.There's suspense in trying to help Ty clear his name and discover just who all is involved in his set up.  Both Ty and Lexie have great friends that added to the story.  Lexie is funny and sweet and I found myself laughing out loud throughout this book.  I loved that it's told from both POVs also.Loved it!  Moving on the the next one and can't wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QU3SA1NIFQR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJAD6#wasThisHelpful","R2QU3SA1NIFQR1","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an emotional, beautiful story of a strong but broken man who finds a reason to live again.  I knew from the small scenes of Deacon in previous books that his story would be intense.  The reason for his coldness is heartbreaking. But through it all, there is no doubt he is a wonderful man who deserves his chance at happiness.Since she was a child, Cassidy has dreamed of living in the Colorado mountains.  She finally gets her chance in her early twenties, when she purchases a number of mountain cabins to fix up and rent.  Throughout the next seven years, the mysterious stranger John Priest (Deacon) shows up and stays in cabin eleven.  She has no idea he's as drawn to her and she is him until one night Deacon helps Cassie with a bad situation and some renters.  They begin a perfect love affair and slowly grow closer.  Cassie knows Deacon has secrets and she's determine to break through and fix her man.  If only he'd erase all boundaries.Wow. Deacon is such a great guy. His past really did a number on him and he's suffered through the years a hundred times over.  Cassidy is the perfect woman for him.  Their story is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed.Looks like the hunt for Nair will reach it's conclusion in the final book of this series, Sebring, in which we finally get Nick's story.

"I can always count on Scott Hildreth delivering a story that I love from the minute I start reading until the very end and the very last word.  Ex-Con was no different and I was immediately swept into the Selected Sinnerâ€™s MC world and able to escape and watch Big Jack and Emily fall in love.We read in the previous book Hung about Jack being sentenced to life in prison for a beefed up charge by a dirty ATF guy.  In Ex-Con, we experience Jackâ€™s life prior to his time in jail and are shown what a fun, loving, protective and honest man he is.  Watching he and Em fall in love was so sweet and their love for each other was powerful.  The scenes we see during Jackâ€™s time in jail reiterate the fact that he is a great guy, although he isnâ€™t a man to sit back and be pushed around.This was a story about love that is soul deep and never dies.  Itâ€™s about making a family out of the people around you whether they are blood related or not.  Itâ€™s full of fun characters that will have you laughing yet you know they will die for each and every person they love.I cannot wait to see whatâ€™s up next in this series.  As always, great job and wonderful story!  Thanks for the bonus of a little Ripp, Shane and A-Train thrown in too.

"The Chaos series is a spinoff of sorts from Motorcycle Man and contains a number of the characters from the Dream Man series. Tabby is the daughter of Tack the president of the Chaos MC. She's feisty and beautiful and has had a crush on Shy, one of the members for a couple of years. Shy is hot but he's also a player. He cares about Tabby a lot but doesn't realize how strong those feelings are until Tabby suffers a loss. He's there to help Tabby get through a tough time and they become close friends. Soon both Shy and Tabby realize its more than just friendship they have. But they have friends and the club to get around for anything to happen.Shy reminded me so much of Tack, and because he tells us he respected Tack and learned from him, it's makes sense they'd be similar. Both bikers, both hot, both protective of their woman and both adamant about getting their way. Tabby is a handful but she's got such a big heart. I think they were prefect for each other and it was so sweet and heart warming watching them fall.There is some drama but not too much and you expect it with a MC book. Looks like we have more in store in future stories as well. Loved we got more Elvira - and she's got herself a bada$$ man of her own.The next story up is about Hop (club member) and Lanie (Tyra's best friend from Motorcycle Man). We see a little action involving them in this book, but we're not sure yet what's going on. Already downloaded it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQKF6K26124T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMIL9C8#wasThisHelpful","R1XQKF6K26124T","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tyra knew the minute she laid eyes on Tack, the President of the Chaos MC, that he was her dream man. They shared an unbelievably fantastic night and Tyra thinks Tack feels the same way - until he rolls over, tells her it's time to go and then asks her to leave her number. She's embarrassed, upset and angry. Mostly because she's not a one/night stand kinda girl, but also because Tack doesn't know Tyra will be his new secretary starting the following week.I loved Tack and thought he was both funny and bossy at the same time. He tells it like it is and makes his feelings on everything pretty flippin clear. Tyra is perfect for him and isn't afraid to talk back. His MC isn't perfect, but they're not into a bunch of illegal stuff and are all pretty great guys. I adored Tabby and Rush, Tack's teenage kids. They were great and loved their dad. The ex-wife was horrible and needed to be slapped. The main drama that occurs doesn't come from somewhere you'd expect so I won't give that away. I will say we get to see all the dream men from the first three books in this series who all come together.  Plus, their wives/girlfriends are now friends with Tyra.There is also a spinoff series called Chaos that will be stories regarding characters from the Chaos MC. Looking forward to reading them and I know they'll be good.Great series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOKY7DCG6TD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJACM#wasThisHelpful","REOKY7DCG6TD9","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brock is a DEA agent who has been working undercover for the past few months.  His assignment was to get close to Tess; but what started out as strictly doing his job turned into more.  Brock fell hard for the beautiful Tess and wants her in his life.  His problem.... when Tess is brought into the police station and interrogated about Damien, her criminal ex-husband, she discovers that Brock is a cop and believes he was only with her to find dirt on her ex.  Tessâ€™ heart is broken and she leaves the station refusing to talk to him.Three months later and Brock is done giving Tess space.  He goes to her house with plans to claim his woman.  He explains why he did what he did and promises to prove to Tess how much more than the job she was.  Fairly quickly Brock and Tess are back together.  She learns about his great sons and has to deal with his horrible, witchy ex-wife.  Additionally, Damien wants her back and is determined to make her give him a chance.I loved this story.  Brock is wild, bossy, stubborn and rough.  But heâ€™s also sweet, soft, protective and caring.  He loves his â€œsweetness.â€  There is also a sense of humor with him that has you grinning at he and Tess.  His family is a wonderful bonus to this story, along with the girls who make up Tessâ€™ posse.  Tess is a great leading lady and a very likeable character.  She loves her man and she doesnâ€™t allow her friends or other outside forces to sidetrack her from her feelings for him.There is drama and some major shake-your-head moments with the ex-wife.  That lady is a piece of work!  There is also some other drama that I wont spoil.Overall, I loved it.  It was mostly told from Tessâ€™ POV with a few chapters from Brock.  Great epilogue too.

For the last four years, she's watched the hot police detective who lives next door in her apartment complex. Mitch is everything she wants, but nothing she feels like she deserves.Mitch has wanted a shot at Mara for the past four years. When the opportunity arises to help Mara get her two young cousins from their drug dealing and using father, he sees his chance. He wants Mara in his life and in his bed and will do whatever he has to in order to convince her they belong together.Mitch is wow! He's hot, sexy, protective, sweet and is great with Billie and Billy, the kids who are the sweetest things. Those poor kids had been through so much and I adored Billy and his insight and protectiveness towards those he loved. Mara is a little tough at first to take. Her ability to throw up a wall and think badly of herself drove me crazy, but with Mitch's help and persistence she becomes a great character I really liked. There are some great secondary characters in this story too.I mentioned above that the epilogue was wonderful and I'll mention it again... So flippin good. Billy :-) that's all I'll say.Great book and great story. I read Mystery Man too, but somehow missed Wild Man so that's my next to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3082ZPIIA4X6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJACW#wasThisHelpful","R3082ZPIIA4X6D","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsNina needs a break. She's engaged to Niles and isn't sure she's making the right decision with her life. Niles never listens, he works all the time and makes Nina feel as though she's invisible. They've been living in England and she plans a solo trip to Colorado for a much needed time out from Niles. Upon her arrival she discovers there's been a mistake with her reservation, and the beautiful vacation home she rented in the mountains is actually currently occupied by the handsome owner. Nina is tired, annoyed and has the beginnings of the flu.Max is amused by the gorgeous woman who shows up at his door with the sexy accent. After explaining his home isn't available for the week and sending Nina on her way to a hotel, he discovers her at the end of his drive in a ditch. He brings her inside and takes care of her for several days when she comes down with the flu. Max feels something for the feisty spitfire and decides he wants Nina staying in his home.This is a lengthy book with a lot that goes on. There is a blooming romance between Nina and Max and we meet some great secondary characters that add to the story. There is also a murder mystery as well as a character struggling with a recent assault.Max is a protective and very dominant mountain man. He has a heart of gold and is a great man. He's attracted to Nina and recognizes that the attraction is mutual. Nina hasn't felt this alive in years. Max not only argues with her and makes her mad, he causes her to feel things Niles never has. Max makes it very clear he wants to pursue a relationship with her and obviously he isn't the kind of man who gives up. I loved Max. He may have grunted and bossed her around, but the man had skills and I'd let him boss me around anytime. Nina drove me a little crazy occasionally with her jumping to conclusions without talking to Max. She'd run and take the cowards way out before she took the time to actually have a conversion with him and learn the truth.I've had this book on my TBR list for a while and I'm glad I finally took the time to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18G80U49AKOEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJAAO#wasThisHelpful","R18G80U49AKOEK","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 2 in the series and is Brandon and Penny's story. It's a standalone, but to me personally, I think you'd have a better feel of the characters if you read Filthy Desire first which is Matthew and Ella's story.After being together for a while, Penny leaves Brandon. He's her Dominant but she doesn't believe he'll be able to provide her the pain her body needs and craves. Brandon is crushed and has a difficult time moving forward while Penny finds a new master to give her pain. A couple of weeks later there's a terrible accident which brings Brandon and Penny back together. Finally they realize that they're willing to work as a couple to reach a compromise so each of them will be fulfilled and they can be happy together.I was so mad at Penny. She suffers remorse and guilt for her decision, but honestly I had a hard time forgiving her. Brandon is perfect. He adores her and loves her dearly. I realize why Penny felt she had to leave, but that doesn't mean I liked it. Nate and Bianca are more involved in this book, so I'm wondering if their story will be the next release, Carnal Desire. Or will it be our bartender Dylan and Daisy the new single mom.Overall I enjoyed this story and I liked it being told from Brandon's POV exclusively. It was great to see Ella and Matthew again and see how their relationship was progressing. I intend to read the next book when it's released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0PZNIRMYNIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TM42CA#wasThisHelpful","R2R0PZNIRMYNIS","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ella interviews for a job with Matthew at Onyx, a club he and his best friend Brandon own.  Matthew never becomes attached to the women he sees, but is immediately protective of Ella and wants her near him.  When he discovers she's living in her broken down car, he moves Ella into his apartment.  Ella is poor but proud and won't stay without paying somehow, so Matthew offers to allow her to cook and clean his apartment while also working at the club.  He knows she's running from someone and has a horrible past, and is determined to learn the truth and keep her safe.  As weeks pass, they grow closer and Ella begins opening up to him.  But the past is never far behind.This is the first story I've read by this author and I enjoyed it. I liked both Ella and Matthew, although I had to get used to Matthew's abrupt and honest personality.  Ella is really good for him and softens his hard edges.  The story is told from dual POVs.  The next book is Dangerous Desires which is Brandon's and Bianca's book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U4WGODBRONND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6GJV3K#wasThisHelpful","R1U4WGODBRONND","ALY4MQYVAEE4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALY4MQYVAEE4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Joss no longer exists - now there is only Jill.  Slade is her very attractive savior and owns the bar where she will be working.  The chemistry between them is not only immediate, but intense.  The problem, Slade doesn't think he's good enough for Joss and attempts to deny his feelings for her and push her away.  He's determine to keep her safe no matter what it costs him.This is a romance/suspense book.  I enjoyed the characters and liked the plot of the story.  You'll fall for Slade.  He tries so hard to push his feelings for Joss aside and in doing so, he comes across as a jerk.  But because we are provided both his and Joss' POV, we know it's costing him to act that way.  He's so protective over her and genuinely only wants what he feels is best.  When Slade finally gives in to his feelings, you can tell just how perfect these two are for each other.  Joss is also a very likeable character.  Becoming Jill makes her stronger.Overall, I enjoyed this story and will read more from this author.

"3.5 starsRebecca is a young spitfire who believes Bray somehow got her fired. She doesn't care that he's a billionaire, nor does she care that he owns the building where she worked at a coffee shop. She wants him to own up to what she thinks he did and find her another job.Bray is a very organized and structured man who lives his life according to a detailed schedule. When Rebecca barges in his office, his world is turned upside down. He's had an attraction to her for a while but wouldn't allow himself to get close to her. Without thought he offers her a job working as his live-in maid and cook at his home. They soon grow closer and enter into a relationship. Unfortunately they both have secrets from their pasts that cause problems.I'm sure you've guessed by the book's title that both of our main characters are in fact virgins. Or were as the case is. They share a strong connection that grows the more time they spend together. Rebecca is normally feisty but with Bray her youth shows and she lacks her usual self confidence. She assumes the wrong thing a couple of times and causes major drama. Bray is extremely possessive of Rebecca. Because of his past and his lack of previous relationship knowledge, he doesn't always say or do the right thing. These two really needed to communicate with one another. In addition to their growing romance, there's a side story involving Rebecca's brother and trouble he ends up involving her with.Overall this was an okay read for me.

"At 5'4"" and 105 lbs, I vary between a small and a medium t-shirt, medium because the small's tend to be too tight in the shoulders, but small because the mediums have sleeve diameters that are too large. In any case, this particular shirt is broad enough in the shoulders while still having appropriately sized sleeves. The poly/cotton blend makes the collar sit correctly while still providing adequate absorption. I like the crew type collar, which makes the shirt work as a stand-alone rather than simply useful as an undershirt. Nice color as well.

"I have a hood over my stove in which I have had three Sylvania Halogen Flood PAR 20 50w bulbs. The hood does not have a dimming or LO/HI feature, so dimming capability for the LED bulbs is unimportant to me. These LED bulbs provide roughly equivalent brightness, color balance, and spread of light when compared to the halogen, with a power draw of just over 25w total instead of 150w. All three work perfectly, come on quickly, and fit in the hood without difficulty. The fit isn't perfect, however, as the bulbs are just slightly too long, so instead of being flush with the surface, they stick down by about one quarter of an inch. They also have a slightly smaller diameter at their surface so there is a small circular space around them that's not present with the standard halogen bulbs. Overall, I'm very happy with the operation and the power draw differential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMGYHJCY7ZOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3VOA9E#wasThisHelpful","R1EMGYHJCY7ZOW","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Glass bottles, real sugar, and a not-too-sweet cola taste. Somehow in my imagination, this is how cola tasted when I was a kid, though the bottle was green instead of brown, before recipes changed and sugar became high-fructose corn syrup. I don't drink soda much anymore, though I still prefer Coca-Cola to Pepsi, but it's nice to find a current cola that brings back the basics using the best ingredients. And the 10 oz size is a good middle ground between the 8 oz bottle and the 12 oz can.

"The Canon MG6820 is a slightly modified upgrade to last yearâ€™s MG6620. The overall device has the same overall size and shape but is now a shiny black instead of flat black (and word has it that the model is available in at least a few other colors). Unpacking is easy and straightforward, easily handled by a single individual. At the top we have a single page scanner, near the base we have card slots for MSDuo and SD cards, and then weâ€™ve got a paper tray that can be used for plain or photo paper. Pull up the front panel to insert the five ink wells (M/Y/C/BK/PGBK - model 270 instead of the 250 provided for the 6620), then follow the instructions on the touchscreen to print out a head alignment sheet which is then scanned to auto-align the print head. On my first attempt to connect the Canon to my wifi router, the instructions froze and I needed to cycle power to the printer. The second attempt went well, at which point I noted that the MG6820 lacks the blue wifi LED that the 6620 has to alert the user that the device is connected to wifi. I was quickly able to access the printer from my iPhone using Canon Print, and could then scan to my iPhone, print from my iPhone, and so forth, all as easily as I could from my computer.Using my Mac running OS 10.11.1, I tried printing from the Mail application, at which point the MG6800 series printer was quickly located and set up without my needing to install any software myself. Since the instructions suggest that one should obtain the IJSetup software online from Canon, then install it, I figured Iâ€™d try it out to see if it gave any improved usability. The process froze at the â€œProcessing. Please waitâ€ stage. Since it ultimately wasnâ€™t necessary to operate the printer or scanner, I discarded the Setup file.Printing speed is the same for the 6620 and 6820. The printers take some time getting ready to print the first page if theyâ€™ve been off or asleep for a while, but once they get going, theyâ€™re pretty speedy. Two sided printing works very well, though slows things down as there is a required pause while ink dries on side one of any given page. I donâ€™t see any difference between the 250 and 270 ink sets and was unable to find information online to explain whether there is a consumer-notable difference.Overall this is a perfectly nice printer. The firmware and Canon supplied software are still a tad rough around the edges, as in addition to the difficulties described above, scanning from Apple's Preview application fails on launch, freezing the printer and returning a statement that the overview scan failed to complete. Photos look very reasonable given the limited number of ink wells, and standard business and home output is on par with that from similarly priced Epson printers. This Canon series is very well designed around an individual who will be using the Cloud, iPhones, iPads, and other mobile technology frequently, but I found it equally easy to quickly connect to computers and laptops on my network without having to deal with any significant software installation burden.Note that at the moment, the 6620 is available at half the price of the new 6820, giving you a very real option to consider given that the bulk of the connectivity capabilities have not changed significantly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P68MZS7AO71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013C0ZCCU#wasThisHelpful","R3P68MZS7AO71","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very well constructed with bright LED's that come on with 9V and come to full brightness just below 12V. With a well charged car battery, full brightness is available even with the engine off. All wiring, an LED-indicator toggle switch, instructions, and heavy duty mounting brackets are included. Wiring allows for mounting of just a single pod, or both pods, as desired. You can purchase either the flood or the spot assemblies. I found the flood lighting to be well distributed for clear lighting of a fairly large field of vision. The logos on the front and sides of the lights suggests that the lights are meant to be mounted on top of a cab or bumper, rather than hanging down from the bottom of a bumper, but there are sufficient cooling fins on the lamps to allow for either approach. Given the overall field of light spread, however, you wouldn't want to mount these lamps too close to the ground. Sturdy and well-built, allowing for use in a heavy-duty truck environment, I found the lamps easy to install and posing no problems in operation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMOMK1QY4IF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0EJXZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1GMOMK1QY4IF5","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Available directly from the manufacturer for just under $150, this is the holy grail for Lost in Space soundtrack fans. Including the full original John Williams cues from the first episode, numerous previously unreleased episode scores, and a detailed explanatory booklet, this set of 12 CD's makes the perfect accompaniment to the new Blu-Ray release of the 3 seasons of the series and the boxed collection of Star Trek soundtracks. Sound quality is excellent, with the occasional bleed through of louder passages due to the original magnetic tape source in a few areas, and notably in mono rather than stereo, again, as one would expect. There are some musical passages not present on the discs, and very likely sourced from library material during original production of the series - for instance, some of the music from Invaders From the Fifth Dimension episode does not appear on the CD and therefore was not produced specifically for LIS. There's room for a little more detail and explanation, but nothing that can't be released in online addenda to the published booklet. The key here, the CD's, are really everything musical that I've wanted since I was 10 and sitting next to the TV with a tape recorder so that I could play back audio versions of episodes at my whim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCFL2U3KF3GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01708JEDS#wasThisHelpful","RMCFL2U3KF3GY","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large watch. I tend to alternate between a Seiko digital watch that weighs just under 2 oz, and a Breitling analog aerospace chronograph, which is somewhat larger than the Seiko but also weighs about 2 oz. The Seiko easily fits under a dress shirt. The Breitling fits under some dress shirts, particularly bespoke shirts where the sleeve can be designed around it. This Lucien Piccard watch weighs about 3.5 oz, is nearly twice as thick as the Breitling, and has a notably larger circumference. It doesn't come close to fitting under a dress shirt sleeve, meaning that it dangles between my hand and my shirt sleeve. While the face of the watch is quite large, the legibility is poor due to the silver hands over a silver background. This is broken up somewhat by the white fluorescent material painted on the hands, but white on silver doesn't make for great contrast. If you want to quickly know what time it is, and you happen to be in dim surroundings, this watch may not be for you.Another reviewer spoke of the red second hand. There is, however, no red second hand. In fact, there is no second hand at all. The watch has a chronograph function: the red hand is the read-out for the chronograph once started using the top button. The left-most smaller hand then provides a minute function for the chronograph, with measurements up to one hour. The right-most smaller hand simply provides a 24 hour read-out, essentially telling you if it's AM or PM, something you hopefully don't really need to look at your watch for. At the bottom of the dial is a date readout.Date and time are both easily set. The chronograph works well. The watch itself keeps very good time. Figuring out the latch on the wrist band took me a few minutes since the instructions lack an explanation that the clasp is hinged to allow insertion of the leather strap. I discovered this by accident as I attempted to insert the strap somewhat more forcefully than necessary. The overall fit and polish of the watch is very nice, with highly reflective chrome, reasonably supple mid-grade leather, and a fine crystal that has no negative optical characteristics.If you like a thick watch that calls attention to itself with some silvery bling, this is for you. If you're more of a Piaget ultra-thin fan, you'll definitely want to look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUP48W4Y6U65X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXHLUQ#wasThisHelpful","RUP48W4Y6U65X","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are patternless, large (32""x38"") dishtowels. At first glance when completely unfolded, each looks like a small tablecloth. The fabric is fairly thin. However, when used as a dishtowel, the cloth is absorbent and leaves your dishes and pans spotless. I definitely prefer these to the usual smaller and more plush items typically sold as dishtowels. The size of this is sufficient to get you through an entire sink of dishes without needing to pull out a second towel, and the fabric thickness makes these very convenient to use on delicate items.

"This Samsung flash drive comes formatted as MS-DOS (FAT32) with 64.14GB of capacity. It quickly mounted on the USB 3.0 bus of my MacBook Pro running OS 10.11.1. I compared it to a 1GB flash drive that I'd been using which is formatted as MS-DOS (FAT16) that works well with my MacBook. I moved a 125MB folder of several hundred files in the finder to both flash drives with no other applications running. Moving the folder to the 1GB flash drive, which does not use the USB 3.0 bus, took just over 40 seconds. Moving it to the Samsung drive took just over 8 seconds. The device itself is a solid piece of what seems to be aluminum. It inserts and extracts easily. It does not have any sort of cover for the port itself. It has a hole at one end so that it can be attached to a keychain or similar device. At 64GB, you can carry around all but the largest music or photo libraries, but the real advantage here is never having to worry that you won't be able to easily move a large database file or PPT presentation. Great little failsafe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCML7PX4EQLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CCTJKE#wasThisHelpful","R3MCML7PX4EQLX","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairly small, but sized perfectly for stepping out of a shower stall. Plush and soft, without any tendency to slipping on a granite floor. Sits nicely without the edges curving up.

"This is a product currently under development and now ready for programmers and developers to take their turn. This is not, at this point, a product that end users should buy, nor is the product being promoted for that particular use yet. What you receive if you purchase this now is a pair of the smart glasses and four pages of instructions directed at developers (instructions regarding debugging tools, driver installation, and so forth).The glasses themselves look like they're out of the mid-1950s and are designed with a large face in mind. I'm used to wearing glasses all day and found these perfectly comfortable. The right eyepiece has an extra screen in back of it which produces an image of a computer screen in landscape mode in front of or slightly below where you'd normally look. As you focus on the screen, you adjust your eyes as if you were looking at something fairly close. That means that if you're driving and you focus on the screen, the road is out of focus. The screen will appear blurry unless you have 20/20 distant vision, either with contacts, or with a corrective lens in place (in the provided adaptor). (And yes, you focus on something close yet you need good distant vision to see it...that may not make intuitive sense but that's how it works). If you wear glasses to begin with, you can place these on your head as well over your usual glasses, but it's clumsy and you will probably lose a visual of the entire screen.Mounted on the glasses is a camera for still or video photos. The entire interface can be controlled through a touchpad on the right side. I found my arm getting sore as I tried to manipulate things constantly over the course of a session of use. The touchpad is sensitive and it takes a little while to figure out what its size limitations are as well as the touch necessary to differentiate moving the cursor from clicking or double-clicking. I was, however, quickly able to connect the glasses to my wifi, then access the web and view various sites without difficulty. There are no built-in speakers, but there is a headphone jack on the right earpiece. Frankly, I'd prefer sound coming from ports close to my ears, since the earpieces are already there.Charging of the device is handy using a microUSB port. A red LED lights up to indicate the unit is being charged, and a green LED comes on to indicate that the product is turned on.The screen brightens and dims based upon ambient light and you can adjust the placement of the screen to suit your needs. I had no trouble reading the lettering on the screen once I got used to the overall product. The provided lenses are simply clear non-correcting lenses which darken upon exposure to sunlight. I noticed no darkening with any home light, including UV lights for plants or IR heat lamps.The overall fit and finish of the product, such as where certain plastic portions of the product come together with the rubberized surface of other portions, is fair. Again, this is clearly a product in development, and I would expect a significant improvement in the overall polish of the product once it is in full release. I'd also like to see both a smaller iteration for those with smaller faces as well as one that can be mounted on existing glasses rather than requiring an entirely separate product. As to what I'd use these for, I'm not entirely sure. I can think of several camera uses, such as video recording a skiing run or other activities in which you can engage while having a hands-free camera while simultaneously watching the video feed. There's also the more obvious GPS operation while driving, though I worry about the need to refocus one's eyes away from the road even given the screen's presence directly in your usual field of vision. There's a mic built in, so clearly one could use it for teleconferences, but while the smart glass wearer would see the usual interface screen, the camera, of course, is pointed away - at what you're seeing - rather than at your face.The star rating is based upon the product's readiness for developers, not on the degree to which this product would have value currently for an end user. At the moment, it would be like having an iPhone with no apps except for Safari and Camera. Three stars rather than four due to the Windows-only interfaces available without any clear interface for those who develop with Macs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SH76ZGA2S2CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBISJ3A#wasThisHelpful","R2SH76ZGA2S2CS","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are cute little square dishtowels, just a little bigger than a standard square paper napkin. The set of six has three white with purple stripes and three purple with white stripes. They are soft and won't scratch anything. They aren't quite as large as typical dishtowels, nor are they quite as absorbent as I'd like. In drying freshly washed dishes, I found that I wasn't able to completely dry anything and still needed to place items in the drying rack. The dishtowel gets wet, but doesn't seem to hold a sufficient amount to dry more than an item or two. I find these great for applying wax on the car or for buffing a countertop clean with a cleanser - they are very good for those applications.The dishtowels are marked to be washed in cold water, on the gentle cycle, and then dried at low temperature. I tried washing one once in warm water, with the normal cycle, and dried it at standard temperature.

"The iPad Air 2 weighs about 15 ounces versus the 3.5 lbs of my 13"" MacBook Pro. So it's nice to have the lighter alternative for trips where I don't need the added abilities of the laptop. But the iPad really requires a case to avoid damage to the screen in my backpack. I've been using a Belkin keyboard case. With the iPad, the combination weighs in at 2 lbs, 4 ounces. This Otter Box case, plus the iPad, weighs 2 1/2 pounds. I still save a pound over the laptop, and the extra 1/4 pound buys me some added agility. There is, however, a cost.With the Belkin, you're restricted from using the iPad in landscape mode (horizontal longer than vertical), but as the unit folds over on itself, there's a magnetic grip that keeps the iPad in place. This results in a firm connection so that when you move things on the screen, everything stays put. With the OtterBox, you can rotate the iPad so that it can be in either landscape or portrait mode. There's a small flap that lifts up, which holds the iPad in place, but it does a much better job doing so when the iPad is in landscape mode. In portrait mode, you really need to lean the entire assembly against something firm so that it can be used easily. That said, the option to turn the iPad is welcome. You can also remove the iPad from the keyboard easily in which case the iPad is still well protected in its own little case, though the screen no longer has a cover. At that point, you can use the magnetic mounting bracket to attach the iPad to a specific spot on the wall where you've mounted the backing, again in either landscape or portrait mode no matter how you've attached the bracket.All ports and controls are easily accessed. The iPad can be removed from the protective case and replaced into the case as desired without too much difficulty. The keyboard is very much like the Belkin's, which is very much like that of the MacBook Pro though the keys are more tightly spaced together. Touch typing is easy with the OtterBox keyboard. The keyboard is separately charged from the iPad and has a different charger port (the cable is included). It would be great, of course, if the two could be charged together with one cable (I haven't seen any that do this yet).Overall pros are the wide variability of the system. In the keyboard case, out of the case, portrait/landscape, on the wall on a mounting bracket or fully portable. Cons are the extra weight (though there's probably more protection there as well) and the difficulty keeping the iPad where it's supposed to be when in portrait mode.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DU6PAOYH3IJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y09F5QG#wasThisHelpful","R3DU6PAOYH3IJQ","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently reviewed a PUR pitcher (11 cup). I was annoyed because the pitcher couldn't pour unless you held up the tab at the end of the cover without slopping water everywhere. And that was difficult because the pitcher was so heavy when full. The Brita has no such design flaw. It pours well, whether you wish to pour quickly or slowly, so filling a small glass is not the chore that it is with the PUR pitcher.The PUR advertises that they remove twice the contaminants as the Brita. Of course I can't actually test this, but the PUR says they reduce microbial cysts, metals, industrial chemicals, and herbicides/pesticides. The Brita is certified to remove copper, mercury, and cadmium.Taste is excellent for water from both pitchers. And both have an LED system on the top (with batteries that can't be replaced) that tell you when to replace the filter. The Brita filter lasts 40 gallons or two months. Same with the PUR. The PUR brand filters are about $9 apiece. The Brita brand filters are about $5 apiece.Overall I definitely prefer the Brita unit. There will be some who will be convinced that the PUR is better given whatever they suspect is in their water supply, and that may be true for some locations with well water. For those with already purified city water, I'd pick the Brita.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37VDUTEB1QSEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8ME4#wasThisHelpful","R37VDUTEB1QSEV","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wireless bluetooth headphones easily and quickly paired with my iPhone 6, then worked unobtrusively as I went from stored music to Spotify to voicemail to phone calls. The controls on the right earpiece have a clean clicking action and allow for change of volume or moving quickly from song to song as desired. Audio quality is excellent in the vocal range with excellent stereo separation. Bass response is fair, without the deep bass that you might expect from high end music headphones; high end treble is very good, but you don't get quite the sheen that you might get from other components. Voices are clear and crisp, without the muffled quality that some headsets have.The headset itself folds up for easy storage, is clearly labeled as to right and left sides, and weighs about 5 ounces. Clamping force is slightly high, necessary for on-ear rather than over-ear wearing, and for an on-ear unit that will stay in place while you run or exercise. As a result, comfort is a little less than I'd like, but on the other hand I didn't need to keep readjusting the position of the headset, so on balance these are pretty good.Instructions are clear, somewhat witty, and unlike so many components these days, were clearly written by someone with a strong command of English. The internal battery charges quickly (about 90 minutes) and provides a full day of use. The microphone is built in, very much like the iPhone's own internal mic, so there's no boom mic. Pickup is very good and colleagues at the other end couldn't tell that I had switched from the built-in mic to the headset.If the battery dies, you can still use the headset to listen, but you can no longer use the mic, which requires a Bluetooth connection.Those interested in using these in their car should know that some states don't allow the use of headsets that cover both ears.Overall a very nice bluetooth headset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7F5QLLGL521/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MBZN4A#wasThisHelpful","R1F7F5QLLGL521","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed by this pitcher for a number of reasons:1) The setup takes quite a bit of time. A new filter must be soaked in cold water for 15 minutes, then installed into the transparent blue portion of the pitcher (the installation takes a second), and then you have to fill the pitcher by pouring water into the blue top and letting it filter into the pitcher. This process takes about 5 minutes...fill it up and wait for the water to filter through, then repeat a couple of times. Finally take the pitcher and place it into the refrigerator.2) The pitcher, full of water, is heavy and doesn't fit particularly well on the side doors of my Samsung refrigerator. It fits only on the top shelf. Smaller family members therefore find this to be difficult without spilling the water.3) Pouring, the key design feature of a pitcher, should be perfect. Here, it's not. The first time we tried to pour water into a glass, most of the water went on the table, partially from the inability to pour water slowly from the spout, and partially because much of the water went down the outside of the pitcher. This usually is due to a lip design error. Either way, I found it difficult, particularly when the pitcher is mostly full, to accurately pour into a glass and to not lose any water along the side of the pitcher.4) Taste: I asked several members of the family to differentiate between the Samsung filtered water coming out of the refrigerator door, tap water (which in my area is supposedly pretty good), and water from the PUR pitcher, all at the same temperature. None was able to distinguish among the three glasses of water. Of course, much of what this filter filters out probably can't be tasted, and hopefully I don't have much of that anyway in my tap water. Needless to say, no bad taste is imparted by the PUR pitcher. I'm pleased, of course, that fluoride is not filtered out of the water.5) LED unit at the top is sealed and a button is pushed for five seconds to show filter status. Not sure how long the batteries will last, but they can't be replaced.I can't fault the pitcher for its size - big families need a lot of water, so it's nice to have this 11 cup option. However, given the weight and the fact that in big families, there might be kids around, I'd like to see a top that can be quickly snapped closed so that no water spills in the process of taking it out of the refrigerator, or putting it back. I'd also like to see a spout that provides some greater ability to pour water into a glass without overpouring or dribbling down the side of the pitcher as you slow down your pouring rate. Fit and finish is otherwise good. Stars lost due to poor pouring ability as well as high setup time compared to competing products.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17X7UT9Q5LOZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FQ8TCQ#wasThisHelpful","R17X7UT9Q5LOZP","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small wifi enabled camera is surprisingly complex. Starting out, you install the necessary app on your iPhone (or Android). I installed it on my iOS9 iPhone6 and had no difficulties connecting to the camera. Note that if you already have a TRENDnet AC adaptor, you need a different app for the camera. Once you connect to the camera, you instruct the camera how to connect to your home wifi, then you switch over to the regular wifi for your connection. The camera provides a clear picture, in full color in the daytime, and monochrome at night using an installed IR light source. The camera cannot be moved remotely, but it has a wide adjustment range whether the base is mounted on a table or on a wall (hardware is provided for wall mounting). Once I hooked it up, I found that the date/time was wrong and that the app had no functionality for adjusting that. That led me back to the printed users guide, which didn't help, and then to the more thorough pdf file available online from TRENDnet. I then connected to the camera from my Mac using a local URL. That allowed me to set the time, date, as well as more advanced video capabilities (better resolution and frame rate than the default setting). On several occasions, my iPhone app attempted to upgrade the firmware from the installed 1.0.0 version, but this failed after three efforts. Then I found that from the TRENDnet site, I could download a more current version of the firmware, and I was able to successfully install that from my Mac using the local connection. In the box is a small sticker that contains a cloud-based URL so that you can see the camera's visual output from any internet connection. Note that the camera also contains a mic so that you can hear everything going on as well. And there's a small speaker so if you wish, you can speak from a remote location. Speaking and listening both have a short delay over the internet. Obviously, the entire setup is meant to view, listen to, and speak remotely to a baby, but the unit can be used for any purpose, and with the LiveView capabilities on a computer, you could use this as an always-on security camera to watch over a remote location. Although complicated, and with firmware that isn't quite perfected, there's obviously significant potential here as well as significant functionality that is more adjustable than those of competing products. If ability to remotely move the camera is important, you'll want to look elsewhere, but otherwise, this presents an inexpensive and very workable approach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R213FBKFQO5ZRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3GKO36#wasThisHelpful","R213FBKFQO5ZRM","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 11 year old son has extensive Nerf gun experience. His first impressions of this unit were based on failed efforts to get the gun to work. It took a few minutes to discover that the energizing button works only if the dart canisters are turned to the correct position. Once we got past that, he couldn't get the darts to actually fire. The BOOMco unit needs the firing trigger to be pulled back much farther than a comparable Nerf unit. The firing trigger also needs to be pulled back more slowly to prevent jams, at least at first. And there were many jams at first. The blaster was disappointing in terms of jam frequency. There were simply too many times when one would pull the trigger with a full dart canister and not be able to fire a dart.When the darts do fire, they do so with fairly good range - about 20-30'. There is a small target provided to which the darts stick and can be removed. Darts do not stick to anything else. Definitely should not be used without eye protection on anyone in the shooting zone. My son's conclusion: It's essentially a copy of the Nerf. I prefer the Nerf gun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFE633HNRCVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TAYK#wasThisHelpful","R2YFE633HNRCVG","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trimmer includes three attachments, one that essentially gives you a haircut to a desired length, one that trims your beard and mustache to a desired length, and one that can be used on other body hair. Generally, body hair attachments for men leave something to be desired, rarely working without leaving you bleeding in several places. This attachment actually works; there's no pulling nor any slicing of skin. If you're looking for baby smooth skin, you will still have to follow up with a shaver, but if you're happy to bring things down to a light stubble, this is perfect. The beard/mustache trimmer, similarly, requires follow-up with a shave for those areas where you want things smooth. Frankly, the products out there that try to combine shaving and trimming don't work this well for trimming, and this Panasonic even has an extendable trimmer that can be used on sideburns or for precise shaping. The trimmer works well and is placed intuitively, again differently from most products and most similar to some of the older Braun shaver's trimmer extensions. This product charges fully in about an hour and will run for an extended period without getting too hot. The entire unit is washable under the tap, and oil is included so that you can treat the blades after they dry from washing, along with a small cleaning brush. Note that once the rechargeable battery has died, the entire unit is discarded (once the battery has been removed, which based on the illustrated directions is a rather lengthy process). Overall, the Panasonic is better than the competition and works exactly as promoted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ70CRD82SXDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO54PAI#wasThisHelpful","RJ70CRD82SXDA","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a North Face fan for many years but I've been having problems with their zippers on more recent coats and their newer model ski jackets simply aren't as warm as their earlier models. I figured I'd try a Helly Hansen Epic. The coat is clearly more fashionable, but is the Primaloft insulation warm enough? It's not cold enough out to tell yet, but in the meantime:The coat is a waterproof shell filled with Primaloft insulation. There are two soft zippered pockets toward the bottom of the jacket, two vertical zippered pockets at the chest, one of which has a cleaning cloth for your goggles/glasses, and two diagonal zippered segments at the outer chest which provide air flow should you become too warm. There's a small zipped pocket at the left wrist, and another inside the main zipper on the left. There is also a large mesh storage area inside the right side. There is a handliner through which you place your thumbs so that there is no open space between gloves and the coat. There's also a snapped elastic inner band at the waist (which is removable) to keep snow out as you go through deep powder. The hood is large -- too large for regular use, but perfect for coming over the top of a ski helmet. The main zipper is a bit hard to get going at first, but I don't see any problem areas like with the North Face design where the zipper can easily grab fabric and get caught. Overall fit and finish is consistent with the cost of the jacket. The material is soft where it might touch your skin, particularly around the neck.So far, so good.

"Beautiful polarizing filter. Fit and finish are perfect and the polarizing lens turns easily and smoothly. I noticed right away that light transmission is markedly improved (by about one stop) when compared to my Canon PL-C II polarizing filter. That alone is worth the price of admission. I tried out the filter on a Canon 70-200 2.8L IS II lens and had no trouble autofocusing in low light despite the addition of the polarizer, something which isn't always the case with other polarizers. The grip is wide so there's no difficulty adjusting the polarizer as you frame your shot.One thing to keep in mind: if you tighten the filter too much, it will be difficult to remove since the front of the filter will simply turn in place. On the other hand, if you don't tighten the filter enough, there's a chance that as you adjust the filter, you will simply screw/unscrew the entire assembly rather than adjust the light flow. There's a middle ground, but the light transmission on this filter is good enough that you may just decide to leave this in place all the time and not worry about ever removing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QMZ4Q3YGOZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPZGRDA#wasThisHelpful","R36QMZ4Q3YGOZR","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Construction: If you've ever built anything from Ikea, you'll find this straight-forward. The instructions are clear, the parts are clearly labeled, and everything fits together easily and smoothly. You need only a hammer and two screwdrivers - one slotted and one Phillips. The delivery box is too heavy for one person to easily carry, so unpacking it and carrying the individual parts to the site where you want the dresser is a good approach. All the parts were present, including interesting metal knobs and all the hardware necessary to build the unit.Finish: The dresser is whitewashed particleboard. It is sturdy but, like similar products from Ikea, may not survive multiple moves. If you build it where you want it, the entire unit holds up quite well without requiring glue or bonding material other than what is provided. If you look closely at the design, you see that the top two drawers have an apparent height that is shorter than the lower four drawers. However, all six drawers are exactly the same dimensions within. There is some wasted space as the sides and backs of the bottom four drawers are the same height as for the top two drawers. There's room to pile clothing above that, of course, but things might fall out when you open the individual drawers. I'd prefer to see taller sides/backs for these drawers. Also be aware that the bottom of each drawer is fairly thin material. It's fine for clothing, but I wouldn't trust filling the drawers with heavy items, such as books. Due to the overall construction approach, you will have somewhat less storage space than you would within a similarly-sized all-wood dresser. This is typical for the price-point, however.Also note, as the company points out in the product description, that this dresser has six drawers, not eight as first glance would suggest.Appearance: The overall unit, once complete, has a light and breezy appearance, perfect for a child's room or beach house guest room.

"Kinetic sculptures are eye-catching, and some of the finest out there are thousands of dollars. Take a look at Mark White's sculptures, for example, to see what the best of the breed are like. So I was curious to see what just over one hundred dollars would fetch. This particular model is composed of two designed wheels on which you bend the spokes to a 30 degree angle so that both wheels catch the wind and spin in opposite directions. The process is easy and takes only a minute. The wheels are mounted already on an assembly that screws into a powder-coated metal rod which then is bolted in place in a ground mount which can be pushed into the ground with your foot. The entire process of installation takes only a few minutes.The assembly is a little taller than your average holly bush, so it doesn't look out of place on a small lot right next to your home. It would be lost if you have more than half an acre or so. The colors stand out, and while it's a bit gaudy up close, it has an attractive and eye-catching appearance from a bit of a distance.In addition to the two wheels spinning, the unit pivots about a vertical axis so that it aligns with the wind. It takes a fairly significant wind to start the wheels spinning, though, so even in a steady 10mph breeze, I noted that the wheels would often just sit there. A good 15mph gust would start the wheels spinning. This is therefore perfect for a beach or mountain location where you're likely to regularly get good quality and constant winds. A well shielded yard, however, will likely protect the device from wind sufficiently that it won't move very much.Each of the two spinning wheels is held in place by a nut which is placed at the factory. I didn't take a good look at that, unfortunately, and in the first day, I found one of the wheels on the ground, with the nut missing somewhere in the mulch. A nut from my workshop solved the problem, but you might want to hand tighten this before you put the unit outside.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJ4JCKEZAK5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOTOI#wasThisHelpful","R3FJ4JCKEZAK5O","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By no means do I claim to be a short story aficionado; I certainly enjoy short stories, but the last place where I read one was in the science fiction magazine Omni back in the 1980s. I travel quite a bit and often grab a book to pass the time while doing so. I am from time to time let down, not finding a text to be worth reading beyond page 9 or 10, and then finding myself having to turn to other pursuits. Here, we have just over 700 pages and a multitude of stories, so already I am pleased. If one story should fail to encourage my reading beyond the first paragraph, there's another story just beyond. This is also the first time I've read a collection that doesn't follow a specific genre, nor even from the same generation. So part of the fun here is learning something about the era, reading something about the author, and then setting out into the story that follows. Obviously I can't say whether these are the best short stories ever written, nor whether they are accurately representative of each decade. What I can do is state that the overall text permitted me to enjoy the passing of several hours which would otherwise have been doomed by the surroundings in a coach seat of a modern overcrowded transport.

"Appearance: Attractive black glass top through which bright green LEDs display your weight.Accuracy: I have a mechanical medical scale against which I compared the nuyu scale. The nuyu scale appears to be quite accurate, providing weight validated against the mechanical scale, and reliably providing the same weight on repetitive measurements.Functionality: The scale itself works nicely, automatically turning itself on and off as necessary. It provides a stable base so long as it is used on hard flooring rather than carpeting. My one foot square tile surface in the bath worked well.Bluetooth Connectivity: Here is where the nuyu loses a point. The initial connection to the app is made by starting the app and standing on the scale when instructed. Your weight is transferred to the app and compared to a target weight that you've set. You may have a target weight above or below your current weight as desired. All is well at this point, until you go to use the scale again the next day. Even with my iPhone 6 nearby and turned on, with bluetooth on, standing on the scale will not cause connectivity to engage. You have to actually run the nuyu app again, and then find the unlabeled control which will prompt you to stand on the scale, which turns on the bluetooth connection. The app then displays your change of weight over time but does not transfer over all weights for which you did not connect the scale. That is, if you used the scale between connections, the scale does not store these weights for transfer when you finally do make the bluetooth connection again, such as, say, most bluetooth blood pressure devices do. The app itself does not clearly depict the method by which you should reconnect to the scale each time you use it, and the process will initially take some trial and error (hint: the little circle at the top right does the trick).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PK6XYEI3NT6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1INI7U#wasThisHelpful","R3PK6XYEI3NT6V","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wet your face and hands, pour some of this powder into hands, rub, and then use for facial cleansing. Straightforward enough and works well. This is a very mild exfoliant as well, but I noticed no scratchiness and no dryness after use. The product can easily be used daily before toning and moisturizer. In doing so, I had no irritation or redness. The powder exits the container rather like baby powder and quickly dissolves in damp hands. Once that takes place, you simply have what appear to be soapy hands but without the negative characteristics of soap or the ingredients of liquid cleanser products. There is very mild flowery scent in powder form that is nearly eliminated once the product dissolves. I noticed no significant scent on application.

"This is a cute little half-stapler that works well. Note first that it comes without any staples. Filling it is easy but you must first break the typical strip of staples in half to do so, hopefully not losing any in the process. Then you can choose to move the anvil at the base for either stapling or pinning (stapling is the usual, where the pins fold inward; pinning is the other choice, where the pins fold outward). Both work well; I found that I could staple by holding the stapler in my hand whereas pinning requires me to push down on a firm surface - that's not unusual at all. Either way, the alignment is appropriate and staples went in according to plan over the course of a day without any disagreeable outcomes. The feel in hand is nice, and the bright blue is great for a bright and colorful office where you might not want the standard black Swingline messing up your creative side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDWRTEH7K8S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PJJOP4#wasThisHelpful","REDWRTEH7K8S3","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This power strip can be wall-mounted or kept on the floor. It allows six AC cords to be plugged in, with a total draw of 1800 watts permitted before the built-in circuit breaker is tripped. There is a neon-lit on-off switch at one end of the unit. There are two indicators on the front panel, one green LED to indicate that the unit is properly grounded, and the other a red LED to show that the unit is protecting against surge. The power strip cord is thick and flexible. It has a right angle plug at the end. If your outlets are vertically oriented and have their ground receptacle at the bottom, this plug will probably need to go in the top outlet as the cord won't bend enough to clear the floor otherwise. And the cord will then cover the bottom outlet.  The 90 degree plug is definitely great for allowing furniture to be pushed back against the wall, so there are two sides to this story.The six AC outlets on the strip itself are vertically oriented, meaning that each ground receptacle falls between the top two prongs of the next plug. The outlets are rather tightly placed, so while standard three prong plugs all fit together nicely, it is more difficult to fit power adaptors next to one another. That said, some power adaptors these days are set up so that on vertically oriented strips, the bulk of the adaptor runs off to the side rather than covering up the other outlets. So before buying this, check to see what it is you're plugging in, and then figure out if you want horizontally oriented or vertically oriented outlets. There is an RF (cable TV) input and output so that you have surge protection on that line. There is no telephone or Ethernet protection here, however.Each of the outlets on the strip have child protection - a plastic tab can be moved over for each outlet.I did not test the surge protection itself so can't speak to that ability. I generally like LED indicators to demonstrate a condition warranting my attention, and to use a color code that makes sense. So here, since the on/off switch is already lit if the unit is on, I'd like a red LED telling me that the grounding has failed, rather than a green one telling me the ground is OK, and I'd like the red LED to tell me that the surge protection has failed, rather than telling me that the surge protection is OK. Ultimately, here, the LEDs go out in a bad situation, and since the LEDs go out, there's nothing calling your attention to a problem. And the red LED, which should indicate a negative condition, is used here to say something good is happening.Overall, it's a nicely designed power strip. Just make sure that the design is compatible with your plans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359VAH4KH8KNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","R359VAH4KH8KNV","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure other reviewers will discuss the speaker's qualities for HDMI connectivity and use within a home theater environment, so here I'm focusing on the other potential uses that the Soundbar and Subwoofer present. I've had the HEOS 3 in my kitchen but the kitchen is large and I wanted a wider stereo platform as well as a device that would sit on top of the cabinets without being blatantly obvious. The Soundbar provides an excellent sound stage as well as providing the ability to hide the subwoofer in a corner, thereby filling the kitchen with a superb range of high and low frequencies without requiring any wires other than a couple of AC cords. So, no, I'm not using the HDMI in/out abilities, nor many of the other capabilities of the Soundbar. But I can easily and quickly use Spotify, Pandora, or music off my iPhone or my laptop (using the Spotify application on my Mac quickly provides access to the Soundbar and my other HEOS speakers and links). The design of the speakers within the soundbar provides a wider sound stage than one might expect with instrumentation clearly seeming to come from areas to both sides of the speaker. The subwoofer equalization can be boosted or reduced using the iPhone app with ease. I found the neutral setting to be just a tad low and boosted it slightly. Classical, contemporary pop, movie soundtracks, and even sounds of nature (rain/thunder) all sound excellent; the only downside is that poorly produced material is notably worse in playback quality than better musical sources.Overall setup went smoothly, with a firmware upgrade that took a few minutes, but I was quickly connected to my network and easily able to tie the Soundbar in with other HEOS speakers, listening either individually or as a group. The provided documentation is sparse so I used the online manual as a better reference, especially since the manual gives a complete description of the many possible LED status combination indicators, a few of which I encountered during the setup process. The subwoofer is paired with the soundbar at the factory; I had no need to make any changes there. Note that there is no wire between the soundbar and the subwoofer. You simply plug the sub in directly to an AC outlet, and the soundbar gets plugged in via a converter brick.So finally: high end stereo reproduction in the kitchen without wires, without resorting to in-wall speakers, and without needing an Ethernet connection","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLZINSHVD83L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYJHH9E#wasThisHelpful","R3LLZINSHVD83L","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"32"" 720p televisions probably won't be around much longer as all the manufacturers move to 1080p as their low end. For now, though, we benefit by having this commodity level television available at a low price point. And frankly, with a TV this size, you will notice VERY little difference between 720p and 1080p. So if 32"" is the size that you're looking for, 720p is fine. Note that this particular 32"" screen is a half inch or so smaller than 32""; I'm not sure if that is universal among sets this size, but it's true here.Setup was easy. The TV comes with a base that attaches with 7 screws, or you can hook it all up to a wall hanging system (not included). The software is a little odd; I told it that I was connecting to cable, using an HDMI cable, rather than over the air and an RF cable, but it started to scan for channels anyway. After finishing and finding nothing it told me that I needed to scan for channels again. I finally simply switched inputs over to the HDMI input and all was well. There are three HDMI inputs, so connecting a DVR, a Blu-Ray player, and an additional source is easy; you also have component inputs for your old VCR. The internal speakers are perfectly adequate for small room listening, but there are audio output jacks should you wish to pipe the sound through your stereo or sound bar.The picture is very good, and if you're transitioning from an older non-HD television, you'll be thrilled. This is about the smallest size TV you should consider using today's 16:9 form factor, particularly if you actually intend to use the TV to watch old videotapes or other non-HD source material. There are several picture settings as well as sound settings, so you don't need to use the overly vivid approach often used in stores but can tone things down to where they ought to be. I saw no missing LCD colors (elements always off) nor were there any elements always on. The remote, running on two AAA's, worked well and the TV never missed a button push.My only complaint is about Polaroid itself. They simply don't have sufficient information about this model available. For example, does the TV have internal stereo speakers? Or does it mix the output down and simply provide mono output? A trip to the Polaroid website did not answer this simple question. What if I want to compare their 40"" model to this one? What advantages does the 40"" have besides the additional size? Sony, LG, and Samsung provide head to head comparisons for their own models. Polaroid should as well.Overall, a great value for the price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EVXV7WS0K1PN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RK9PYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EVXV7WS0K1PN","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two years ago, I reviewed Epson's excellent XP-850 printer, a unit that represented one of Epson's top-of-the-line models in this particular size with respect to photo output. The XP-850 uses six individual ink cartridges, each of Claria Photo HD ink, including five colors plus black. The unit can provide 5 ink droplet sizes, as small as 1.5 picoliters for a maximum resolution of 5760 x 1440 dpi. The print engine can run at a maximum speed of 9.5 ppm. A 3.5"" touchscreen is present for a direct interface. And that unit retails for $100 more than the XP-830, which I'm about to discuss.So now Epson has come out with a brand new XP-830. This uses the exact same external form, so the unit is identical in size, though it weighs a couple of pounds more. The XP-850 remains available, though as of this writing Amazon has both the XP-830 and XP-850 available for the exact same price, leading me to believe that the 850 will be discontinued shortly. So now the question is: which one do you want?The XP-830 uses five individual ink cartridges. In this case, they are of Claria Premium ink, a step down from the ink set used in the 850. Further, there is standard black (for printing letters and business output) as well as photo black, leaving you with only three color carts instead of the five in the 830. The output has the same resolution and the same drop size capability. Photos look great, and are roughly equivalent to what you might have gotten in years past from your neighborhood photo shop, but there's no question that the photo output from the 850, particularly in larger sizes, has notably superior color and overall appearance. If your primary goal with this printer is to get wonderful photo output, I'd go with the 850 while it's still available.On the other hand, the 830's print engine runs at up to 14ppm, a better than 40% increase in output speed compared to the 850. And a typical printed page looks identical on the 830 and the 850. Presumably, with text output, the 830 will simply use the standard black rather than the photo black so you won't be wasting your photo ink while printing business output. So from this context, if your primary printer activity involves printing out pages and pages of text output, with only the occasional photo, the 830 would be the way to go (due primarily to the higher speed).Note that a full set of Epson brand ink for the 850 runs about $100 (standard capacity). That's significantly more than a full set of ink will cost you for the 830. So there again is a nod to the newer 830, again if premium photo output is not worth the premium cost. Note also that the 830 has a touchscreen interface that is 4.3"" rather than the 3.5"" on the 850, so another nod to the newer 830.As usual with this line from Epson, the unit has fax, scanner, and copy capabilities as well as printer capabilities. There are multiple interface techniques, with wifi connectivity as well as Apple AirPrint and direct camera card ports as well. A built-in automatic document feeder works brilliantly for scanning, and even manages two sided scanning of up to 30 sheets of paper. Two sided scanning can be somewhat tedious, so I wouldn't depend on this printer for that if it is a frequent requirement, preferring one of the larger units with a more dedicated scanning capability.Finally, you may wish to take a look at Epson's slightly older XP-820, which is similar to the 830 in terms of output speed and overall capabilities. There is no difference in photo or text output between the two units, and while they use slightly different ink cartridges, the actual ink is identical. The 820 has the older smaller interface screen but the newer speedier output engine. The XP-820 is available now at a price cut of $50 and given that the only real difference is the interface screen, that would probably be my pick between the two while still available.I had no trouble setting up the printer, updating firmware, and printing quickly from my Mac running OS 10.10.5 or from my iPhone 6 running the current OS. Overall Epson has done an excellent job in getting rid of the few little difficulties with this printer line over the past several years. Just like a new car where it's better to wait for the second or third year of a model, once all the growing pains have been worked through, we're now well into the Epson Expression line's middle age and as a result we have a printer that will very likely be problem free from both hardware and software perspectives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJ1NQ3FGV21J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R1EJ1NQ3FGV21J","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All the artistic instruments work nicely and were in excellent condition within the box. The packaging is colorful and attractive. While the box indicates it is for children age 6 and up, our 3 year old loved it and began playing at once with a big smile. Of course, we needed to watch to ensure that the walls didn't get colored along with the appropriate paper and other canvases. All the contents are of normal size - that is, the crayons are like crayolas in size, the pastels are typical in size. Pencils are half-length, not unusual for colored pencils.

So here we have a full adhesive page, with paper stock that's thick enough to cover any prior labels or printing that you want covered. It ran through both laserwriter and ink-jet printer without difficulties, smearing, or peeling off in the printer. Most UPS or USPS labels take half the sheet and you can then just use scissors to separate the label from the receipt, which usually takes up the other half. (Avery makes adhesive half sheets as well, if that's your preference). Removing the backing paper is easy and the label adheres well to cardboard boxes, manila envelopes, and plasticized envelopes.

"Construction takes about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Parts provided allow for a single layout as depicted. Assembly is not difficult but requires considerable floor space. Needs to be built where it will be used, and deconstruction, while possible, will easily result in loss of parts and difficulty reassembling unless you've kept the directions. The track itself contains several features: a house with a door that opens as the train passes, a barrel that rolls down a ramp into the train, and an unloading platform and mechanism. There are also several ramps up and down. The train runs on two AAA batteries (not included) and pulls three cars. If the track is not aligned well, the cars will derail from time to time. We found it best if you want the train to run for a longer period of time, to simply remove the cars. Once each of the features has been used (door opens on house; barrel rolls down ramp), that's it until the next time you reset the feature (close the door and reload the barrel), so most of the time, the train will simply go around in circles, doing nothing....The instructions could be a little more clear if color-coded, but overall we made no mistakes as we went through the process. The build of the parts is reasonable and there is minimal warpage or other similar difficulties. Everything fit together well. Note that while Thomas is usually of interest to 3-6 year olds, they will not be able to put this together themselves, and they might find it difficult to control at the younger end of that spectrum.Thomas, as he goes around the circle, plays a tune, railroad noises, holiday cheer, and so forth, in a loop that can't be shut off. Run the train, and you're going to hear the little musical accompaniment.This track does not interface with standard Thomas track. Note that there is a single point on the track where a switch is incorporated. One pathway is along the circle, while the other goes immediately to a halt.

"One of the limitations of the HEOS system is its inability to utilize music sources other than those which are part of the HEOS app. So you can use Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, and others that are part of the system, and you can use music which is stored on your phone, but you can't stream from Apple Music. On the other hand, when you add this GO Pack, you can stream from anything which will stream on your phone, so Apple Music can now be utilized, this time through BlueTooth rather than through wifi.The battery pack installs easily after quickly taking off the bottom plate of the speaker. Don't forget to color coordinate your Go Pack with your speaker. Add the BlueTooth dongle on the back of the speaker and you can then either continue using the speaker in the usual manner through wifi, or transition over to BlueTooth and stream in that manner. The speaker actually did a great job keeping up with my transitions back and forth, and Spotify's app also did a very nice job going back and forth. The HEOS app, at one point, lost communication ability with all my HEOS speakers, but after leaving everything alone for ten minutes or so, it all returned. Just a little more improvement on the HEOS app would be nice with respect to returning a HEOS 1 to the wifi network after utilizing the BlueTooth connectivity. There are many helpful points, by the way, in the online manual available at Denon's website that are not present in the printed material - among which are the LED Status light explanations.The battery pack charges from the AC line to which the speaker is ordinarily plugged in, so there's no extra line necessary. It holds a charge as advertised and lasted for several hours (and had plenty more to go) on my test with no apparent change in speaker capabilities (as compared to AC power source).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119YF4WFCNRTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY93Y9U#wasThisHelpful","R119YF4WFCNRTC","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't stand grilled food. I don't like the charcoal taste. I don't appreciate the fact that most people seem to burn the surface of the chicken or hamburgers that they're making while they leave the interior raw. And I don't like the mess that has to be cleaned up afterward. But I do like to be outside on a nice day. So when Vine offered the Indoor/Outdoor grill, I thought I'd take the gamble.Setup of the grill took just a few minutes and all the parts went together smoothly and easily. The entire unit is easy to handle, pick up, and move; and stable enough for cooking. I'd like there to be someplace to hang the top, however, so that when I take it off the food, I don't have to put it on the ground. Black handles on the sides and the top remained cool throughout. The heat control works smoothly, and a small LED tells you if you've reached the desired temperature.This is essentially an electric griddle with ridges so that cooked foods have the appearance of grilled food. The griddle is teflon-coated so you can't use metal grill utensils. The size is perfect for 6 or 7 hamburgers at once.  The grease is drawn away so hamburgers have a great taste, and you cover the food as it cooks so there's a steaming effect that takes place as well. Setting the hot plate to 3 1/2 gave us perfect medium rare hamburgers in just a few minutes per side. Taste is similar to what one would expect from stovetop frying minus some of the grease. If you love charcoal taste, this isn't a grill for you. Nope...this is the grill for all of us who dislike charcoal taste!Clean up afterward was easy since I just hosed off the hot plate after it cooled and I'd disconnected the electric cord, then dried everything with a paper towel.Don't leave it outside as it's not meant to be in the elements. You can easily break it back down or store it constructed in the garage as it takes up very little room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZWCNS25P3LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUYI#wasThisHelpful","R1DZWCNS25P3LB","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steil's fictional writing is as strong and compelling as her factual writing, with which she has significant experience. The author has much in common with the text's protagonist: they are both wives of a British ambassador, both free-spirited and lustful of life and travel, and both raising a young daughter. Miranda, the narrator of the book, and her family are based in the Middle East, where Steil spent significant time. As a result, the book runs thick with realism and depth. Interestingly, there are depths through which Steil seems somewhat reluctant to explore in her usual detail, specifically those around guilt and the extent to which such an emotion can impact a relationship. By the end of the text, both the Ambassador and the Ambassador's Wife have reason to feel guilty, whether over the heartache, physical hardship, and economic disaster that they have caused one another either directly or indirectly, or through the impact that they have had on the lives of others. But there are only so many pages in a book, and here I found myself often enjoying the vivid detail and intellectual insight that Steil so easily captures. I enjoyed the book and look forward to Steil's next outing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MR4DI35UACJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539029#wasThisHelpful","R15MR4DI35UACJ","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nicely constructed hair dryer. Comfortable in hand and not too heavy for a full size dryer. Three choices of heating level and two choices of speed through switches that can easily be accessed and manipulated with one hand while drying. The noise level is not uncomfortably loud, but isn't as quiet as those models that promote their minimal noise output. There is an air filter on the back that can be pulled off (not turned and removed, as the instructions suggest) and cleaned. The unit comes with both a concentrator and diffuser attachment.

"I tried this on my own thinning graying straight hair, and then on my 11 year old son's thick, curly, and easily tangled hair. Neither of us found the gel to be particularly useful. It provides a nice sheen, and certainly settled his locks down a bit, but neither of us liked either the scent, which was a strong musky odor, or the way our hair felt on our hands. Even ten minutes after application, if I ran my hand through my hair, my hand felt sticky afterward, so rather than my hair having a clean and lightweight feel, it had a sticky feel that didn't smell good anymore.

"First of all, I have a HEOS 3, a HEOS 5, and a HEOS Link on my network already, along with a wireless Polk Omni system. The Denon speakers work wonderfully. They connect to networks smoothly (unlike the Polk, which is occasionally a nightmare to reset), stay connected, and reconnect unceremoniously after a power failure or being moved within the household. They always appear available from the HEOS app, and are always present when I use Spotify from either computer or iPhone. So kudos to whomever put together the networking software within the HEOS systems. That team deserves a raise.The HEOS 1 is very impressive for its size, particularly given the fact that it is mixing down two channels of audio into a mono output. While I thought there would be less overall fidelity, there isn't, and honestly - in the bathroom - I'm pretty sure I don't need to listen to a clear stereo soundstage. The bathroom is precisely what the HEOS 1 is designed for, what with its high humidity tolerance and specific design to be in a moist/damp environment. No, you can't put it IN the shower stall, but it's fine for the bathroom counter. Adjusting the bass/treble response is easily accomplished with the iPhone app. Volume is more than adequate, even for a large bathroom. Up to 10x10' rooms should be easily filled with the HEOS 1.This is a very nice addition to the HEOS line, with a nice design, pleasant appearance, excellent software, and great sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNY4YY12JXIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5EAZ0E#wasThisHelpful","RUNY4YY12JXIO","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't tend to use washcloths or body wash, generally using hands and soap instead, but since I have body wash handy, I thought I'd try this. You place body wash on the mesh side, lather up, and then use the pad to clean the area. The mesh and pad are both equally rough, though not too rough, with an exfoliating quality. I wouldn't want to use this every day as it might be somewhat irritating, but 2-3x/week would work out nicely. If rinsed and hung out to dry as instructed, the mesh/pad combo should last about 4-6 weeks. The packaging opens up easily, without sharp edges to the plastic.

"Seven pens: Black, Dark Blue, Light Blue, Purple, Pink, Dark Green, Red. Each pen has a friction generating eraser at the top that looks like a clicker, but you actually press down the pocket holder to push the pen out and then release it again. The pens themselves all write smoothly and easily but generate a line which isn't quite as solid or as full as with a non-erasable pen. Under a magnifying glass, what you see in a straight line drawn with the pen is a pale area in the center of the line. As a result, the colors aren't quite as bold and the lines aren't quite as dark as you would typically get. Erasing is reasonably complete and you can easily re-write over the erased area. Green and purple are both fairly dark, so rather than shouting GREEN or PURPLE, they are such deep hues that they could be confused with black ink if looked at quickly and without a direct comparison to the other colors. So ultimately this set is something of a tradeoff with less boldness than I would generally expect from a Pilot pen, but with the advantage of erasability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BCOLWP80KKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WMDLCYQ#wasThisHelpful","R39BCOLWP80KKP","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cork grease preserves the gasket and if applied regularly, the cork lasts years longer than it does otherwise. Whether all natural organic cork grease will work identically to the synthetic that I've used in the past, I don't know, but it applies easily and appears to have the same characteristics.This product is packaged like chapstick. The only problem is that, in a home where we have several chapsticks that often find their way to various locations, the cork grease could easily be confused for chapstick.

"Energy saving with respect to home windows can work in two ways; here in the northeast, when I think of energy savings, I'm concerned primarily with keeping my home warm in the cold weather. I therefore want all the sun I can get and a minimal amount of air passage around the windows. In the summer, since we don't have air conditioning, we typically have the windows open. So film on the windows won't do much to save energy in my situation. That said, I do have colors that need to be protected in certain areas, so blocking the UV radiation from fading my colors is another story entirely.I therefore applied this film kit to two windows where materials were in color-fading jeopardy. The first window is a single 31""x31"" pane. The second window had a single 15""x21"" pane, and another 15x21"" expanse divided into six smaller panes. Have you ever placed one of those small film screen protectors onto your iPhone? There's always a little air bubble or speck of dust or cat hair that immediately appears or creates havoc with your efforts. Eventually you get close but never achieve perfection. That was my experience here, though the smaller window panes were the easiest to work with. Ultimately, though, it didn't matter too much since once applied you can't really see the film in place. The air bubbles that remained weren't visible unless one looked quite closely. My windows are over 100 years old and have many imperfections in them, so your mileage may vary if you're applying the film to brand new glass.I won't know if this works to prevent fading for a year or so, but in the meantime, the film is sticking in place and cutting down on the sun's brightness a bit. So that's a start.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQZYNI98S1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","R1PQZYNI98S1H","A3JUHP1E3WUHEA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JUHP1E3WUHEA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Never thought I'd say this about a pitcher, but the design of this thing is absolutely brilliant.From the bottom up:â€¢ The filters are easy to install and remove.  They don't lock or screw in.  So they don't require much strength and there is no need for tools.* Nice handle.  Not overbuilt.  Not too small, not too big.* The well you put the water into for filtration is a nice size.  Fill it twice and you've got a good amount of filtered water.  Just stick it in the fridge and fill it again each time you use it.* The really brilliant part is the top.  You don't even have to open it to pour in water to filter, or pour out filtered water.  No clipping, snapping, or switching.  All the little openings fully open and close, water and air tight, with no effort at all.  The design reminds me of the kinds of things I find in Japan which are so useful and smartly made.* A handy counter dial on the top helps you keep track of when you need to change the filter, so no stickers or need for a pen.Generally there's no need to take it apart in any way, and because of how it's designed you can probably not bother even washing the pitcher until you change the filter.I am very pleasantly suprised at how smart this design is.  It puts all other filtration pitchers to shame.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R110IET43X1237/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9WLH0I#wasThisHelpful","R110IET43X1237","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to use as checked-in baggage for my all carbon Trek Madone 5.9, flying to Japan.SIZE: My old bag, which someone borrowed and never returned, was large enough that I could put my mountain bike in it upside down so it rested on the saddle and handlebar, without taking the bar off. This one is not that large, but it does provide plenty of room for your full size bike, accessories, and to throw in your cycling clothes, helmet, shoes and such as well.  I did have to take the handlebar off, but not remove the saddle.  I also wrapped the entire bike in bubble wrap and created a cardboard protector for the rear triangle and derailer.* Remember that you have to take all the air out of the tires before you fly your bike.  The airport requires it, and if you don't do this the tires will explode--and it sounds like gun shots, so that's a bad thing on a plane.It seems rediculous to me that these bags aren't made for you to put the bike in upside down, but that's the typical way they pack.Note that it does come with a plastic fork protector--which my wife put in the trash because she didn't know what it was.  You can get these at your local bike shop as bike manufacturers put them on all their bikes for shipping.  The bike shops then throw them away, so call ahead and ask if they have any and to save you one if for some reason you lost the one that comes with the bag.POCKETS: Besides the two very generously sized wheel pockets that run the entire length of the bag and come with two velcro straps each, there are two deep, velcro enclosed pockets on the outside as well.  These proved deep enough to put just about every small item and tool into, including my woven steel cable lock.  I placed sheets of cardboard between the wheels and the outside of the bag, which provided adaquate protection for handling by the luggage folks at the airport.CARRYING: There is not an additional strap, and none of the straps are removable or expandable.  Those handles are it.  On the other hand, I'm fairly big in the chest and shoulders, and I didn't have any trouble putting my head and arm through and carrying the bike like a shoulder bag.BOTTOM LINE: The pros use soft bags for their bikes as well without problems, but of course they have much pricier bags.  But I feel this bag provided adaquate protection for my precious and very expensive all carbon bike.  After I arrived, I took it out to inspect the bike and there wasn't a scratch on it.  Money well spent.Note that I've traveled on trains and such in both the United States and Japan with my bike in a bag like this and never had a problem or even had to pay extra.  Bikes are generally not allowed on Japanese trains for example--unless they're in a fully enclosed, bicycle bag like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5ZQUFOY56PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEILGMK#wasThisHelpful","R2K5ZQUFOY56PP","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using KT Tape after I was hit by car and completely disabled in late 2010.  Both my knees had to be surgically reconstructed with cadaver parts and titanium, and I had minor spine and foot surgery as well.Because I'm a lifetime athlete and particularly wanted to get back on the bicycle as soon as possible, I understood that if I didn't give my physical therapy far more than the prescribed amount of effort, I would have to be satisfied with, at best, being able to ride at a novice level and probably never be able to walk normally again.There were a lot of things I did which contributed to my full recovery over the long term, but KT Tape was a big part of it.  I lost strength and aerobic capacity far faster and more completely than I could have possibly imagined, but with painful and extraordinary effort those things are can be recovered.  What isn't easy to get back is the strength and endurance of all the little muscles, particularly at the joints--feet, ankles, knees, wrists, hands, and shoulders.  That's where KT Tape came in.But it is important that you learn how to tape yourself properly, because if you don't it can be counterproductive.  People see their sports heroes with KT Tape on and suddenly it becomes a form of performance enhancement.  People who don't even need tape start using it because they think it makes them look like more hardcore.Every athlete, and even non-athletes can use this product instead of medication to relieve pain or repetitive stress disorder, but you have to learn how to use it properly.  There is plenty of information in the included material, as well as on the internet.  But the best resource is to study up, try it out, and ask a licensed physical therapist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCO16VEYI34AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B8TTM8#wasThisHelpful","RCO16VEYI34AF","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in New York City, which is synonymous with both airborne grime and--you may not know this latter part--pockets of green cityscapes.  Specifically, I live near Astoria Park, near the East River and the Triborough (aka 'RFK') Bridge.  So not only does my car get it all but so do my high end bicycles--most notably my prized Trek Madone 5.9 all carbon racing bike.  Both my car and my bikes get nothing but loving care and hard driving.You know when you've entered New York City because the roads are horrible: ruts, potholes, uneven pavement.  As soon as you cross the border into New York City you're in worse conditions than if the roads were unpaved.  And this shows on vehicles, which if I were to rely solely on car washes would require that I go once a week.  That's about $80 in car washes a month just so that I can look and feel decent.So naturally I use some instant detailer or car wipes once a week, between monthly car washes.  With the car, I usually do this when I have a moment in a parking garage or lot while commuting or running errands, and on the bikes I do it about every third weekend.COMPARED TO 'GLOSSER' (My previous favorite): Until this speed detailer I had been using Glosser pre-waxed car detailing wipes, a product I started using when I lived in Japan, and on occassion I would use the much pricier Finish Line Pro Detailer.  They worked better than anything else I tried, but by comparison the Glosser wipes left white streaks of wax that were obvious, and it took more effort to really make the finish shine.  Still, Glosser was better than any other detailer or spray on wax.  I might still use Glosser on the bikes on occassion because the towels can really get into the all the curves and corners of the bicycle, but then so will a shop towel.COMPARED TO WASHING AND WAXING: Sure, washing and waxing your car, or taking it to the car wash to have it done, is the best possible option, but it's expensive in terms of both time and money.  This speed detailer gives you those results with only five to ten minutes of effort.USING BLUE DISPOSABLE SHOP TOWELS: You know those shop towels you can buy by the roll in any Pep Boys or Target?  Until now, they've really only been good for the glass on my car.  They left streaks on my finish.With this detailer formula I go once over to get the dirt off, then go back with a clean, dry shop towel to finish it off for the perfect shine.  I don't have to apply pressure, or buff any film off--just wipe and it's done.BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I tried this even though the other products I mentioned were ones I had been using for over ten years.  I've tried other formulas before, including Mother's, but never 'converted' to one as I did with this.  Try a bottle of 303 and I'm confident you will have a similar experience with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1424T0YRDZIYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K02Q2RI#wasThisHelpful","R1424T0YRDZIYK","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know I should floss, I know how to floss, and when I'm done flossing I feel great, but the string method is uncomfortable and inconvenient.  If I flossed even once a week that would be meaningful to my dental health, and therefore my health overall.  Besides, I'm a television and film actor, so I really should do it because it makes me look good on camera--and to me that's money in the bank.Thanks to this new version of Waterpik's affordable model, I am flossing regularly.GREATLY IMPROVED--LARGER CAPACITY AND POWER: I had a different model of Waterpik before that I bought in my local drug store but ended up throwing it out.  The power ran down completely after only one use and it held slightly less fluid than was needed to make it through a single flossing--so it needed to be recharged after each use and filled twice for a single use.This model is much better.  With the upgrade in the battery, I can do three or four flosses before I need to recharge, and with the slightly larger tank it holds plenty of fluid so I can floss thoroughly and do a second pass.SEEMS LIGHTER AND EASIER TO HOLD: Even with the slightly larger tank completely full, and though the overall design is about the same size, it seems lighter than the previous model.  This design is also more ergonomic.TOOTHBRUSH: I had been using Oral B electronic toothbrushes with guilty conscience because when an Oral B's brush head wears out it's not replaceable so you have to throw the whole thing out.  But with the Waterpik Nano Sonic Toothbrush, not only is the head replaceable but it's also a much better electronic toothbrush.The Oral B model is too powerful.  I would say it's like sticking a Dremel tool in your mouth, but that would be an insult to the fine tools by Dremel with which you can do very detailed work.The Waterpik Nano Sonic seems like a much more expensive electric toothbrush but at an affordable price.  Again, this is a good item to buy if you're considering paying big money for a top of the line model, but not sure if you would use it yet.  The Waterpik will certainly sell you on the idea where the Oral B may not.BOTTOM LINE: There are much smaller, lighter, and better water flossing wands out there, but they cost at least four times as much.  This is the best bang for your buck, especially if you've never used a liquid flosser before.  While I'm sure that I will one day get a deluxe model now that I'm on my second flosser, I'm extremely pleased with this one particularly for the price and convenience.The Nano Sonic toothbrush as well is much better than the cheap Oral B models I had been using until now, and for a bonus, this one has a replaceable brush head, which means less plastic items in land fills and floating around in our oceans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QP60Q46XGVAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQQ0ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QP60Q46XGVAY","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We already had a similar radio with all the same features, but in reality it hardly worked to the point that we thought all similar items might be equally useless, so we are extremely pleased that we gave it another try with this well-known name brand--Midland.RECHARGABLE BATTERY, CRANK, AND SOLAR PANEL, : The most important feature in any emergency radio is of course the battery.  The one we previously had couldn't hold a charge after being cranked up or charged via the solar panel.  We tried to run this one down to see how well the rechargeable battery lasted by turning on the radio and light, but unlike the other model it would not die.The last thing you want to be doing when the power goes out is sit there cranking up the battery on your emergency radio, or using precious and expensive disposable batteries you rather use in other devices just so you can hear the news or music to pass the time.  The battery in the Midland emergency radio is plenty reliable, to the point that you really don't need to worry about making sure it has disposable batteries in it.RADIO, LIGHT, ET CETERA: Like all emergency radios, this one has all the standard features, but unlike most emergency radios, due to the quality of the battery and general build, this one is not useless.They all have working radios, lights, and so forth, but most rely on you having quality disposable batteries on hand.BOTTOM LINE: There are a lot of junk devices out there which seem like exactly the same thing, but they're not.  If you want a reliable emergency radio, or one that you could also use daily without it failing when you really need it to work, get a Midland.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXP58TIUO9VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK74OA8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXP58TIUO9VS","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like any dental care product that allows me to be lazy and still get great results.  In this case, I get the best results.  I've tried whitening strips for example, and they work, but not as well as Colgate Optic White Platinum toothpaste.I've also tried other 'whitening' toothpastes, but have seen as good results except for one I can't recall the name of.It's not whitening to the level you would get at the dentist, but most people really don't want that.  We just want our teeth to look clean, but natural, and Optic White gives you that kind of result.Bottom Line: If you want whiter teeth but without white strips or using some invention you saw on television late one night--in other words, if you're lazy about it like I am--Colgate Optic White is as good a method as you can expect, it's noticeably effective, and it's as easy as brushing your teeth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JO10SRF87SJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KC4T3RK#wasThisHelpful","R2JO10SRF87SJB","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ADDED:I must add this in because I'm very impressed with what my new TomTom did the other day.I live in Astoria, Queens, right near the Triborough Bridge.  Anyone who has driven in and out of New York City knows the tolls are criminal.  You can easily spend $20 or more a day just leaving and reentering New York City with the exception of the Bronx, whereas tolls outside of NYC are typically a couple of dollars at most.  If I miss an exit on my way home while driving on the Grand Central Parkway, just going over the bridge and coming back could cost me $11 currently--so I always have the GPS on for those drives just to remind me not to miss the exit because a few times I have spaced out or was talking to someone in the car and that happened.But there is a way to get out, and even back in to New York City without paying a toll if you are intimately familiar with driving directions around here.  It takes longer and could cost you a bit in gas, but typically if you have the time then it's worth the effort.  The only problem is, no GPS, none, not a TomTom, Garmin, Magellen, Google Maps, you name it will provide you toll free directions out or into New York City, to or from anywhere but Manhattan--until now.Here's what happened.  I had an acting gig for the show 'Flesh and Bone' being shot somewhere in Westchester.  It's only a forty minute drive, but because of the tolls I initially decided to schlep into Manhattan to take the shuttle bus the production company was providing.  I changed my mind when I thought of the prospect of a shoot lasting until late at night and having to go home, carrying wardrobe, possibly wearing makeup, on the subway for over an hour just to get less than five miles East.So I was sitting in my car, with my brand new TomTom, and asked for the impossible--for it to avoid tolls between my home in Queens all the way to the location in Westchester.  To my absolute, pure joy, it did it!  It even gave me an ETA which was earlier than my Call Time!It was a nice, easy drive that went the long way round, but didn't cost me a cent in tolls.At the end of the day--lunch was at 7pm, so when I say 'day' I mean we wrapped at 10pm--after having offered several other actors who live in my neighborhood rides home, I was more than happy to pay the single toll back in, but this TomTom did provide me the even more impossible option of a toll free drive, back into New York City and my Queens neighborhood of Astoria.I am thoroughly impressed.  This experience alone would make this GPS a five star item.---------------------------THE ORIGINAL REVIEWI like maps more than most people, and grew up with essential map skills which have carried through to my use of GPS units as an adult.  I have multiple GPS devices which I've been using for years by Garmin, Magellan, and TomTom.  There are some GPS devices I've forgotten I have for cycling, running, hiking, driving, and just plain finding my way around.For the last several years my best buddy in the car has been my TomTom VIA 1535T 5-Inch Bluetooth GPS Navigator with Lifetime Traffic and Voice Recognition but I was frustrated with not having Lifetime Maps, resulting in a yearly charge of about $50 for maps I could have received for free if I had just bought a different model.So I was in the market for a new GPS unit, wanting all the same features of my old friend, but with a bigger screen and improved functionality.  Even though that's exactly what I got in the GO 600, even though it's the same brand, it wasn't an automatic easy adjustment, due to the following good and bad points.I've written a heck of a lot here, but not everything I could have, so if you have any questions that I didn't cover, please feel free to ask.FINDING PLACES (huge improvement): I can't even make a comparison.  This unit works how you wish all GPS units worked in finding locations.  You can look up places however you want, from the same screen, by name of business, street address, or point of interest.  It's about the same, if not better than using Google Maps on an iPad.  And once you've found the place, you can immediately add it to your Favorite Places instead of having to go to another screen--which is extremely helpful if your job, like mine as a television and film actor, takes you to different locations at different times which only need to be on your favorites for a week or two.It's very intuitive in ways that no other GPS unit is yet.GRAPHICS (better maps, tiny text, bad lane guidance by comparison): The map views in 2D and 3D are better than it's predecessor, but not as good as on, for comparison, Google Maps.  Even here in New York City, the 3D view provides very sparse building models, but the roads are much more accurately portrayed than they were on my 1535T (and who really needs 3D buildings while driving anyway).Text on the screen is tiny to the point of being difficult to read at a glance.  This is a bizarre change given that the screen is bigger and a larger percentage of it is used to display the map than on previous models.  I want to be able to look at the screen once, just glance at it, and be able to read the name of the next street I'll be turning onto.Another thing I could do on the 1535T which is apparently missing on this model is touch a portion of the screen and have the voice tell me what my next turn would be, on demand, including the name of the street.  I'll have to do a diligent search, but it seems like they left it out on the GO 600.On Lane Guidance, I like the old model better which gave me a generously sized, screen wide graphic of the available lanes, highlighting which lanes are recommended.  It would also tell me to 'stay in the right lane' and so forth, and this one simply doesn't.  Instead, you get a graphic not even as large as a thumbprint next to the name of the next street or turn.  Still far better than Garmin, but not as good as TomTom's prior models.VOICES (better): The voices are better than before, but only the default voice reads street names and numbers.  Particularly given the tiny text on this version, that's a real problem.  It basically makes all other voices--a product TomTom tries to get customers to buy--useless.Still, even the default voice is more natural sounding than before.PLACEMENT (bad): I always placed my 1535T on a friction mount directly in front of me on the dash board, right in front of the steering wheel.  I realize most people put it in the center of the dashboard, but I don't understand why.  All your other readouts--speedometer and such--are directly in front of you in the driver's seat.  Only non-essentials like the stereo and climate control go in the middle of the dash.There are two reasons I can't do this with the GO 600.  One, it's bigger, but that wouldn't be a problem if it were not for, two, this unit does not have a way to flip the screen as my 1535T does.  With the 1535T I could simply turn it over so that it stands lower and doesn't block my view out the windshield, but the GO600 has no accelerometer or other ability to rotate or flip the screen which causes it to sit too high on the friction mount or dashboard.  It blocks your view significantly no matter where it's placed for simple lack of ability to flip the screen.  Why oh why would TomTom neglect to include this feature in their new design?  It's a mystery.So I've had to become accustomed to mounting my GPS on the windshield glass, in the middle, where I have to look away from the road to view it.  If this causes an accident, I'll make sure to mention TomTom to the insurance adjusters, but I'm getting used to it.SCREEN VIEWABILITY (not as good): I immediately noticed that it's hard to see the image on the screen well by comparison when wearing sunglasses.  My 1535T had the ability to turn the screen brightness up enough that I could see it just fine with sunglasses on, whether in bright or low light, and there was plenty of room in the settings to go much brighter.  And with polarized sunglasses--who wears non-polarized sunglasses?--it's worse.  You have to make sure you've got the unit at just the right angle so you can clearly see the image on the screen while wearing sunglasses or you have to take them off to view the GPS well.I'll add though that once I became familiar with the display items and angling the unit just right, it became less of a problem.  Regardless, they should have considered this and made the unit able to increase brightness beyond the current maximum.STARTUP SPEED (excellent): The 1535T was a pain in the butt to start up.  You might press the on button and nothing would happen or it would take a long time to start up and then far longer to find satellites.  If you didn't use the 1535T for a few days, for some odd reason you had to perform a completely restart, which requires you acknowledge the terms and conditions yet again.  Then it took a long time to find satellites even when you hadn't moved from the last position you were in when you turned it off.  The 1535T also would occasionally nag the user to update new maps.  It wasn't an unacceptably slow machine, but it was annoying just to get the thing turned on and ready to provide directions.None of these technical problems exist with the GO 600.  They really worked out all the bugs.  You touch the power button and it starts up immediately.  It finds satellites in the next instant, and is quick to plot directions.  It's frustration free.ACCURACY (excellent): If there is one thing Garmin has always beat out every other brand of GPS I've used on, it's accuracy--until I started using the GO 600.  The 1535T would often relocate me on an entirely different roadway, going in a different direction, mid-travel, or assume I was on the roadway it directed me to go on if I had intentionally or accidentally missed an exit I was instructed to take.  This GO 600, even in New York City, knows instantly when I'm on a different road, even if it's running parallel to the one I was directed to take.BOTTOM LINE: I love my new GO 600, BUT the tiny text, the lack of screen brightness making it hard to see with sunglasses on, the miniaturization of lane guidance should be addressed in software updates.  Still, putting aside all comparisons, this is an excellent GPS unit and the best I've ever had for driving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIYGMHLHV8GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9UKS6O#wasThisHelpful","R3VIYGMHLHV8GG","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll upload a photo at some point--wish I could add a photo just to my review, but currently can't--to show you that this apron looks rather good even on a manly-man like myself.  And not only does it look good, but it fits just fine.I'm an Actor on television and in films (Blue Bloods, Orange is the New Black, Boardwalk Empire to name a few shows I've been on) so I know my measurements.  According to the latest from Wardrobe, I'm 5'9"", wear a 42 Regular jacket, and measure 36"" at the belly button; so I'm not small, but not huge either.BELLY FIT: So as I wrote, currently I'm 36"" around at the belly button and dropping because I've been losing weight.  This apron has waist ties which are long enough to go around the back and still have enough slack to shoe-knot tie them at the front.  I figure that altogether that makes the two ties with the width of the apron about 80 inches--plenty big enough to fit most men.I also get full coverage, so my clothes are protected whether I'm grilling steaks or working on my car.AROUND THE NECK: The strap at the top is fastened with a good old fashioned pair of D rings, placed on one side at the top of the front panel of the apron.  No clips, no buckles, no having to tie a knot behind your back.  And as with the waist, it's plenty long, so whether you're short or tall it should fit.FRONT POCKET: The first thing I thought of when I ordered this is how big the front pocket is.  It had to be bigger than a shirt pocket to be at all useful.  So I tried various common 'man-objects' in it for relative size, including a Thermos travel mug and a full-size hardcover book, but the best object for understanding size turned out to be my iPad (the model just before the iPad Air).  The pocket is plenty big enough for the iPad with it sticking out of the top, and not much else.  I could probably slip a notebook in there too, certainly a magazine would fit, but the iPad by itself fills the pocket.MATERIAL AND STITCHING: It seems durable, but it's not Carhartt durable.  The material is tougher than a dress shirt, but I wouldn't call it duck, canvas, or denim tough.BOTTOM LINE: I'm rather happy with it.  I plan on using it when I'm doing maintenance on my bicycles and/or using my fryer to make hot wings.  If it fails or disappoints in any way, I'll make sure to update this review to tell you about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TKFVCZUNWF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2RWTCO#wasThisHelpful","R33TKFVCZUNWF9","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Japan we use a lot of this style of bin or basket, so my wife and I are somewhat of aficionados on this type of product.  While the quality and design are excellent, and we are giving it the full five stars, we do have some notes about why we would still recommend going to a Japanese store to buy this style of bin or basket even if it costs more.MATERIAL / QUALITY: The material is first rate, not too rigid or hard.  It seems durable enough to withstand years of regular use without breaking.  It is also strong enough to hold water or other liquids if you want to use it as a small bucket.  In fact, I'll go so far as to write that you could rely on this bin for heavy items such as nails or batteries as well.DESIGN: Overall, we love the design.  The cutouts are large enough for even exceptionally large hands to grab the bin, and that's especially important if you want to use it for hefty items.SMALL FINISHING PROBLEMS: Our only real complaints are about there being too many sharp edges at key points.  Again, the only reason we notice these things is because of our experience with similar products in Japan.The handles are plenty large but the designers should have rounded off the edges just for comfort.  They did so where it complimented the look of the basket, but didn't bother with the areas where this is functionally important--notably the handles and the bottom--to prevent discomfort or scratches.Also, the part on the bottom, in the center, where the plastic was injected into the mold should be smoothed off or at least neater.  Just because it's on the bottom doesn't mean it's 'out of sight, out of mind.'BOTTOM LINE: A good product, but for our money we still rather go with one from a Japanese market.  If you don't have access to a Japanese market, this is the best you can expect to find--and I mean that in the best possible sense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJFLPZ2Y66VU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5NGFGW#wasThisHelpful","RKJFLPZ2Y66VU","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We enjoyed not only the flavors of these gummy candies, but the shapes as well.SHAPES: The random variety of objects these gummy sweets come in are too numerous to mention.  Unlike Lucky Charms, there aren't just a few interesting shapes and the shapes also seem to be independent of flavor--so a clock shaped gummy wouldn't always be grape for example.My wife and I genuinely enjoy the shapes.FLAVORS: Having lived in Japan, I became accustomed to sweets which are not nearly as sugary as the ones in my native United States to the point that I developed a dislike for anything packed with sugar.  In Japan, sweets generally use fruit sugars which taste much better.  Sometimes even my favorite sugary snacks are just too sweet for me here because too much sugar masks the flavor of whatever it is you're eating.  In coffee for example, I used to use plenty of sugar, and now I can't stand plain white sugar because you need too much of it just for it to effect the taste, whether it's coffee, peanut butter, or chocolate--but a little Sugar in the Raw is wonderful, because it has flavor.  Refined sugar is also patently bad for your health of course.These gummies have a good, subtle sweet flavor, no bitterness at all, and the flavor does not taste thin or watered down.  They're comparable to Haribo but a bit less sweet.TEXTURE, CHEWINESS, and SOFTNESS: Each gummy has a nice, smooth texture and the shapes don't take away from that.  In terms of chewiness and softness as well, these are comparable to Haribo, but slightly less chewy without being too soft.  They're not tough like licorice or stick to your teeth, so they're probably a good choice for people who wear dentures, partials, braces, or who have trouble chewing but can't resist gummies.Even when we kept them chilled in the refrigerator, they didn't become hard to chew or swallow.  We prefer them cold.BOTTOM LINE:  These days even fruit chews tend to be far too sugary, and the best alternative is typically gummies and the like made for athletes, but they tend to be too pricey.  I hope the Wonka gummy candies represent a trend in the United States away from overly sugary snacks for the common consumer--particularly kids.If you're absolutely addicted to jelly beans, gummy bears, and the like and wish you could switch to something less 'intense' and sugar loaded, these are a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7Y2RCR9BUSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAXNMRG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7Y2RCR9BUSH","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an actor and filmmaker in addition to writing these reviews, so when I looked up reviews and videos about this style of fryer because I've wanted one for a long time, I was surprised at how bad they were.  Most of the videos were of people talking about the fryer, but not actually using it.  The only good ones I saw were a woman showing how to make hot wings, another where two drunken roommates used this style of fryer to cook frozen fish sticks which were already cooked, and a chef who talked about this particular fryer and had great tips and information but didn't actually demonstrate it.  So maybe one day I'll make a video but for now just know that there isn't a whole lot of helpful information out there about fryers and how to cook with them despite the vastness of the internet except here on Amazon.I have seen full size professional fryers used in restaurant kitchens and tiny boxy ones used in grocery stores to cook sample sizes of food products for customers to try.  I don't know how the tiny fryers manage to get oil all over the place, but that was the one lasting impression that prevented me from getting one until now.This one doesn't spatter or burn at all.  It's as clean and easy to use as a coffee maker.NO SPATTER: It's the way that it encloses properly for its size versus other designs of home fryers which are basically mini versions of full size, professional fryers.  A mini-version fryer will spread oil around like it was made to do it, whereas this one wont spatter at all.  And yet you can still watch the food frying with the top on, or even with the top open, safely.NO BURN: I didn't understand what they meant by a 'cool zone' in the product specs until I watched a video by a professional chef.  The cool zone is the area below the heating element, inside the fryer, where the oil is.  So you might be thinking they're calling something a design feature which actually isn't, until you know why it's designed that way.If you heat the oil by heating the container, then not only will the oil be hot, but the metal surface as well.  So imagine for example if you made fried chicken in a skillet or pan instead, where the pan itself is heated.  Of course bit of food would not only cook on the surface of the pan, but would bond, harden, and solidify on it--resulting in a long, hard cleaning process of scrubbing the pan afterwards.Because of the 'cool zone,' this doesn't happen, so you never have to scrub hard to remove bits off any of the surfaces of the fryer.EASY CLEAN-UP: I don't currently have a dishwasher, but this fryer is dishwasher safe.  All you have to do is drain the oil, and either rinse and wash the easy to clean parts with a sponge, or put it in the dishwasher.  It really couldn't be easier or cleaner than this design.  Again, about the same level as cleaning a coffee maker, except in this case you can clean the entire appliance.DIGITAL TEMPERATURE CONTROL: This is a great feature because it makes a big difference exactly what temperature you fry foods at.  A little hotter or a little cooler can make the difference between whether or not your fried foods are greasy, crispy, or tender.  Without a digital temperature control, I couldn't recommend any fryer.BOTTOM LINE: Not so long ago, in relationships in which gender roles were strong, women did all the cooking, and the worst of it was Thanksgiving, when the family had to have a turkey which took over seven hours to prepare, cook and serve.  Then along came cooking appliances for guys.  Particularly for guy (I'm using a cooking stereotype here which includes me) appliances like this make the difference between whether they cook or not, and particularly whether they enjoy it or not.  Guys and appliances are a natural combination.  If we can put it in some kind of machine and the result makes us look like cooking superheroes, then not only will we cook but we wont allow others to use our toys.This is one of those wonderful toys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HU6QAOJOQC7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00489QJUE#wasThisHelpful","R2HU6QAOJOQC7D","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HANDWRITING RECOGNITION in MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, DRAWING, and PHOTOSHOP: Some time after writing this review, we discovered that, just like you would expect on a tablet, this laptop's touch screen recognizes your handwriting.  We tried it with a stylus, by finger, in English, and in Japanese.  We even tried sloppy handwriting, and it still worked perfectly.  So if you prefer to not use the keyboard, or you just don't want to switch because you have a stylus in your hand at the moment, it's very intuitively useful that the touch screen works so well.  And of course this means a lot for creative professionals like myself who draw and use programs such as Adobe PhotoShop on their computers.  Before, to get the usefulness of a brush or pen, I either had to use a tablet--which isn't as powerful or functional as a laptop--or some sort of accessory in place of a mouse which wouldn't allow me to interact with the image on the screen directly as I would do with drawn, painted, or printed material.It's a most useable laptop for creative professionals given these basic features that don't exist on Apple products.MOJO: The best comparison I can make is with cars.  You could have your choice of five different cars with similar specs, but you know it all comes down to two things--the look and how you feel driving it.  This computer has looks, power, and performance, which is why I say it's the first PC of many I've used which has 'mojo.'LONGEVITY: Sure, I could get technical about the specs, but the fact is that any computer, no matter how souped up it may be the day you buy it, is going to age very quickly.  This computer has enough horsepower and capacity that you wont feel the need to upgrade for a good five years at least, but when you are ready to upgrade you will probably want one with the same features.WINDOWS 8: I'll tuck this in the middle of the review because I feel it has to be written but it doesn't belong at the opening or conclusion of the review.  Windows, from the first version to this latest one, is a great system until you start adding things to your computer.  On Apple, you can keep adding and adding features and it wont effect the function and performance of the computer, but with Windows, the more features you use the more trouble you're asking for.  It's enough to make you want to go back to using DOS.Windows 8 not only completely ignores this historical problem, but adds to it with this new graphic based finder/desktop/proxy.  When you're a kid, and you have a lot of toys, you might have like to have all your favorite toys out at once and never put them away.  What Windows 8 does is put out all your toys, plus all your clothes, every color of crayon, and ever Pokemon character out all the time in a bizarre attempt to appeal to any and all possible whims you may have all at once.  Put simply, it's a messy collage of everything you can do with your computer, placed as a proxy for a system which has never been user friendly much less intuitive.Fortunately, you can bypass this mess, use Windows the old fashioned way, and learn to love it like an arranged marriage or the clothes your mother picked out for you.TOUCHSCREEN:  The number one thing I love about this computer is that it has all the power and convenience of a top of the line laptop, and it has a touch screen.  Much as I thought when I first laid hands on my Canon EOS Rebel T4i 18.0 MP Digital SLR with 18-135mm EF-S IS STM Lens and used the first ever touch screen installed on a DSLR, my thought was ""Why haven't all the computer manufacturers done this by now?""BOTTOM LINE: The combination of a powerful laptop with a touchscreen is something we've all been waiting for even if we didn't know it yet.  Additionally, this computer is a pleasure to use despite Microsoft Windows.If a committed Apple user has to be chained to a PC laptop for work, this is the laptop (s)he will be happy with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8ED1W8G704I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGECA#wasThisHelpful","RL8ED1W8G704I","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a cycling freak, and therefore very diligent about sunblock use.  It's important that the sunblock I use actually work all day, from getting suited up as early as 4am to going home some time in the afternoon.This water resistant lotion held up rather well for a full day as a Marshal for the Five Borough Bike Tour in New York City, which had me out there from six in the morning until five in the afternoon.My only criticism is that in comparison to my old favorite, Brave Soldier brand sunscreen, it didn't hold up as well and did allow me to become slightly red.  I will add though, I've used other Banana Boat lotions before, in far harsher conditions, and they worked just fine.  My only problem with those was that they have a tendency to degrade over a few months, after which they can cause skin irritation.For most people, this is a good all-day sunblock, though I'll take one star away for not being as durable as Brave Soldier.It's a good walking around lotion, but if you're doing sports you may want to go with something that's going to provide all day protection without having take take a bottle of lotion with you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPQD3HZCGNJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOP3MJI#wasThisHelpful","R2QPQD3HZCGNJT","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had quite a few of these, particularly when I was starving my way through college and this type of vacuum was all I could afford.Until this one, none of them had the kind of power and durability you would need to use for more than a year.In a small apartment, this has more than adequate power to be part of a thorough cleaning.  It definitely has more power than is needed for quick little pickups.It's also great for cleaning up your desk area, vacuuming out your computer keyboard, and generally making your work space more comfortable.Note that this is not a wet-vac.  Having owned several Black & Decker hand vacs, my impression is that it wouldn't be as strong and durable as it is if it were a wet vac.This is the perfect item to give to your college bound student, whether they are moving into the dorms or their own apartment.

"Update to my original review: I liked these so much that I bought a small bag of them recently--except I bought Godiva Chocolatier Assorted Classic Truffles Milk Dark White 4.25oz instead.  And I was surprised to discover that I really didn't enjoy the Godiva truffles.  They just didn't have as much flavor.  So the next time I bought Lindt Lindor Four Flavors Assorted Chocolate Truffles 19 ounce instead and think I'll have a bag of these in the fridge from now on.-----------------------These are surprisingly refreshing white chocolates.  Typically white chocolate tastes about the same as butter--creamy, sweet, and not much else--but these have more flavor to them.Unlike other Lindt truffle chocolates I've tried, these also don't have that structure of a 'chocolatey' shell which once broken away reveals a slightly chalky core--at least that's how they seem when I buy them at a convenience store here in New York City.  The white chocolates have a consistent smoothness throughout.I kept them in the fridge and treated myself to one or two a day.Bottom Line: The perfect little sweet treat, just the right size, not overly creamy or sweet.  I'm definitely planning on buying more of these in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQZZDOXVSF3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPGLWU6#wasThisHelpful","RNQZZDOXVSF3D","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good device even if you're a lifetime athlete, because sometimes you may have a few years where it's impossible to keep up a high level of activity due to life experiences, injury, or just plain misfortune.  Besides which, a lot of athletic people like to track every step and calorie.But my wife road tested this item for me, and she's no athlete.  I'm Man vs. Wild, while she's Girl vs. Shopping.  On top of that, she has rheumatoid arthritis, so sometimes she finds it very difficult to do even basic activities.GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS: That's why we were so glad, first off, to find that inserting the watch type battery in this device didn't require squeezing, pushing, or using a coin to open and close a cover.  There's a simple switch on the back which locks and unlocks the battery compartment which she found joyfully easy to use.The three buttons on the front are also very easy to operate and the display has nice, big numbers so you shouldn't have trouble reading the display.VARIOUS WAYS TO ATTACH: It comes with several ways to attach or carry the pedometer: a large clip, a lanyard wrist strap, and a clip on the wrist strap for clipping to a pocket so it doesn't just fall out and get lost.COLORS (the one CON): In Japan, where both my wife and OMRON are from, this pedometer comes in other colors including black, navy, red, pink, and white.  Why battleship grey is the only color available in the States is beyond me.  In grey, it looks like a medical device.  And as someone who was hit by a car and disabled for over two years I can tell you that the last thing I want my pedometer to look like is a medical device--like I'm crippled or elderly.  Americans like colors too people!But my wife likes it OK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDIQHSCSMDTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOGK4RG#wasThisHelpful","R1KDIQHSCSMDTZ","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After three Dysons my standards for beauty are quite high, so at first glance at the Oreck I thought, ""Wow, what an ugly, old looking machine.""  First impression, it looks like an old vacuum, and it also looks industrial like something you would use to clean up a store at the end of the day.  But looking longer and more carefully I realized it actually has all the best features of classic vacuums my parents and grandparents owned, but in a lighter and sleeker design.SIZE AND WEIGHT: The motor alone is a fraction of the size of vacuums of yesteryear, and no part of the body or frame is made of heavy steel, mostly plastic and heavy duty but light aluminum.  It's not a smaller than 'classic' vacuum, but it's a hell of a lot lighter, and the over all weight seems about the same or less than a Dyson upright.NOTABLE FEATURES:* BAG: I'm glad to see a vacuum with a bag.  After many years of empting bagless Dysons, I'm very happy with the bag.  The novelty of seeing all the dirt and hair my Dyson picks up wore off within the first year, and now I think it would be a good idea of Dyson came out with a bag model as well if that would work with their technology.  It could even be a clear, plastic bag so you could tell when it's full, but the bagless Dyson with transparrent dust bin now just seems like I'm trying to sell myself the vacuum I already own.* BUMPER: If Oreck is known for one thing, it's taking abuse.  These are industrial strength vacuums.  And part of that durability is the oversized bumper that runs along the outside edge of the body at floor level.  So when you're trying to get though the chore of vacuuming in a large space as quickly as possible, you don't have to worry about accidentally slamming it into something because neither the vacuum nor whatever it bumps into will likely be damaged.* LIGHT: It's got a headlight.  You don't know how valuable that is until you've tried it.* BIG, THICK, LONG CORD: The cord on this thing is big, thick, and durable but it's not as heavy as you would imagine.  This cord should be plenty tough to resist knicks, cuts, fraying, twisting, and everything else that can ruin your typical vacuum cord.  Dyson would never put a cord like this on one of their vacuums because it's not pretty, but like everything else on an Oreck it will likely outlive you.Only one CON: It's so loud that it seems like it's ready to take off.  It's literally about as loud as a lawnmower.BOTTOM LINE: Why not five stars?  It's a great vacuum for the elderly because the simple yet light design will be just like the vacuums that they're used to, only better.  By comparison, the Dyson has a lot of parts, switches, and requires a lot of maintenance on the part of the user.  The Oreck is simple and trouble free in that respect.  On the other hand, it doesn't actually pick up dirt as well as the Dyson, and that after all is the true purpose of a good vacuum cleaner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCXZUEQ1LQ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU19BBU#wasThisHelpful","RSCXZUEQ1LQ3Y","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You don't need to attend film school to learn to make movies.  Particularly these days, when you can carry everything you need to make a movie in a backpack or messenger bag, literally anyone with enough self-motivation and basic tools can learn to make quality films.  That's not just because the technology is now more accessible and easy to use than ever before.  Stanley Kubrik was entirely self-taught long before personal computers, and he was one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, just to name one of the innumerable examples.  It has far more to do with your ability to tell a story than with how pricey your equipment is.Most mobile devices and computers these days come with some kind of movie editing software.  For most people, who make maybe one short film a year, that's plenty.  But if you make films on any kind of regular basis, and edit them, then eventually you're going to find that you have outgrown what that software or app is capable of doing.  Even something so simple as a title screen and end credits are beyond the capabilities of basic editing software.If your computer is a PC, you might think your only option is to buy an iMac for $1500 with Final Cut Pro for another $300.  That's quite a commitment.  But the truth is, I can't think of any major function that Final Cut Pro has that Corel VideoStudio Pro doesn't for the very reasonable price of about $70.  You can actually do professional level work on this program--including color correction, subtitles, effects, voiceover, and background music.  And if you know how to use this program, the rest of them, including that industry standard, Final Cut Pro aren't very different at all.  If you can use this one, you can use any video editing software.THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIDEO AND FILM IS EDITING:Please, I beg of you, edit your videos.  Even if they're home movies, nobody wants to watch unedited video footage of your kid's school play or dance recital, including you or your kid.  You will never watch that.  But if you learn to edit, not only will you watch it, but your friends, even strangers will want to watch it too.  A good book for learning video editing, which is available on Kindle, is called,How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck: Advice to Make Any Amateur Look Like a Pro by Steve Stockman--the filmmaker, not the politician--and a great website for learning and sharing filmmaking, no matter how humble your efforts may be, is Vimeo.If you learn to edit, not only will your videos and films be better, but you will enjoy movies you pay to see on cable, online, and in the theater a whole lot more.  It's like watching a football game when you enjoy not only the action, but how the game is played.When you edit you no longer have a video, it's a movie.  Movies are the difference between listening to an Astronomer like Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson bore you into a stupor as they drone on about physics, and the hit show Cosmos.  It's not because these people or their subjects are so interesting; it's because they work with people who know how to turn their boring lectures into entertaining content.WHY ISN'T THIS A VIDEO?:So why isn't this a video review?  The fact is, I intended to make a short film just for this review using this software, but the old PC laptop I tried this software on is simply not powerful enough to edit a film shot in 1080p without a lot of waiting for the processor to catch up.I could have shot the scenes in standard definition, but didn't want to change the settings in my camera.  I do all my filming on a Canon DSLR in 1080p and usually do all my editing on an iPad using several different pieces of software.This program is far more capable of accomplishing what I really want to do, all in one program, than every program I use on the iPad combined, but I don't have a PC fast enough with enough RAM to make it work.  In fact, my old PC is starting to show signs that it can't handle basic internet anymore either.That's my one warning about the program--your computer.  If you have an old computer, make sure it's fast enough and has enough memory before investing in graphics or video editing software.  On the other hand, if that's all you have, and you really want to learn to edit films, even put it on your resume, then you can make it work with compromises on video resolution and your end product really wont suffer for not being in 1080p.  You don' t need a supercomputer, but if your computer is more than five years old you should consider replacing it.BOTTOM LINE: This is a great, pro-level program at an impulse buy, hobbyist's price.  It includes two versions to accommodate slower, older computers as well as the latest, most powerful machines, but be aware that if your computer is really old you may have to compromise on image quality in favor of accomplishing your storytelling goals.With this program, you have everything you need to make great home movies that people actually want to watch, business presentations that are engaging and informative, or even shoot your own commercials for your business that are good enough for local television or posting on the internet.And you can have fun doing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HLRPG1K1GIEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIL0SCS#wasThisHelpful","R3HLRPG1K1GIEW","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I taught classes for over fifteen years, but only a few of those years had me using chalk boards on any regular basis.  Mostly I used projectors because I was teaching multimedia, or a white board because I was teaching in corporate conference rooms.  But I actually prefer chalk.Compared to white boards and markers: chalk doesn't go dull; there's always more chalk; and you're never stuck with several pieces of chalk, none of which work, as you do with markers.  And of course chalk doesn't need to be sharpened to work at all as is the case with pencils.  With chalk, you're never standing in front of a group of people, grab the only marker in a particular color, and find out it's useless.  Chalk on a blackboard works every time, and it's also a hell of a lot more versatile than any other way to write for an audience to see.  I wish writing on my iPad had the functionality of chalk on a blackboard.With computers and projectors, a lot of things can go wrong, to the point that you could be standing there, ready to teach a class or make a planned presentation and have absolutely nothing to show your clients or students because some part in the massive chain of technology between your computer and the big screen within arm's reach right behind you isn't working.This is a top quality blackboard and the frame is nice and solid--made of some kind of press or particle board with a wood grain graphic on it.  Of course, nothing beats a solid wood frame, but this frame is good enough to stand up to years of abuse.Small and light enough that you could carry it with you from place to place or pass it around.  You could use several of them for a group activity at a training seminar.  (To add my two cents, I really don't like it when I'm an attendee in some kind of training seminar at a company and they hand out one of these odd game sets with factory made pieces which you're not allowed to mark up or take home).  It fits in my Timbuk2 large size messenger bag, though it adds a bit of height.When ordering, please realize that this item does not come with any chalk or eraser.One negative on whomever designed the packaging--the product is five stars, just something bothers me about the packaging.  The picture on the front is of a chalkboard with two sentences written on it, ""Plan dinner menu"" and ""Mail out cards"" but it was done on a computer instead of using photography, and the text is typed out.  How hard is it to demonstrate the product, on the packaging, by taking an actual photograph of something written in chalk on this make and model of blackboard?  Many restaurants and most pubs have people who write on small blackboards like this beautifully to attract customers to their business with daily specials and special events.  As someone who does both computer graphics and photography, I can tell you a photo would have been easier, cheaper, and of course better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDDHLQSN3W2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7NYKRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HDDHLQSN3W2Z","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this set because it was cheap and included the basics.  I couldn't have imagined how useful four filters would be.HOW TO USE: Basically, choose the filter which is the color the object you're viewing is not.  So if you're looking at Mars, use a blue filter; if you're looking at the Moon, use the gray filter; et cetera.You can also stack filters, because they not only thread into the telescope but to each other as well.  I sometimes use two filters for exceptionally bright objects.Especially very bright objects such as Jupiter look so much better if you use a filter.  You can really see the details.  And for exceptionally bright objects like the Moon, it makes viewing not only more pleasant in terms of detail but because the Moon is so intensely bright it's very difficult to see it through a telescope without a filter.It can be very hard to tell which filter is which in the dark, so I suggest you mark the case somehow that can tell you the difference when seen under a red light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TLGKO1P6XDY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008Y0TP#wasThisHelpful","R1TLGKO1P6XDY6","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This type of fuel wont expire.  You could store it indefinitely just for emergencies or only occasional need and it's as safe as new.  I imagine this is a good type of fuel for survivalists and doomsday preppers to stock up on for that reason, but certainly if you live in an earthquake zone where the gas to your house could be cut off unexpectedly it's a good idea to have some fuel stored.  And of course it's good for camping and cookouts as well.This is the largest canister they make.  To be specific, they all have the same circumference, but this is the tallest canister they make.  It easily fits in the pot of my JetBoil Sumo but not with any of the other parts or accessories.  Still, those other parts are small, so it's easier to stash them somewhere else in your pack than to store put the fuel canister somewhere else.If you want to get the fuel and other parts inside your JetBoil, then go with the 100gm--so long as that's all you need.  I prefer the larger canister because it keeps me prepared for the unexpected, and any little extra is a luxury while either camping or making due after a Superstorm Sandy situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYIAM92FXUWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TL6DXI#wasThisHelpful","R2VYIAM92FXUWR","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're going to jump rope, whether it's for CrossFit, martial arts, or just plain exercise, you need a proper jump rope.  This type of rope is also sometimes called a 'speed rope.'  It's a great aerobic and endurance workout, especially for people who don't have the time or desire to jog.  In fighting or martial arts forms you don't do any running, but you do a heck of a lot of bouncing, dancing, and jumping, so jump rope is a great way to get in shape for that.Most exercise gyms these days will either provide or charge you about what this cost me for a cheap, plastic child's toy.  You don't want that.  Better to own and bring your own.There are other speed ropes with the same ball bearing design made of plastic, with foam padded handles, or even weights, and I've used those, but I much prefer this wood and leather model.  The wood handles are plenty comfortable, and frankly I think they're better than padded or plastic handles because they don't flex, wear, or give.  And as for the rope itself, leather doesn't whip you as badly as a plastic rope in my experience.Right out of the box, the rope will have kinks in it from sitting in the packaging, but it will soften up after the first day of using it.  I've heard suggestions such as soaking it first and such, but mine was fine after the first day.SIZING: Without debate--because some people will troll about anything--this is the time tested way of knowing what size jump rope is good for you.  Standing on the rope or measure with your feet together and hold the rope to your body, the two ends should come up to your armpits.  I'm not saying there isn't another way to size a jump rope, but unless you're doing some specific jump rope technique, that's a good general guide.  If you're going to be doing double and triple jumps constantly, ask someone who does it how to know what size you use.  I just know that when I was jumping rope every day, without any tricks, for at least ten minutes a day, the sizing above was fine.I'm exactly 175cm (I guess that's 5'8.5"" or 5'9"") and the 9.5 foot rope is the right size for me, if that helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Y7I99VYSRQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00091RXXM#wasThisHelpful","R17Y7I99VYSRQW","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In New York City the rule is that recyclables have to go in clear or blue bags.  If you put recyclables in regular white, black, or green trash bags then that means it's regular trash and you can be fined.But typically it's very hard to find clear or blue bags.  Sometimes the stores are stocked with them and other times they will be out of them for weeks or even months.  So this last time after we were out of them and I went to five different stores including three supermarkets and a Target only to find them nowhere, I finally just ordered them from Amazon.The price is right, and with my Amazon Prime membership I had them in two days with free shipping.

"When I say 'all time' favorites I really mean it.  It's right up there with the Little Rascals, I Love Lucy, the X-Files, and the remake of the Battlestar Galactica series.  It's highly original, features both comedy and drama, special effects and just plain good sitcom sketches, and it's a show you can watch with anyone from a sophisticated book smart person to a small child.  Though I'm a sucker for any really well done science fiction genre show, I am oh so picky, and this certainly makes the grade with me.One small complaint though.  I've seen every episode when this was on television, and not every episode is available on Amazon.

"When I was growing up and camping, I never had any kind of camp stove.  I would cook things on or in a campfire, either in foil or with my rather bulky cooking set--mostly the former.  The cook set only came with me when I was chaperoning for the Boy Scouts who only knew pancakes, franks, and beans.  Otherwise: take a chunk of meat, wrap it in foil, put it in the fire; wrap a potato, put it in the fire; an ear of corn, don't even shuck it, just stick it in the fire--best corn you ever ate.  I went camping with a five star chef once, and even he used foil in similar fashion to make--I am not making this up--poached salmon out in the middle of nowhere.Coffee was always a challenge, but I always managed to make it somehow--and many of those somehows you really don't want to know.  Stoves were for novices who needed an actual 'camp ground' within sight of their cars, or professionals who climbed famous mountains I would never see.Just about every person I learned from was an old man who was in the military in WWII or Vietnam, and knew how to make themselves really comfortable in the middle of the woods.My camping days ended when Man vs. Wild married Girl vs. Mall.DO YOU NEED IT IF YOU DON'T GO CAMPING ANYMORE?  UM, YEAH, SURE, ABSOLUTELY: Well now I have this thing, which I bought pre-Superstorm Sandy but haven't actually needed yet.  I knew of course that the gas for cooking at home would likely never be out short of a major earthquake, but hurricanes were my justification to my wife for buying the JetBoil.  I really could have (almost) used it after Hurricane Irene the year before because my parents live on a mountain in Vermont and three days after hearing they couldn't get off the mountain to go to the store because the road had washed away, I was just about to head up there with an SUV full of supplies, figuring I would sleep in my Honda Element, when they called and said the power was back on and the road was passable again.  So finally I thought I should at least try using it so that when I actually need it I won't be just figuring it out then.WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?: Logically you would think you could dump a can of soup in the pot and cook it, but you would be wrong.  You can get away with cooking something that cooks in boiling water such as pasta or coffee, but you really don't want to try making mac & cheese or chili in this thing.  Just say no to putting any kind of sauce in this pot or anything that would require stirring.  As is, right out of the box, it boils water and that's it.There are a lot of accessories you can get for a more complete cook set.  There are frying pans and coffee presses for example which are made to mount onto the burner for windproof cooking, but just the ability to boil water is amazingly handy, particularly with this design.  With boiled water you can make coffee, tea, ramen, pasta, or boil some eggs.  And of course it's good for washing the dishes or cleaning yourself up at the end of the day.SIZE and HANDLING: The Sumo is especially handy because it boils a fairly large amount of water very quickly, so if you can keep boiling water so long as you have gas.Don't to carry so much gas?  Well it sure beats finding firewood and keeping a camp fire going.  Even if you used a grill and you were at home that grill isn't going to stay hot more than an hour without constant care and an endless supply of charcoal.  In terms of size and efficiency, the Jetboil SUMO is the best combination of the two.What I'm most impressed with is the ability to handle the pot without any accessories.  Those old cooksets I used as a kid all fit together into one unit, but they were big and you couldn't handle a pot or pan without a handle.  This thing you can pick right up with your bare hand and even drink straight from it.STORAGE, CARRYING, and FUEL: It comes as shown in the photo minus the gas canister.  You can fit one gas canister, any size inside, BUT if you want to put all the parts and a gas canister inside, then stick with the 100g canister because even though the 230g or 450g will also fit you can't fit the larger size canisters inside the pot along with the other parts.  Still, the other parts are rather small so I don't see that as a big deal.  I would rather carry one 450g canister if I think I'll need that much than a few smaller canisters.The fuel doesn't expire.  You can store it and forget it without worrying that it will go bad or become volatile within a year or two--though of course make sure you put it somewhere dry that it's not going to get damaged or heated up unexpectedly.  You can also use the fuel and store the unused portion until you need it.BOTTOM LINE: You don't need to be climbing mountains or have an excuse to buy one of these.  Like any handy thing, such as a Leatherman, it's something you will be glad you have when you need it, as well as a nice extra to have when you go on a picnic or other outing.  Put it in the car on road trips or when you're heading out into bad weather just in case.Also, before you really need it, make sure you have used it a few times.  Make a few lunches with it, just for practice.  That way you wont fumble with it when you're under pressure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO651M7KR1VH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EM37S6#wasThisHelpful","RO651M7KR1VH4","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's termed the iPad 4 but technically it's the iPad 6.I bought this particular model several months after its release at an AT&T store in a mall.  They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.This is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, ""That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.""  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.In fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).Will you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.  If you wait for the price to drop, then you're going to want the model after that.  And the cycle of suffering on this matter is endless.When you're ready to buy, then buy.  Buy the one you want.  This one versus the Air, personally I think the only significant difference is price, that you're not missing something.  Just make sure to buy it new from an authorized Apple dealer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13C6MJ4CO2Z3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7MS67Y#wasThisHelpful","R13C6MJ4CO2Z3M","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to make this device the subject of my first video review, but right now I just want to write something quick about it.Anyone who has been through physical therapy after surgery or an accident is familiar with this type of device.  I had always thought it was to strengthen the muscles around my knees, which were both surgically reconstructed with cadaver parts and titanium after I was hit by a car.  But it turns out it's to soften the tissues which have become stiff and painful.Even though I've had hours and hours of experience with this kind of therapy, I didn't really understand how good it is until I tried this unit.  For starters, it's just as strong and effective as the larger machine you will find at your orthopedic surgeon's physical therapy area, but--minus the belt clip holder which I personally don't use--it can easily fit in your hand.  The unit is pocket sized, and the pads on their holder are also pocket sized.  It comes with a nice little soft bag, so you can keep it with you when you travel.THE ROAD TEST: I had injured my left hand weeks earlier in a CrossFit class where we were doing power lifting, and aggravated the injury by playing video games and resting my head on that hand while laying on my side.  I was at the point where I stopped using the hand thinking that would solve the problem, but it didn't.  It had been stiff and painful for weeks.Two fifteen minute sessions with this--and this is why I want to make a video--and my hand was completely fine again.  I was blown away.  Ice and heat didn't work, massage didn't work, over-the-counter pain relievers didn't work, but the Omron Pain Relief Pro did.It also has worked well on back and shoulder aches, and as a result I'm taking a lot less ibuprophen.PRO?  REALLY?: Why ""Pro""?  Because it's virtually as effective as the unit I was hooked up to in physical therapy.  The difference is, I can use this unit anywhere.  A Physical Therapist will use a bigger, more durable unit, but functionally their the same thing.IS IT SAFE?  WILL I ELECTROCUTE MYSELF?: This is another reason I want to make a vide review, to show how if I turn it up enough it will cause my muscles to move with each surge of power, but it is neither painful nor harmful.  Even on a strong setting, the only place I felt the effects of the electricity was on the area the pads were connected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6BU3ADY83TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWLQ3R4#wasThisHelpful","RN6BU3ADY83TM","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You expect Buddhists to be happy all the time, oozing with positive vibes.  In reality, we all have suffering and it is actually suffering--the crap of life--which is the best environment to change one's karma and pursue enlightenment.  Or to use the Buddha's illustration, the lotus flower grows in a muddy (crappy) swamp; it cannot grow anywhere else.  The lotus flower also is unique in that it blooms and seeds at the same time, so as the individual gains enlightenment they spread the seeds of enlightenment in their environment, the society, and people around them.The Life is Crap t-shirt is practically a Buddhist parable.On fit: My size large fit me well even after I gained forty pounds and my torso looked like a bag of potatoes because I was hit by a car while cycling and disabled for over two years.  And it has a nice semi-loose fit to it now that I've lost twenty-five of those pounds.Quality: I suppose you could call this a medium weight cotton, but it has the comfort of a heavy weight t-shirt.  Good softness, but not too soft.  It doesn't feel or fit like silk, so it's not 'revealing', but it doesn't feel like you're wearing a scratchy burlap bag either.  Good-to-excellent quality.Graphics: I haven't had any problems with the graphics cracking or peeling, and they're not thick and rigid so they don't mess with the feel and fit of the shirt.  The brown parts of the graphic on a dark blue t-shirt didn't stand out so well right out of the box--I bought it anyway because I really wanted it--but I got to liking it.  Now that I've been wearing it several months, I don't think about how well the graphic stands out against the color.  After all, it's for me, it's not advertising.There is a small Life Is Crap logo on the back of the shirt, center of the neck, which is green and stands out well.  I like it.Overall: Didn't shrink in the wash, hasn't faded, and after several trips through the laundry the color is still even.  It's a good clothing buy, not just a novelty shirt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH2EH3SG0AY29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9LF6IM#wasThisHelpful","RH2EH3SG0AY29","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: Since I tried out this kit, I've been making chili about once a week.  I didn't realize it was so easy because cooking shows make it look like you need special equipment, rare ingredients, and years of practice to make decent chili.  But the truth is you can make chili very quickly and easily with just a few basic ingredients--and it's soooooo much better than anything you can find in a can.Literally, you can find everything you need to make chili at any grocery store.This is a wonderful starter kit, and I highly recommend it.------------------------------------------From a commercial kit, I was expecting so-so chili, but this chili is the best I've had outside of a restaurant.It makes exactly 1.5 Quarts.Doesn't it seem like every time you want to make something you saw on a cooking show it includes at least one rare, and expensive ingredient?  And surprisingly, chili has this mythology of being one of those things where you need a special mix of spices, or chili peppers which are impossible to find outside of their native lands.  Well, it turns out it is just a myth.  I'm telling you, yes YOU, that YOU CAN MAKE CHILI !!!Back when I was a bachelor, I used to think I knew how to cook, that there were at least six things which I knew how to make well.  But after I met my wife, I knew that even if we're talking purely pub food I really don't know how to make anything from whole ingredients--which is what real cooking is.  So over the past ten years, aside from making lunches for myself which strongly resemble British pub food, and my surprising aptitude for charcoal grilling (which is all about building the right kind of fire), I hardly could claim any kind of cooking ability.So one day I told my wife that I wish I could find a great chili in a take out restaurant or can, and she said I should learn to make my own.  I don't know why, but I found this project somewhat intimidating.  If it was some kind of complicated technology I could learn it quickly and teach it to others, but this chili thing had me hitting the wall.  I suppose it's because, being somewhat of a perfectionist, I didn't want to experience a failed attempt.  Besides which, food is money.  If you buy a computer program of device, eventually you will learn how to use it and it will cost you nothing to do so, but when you try to make food and you fail you waste money--and you have to clean up after yourself without the reward of delicious food.You've seen the typical chili kit.  It's nothing more than a bag of spices with instructions on soaking kidney beans, and doing some odd thing with ripe, fresh tomatoes both of which require cooking skills you don't have. How hard can it be to make chili?Not at all it turns out.Hunts made this painless.  You want to start from scratch instead?  You have to walk before you can run, so learn the basics first, then experiment.IN THE BOX: You get three cans of ingredients: Kidney Beans, Tomato Sauce, and Diced Tomatoes, plus a packet of spices.  You need these and, as it says on the box, a pound of ground beef or other ground meat.  You can find these ingredients in virtually any grocery store.DIRECTIONS: 1. Cook meat, and 2. Dump in everything else and simmer until it seems like you have chili.That's it.Now if I can only figure out which beer goes best with my chili.BOTTOM LINE: Love it.  It couldn't be easier.  A child could do it.  And once you've done it, from then on you can make your own signature chili or just stick with this one.  Your friends and family will be impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KIGQ15OVW3TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENBP2VE#wasThisHelpful","R2KIGQ15OVW3TS","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't usually put a case on my phone at all, unless I'm doing something athletic or outdoor sports.  Generally, I just stick it in my pocket.  But I pay for insurance with my cell phone carrier for all the devices on my plan in case I break them and need them repaired or replaced.  Currently, that's a top of the line iPad, an iPhone 5 (mine), and my wife's iPhone 5S.  I have a good, shock resistant case for my iPad that also looks good, my wife has a decorative case for her iPhone which barely offers any protection, and as I wrote above I usually don't use any case at all for my phone.One person I asked about why they put a bulky case on their phone answered, ""I'm protecting my investment.""  If a cell phone is an investment, it's the worst kind.  It depreciates rapidly.  Just ask yourself how much you would pay for someone's used 4S or 5 at this point.  Not much of course.But these things cost a lot of money, even if you're getting a discount.  My wife's 32GB 5S on opening day cost me $300 on paper, but there were several additional charges, so let's say it was at least $400 out of pocket.  I would be stupid not to protect this expensive item in some way against damage; but I always purchase the insurance because not only does it protect 'my investments' in terms of damage, but for wear and tear, complete destruction, theft, and just plain losing it somewhere.  Over the last several years, I've had two phones repaired and three replaced, well worth the price of the insurance.OK, but insurance is expensive, right?  That's where you have to consider your options.  This particular case, for this model of phone, only cost about $35 currently, versus fully insuring the phone for $8 a month / $96 per year--you likely spend more on coffee at Starbucks.  So if I'm fairly confident that I will never ever lose my phone and it will never-ever-ever be stolen (I live in New York City, where stealing iPhones is common) then the case seems like a good deal.  But if the case cost $60 or more, then the insurance would be the better option.Aside from cost is the case itself.  Otterbox of course is the most famous for protecting your electronics better than any other brand in terms of impact, dust, and so forth, and some people just plain love the bulky, 'military grade' armor plating because ... because ... because they just do. but I'm a bit mystified by some of the design features--for which I took away one star.If you're going to go this far to protect a cell phone why not go all the way and make it water resistant as well?  There's a plastic window protecting the Apple logo on the back while letting you display it, but no window or gasket door for the camera and flash, so obviously water, dust, and sand can still get in.  There is also no cover for the ports, speaker, and mic on the bottom of the phone, or the home button on the front.  In other words, this case is ONLY impact resistant, where as the Life case for example is also water resistant.On the positive side though, there is no problem working all the buttons on the phone even under this thick armor.  This is a vast improvement over the Commuter case that I had for a previous phone which fit loosely and made using the buttons and accessing the ports difficult.And lastly there is this great holster clip.  While I would never wear something like this on my belt, I love it for my TimBuk2 messenger bag and outdoor sports gear.  I have absolutely no worries about this coming off if I choose to have it hanging out on a strap or even clipped to a pocket--only I would have to slip it inside a ziplock bag if it started to rain.BOTTOM LINE:Consider what it costs you to buy a pricey protective case versus just insuring the phone.  At the current price, this is a good deal and good option if you're reluctant to add another $8 to your wireless bill.The phone couldn't possibly be better protected from impacts and drops, and the holster is so secure that I doubt there any risk of it falling out while maintaining easy access.The only thing that is really inadaquate about the design is it's lack of water, splash, dust, sand, and rain resistance.  I would make sure to carry a ziplock bag with me if there was any chance I would get caught in the rain while using this case on my phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3WWOXB3KSBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3SIW18#wasThisHelpful","R1O3WWOXB3KSBD","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a cyclist, so when I see an item made for cyclists I'm interested but usually disappointed because most of the time it seems they don't field test these things or ask the end users what they would change if they could.  Belkin obvously took their product to the field and listened to people who actually be using this thing instead of just putting team colors on it.Compared to the standard Belkin armband, there a lot of excellent changes.The fit is better on my iPhone 5.  On my other armband the home button is near the overbuilt reflective border so it's difficult to use, especially while moving.  This one the fit is very exact so my phone has no additional wiggle room I don't need.There is only one hole which is exactly where the headphone jack goes in.  No more poking around for it.  And the opening is tight enough that rain, dust, bicycle grease, suntan lotion, sports drink, goo, pieces of energy bar, or any of the other things we cyclists use while we ride don't have a chance of getting in there.  The original armband has many holes and they're always open.The key slot isn't difficult to access like the one on the original is.The feature I'm most thankful for is that the armband is a bit longer, so it fits my larger than most biceps comfortably.  To be frank, the original armband is very uncomfortable not only because it's too tight for a full grown adult male athlete, but the case is too bulky.This one is slim, comfortable, and when you're not using it on your arm it fits nicely in a jersey pocket or bento box without taking up more than its share of space.Bottom Line: Like the now ubiquitous bento box, and before that the water bottle, the design has now come to the point that I would choose this over mounting my iPhone on the handlebar--which I would never do.It's also great when you're riding a trainer--which is perhaps the world's most boring activity otherwise.This is a much improved, more usable product than its predecessors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UV6XIPK8XVIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMKDK7M#wasThisHelpful","R3UV6XIPK8XVIR","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish I had bought this thing years earlier.  It's worth every penny.  If you have ever had neighbors or roommates complain about how your sound system is too loud and shakes the room, you absolutely must get an isolation riser.  Carpeting will not do the job like one of this will.I live in New York City.  I rent the top floor of a house, and the current house we live in is connected to other houses on either side--so we share walls with our next door neighbors, and our floor is our landlord's ceiling.While I love my home theater system, without this isolation riser I couldn't possibly turn up the volume loud enough to enjoy it because the subwoofer would shake the floor and the sound would travel to all the neighbors.  Besides causing problems, when the stereo shakes the room it sounds muddy because buildings are not speaker cabinets.I know what you're thinking--""But I like that!  I like to shake the room.  It sounds better.""  No, it doesn't.  Trust me.  Try the isolation riser.  You'll like it.  It sounds a hell of a lot better than your buzzing, muddy sounding walls.Even with the volume turned up beyond the point that your neighbors would normally call the police, the sound hardly travels outside the room except through an open window or door, and it sounds soooooo much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNYJ31NTSKGK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001140OZ0#wasThisHelpful","RNYJ31NTSKGK9","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You might think that you don't need this item because you don't see any obvious flare or glare in your photos, but you should absolutely have a lens hood for every lens you own.  You will notice the difference immediately.  It's shocking how much better your photos look when you use a lens hood.For the same reason you can see better when you're standing out in the sun if you wear a hat with a brim--such as a baseball cap--a lens hood will allow your camera to see better.  And it doesn't just shade the face of the lens from light from above, but from the sides and below as well.Besides that, there are the traditional reasons for adding a lens hood: It makes you look like you know what you're doing, and it protects the lens from getting scratched or broken if you bump into something hard or drop the camera.  The latter reason is an especially good one because this particular $20 piece of plastic protects my $500 lens--which otherwise should outlive me.As for the price, like I wrote above this item costs $20 or less here on Amazon.  On the Canon website they sell it for $40.  Enough said about that.There may be alternative lens hoods which are the right size for your lens, but if you're using a Canon lens I recommend getting the Canon lens hood.  It fits right, it looks right.And lastly I should note that with this lens hood facing out, attached to my Canon EF-S 18-135mm STM lens, mounted on my Canon T4i, it fits fine in my MegaGear holster bag.  I do not need to turn the hood around to put the camera in the bag, zippered up, at the ready.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ABILKTZQGGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YE6FY#wasThisHelpful","R11ABILKTZQGGV","A24RT6AVJXJZHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24RT6AVJXJZHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is from Japan.  She only weighs a hundred pounds; she's kid size, and she's always looking for those small size brushes like the ones available in Japan.  Until now, all the electric toothbrushes she has looked at were too large and powerful, but this one is perfect.The head is small enough to reach her back teeth without causing discomfort, and unlike my Oral B electric brush it's not over powered.  The motor is gentle and quiet.We also like--for adults as well as kids--how this toothbrush comes with several decals, with several designs and colors so you can personalize it.The only con to note is that the handle is rather large for kids--or my kid size wife--though it's not too heavy.  This is probably out of necessity to put the right motor in the brush without driving up the price by miniturizing it.

"Ethan Canin's new novel demonstrates that plain language and direct characterization can be as compelling as verbal pyrotechnics and indirection. The portrayal of the gifted mathematician Milo Andret is an unflinching yet sympathetic, and completely believable, examination of genius and its price. This is a theme that often leads novelists down the thorny path of caricature, but Canin is able to disentangle the realities that shape the caricature and present them as they are.

"Robert Jackson Bennett's latest novel is a sequel to his acclaimed City of Stairs, which I read for the first time only a few days before beginning City of Blades. That may have been a poor choice, as the new book is quite similar in structure to its predecessor. Again the protagonist is a representative of the now-dominant Saypuri government visiting an occupied, resentful Continental city to investigate the mysterious fate of someone associated with that government. Again the protagonist discovers that an old acquaintance with whom she has a difficult history is a powerful figure in local circles, one who may end up helping or hindering her investigation. And again what she discovers suggests that the gods of the Continent, murdered by her people generations ago, may not be as dead as they seem.Of course I've structured this summary to emphasize the similarities (not all of which I've mentioned here) and downplay the differences. And of course playing with formula is part of the appeal of many ongoing series. But while Bennett's characters are as charmingly warped as ever, it takes a long time for City of Blades to feel truly distinctive, and there's a deeper level on which it can't help but lack the appeal of the first book. Part of the pleasure of City of Stairs was working out the history and metaphysics of the setting; the very nature of that universe was as much one of that novel's mysteries as what had happened to Efrem Pangyui. But this time, we already know all that. The only way City of Blades can innovate there is by giving its particular city and deity a unique and memorable identity. And while there are certainly some unforgettably unpleasant images and deliciously twisted concepts, they're thinner on the ground than they were in the first book. As a dark urban fantasy, this novel is undeniably weaker than City of Stairs. And yet in thematic terms, this may be the better book.City of Stairs set up powerful ambiguities concerning oppressors and oppressed with the complex history of Saypur and the Continent, and by focusing more directly on military realities City of Blades really digs into their ugly nature. Bulikov was seething with tension, but the occupation of Voortyashtan is an even grittier affair, and Turyin Mulaghesh's dark past, while easy to predict and rather long in being confirmed, personalizes the novel's meditations on warfare and justice. At times Bennett's characters can behave like caricatures of anti-heroic toughness, but when it counts he doesn't shy away from the psychological consequences of their actions. Its horror imagery may be less vivid, but in the long run this is a darker book than City of Stairs, its moral ambiguities harder to resolve, its tragedies more emotionally punishing. Together, they represent a substantial achievement in contemporary dark fantasy, and I'm eager to see where Bennett takes the series in the next book, City of Miracles. Readers who like their weird fiction to be thoughtful and meaningful without sacrificing entertainment value should not miss these novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EJCRMZI2NDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553419714#wasThisHelpful","R21EJCRMZI2NDB","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A twisting plot and a sympathetically understated portrait of teen despair make More Than This both compelling and moving. A boy drowns and then, somehow, wakes up, and at first that's all the reader knows. As he explores his mysterious, seemingly-impossible new environment, flashback chapters begin to reveal who he is and how he ended up in the water. The first third of the novel, in which the mystery is at its strongest, is especially good, with revelations and weird discoveries ideally paced to keep the reader hooked. Once the major questions have been answered, the book becomes in some respects a more conventional teen adventure novel with a familiar premise. But the action remains crisply described, and the boy's emotional struggles capture the very real frustration of teenagers who want more out of life than it feels like they can ever have. More Than This is another sign that Patrick Ness is one of our finest writers of literate, entertaining YA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EB2H1G1OE1UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763662585#wasThisHelpful","R3EB2H1G1OE1UR","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This posthumous volume of odds and ends not included in David Rakoff's previous collections may feel a trifle insubstantial, but the quality is high enough that it doesn't really matter. The main stumbling block is that Rakoff didn't leave behind quite enough uncollected work for a full book, so in addition to 200 pages of essays we have two 30-page transcripts of Fresh Air interviews and the full text of Rakoff's short verse novel Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish. I'm going to confess that I didn't read the latter, because it wasn't what interested me about the book and because the second couplet attempted to rhyme ""help her"" with a description of a midwife as a ""whelper."" While I'm sure the novel is lovely if you like that sort of thing, I have very little patience for straining after sing-songy rhymes. The interviews, on the other hand, and funny and insightful, and a welcome way to round out the volume. The essays themselves are generally short, and sometimes one feels that they're just getting warmed up when they suddenly end, but Rakoff is a smooth and witty stylist, and the catch-all nature of the collection allows for a range of topics and structures, from op-eds on smoking bans and Laura Bush's view of American literature to travel pieces, memoirs, and reviews. Overall, this is a nice sampler for those who haven't yet experienced Rakoff, and one more chance for his established fans to reflect on what we've lost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NN4SUNUEBLX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307946479#wasThisHelpful","R1NN4SUNUEBLX8","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These chocolates are packaged as a luxury experience, and I mean that both figuratively and literally: the packaging is gorgeous, if rather difficult to get into. But I can't say that the flavor and the texture quite live up to the branding (or the pricing). The flavors are subtler and the texture less smooth than in many chocolates, which may be preferable for some; while it did grow on me as I worked my way through the package, I can't say I came to prefer it to less expensive, less pretentious varieties. I did like that many of the flavors had light infusions of various nuts, giving a light flavoring without the gritty texture of larger pieces of nut. Note that these chocolates, while still high in fat, are less so than many brands: you can eat more than one piece a day without going over any recommended daily values. At these prices, though, it might still be better to savor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEPTHB6W91FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGI0#wasThisHelpful","RIEPTHB6W91FC","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little suspicious of this range extender, because the emphasis in the product description on the bells and whistles had a faintly desperate ""as seen on TV"" vibe. But in my case at least, it delivered on what it promised. Although there's only one normal-sized wall between it and the router, my bedroom has always been an iffy spot for wireless connections. My laptop would lose the network and need to be manually disconnected and reconnected; my PS4 would have periods where it would download at a measly 0.07 MB per second; my Bose SoundTouch 20 would buffer several times in a single song; streaming video on my phone barely worked; and so on. An inexpensive nightlight sized range extender helped somewhat, but it was still a 50/50 shot whether you'd do better connecting to it or to the original network. Now, with the TITAN-EX positioned just on the other side of that wall, about halfway between the router and the PS4, everything runs smoothly. The laptop never loses its connection, the Bose never buffers. The PS4 is at about 5 MB per second, nearly what it gets when wired directly to the router, and Netflix buffers noticeably faster on it. And I can run a livestream from Twitch at source quality on my phone, while Netflix is streaming on the PS4, without any slowdown.Setup of the range extender is very easy if you have a basic understanding of how to connect to Wi-fi networks in the first place; 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz connections can be created simultaneously. You do have to attach the four antennas yourself, but it's a simple process. Once the initial setup is complete, you can unplug and move the range extender without having to redo the settings, allowing easy experimentation to find an optimal position. A signal strength LED helps with this process, though of course in some cases the actual difference between green (good signal) and yellow (adequate signal) may be so small as to make no difference. The antennas do stick up quite a bit, so you may have to get inventive if you're positioning the extender within a desk or an entertainment center or close to a screen. This is obviously a premium-priced product, and in many cases a less expensive extender may meet your needs. But if you're willing to pay more for something with a lot of power, the TITAN-EX is worth serious consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ1UTAOY6P25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G2JUDO#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ1UTAOY6P25","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Mitchell's new novel is divided into several sections with diverse narrators, but where Cloud Atlas and The Bone Clocks told sprawling, interconnected stories whose settings ranged across great swathes of time and space, Slade House is a much more focused and straightforward (and much shorter) affair. Even its prose style shows less variety, though the voices of the characters are confidently differentiated. The problem is that the straightforwardness verges on the formulaic. The first section explains so much about what's going on that all the reader can do is watch the pattern repeat and wait for the inevitable climactic variation. The elaborate, eccentric world-building may make more sense to those better versed in Mitchell's work, but to the uninitiated it comes across as an ungainly hybrid of crackpot mysticism and bad horror movies. And yet there's a ridiculous charm there. The characters, though they're more types than people, are sympathetically drawn, and the prose is lively and involving. Although it technically has the word count of a novel, by Mitchell's standards Slade House is more a piece of long short fiction. But what it lacks in grandeur it makes up for in fast-paced, streamlined entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9ZJJVJD8XE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998685#wasThisHelpful","R1R9ZJJVJD8XE9","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey, look, it's another King game. But it doesn't have Saga in the title, its not about matching, and it doesn't very quickly become super-difficult if you don't spend money. Instead, it's a crafting-based community-building game with a cutesy tropical/pirate theme and very minimal story elements built around jokey character dialogues. You plant and harvest crops and trees, which are used as the base materials to make nets (for catching fish), backpacks (for digging ore), boards (for making sandals-- don't think too hard about that one), food items, etc. Members of your community will request particular combinations of items at the trading post in exchange for coins (in-game currency), hearts (a relationship metric), and experience points.As your experience level improves, new items and locations will become available for use, increasing the number of things you can do. Improving relationships with characters will yield treasure chests that also give coins, XP, and random items, and will unlock yet more items at one of the game's locations. You can exchange items with passing traders, who make time-limited requests that sometimes have pretty nice rewards, or buy and sell items to other players online. You can even visit other players' islands if you know anyone else who is playing the game on Facebook, which I unfortunately do not. Random treasure chests sometimes appear, as do tappable elements (mussels, crabs, butterflies) that yield small amounts of XP. Overall, there's enough to do that for long stretches of time you can lose sight of the pointlessness of the entire enterprise, which is the best that can be said for a game like this.The premium currency here is gems, which can be used to buy resources you don't have, get exclusive decorations, unlock additional slots at crafting locations so you can queue up more items, or speed up crafting. You can get small amounts of premium currency from treasure chests and from completing achievements, or get a whole bunch via in-app purchases. As I said above, I'm not really feeling like I need more gems than the game gives for free, though that may change at higher levels (I'm currently level 17). The range of items residents can request that use the same base materials means that there's room for mild strategic planning in what to make when, which keeps crafting from feeling like a slog. Limits on stored materials also prevent you from building up large reserves, though gradual storage capacity upgrades do provide some flexibility.I'm playing on an old Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and an LG Ultimate 2 phone and haven't experienced any of the freezing or crashing issues other users report. The game definitely works better on a larger screen: some tappable objects are just too small to hit on a 4.5 inch display, and the planting/reaping mechanic can be tricky even on the Kindle. Overall, I'm not sure how long it'll be before I get sick of the game, but I'm pretty happy with the free diversion it's provided so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSGYO4DYJD45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160CRV3A#wasThisHelpful","R2TSGYO4DYJD45","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The gimmick of Patrick Ness's charming new novel is that it focuses on the kids who AREN'T part of the main story in a paranormal romance scenario. The ""indie kids"" are the ones who have to face down the invasion by demons or zombies or aliens; everyone else just has to live an ordinary life and hope the school doesn't get blown up this time. There's an element of parody here, but it's mostly confined to consciously overwrought chapter titles that summarize the supernatural action, of which the protagonists are largely ignorant. In practice, then, this is a realistic YA novel with a light tinge of genre, and on those terms it works quite well.Schoolwork doesn't matter much as senior year winds down, but Mike has a lot of other stuff on his mind: his crush on his longtime friend Henna, which is threatened by mysterious and handsome new kid Nathan; the possibility that college will separate him from his buddy Jared, who is gay, descended from a god, and the best friend Mike has ever had; and worries about his sister Melinda, who is struggling with an eating disorder exacerbated by their well-meaning but hopelessly alcoholic father and their ruthlessly ambitious politician mother. Navigating these relationships, and his own struggles with obsessive behavior and self-esteem issues, is no easy task even without the indie kids' latest drama getting in the way.For all the heavy thematic material alluded to above, this is a light, extremely readable novel (I sped through it in a few hours) with a sharp sense of humor and a gift for tackling issues in a quietly realistic way. The family dynamic is especially impressive, capturing imperfect but well-intentioned parenting without any corny reconciliations or cheap moments of mutual insight. There's nothing especially surprising in the course of the narrative-- various conflicts rise to confrontation, revelation, and resolution-- but Mike is a likable yet flawed narrator whose issues manifest in believable ways across his various relationships. There's one iffy moment late in the novel, where the fantasy plot mechanics require a decision a character wouldn't make that also undermines a major thematic point, but it's tangential enough to the larger purpose that I can overlook it. This is smart, warm-hearted YA, and leaves me very excited for Ness' forthcoming Doctor Who spin-off, and eager to read his other novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148EIYQ2JKDFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R148EIYQ2JKDFW","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Umberto Eco's new novel is slim and, by his standards, slight, but it's still a playful yet thoughtful diversion from the ordinary world. The protagonist is employed creating dummy issues of a newspaper that will never exist, but that doesn't mean it won't have an impact, as he discovers when a colleague begins unfolding a conspiracy theory about Mussolini, the Vatican, and the CIA. There's not much narrative complexity here, but the dizzying charm of fringe notions takes the book a long way, and the sections about the fake newspaper offer a lot of cynical insight into how the press manipulates the public. One might wish that Ecco had taken all these thoughts on the relationship between reality and illusion, between brilliance and obsession, and woven them into a more elaborate and elegantly-structured plot, but the book is what it is, and I'm glad to have read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AJJYWBYPV2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544635086#wasThisHelpful","R5AJJYWBYPV2S","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The new kids' tablet from LeapFrog does a fine job of balancing the company's educational goals with the less-than-educational nature of most tablet features. But the first thing caregivers considering a purchase should understand is that this is not just an ordinary tablet with a kid-friendly design. As a LeapFrog device, it's limited to running the company's apps, and while they have a wide range of games, books, videos, and music in their proprietary store, it's not a patch on the variety (or the pricing) of other app stores. The manufacturer recommends the tablet for ages 3-9, and I suspect that even some kids on the higher end of that range will want more from a tablet than this can provide. The LeapPad Platinum is probably best for kids old enough to want a tablet of their own, but not old enough to want specific games or features on that tablet.Which isn't to say that there aren't a fair number of bells and whistles on this Platinum model. A 1024x600 seven-inch screen, 8GB of memory, and front and back cameras with video capability make for decent specs, and the included games have a surprising amount of depth, with achievements and a reward system that mimic, and should prove as compelling, as those found in tablet games for grown-ups. The balance between fun and learning is just right: enough play that kids in the right age range won't become suspicious or bored, but enough teaching that the educational label can be taken seriously. A mini-game in the included virtual pet app, for example, requires the player to solve four simple math problems before a fast-paced touch-based section begins. That mini-game, like others in the app, offers more gameplay time as the player progresses in the main app, allowing increases in high score that will keep kids coming back... and doing math.Pet Pad Party is probably the most substantial of the included apps, but there's also a music player with 10 included songs, a photo app that allows  kids to add lots of wacky effects to the pictures they take, and a range of smaller, more functional apps, including a notepad, a voice recorder, and a calculator. A free download of one app from a list of options is also available. The tablet is compatible with, but does not include, LeapFrog's cartridge-based learning games. Overall there's a decent amount of free content, but if you really want your child to get a lot of use out of this tablet, you'll probably have to buy more, so it's worth keeping in mind that LeapFrog apps are more expensive than those in ordinary app stores; you'll want to choose carefully to make sure kids will keep playing and get your money's worth.Because it has a shatter-safe screen and built-in bumper case, the LeapPad Platinum is slightly bulkier and heavier than ordinary 7-inch tablets, but it should still be easy for most children to carry, and will probably stand up to any damage they could inflict on it. The stylus is attached on a string, so it can't be lost. A parent control system allows limits on playtime. Its password protection is only a four-digit number, which isn't terribly robust, but even a determined child would probably give up before trying all 10,000 variations.The real question for anyone considering a purchase of this product is not whether it's high-quality--- it very much is-- as whether it's right for the child they're buying for. Some kids just won't be interested in an educational tablet that, apart from some Disney-branded content, doesn't offer the recognizable franchises of the adult tablet world. But for the ones who aren't already familiar enough with that kind of thing to be hooked on it, the LeapPad Platinum is a great introduction to the world of mobile devices, with games that are both enjoyable and educational and lots of ways for kids to express their own creativity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BFT6XCQLOGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1OQC6#wasThisHelpful","R34BFT6XCQLOGD","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A highly readable and atmospheric prose style distinguishes this supernatural romantic thriller in which the under-explained fantasy elements are the main narrative attraction. The romantic thriller plot is standard-issue stuff; it's built around the old ""which of the heroine's two love interests is the killer?"" approach, which is very difficult to do well. It's A, or it's B, or it's neither, and it takes real skill to make any of those outcomes feel like a surprise. Here the answer is so obvious that I'm honestly surprised the book waits most of its length to directly confirm it. Once confirmation comes, a rapid and anti-climactic resolution makes this first in a trilogy feel like it might have worked better as the first 150 pages of a more focused single novel. And yet the lively style keeps things moving fast enough that the book's flaws are forgivable. Narration alternates between a second-person account of the killer and his target's first person. The latter is engaging, touched with comedy, likable in the crude way of beach reads; the former is  cold, piercing, creepy without being exploitative. The only drawback is occasional lapses into the florid, most notably in impressionistic sensory descriptions of emotion (a la the title, but much more elaborate) that sound nice, but don't mean much of anything. The supernatural elements are barely explained despite some intriguing last-minute hints, and it's not at all clear how the story will progress in future volumes. But I'm eager to find out. Love is Red doesn't break new ground in its increasingly popular niche, but it's compelling enough to be worth a look all the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTLFFY89M5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062346261#wasThisHelpful","RJTLFFY89M5B","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"China Mieville's second collection includes 28 stories, exactly twice as many as were in his first. And it's one of those cases where less is more: Looking for Jake was a masterpiece, while Three Moments of an Explosion is less than the sum of its parts. It's not that Mieville has declined as a writer: his distinctive blend of the weird, the political, and the urban is as eerily atmospheric as ever. He has a gift for devising concepts that are unusual, downright peculiar, yet enormously resonant. But in Three Moments of an Explosion the conce[ts aren't consistently matched by the execution. A few of these stories are structured as transcripts of movie trailers, and many of the other short pieces feel similarly like previews of what might be done with the ideas involved. Even the longer ones tend not to develop so much as to proceed, and then simply to stop. This is an occupational hazard in the writing of truly weird fiction, where explanations and a sense of conclusion are not the point, but as his best Mieville arranges the revelation of what little exists to be revealed in a way that maximizes its impact. Here you can see him reaching for similar effect, but instead what one feels is a sense of sameness, Mieville's distinctiveness working against itself. And yet the best stories are reminders of his genius. ""The Dowager of Bees,"" about unexpected-- and impossible-- high stakes card-playing, with a thoroughly satisfying ending; ""The Buzzard's Egg,"" a melancholy monologue about the implications of henotheism; ""The Rabbet,"" a horror story that is perhaps the strangest homage yet to M. R. James'  ""The Mezzotint."" Even the lesser stories linger in the mind, more satisfying in retrospect than they were in the reading. Three Moments of an Explosion is not China Mieville at his best, but it's still a rare treat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXX2S81FR3N6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110188472X#wasThisHelpful","RXX2S81FR3N6C","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own three Bluetooth-enabled devices: a last-gen Kindle Fire HD 8.9, an HP Stream 7 32GB Windows 8.1 tablet, and an Acer chromebook. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this Microsoft keyboard and mouse works best with the Windows tablet. It's not compatible with the Kindle at all, and while the mouse works with the Chromebook, the keyboard tries to pair, responds to the passcode prompt, and then doesn't actually work. If you're curious about compatibility with other devices, there's a partial compatibility chart by operating system on the Microsoft website, though it may not be much help.If they can connect to the device you want to use them with, these are a decent keyboard and mouse that do a good job of striking the balance between size and functionality. The keyboard is bigger than a lot of Bluetooth keyboards (and, for that matter, bigger than the keyboard on my Chromebook), and feels slim and lightweight but not flimsy. The battery compartment is under the top of the keyboard, adding a nice sense of weight and balance. The mouse is basic, thin and squarish, but it responds nicely even when run along a surface as uncongenial as the arm of a recliner.Overall this keyboard and mouse works perfectly well, but there's nothing to make it stand out in comparison to other, cheaper models, especially given the variable compatibility. If you're attached for whatever reason to the Microsoft name, this is a solid choice, but otherwise, use caution unless you can get it for well below the current MSRP.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4QEQJE54C9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPKMVCU#wasThisHelpful","R2K4QEQJE54C9E","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an odd hybrid: half a conventional true crime account of the Aurora theater shooting, half a reflection on the causes of mass shootings more generally. The former is solid, unexceptionable work of its type, hampered only by the facts that the trial is ongoing and that the title document, written by James Holmes and possibly revealing his psychological state, remains unavailable to the general public. There's a tetchy quality to the authors' discussion of the delays and secrecy surrounding the trial. A cynic might attribute this to frustration that they've been following the case for years and have only gotten half a book out of it, but that would be unfair. The Singulars want a speedy resolution, I think, because they imagine that the completion of the trial and the revelation of the notebook's contents will explain the Aurora shooting, and provide answers to the larger question of why such things happen. But I'm not sure that's true, and that disagreement cuts to the heart of my issues with this well-intentioned, thoughtful book.Two members of the Singular family are credited as authors of The Spiral Notebook, but the writers' son Eric is also a major influence. In the aftermath of the Aurora shooting, the family engaged in a conversation about how contemporary society has shaped and warped people of Eric's generation. Let's be clear: it's great that they had this dialogue, and it's great that it gave the family a greater sense that they understood and appreciated each other. But the degree to which Eric's personal influences and opinions have shaped this book's treatment of an entire generation is a problem. The meaning of alternative media to ""millenials"" is a valuable subject, but why talk about Vice in particular, except that it's what Eric happens to know? I'm aware that a lot of guys think, like Eric, that Fight Club is a big deal, but then a lot of us don't. A breathless and initially baffling late chapter on the intriguing but tentative possible benefits of yoga and mindfulness because clearer when we learn that Eric Singular has taken up the practice. Scattered quotes from interviews with others in his age group give an impression of a wider focus, but one suspects they've been carefully chosen to reflect the things the authors have already decided are important.One of the many commendable aspects of The Spiral Notebook is that its social critique is wide-ranging. Gun control, mental health, bullying, foreign policy, economic stability: there's barely an aspect of modern American life that the Singulars don't take issue with. But trying to tackle all of that in half of a 318-page book means that there isn't much room for argumentation or nuance. Apart from scattered citation of statistics about the rise of mass violence and the increase in heavy use of psychoactive drugs, the authors tend to assert rather than argue, which will have many readers nodding at certain points, shaking their head at others, and rarely being persuaded to look at the subject in a new way. Personally, I found myself most frustrated by the authors' perception of my own generation as uniquely disillusioned and out of touch with the beliefs of the wider society. Young people must always confront and cope with the ways in which the values on which they were reared conflict with and complicate adult life, and I really don't think, despite a brief, hand-waving effort to explain how today's counter-culture kids are different from those of the 60s and the 70s, that the frustrations and protest movements of today are much distinct from those of the past.The real question, though, is to what extent a wide-ranging discontent can explain a disproportionately visible but small-scale phenomenon like mass violence. There may be a current ""epidemic"" by comparison to previous decades, but the absolute number of people committing acts of mass violence is still miniscule. To what extent can we assume that these deeply troubled individuals are different in degree rather than kind from their conflicted but not violent contemporaries, that they are products of a sort of perfect storm of common social failings rather than of distinctive biological or environmental circumstance? The issues under discussion in this book are important, but their importance doesn't stand or fall on their possible contribution to mass violence. Bullying is a social problem even if the idea (echoed here) that it was a significant factor in the Columbine shooting has been convincingly debunked. Part of the reason our society can't make any progress on major questions of our time is that we only talk about them after extreme, headline-generating cases. We talk about guns and mental health after mass shootings, about bullying after tragic suicides, about bigotry after a celebrity says something stupid or careless. But gun violence hurts many more people than mass shooting victims, and bullying scars even the vast majorities who don't commit suicide. In some ways the social commentary of this book might be more powerful if it were entirely divorced from the question of mass violence.To return, then, to the spiral notebook. The Singulars seem to believe, or to hope, that because Holmes was smarter than some mass shooters, and because he was studying the workings of the mind, his notebook will lay bare not only his only motivations but the logic (as it were) of mass shootings more generally. But every mass shooter is different. There can be no Rosetta Stone for their minds, any more than Eric Singular can speak for his generation. The best thing about The Spiral Notebook is its warm-hearted optimism, its emphasis on the importance of community, acknowledgement, and understanding for the general welfare. But part of understanding is acceptance of complexity, recognition that some dilemmas remain inexplicable or insoluble and that a hunger for simple and satisfying answers can exacerbate the problems it's meant to solve. This is a valuable book for those looking for an introduction to the social and political topics that surround mass violence, but its limitations make it a place to begin rather than a one-stop guide.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDP8KECDC7J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619025345#wasThisHelpful","RMDP8KECDC7J7","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection, reissued with a new preface in the wake of Fowler's award-winning novel We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, was originally published in 1998, but its stories feel as fresh and startling as if they were brand-new. Fowler is both a co-founder of and a multiple nominee for the Tiptree Award for science fiction and fantasy that explores gender, and some of the collection's most memorable stories work in that territory, including its first and last. The opening and title novella has a premise that would sound silly if stated flat-out, but it makes for a sharp exploration of the dearth of historical heroines, the fault lines that society builds into even those marriages committed to equality and fairness, and the appeal of uncompromising, audacious action in support of one's beliefs. It's also a marvelously entertaining story, with delightfully surreal overlapping plotlines and flashes of the humor that makes some readers underestimate the serious of Fowler's literary purpose. At the other end of the collection is ""Game Night at the Fox and Goose,"" a bleaker look at similar themes, in which Fowler's eye for revealing historical moments leads to a very literal take on the battle of the sexes.I mention historical moments. Some of the stories here are so thoroughly derived from fact that they could almost be speculative essays. These include ""Shimabara,"" an exploration of motherhood and religious zealotry based on a seventeenth-century Japanese rebellion; ""Lieserl,"" an eerie imagining of the long-unknown, still-mysterious first child of Albert Einstein; and ""The Elizabeth Complex,"" a dizzying look at the parallel lives of several famous and unconventional women of that name. Pop culture, literature and myth are also inspirations, whether fairy tales (""Lily Red"" and ""The Black Fairy's Curse""), Gulliver's Travels (""The Travails""), or the Lone Ranger (""The Faithful Companion at Forty""). Whatever her source, Fowler is both playful and thoughtful, pointing out the implications of tropes we often take for granted.Several stories draw on Fowler's childhood in Indiana and her time as a college student in 1970s California. ""Go Back"" meditates on memory, shifting from a kaleidoscope of pleasant recollections to something darker, while ""The Brew"" gives a supernatural twist to that familiar childhood figure, the mysterious and crotchety neighbor. It's one of the collection's less successful stories, only because its theme is the sort of tried-and-yet-possibly-not-true thing Fowler usually takes apart. ""Letters from Home"" seems to be a memoir of what the Vietnam War meant to a young man who fought in it and a young woman who protested it, but as with much of Fowler's work, a final turn reveals the emotional desperation at the heart of the recollection. And ""The View for Venus"" is both a gently comic account of single life in 1969 Berkeley and a smart reflection on the way ideas about gender shape women's self-perception.Despite my arbitrary sorting of these stories, the overall impression they give is not of discrete groups but of an imagination that is versatile yet rigorous, interested in everything and able to see to the heart of anything. Even readers who admired We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves will, I think, be surprised by the variety and the audacity of Black Glass. This genre-defying collection is required reading for anyone interested in the interplay of gender, memory, history, and fiction in our ever-tentative, ever-fallible attempt to understand the world in which we live.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GU9SNFW0XSDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399175792#wasThisHelpful","R2GU9SNFW0XSDV","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an author's note to this collection, written and published in Spanish before his award-winning novel The Sound of Things Falling but only now translated into English, Juan Gabriel Vasquez mentions a principle he derives from Tobias Wolff: ""that a book of stories should be like a novel in which the characters don't know each other."" Lovers on All Saints' Day certainly fits that bill, but it's a harder question whether that aesthetic unity is a plus or a minus. These stories of adultery, suicide, despair, and fleeting, futile connection are well-crafted, subtly creating an atmosphere of melancholy that never feels lugubrious; viewed in isolation, each story is successful as a slice of (miserable) life. Taken together, though, they feel monotonous, even stifling, and the characters' inability to solve their emotional problems inspires frustration rather than pity. Vasquez is too talented a writer for that to be a fatal flaw, but the collection is ultimately less than the sum of its parts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD6YSI2L33RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634262#wasThisHelpful","R2SD6YSI2L33RU","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The latest novel from the unpredictable, fascinating Jesse Ball offers a unique spin on the contemporary vogue for novels about how people live in an uncertain, tragic, possibly meaningless world. Its first half focuses on an unnamed ""claimant,"" a man recovering from what he has been told is a serious illness, one so serious in fact that he has to be retaught many of the basics of human society by a gentle ""examiner."" Then, after his recovery takes several unexpected turns that suggest a sinister side to the forces behind his recuperation, the novel switches gears to an epic monologue in which a grieving man explains to a sympathetic bureaucrat why... but that would be telling, though the novel's title is rather a large clue. As with Ball's last book, Silence Once Begun, A Cure for Suicide can be a strange, bewildering experience, but the thematic purpose and emotional power of this one are more immediately evident. A lot of writers give glib answers to the question of how we deal with loss, but Ball doesn't play that game; this is, in its understated way, rather a dark novel, not because its setting is a dystopia but because it might very well be the opposite. Laced with sharp, unexpected insights into the rules and meaning of human behavior, A Cure for Suicide is a dislocating yet compelling experiment that will reward patient, dedicated readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCW46YXWS8Q8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870125#wasThisHelpful","RCW46YXWS8Q8K","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a simple but effective little device for people who want to take back some space on the top of their flat-panel TVs. It really does install in seconds, if ""install"" is even the word for something that locks into place so easily. Inevitably the shelf isn't super-secure, but unless your TV is positioned somewhere it's going to shake around wildly you should be all set, especially since a friction-reducing piece of plastic is included. Also inevitably, the shelf isn't very deep; as the packaging suggests, it's ideal for small electronic devices like Rokus, soundbars, remotes, etc, but it's not a shelf in the more general sense of the word. Do note that the shelf comes in three sizes. The 6-inch is what I was sent for review, and six inches is less space than you might think.

"It would be trite, but maybe not inaccurate, to suggest that the scope of Shirley Jackson's posthumous short fiction career is an irony worth of the author herself. Only one collection, The Lottery, with its famous title story and 24 others, appeared during her lifetime. Shortly after her death her husband put together a second collection, featuring fourteen uncollected or unpublished stories, an unfinished novel, and miscellaneous other works. In the 1990s two of her children assembled another, with 54 stories. And now, some 50 years after Jackson's premature death, here is Let Me Tell You, which features not only 30 more stories but also 26 essays, and even a few cartoons. Cynics might imagine that by now Jackson's heirs are scraping the bottom of the barrel, but the wonderful thing is that they aren't. The best of the stories here are comparable with her finest previously-published work, and there's virtually nothing that feels like it didn't deserve to be brought into the public eye. For devotees of Jackson, this is a must-read, and even those unfamiliar with her work will be able to discover what the fuss is all about.Jackson's dual writerly identity-- horrific or unsettling fiction on one hand and comic sketches about family life on the other, Robert Aickman vs. Erma Bombeck-- may seem peculiar, but they're linked by a keen sense of the absurdities of human behavior and the fragility of our notions of order. She might make an angry dinner table conversation a subject of fun or a stomach-twisting exercise in social unease, but the emotional dynamics at its heart are the same in both cases. The concept of one of the finest stories here, ""Mrs. Spencer and the Oberons,"" could easily have been used for a humor piece about the comeuppance of an overly fastidious housewife, but instead her emotional life is treated seriously, and the idea becomes the basis for one of those eerie, harrowing Jackson tales in which ordinary events take on an air of supernatural menace.That story and several others have been published in recent years in major contemporary short fiction outlets. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these are the most substantial of the new stories. Some of the others are only a page or two long, and while a few are just right at that length, like the short, sharp satire of ""Company for Dinner"" and ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" others are well-crafted scenes in search of a larger context. Only the title story is explicitly marked as unfinished, but one can't help but wonder if Jackson was really done with some of the others. In any case, her command of her voice is consistently obvious, and the vignettes provide a nice contrast to the weightier full stories. Pieces like ""Family Treasures,"" about a young woman's unlikely path to self-esteem, and ""The Man in the Woods,"" another example of Jackson's mastery of the rising atmosphere of dread, are equal to anything she published while alive. Even the works segregated in a section headed ""Early Stories"" are rewarding, and show her dealing more than in later work with the social consequences of World War II, though the signature style is less developed.The stories are about two-thirds of the collection, with the essays and those mysterious ""other writings"" making up the balance. They're divided into three sections: ""Essays and Reviews,"" ""Humor and Family,"" and ""About the Craft of Writing."" A pedant would point out that several items in the first section are in fact humorous essays about family life and might have fit better in the second, but quibbles aside, one is most struck by how well-observed the more serious essays are. They're brief, but within a few pages Jackson makes astute comments on topics as diverse as clowns, Dr. Seuss, and Samuel Richardson, and her explication of her own work reveals a writer very conscious of how she achieves her effects. I wish more such work had been included, if it exists. The domestic humor is, of course, perfectly executed, and, for those of us who like that sort of thing, laugh-out-loud funny.The range of writings included here may be a matter of necessity-- probably at this point there wasn't enough quality unpublished work of any one type to make up a full book-- but its effect is to give readers a fuller awareness of Jackson's personality. More than an eccentric horror writer or a harried housewife-humorist, she was a complex and fascinating woman, and this collection does more than any one previous gathering of her writings to capture that. No matter why Shirley Jackson interests you, Let Me Tell You is essential reading. And if she doesn't interest you yet, it's a good way to change that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWU0F116FWWYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997662#wasThisHelpful","RWU0F116FWWYX","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first-person narration of Nnedi Okorafor's new novel has an artlessness that is both endearing and a striking and successful contrast with its mythic events. As a cautionary tale of a dystopian future, it can hardly claim to break new ground, but its fast pace and its humanist vision will make it a rewarding experience even for those who find its science-run-amok premise all too familiar, and who wonder how original a novel about an escaped, vengeful genetic experiment can be. To say too much more about the course of events would deprive the reader of the pleasure of discovering them for herself, but the grand scope of the story fits surprisingly well into little more than 200 pages. The Book of Phoenix is a rewarding saga from a well-regarded new voice in science fiction and fantasy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1C93VAIZTKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756410193#wasThisHelpful","R1G1C93VAIZTKP","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first novel by the much-praised short fiction writer Ken Liu is a study in contrasts. Its prose ranges from striking poetic imagery to oddly colorless exposition and stilted dialogue, while its fascinating Asian-influenced fantasy setting is host to a rather unimaginative, if ""epic,"" fantasy plotline. Thematic questions of power and morality are not exactly new territory for this subgenre, but Liu frames them somewhat differently from many of his contemporaries. Readers who come to The Grace of Kings expecting the breathtaking innovation that hype has promised may be disappointed, but this is nonetheless a novel to which epic fantasy audiences should give due consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTZKSI85243W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481424270#wasThisHelpful","R2GTZKSI85243W","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian Catling's first novel is one of those fantasies in which language is less a means of communication than an end in itself, the kind of thing where words are used more to evoke and induce emotions than because they make a great deal of literal sense. The blend of literary fiction, history and fantasy here is an unusual one, but some readers will find it instinctively appealing, and for them, The Vorrh will be one of those experiences in which strangeness, even frustration, is part of the pleasure. Some books cannot be reviewed in the traditional sense. The Vorrh is one of them. Most people will, I think, know after reading a few pages that it's not the book for them. Those who are less certain should journey, like the characters, into the dark heart of this unlikely and dangerous forest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWLANX6XYQ4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101873787#wasThisHelpful","RTWLANX6XYQ4Q","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert McCammon's new novel has a disturbing vividness that its awkward prose can't dispel. Earth has become a battleground for two alien species so mysterious and powerful that, as one character observes, their technology is reminiscent of Clarke's ""indistinguishable from magic"" dictum. As if avoiding skirmishes between the Gorgons and the Cyphers wasn't challenge enough, the beleaguered remnant of humanity also faces diminishing resources and the nightly threat of the Gray Men, mutated humans who have become ravenous zombies. Into one survivor community hanging on by a thread comes ""Ethan Gaines,"" an amnesiac boy with unusual injuries and even more unusual talents. His abilities may save the community-- if they aren't part of an elaborate alien trap.You may gather from this plot summary that The Border is as much a horror novel as apocalyptic SF, in the vein of The Stand or McCammon's own 1980s bestseller Swan Song. And McCammon certainly has the imagination to make that work: the aliens themselves, their vessels, their weapons, the Grey Man are all viscerally unsettling in their different ways, and even the ordinary decay of the ravaged setting is described in ways that contribute to an atmosphere of consistent disquiet, and keep the largely predictable plot mechanics compelling. It's true that McCammon's prose is technically clunky-- awkward syntax, jarring POV hops, and other minor but regular distractions from the flow of the narrative-- but many readers will feel as I do that this pulpy quality isn't enough to dispel the novel's dark charm. If you loved the mass market horror of the 80s and 90s, The Border will be right up your alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8B4SZR6W2IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067039#wasThisHelpful","R3K8B4SZR6W2IX","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chris Beckett returns to the setting of his Arthur C. Clarke Award winner Dark Eden in a new novel that shares many of its predecessor's strengths and weaknesses. It's been several generations since John Redlantern changed the way of life of the humans stranded on the strange planet known as Eden, and the society has continued to evolve. But there are outposts that are little changed from John's time, and it's from one of those that heroine Starlight Brooking comes. She wants something more than the peaceful but monotonous life of Knee Tree Grounds, and she'll get it, in ways that have potential to change Eden as much as John Redlantern ever did.As in Dark Eden, Beckett is interested in the ironies and ambiguities of leadership and social evolution: the line between altruism and self-interest, the question of where power really rests, and the discontents of a developing civilization. And as in Dark Eden, one can admire his exploration of those topics while feeling that the novel is longer than it needs to be to do them justice. The narrative structure here could do with some streamlining. The most noticeable difference between Mother of Eden and the earlier novel, apart from a welcome reduction in the characters' verbal tics, is that the sense of the strangeness of Eden is lost, both because the setting is no longer new to readers and because humanity has begun to tame and industrialize the planet. What is lost in ""sense of wonder,"" though, is made up for in the fascination of seeing how the society of Eden has changed. I'm not sure I agree with the model Beckett presents or the conclusions he may draw from it, but his touch is light enough that I might well be wrong about those conclusions, which makes for a welcome change from more heavy-handed politically themed science fiction. And there's a simple but very real narrative pleasure in the scope of a centuries-spanning saga like this. I don't know whether Beckett plans to write more about Eden, but if he does, I'll certainly be reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFHHPR6JL8HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138702#wasThisHelpful","RIFHHPR6JL8HD","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The phenomenon of contemporary, Internet-driven public shaming is an important one, very much in need of a searching and comprehensive analysis. Jon Ronson's latest is not that book. It is, like most of Ronson's work, cheerfully lightweight, casually researched, hollowly opinionated, more concerned with entertaining than informing. With certain topics, this approach works. Here, it falls badly short, in no small part because Ronson feels an evident passion for the subject that isn't matched by his interpretive skill. Like a lot of people, he thought public shaming was good when he sympathized more with the shamers than the shamed, and changed his mind when the reverse was true. His personal sympathy for certain targets of shaming (many of whom spoke only to him and refused all other journalists, a situation that should perhaps have inspired some self-reflection on his part) prevents an even-handed analysis of what they did, and more importantly of why they inspired so great a response. He analyzes public shaming largely in terms of unflattering theories of group psychology, which is unrewarding not solely because his treatment of them is haphazard-- I share his doubts about the Zimbardo experiment, but citing personal experience with a teething baby and a cramped cruise ship is certainly not a rebuttal of it-- but also because it ignores the larger factors at work in the shamings with which he deals.At issue is less the nominal source of the shaming-- plagiarism and other journalistic sloppiness, a joke making light of AIDS and racism, a goofy photo taken at a military cemetery-- and more the larger frustrations for which the shaming provides an (often inappropriate) outlet. Ronson quotes a number of nasty tweets about Jonah Lehrer that were, in a remarkably ill-advised move, streamed in front of Lehrer during a public apology. Ronson's focus is on how bad this makes Lehrer feel; in one of many signs of an inability to be an evenhanded judge of scope and severity, he compares it to a public whipping. But what is striking about the tweets, once one gets past the nastiness we feel free to express about people we don't know, is that some of them criticize Lehrer not merely for his widely-publicized errors and failures of attribution, but also for writing glib, simplistic pop-psychology, trite work of which his specific failings were seen as symptomatic.And for which, one might add, he was well-paid. Ronson mentions the controversy over Lehrher receiving $20,000 for that apology speech, and quotes Lehrer as defending it by saying that he hadn't earned any money in months and had bills to pay. Elsewhere in the book, he mentions Lehrer having purchased a house for 2.25 million dollars. The point here is not that wealthy people can't be worried about their bills, but that Lehrer had acquired a fine lifestyle with his fraudulent work, and that an apology that continued both the work and the compensation hinted Lehrer was not remorseful enough about his actions to feel they should have any consequences. That Lehrer was pushing a new book proposal a scant four months later is likewise suggestive. Ronson, driven by personal sympathy with Lehrer, takes the criticism of Lehrer as an overblown ruining of his life, never stopping to consider that Lehrer, who has a different new book coming out this year, had perhaps not been permanently ruined, and that the criticism of Lehrer was in fact fueled partly by an awareness that it would have little concrete effect.Ronson is capable of acknowledging in generalities the way power disparities like this can fuel public shaming, but doesn't do enough thinking about how they shape the particular shamings about which he writes. He is endlessly sympathetic with Justine Sacco, whose Twitter joke about AIDS in Africa set off a short but vicious shaming that ended in her losing her job. The repeated declarations that she did nothing wrong may irk even those who feel that the response to her callous attempt at humor was greatly excessive, but the real problem is his failure to engage with the larger debate about dark humor and social issues into which the Sacco incident fits. Related concerns about social justice and inclusiveness are in play with the case of Adria Richards, whose tweet about men making crude jokes during a computer conference led to an Internet controversy and the firing from their respective jobs of Richards and one of the men. Ronson doesn't get into these larger issues, and is rather coldly uncomprehending (and unaware of what the ad hominem fallacy actually entails) when Richards tries to explain them to him during an interview.I could go on like this, but I think the point has been made: Ronson doesn't really dig deep into anything, relying on instinctive responses and surface explanations. This makes for a book that is very readable and frequently entertaining; the second half, which moves from describing individual shamings to consideration of the wider role and utility of shame in social life, is less repetitive and rather more enjoyable. If you happen to agree with Ronson's take on everything he discusses, you may even find it insightful. For myself, I can't escape the feeling that what Ronson has produced here is, for such an important subject, the wrong kind of personally-inflected journalism: work in which the character and style of the author, rather than livening up a careful and balanced account, becomes the focus and the true subject. There's a fair amount of interesting and valuable information here, but the overall perspective is sorely lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO54I4GAWZS02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487138#wasThisHelpful","RO54I4GAWZS02","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lani Guinier's very short new book offers a forceful but less than comprehensive critique of contemporary notions of personal and educational merit. For all its brevity, the book is surprisingly loose in focus, moving from a critique of the culture of college admissions to an exploration of educational alternatives to a discussion of other areas in which a changed conception of merit might have positive results for society as a whole. This breadth corresponds to a lack of depth that may make her arguments less convincing for those who haven't encountered them in other contexts, and don't instinctively understand the malleability of admissions criteria, the importance of mindset and support networks for the development of intelligence, the ways in which evidently-neutral exams are shaped by the social context of those for whom they're designed, etc. Such readers may wonder, for example, why Guinier considers government-mandated standardized tests a more reliable metric of performance than the SAT, or wish for a more developed model of how democratic merit can be identified. But the book's brevity also makes it a useful, if dry, introduction to the topic, from which interested readers can move on to more detailed and complicated works. As Guinier observes, the great transformation she hopes to see in American social structure is in a hopeful infancy, and so in this book is the description and analysis of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TENCZR7MDNM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807006270#wasThisHelpful","R1TENCZR7MDNM3","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kelly Link's latest collection offers more of her particular brand of literary fantasy, similar to (and likely to appeal to readers of) the work of writers like Karen Russell, George Saunders, Aimee Bender, and Melanie Lamaga, but with a distinctive voice that could only belong to her. Link plays with the tropes of pop culture, from superheroes to haunted campgrounds, but in spite of a lively style and quirky sense of humor there's an underlying bleakness to her work that's anything but mass market. Even stories written for teen audiences are pretty blunt about how manipulative and petty people can be, and about the sadness that often (but not always) drives such behavior. Perhaps the finest of these nine stories is ""I Can See Right Through You,"" a non-linear ghost story about the corrosive effects of celebrity, though ""Valley of the Girls,"" a science-fiction take on similar themes of privilege and emotional turmoil, is also powerful. Mention should also be made of ""The Lesson,"" a study in the meaninglessness of tragedy that is at once wrenching and very funny. Despite the lack of genre elements, it feels very much of a piece with the more overtly fantastic stories in the collection, because the true magic of Link's writing is not in her concepts but in the execution. Even when the structural and stylistic gambits don't quite pay off, as in the intermittently successful ""Two Houses,"" or when the concept feels less than innovative, as in ""The New Boyfriend's"" take on the popularity of teen paranormal romance, one admires the craft at work. For those who appreciate the surreal rhythms of Link's prose and plotting, Get in Trouble is a collection not to be missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PQHAF74L4TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179689#wasThisHelpful","R31PQHAF74L4TM","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a versatile countertop grill with only a few fairly trivial drawbacks. The cook temperature is adjustable from 300 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and there's an adjustable timer as well. However, they're both controlled by the same ""up"" and ""down"" buttons. You switch between time and temperature adjustment with a button labeled ""time/temp,"" but there's no way to know which is active at the moment; if you forget whether you've already switched from the default of temperature adjustment, you may mess up your cooking process. For some reason the timer automatically activates the timer and sets itself for five minutes whenever the grill is turned on, requiring you to turn it off manually. If you don't, the timer will go off, making a noise identical to the one that announces the grill has preheated, a real source of potential confusion for people who don't notice that the temperature display changes from flashing to solid when preheating is complete.The grill features two sets of removable plates, one set for grilling and one for making waffles. The plates are easy to remove; locking them back into place is slightly trickier, but not difficult enough to complain about. The plates are labeled ""upper"" and ""lower,"" but don't offer any notes about how to orient them: you just have to remember that the lip belongs on the outer edge. The plates are dishwasher safe, and in most cases they won't be difficult to clean by hand. A switch on the side of the machine allows the grill to be laid flat (for sandwiches) or tilted at an angle (for meat) so that grease drains out into an included tray. The one drawback of the physical design is that the top of the grill is heavy enough, and the angle at which it sits open acute enough, that it doesn't feel particularly secure. This can be kind of nervous-making, especially when the grill is hot and you're trying to add or remove food without knocking the top down onto your hands. It's not so much that it's actually likely to fall as that it seems like it would.That aside, the grill performs very well. As with any cooking device, you'll want to experiment with different times and temperatures to get the best results. We lucked out and found a good ""recipe"" for bacon on our very first try; we're still trying to figure out what to do with steaks. The available ""sear"" feature, which cooks food at 500 degrees for a brief period, seems like a neat idea in principle but is hard to work with in practice. Once the grill preheats, you have to put the food on and close the grill immediately, because the 90-second searing starts and ends automatically. Then after the 90 seconds, the grill defaults back to 300 degrees, and you have to adjust the temperature to your desired level all over again. I assume this is meant to keep people from overcooking things, but overall the feature feels like a good idea that's too complicated to execute on a machine with this level of computer power.I'm not the type who would ever have thought a countertop grill was worth more than $100, but now that I own one I've changed my mind. Once you get the hang of using it and find the first settings for your favorite foods, the savings of time and effort is invaluable. While the GRP4842R 2-in-1 Evolve Grill is perhaps not the perfect countertop grill, it's an above-average machine that will be accessible to first-time owners and strikes a decent balance between price and functionality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLGFSZO7P2IF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJWE8#wasThisHelpful","RLGFSZO7P2IF4","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a functional vacuum cleaner, pleasingly lightweight, with a sleek design. It works fairly well both as a handheld unit and with the floor extension attached. It's not the best vacuum for very thorough cleaning, both because it's not quite powerful enough and because the brief battery life and lack of a power cord mean that it will run out of power in the middle of a job and need a long recharge period. I also found the charger surprisingly touchy: the slightest of taps will stop the charge, even if the machine doesn't move and remains slotted in its place. As this is a cordless handheld vacuum, the tank capacity isn't enormous. What all this adds up to is a vacuum that's good for a casual cleaning of an entire house or a deep cleaning of at most one moderately dirty room. If that's what you're looking for, and you want a light, mobile cordless vacuum with a decent floor extension, the BDH2400FH is a good selection. If you want something more powerful for a $200+ plus price tag, you're better off looking elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWFQFL5DK1QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJ0G56A#wasThisHelpful","R3FWFQFL5DK1QN","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[The author supplied a review copy of this book.]The best that can come of ambitious literature adopting the forms of popular fiction is work that combines the sheer narrative appeal of the latter with the subtle thoughtfulness of the former. Such a novel is If, by a writer working under the playful pseudonym Nicholas Bourbaki. The horizons of American fiction these days are so narrow that the phrase ""experimental novel"" doesn't mean much, but the format of If is certainly unusual: it's one of those choose-your-own-fate books, where you're given options at the foot of a page and turn to a different section based on what choice you make. But you, the second-person protagonist, aren't facing robots in a futuristic wasteland or escaping from a haunted amusement park: you're just growing up, in middle-class northern California around the end of the twentieth century. Your decisions are about sex and love, education and employment. Some are large, some are small, but they all have unexpected, and unintended, consequences.This sounds like a gimmick, but it's actually essential to one of the novel's thematic concerns: what the author described in a recent interview as ""how contingent our lives are, but also how some parts of our identities are stubbornly resistant to change."" And If succeeds in no small part because the protagonist does indeed have a consistent identity despite his wildly varying choices. ""You"" might wind up a homeless drug addict, a pillar of the community, or something even stranger, but certain traits will endure: insecurity, passion for grand ideologies, perhaps an over-reliance on mild-altering substances. There's something tragically likable about you, even though you can be a real jerk a lot of the time. You want, like everybody else, to be happy, and you associate happiness with freedom. But pursuing freedom tends to leave you unhappy.And make no mistake, ""you"" will be unhappy for much of this book. Most pick-a-path titles have obvious good and bad endings; If doesn't break down that easily, but let's just say there aren't many turns of the page that will give ""you"" a deep sense of personal fulfillment. In that sense, If is rather a bleak meditation on the consequences of the unstructured pursuit of happiness. But it's subtle about that. A lesser writer would make much of the fact that doing the right thing can lead to a bad ending; Bourbaki takes that for granted, and has a less mechanistic sense than many writers of the way we are and aren't shaped by our decisions. The way the protagonist's life evolves acknowledges the seeming randomness of existence without denying the possibility that art can still illuminate meaning in that chaos.This makes the book sound like heavy going, and for readers expecting the adult equivalent of Prisoner of the Ant People I expect it will be. Some of the protagonist's fates slip from straightforwardly realist contemporary fiction into more stylized and unsettling forms; he's artful about unleashing it, but Bourbaki has a real gift for intense, psychologically suggestive experimental prose. And yet for readers accustomed to long sentences, prose poetry, and highly fractured stream of consciousness, this novel will be the farthest thing from difficult: it will be a genuine page-turner. I myself picked it up to skim the first few pages, and wound up reading long into the night, impelled by the same curiosity about the consequences of a choice that draws children to the famous gamebooks, and by the psychological acuity of Bourbaki's characterization. The next day I couldn't wait to go on my lunch break and continue following the protagonist's forking paths. If is a novel that manages to be experimental yet accessible, compelling yet quietly intricate, and it deserves to be read by a much wider audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTJCFQI9RK17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604891351#wasThisHelpful","RVTJCFQI9RK17","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[The author supplied a review copy of this book.]The continent of Kal Arna was once dominated by the great empire of the Valdori. Now only ruins and fragments remain of that greatness. But even fragments can be dangerous. There is a mysterious urn. Arandras Kanthesi has it, but is interested in it only for the clue it might provide to the identity of the man who murdered his wife. Clade Alsere wants it, for the help it might offer in his escape from the god who dominates his existence. Eilwen Nasareen knows nothing of it, but will soon become caught up in events surrounding it, events that threaten to ruin her life with the Woodtraders Guild and reveal her most terrible secret. As scholars, sorcerers, and merchants struggle for power, these three lives will intersect, and their shared desperation for freedom will have terrible consequences.If the premise of Matt Karlov's first novel sounds broadly familiar, that isn't misleading: this is a novel very much in the tradition of contemporary epic fantasy with a gritty edge. But familiar doesn't have to mean derivative, and The Unbound Man manages the difficult feat of fitting into a subgenre without being trapped by it. The key to this, I think, is that Karlov's protagonists are less aggressively amoral than in some of the epics that label-loving readers have called ""grimdark."" Fantasy was dominated by heroes and then by anti-heroes, but Karlov's characters are neither: they're ordinary people, struggling to balance their desires and their morality. They do bad things, they justify them, but they're aware of the weakness of their justifications. This makes their moral struggles easier to relate to than those of murderous queens and sadistic knights, though the thematic points being made are not dissimilar. Karlov is interested in the line between appropriate and inappropriate moral certainty, in the way the perception of oneself as righteous can lead to just as much destructive behavior as conscious cowardice. That's not to say, though, that the book declines into facile moral relativism. The three protagonists of The Undying Man are drawn with empathy (and even in the world of gritty epic fantasy it's striking to find a novel lacking an out-and-out human villain), but their dramas are weighty precisely because it matters whether or not they're doing the right thing.If there's a downside to Karlov's themes and characterization, it's lack of subtlety. The reader is constantly being told what the characters' emotional states mean, even when it's obvious from their current and previous behavior. At one point a character has a thematically-charged dream, and the text notes, ""The dream's meaning was plain enough."" Indeed... but the text goes on to explain it anyway. These explanations can feel especially grating because the characters' moral and emotional dilemmas are basically unchanging throughout the book, so that their implications would be obvious even with no hand-holding, let alone a constant stream of it. The climactic action in particular feels bogged down with on-the-nose statements of points that were already implicit. But the thematic resolutions are satisfying enough that they work despite being overplayed.The themes are perhaps the strongest aspect of The Unbound Man, but no aspect of it is less than competently done. The prose is clear and readable, with diction that is only occasionally too contemporary for a pre-modern fantasy setting. The world-building is rich in detail, concerned largely with the daily life of the two major cities in which the novel takes place, but also suggesting a wider world that will likely come into focus in the two remaining volumes of the trilogy. Karlov's world-building is less atmospheric than that of the very best fantasy writers, less likely to produce a vivid mental picture or a sense of wonder, but it's enough to make the setting feel real and weighty. The magic system strikes what seems to me a good balance between ""mysterious and inexplicable"" and ""so detailed it belongs in a role-playing game.""The plot is, it must be said, a slow-building one even by epic fantasy standards. The mysteries of the characters' backstories make the opening sections compelling, as readers begin to puzzle out how it all fits together, but once the general outline is clear, it takes a while for the action to kick into high gear. Part of the novel's emphasis on realistic characters rather than heroes is that the stakes are not at first enormously high, and the intrigues are less complicated than they might otherwise be. It's only in the last third of the novel, as the plotlines directly intersect and long-held plans are enacted, that events take on the usual feel of epic fantasy. But there's enough going on throughout to satisfy readers who don't demand superficial action every step of the way. And the denouement is both a satisfying resolution of this novel's conflicts and the beginning of a larger story that promises to extend this one's themes in intriguing and emotionally resonant ways. I'm certainly looking forward to the next book, and I suspect that, once they've experienced The Unbound Man, many other readers will be too. This is a fine debut novel from a writer with a great sense of how to use the tropes of epic fantasy in thoughtful and entertaining ways.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C2NFPJXMTZHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBJCTI8#wasThisHelpful","R3C2NFPJXMTZHM","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the translation into English of Saramago's final novel, Cain, his American publishers doubled back to release two early novels that had never appeared in the United States: Manual of Painting and Calligraphy, the last novel before the emergence of Saramago's signature style, and Raised from the Ground, in which that style blossomed. Now here is something even earlier, a novel that was not merely untranslated but unpublished. As an introduction by Saramago's widow notes, Skylight languished for a long time in the offices of the publisher to whom Saramago submitted it in the 1950s, and even after it was returned to the by-then-famous novelist, he declined to allow its publication during his lifetime. So now after his death we finally have, not quite his first novel (that would be the still untranslated Land of Sin from 1947), but an early one, and something even more unusual for Saramago, which is to say more usual for most writers, than Manual of Painting and Calligraphy.Skylight describes the intertwining lives of the residents of a Lisbon apartment building in the early 1950s. One couple, happily married, takes in a young lodger who forges an unconventional friendship with the husband; another couple, miserably unhappy, contemplate the end of their marriage. A family struggling to make ends meet considers having their daughter seek a favor from the neighbor who was once a prostitute but is now the mistress of a powerful businessman. And two widowed sisters live together with the daughters of one, until unexpected desires threaten to thwart their impoverished but aesthetically rich existence.Sixty years on and in another country, the subject matter and manner of Skylight perhaps feel more traditional, more familiar, than they did in the Portugal of the 1950s. There is certainly something strange in seeing Saramago offer the kind of physical and psychological capsule descriptions, the kind of philosophically and thematically-laden over-articulate conversations, one associates with writers from entirely other literary traditions. But at a certain point one stops trying to fit the novel into a summary of Saramago's artistic arc and simply appreciates it for what it is: a heartfelt and wise examination of the frailties and ironies of the universal search for fulfillment. The residents of the apartment house create a panorama of the ways people can be satisfied and unsatisfied, and even without the particular sympathetic distance created by his mature voice, Saramago captures his characters' hypocrisies and cruelties in a way that acknowledges their humanity. Most readers will, of course, be interested in Skylight as a part of Saramago's oeuvre, but even considered in isolation it has not inconsiderable merits of its own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBLEORKLXP67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544090020#wasThisHelpful","RVBLEORKLXP67","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's well-sized for what is now Amazon's last-gen basic Kindle (the final model without a touchscreen), and the flexible neck lets you try lots of angles in the search for good, glare-free illumination. It's also a good size to be attached to print books. The stated battery life of 20 hours isn't all that long, but replacement CR2032 batteries are cheap enough that the light remains a good deal overall. The power button is on the sensitive side; it activated when I accidentally slid a finger over it while removing the battery cover just now to double-check the battery type. So it might be worthwhile to wrap the button in a soft material while carrying the clip light in a bag or suitcase.

"This device is easy to set up (though users with less knowledge of tech jargon may want to skip the included pamphlet and find the more detailed instructions on the manufacturer web site) and works very well. Its design is sleek and attractive, and I like that it can also double as an adapter for wired Ethernet devices. The price is high, but the extender is worth it for those who want better range on their wi-fi; cheaper models are available from the same manufacturer for those who want to strike a different balance between quality and cost.Updated April 2015:The preceding review was written when I lived somewhere with strong, consistent wireless throughout the residential area. As such, I couldn't test, and be impressed by, the range extender's capacity as much as I might have. In my new home, though, things are a little different. Most devices work fine in the bedroom, but for some reason my newly acquired PlayStation 4 could barely connect to the network. Downloads of as little as 250 MB were estimated to take in excess of ten hours, and even signing into the PlayStation Network was at best a 50/50 prospect. With the RE200, though, things are different. Just setting the extender up in the bedroom sent download speeds through the roof, and using it as an Ethernet connector has put them on par with what I got connecting the PS4 directly to the router. Since the alternative was running an Ethernet cable halfway across the apartment and leaving an airtight door open 24/7, I'm very pleased with how well this extender performs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVHFZOF24YFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR2VMNC#wasThisHelpful","RUVHFZOF24YFO","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laurie R. King's latest Russell/Holmes mystery has a leisurely pace and gives its lead characters relatively little to do, but it has a certain low-key charm that makes it difficult not to like in spite of these imperfections. After an in media res opening set in England, the action moves back in time to Russell and Holmes' cruise to Japan, where Russell meets and befriends Haruki Sato, a young Japanese woman who, this being a suspense novel, may be more than she seems. It takes quite a while to discover what that ""more"" is, so the novel's first hundred pages are more a light-hearted look at upper-class life on a 1920s cruise ship than anything plot-driven, though there are a few smaller mysteries that work to disguise the overall lack of momentum. Even after the leads get a sense of just what Haruki is up to, there's a long interlude in which they must prove their mettle by taking an unusual tour of Japan. The resulting travelogue will be most interesting to readers who know very little of Japanese culture and history; others will be eager for the explanations that finally arrive around the book's halfway point, at which moment a sense of narrative urgency at last develops. In some ways Holmes and Russell wind up playing second (and third?) fiddle to a set of new characters, but they're close enough to the action that the sense of drama never dissipates. The plot isn't terribly surprising, but there are some clever turns in the last hundred pages. Overall, Dreaming Spies is a solid read for anyone who enjoys historical suspense with larger-than-life heroes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OA9AH7EJW8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345531795#wasThisHelpful","R4OA9AH7EJW8M","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering its price point, the HP Stream 7 is an excellent Windows 8.1 tablet. Obviously for $99 you're not going to get a gorgeous display, powerful speakers, and lightning-fast performance, but I was surprised at how well it did given the low cost. And that's setting aside the included one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal, a $70 value, which makes the tablet a real steal... if you find any value in Office 365 Personal. The Stream 7 is somewhat thicker than other tablets, but well-proportioned so that it feels durable rather than bulky. There are no external battery/power indicator lights. Battery life is acceptable but not astonishing: streaming video depletes the battery fairly steadily, but you'll still get at least a few hours of straight viewing. Performance is a highlight; you're not going to run multiple demanding apps simultaneously, but you're also not going to find the tablet freaking out at a second app running at all. The display and speakers are good enough for casual viewing, though you'll want headphones (or subtitles) if there's any competing sound in your area. The bottom line is that this is a basic tablet, and compares to a top-of-the-line tablet the way a netbook compares to a laptop. If you want to play the latest games, watch high-quality videos, enjoy rich music, and run complex software, find something else. If you want to play casual games, get more than adequate audio and video, and browse the web a bit, the Stream 7 is a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8KCGZ9A9HK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSHLVD2#wasThisHelpful","R2C8KCGZ9A9HK5","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fine Chromebook for the money, and a nice, if small, upgrade from the Acer C720, which I also own. The white finish is visually appealing, and its contrast with the colors of the screen makes the screen seem a bit larger, though of course it's the same size. The screen is also visibly richer in color than on the C720. The AC jack has been moved from the side of the machine to the back, which I think works better. This one is about 5 ounces lighter than the C720, enough to make a noticeable difference when carrying it around. The processor is a better one as well, though I can't say I noticed much difference in performance; the Chromebook is already fast enough that added speed is probably measured in very small increments. My only complaint about this machine vs. the C720 is that this one takes slightly longer to reconnect to the Internet when I open the lid. It's still a matter of seconds, so hardly a major issue, but it does mean the loss of the ""open it, click immediately"" feel of the C720.Setting aside comparisons and speaking generally, I'm happy with this Chromebook. The battery life is great. I'm the type who forgets to plug things back in even when they're sitting next to the adapter, and I hardly ever get ""please plug me in"" messages on this Chromebook. It also charges fast when you do plug it in. The speakers are strong considering the size and cost; I've gotten less impressive sound from full laptops with much higher costs. The cramped keyboard is an adjustment if you're used to a full-sized laptop layout, but once you get used to it, it gets to seem normal and it'll be the laptop that feels wrong-sized and awkward. My only regret is the absence of separate touchpad buttons (I'm not good at two-finger tapping) and dedicated page up/page down keys (a two-button shortcut just isn't as naturally when scrolling through something). But those are pretty small trade-offs for a cheaper, faster device that covers most casual computing needs. Despite coming in at the low end of Chromebook pricing, the Acer 11 CB3-111-C670 is a quality machine, well worth considering for those new to Chromebooks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6DAACAYOBXPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLV7VQ#wasThisHelpful","R6DAACAYOBXPB","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phyllis Lee Levin's new account of the early years of John Quincy Adams draws heavily on his diaries and other contemporary sources to produce a fascinating, if sometimes long-winded, overview of the forces, both political and personal, that shaped the sixth President of the United States. This balance between the intimate and the historical brings remote figures from textbooks and civics lessons to vibrant life. The portrait of JQA's difficult relationship with his wife Louisa is a particular highlight. Some readers may feel that the detail is excessive, and that the book's nearly 500 pages might have been better used to cover a longer span of time, but for the patient, this is a rewarding look at the private and public lives of a man often misunderstood as distant and prickly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPTCW77VLR2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279621#wasThisHelpful","RTPTCW77VLR2E","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first sentence of Hemione Lee's latest sets the tone: ""This is the biography of a great English writer, who would never have described herself in such a commanding way."" The account of Penelope Fitzgerald's life that follows is admiring, respectful, heavy on the use of Fitzgerald's own writings, and less investigative and insightful than the greatest biographies. Even when family secrets are being revealed, Fitzgerald remains an elusive figure, one whose public performance of various personas (witty young intellectual, eccentric late-blooming writer) is hard even for a biographer to crack. The book is better at evoking Fitzgerald's times than the woman herself. But the outline of her life is an engaging one, and Lee tells the story well, in artful but non-intrusive prose. Like most worthwhile biographies of writers, this one will make readers want to seek out the writer's work-- and, in this case, perhaps make their own effort to figure out Penelope Fitzgerald.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOOGLAPFMUPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352344#wasThisHelpful","R1UOOGLAPFMUPS","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heavily customizable learn-to-type program that will work best for motivated adults who want instruction that's businesslike and no-nonsense but is also non-threatening and encourages you to go at your own pace. If you need games and other distractions to learn to type, look elsewhere: there's no spoonful of sugar to help this medicine go down, only formal explanations and a lot of repetitive exercises and skill checks. But learning to type ~is~ repetitive, and those who prefer the practical approach should definitely consider this program. A preferences menu allows users to customize not only aspects of the visual presentation (backgrounds, the skin tone of the onscreen hands) but also various technical features, including how the program handles errors and calculates words per minute. Once preferences are set, a couple of brief videos on posture and finger placement are followed by a series of lessons that gradually introduce more and more letters. Each lesson is followed by a customizable skill check, where you can decide how long a passage or how many minutes of typing will best allow you to test yourself. The program also identifies particular weak points in your typing, and offers ways to improve. This is, in other words, good software for people who are already highly motivated to learn to type, and just want an inexpensive professional tool that will help them to do that.[This review is for the Personal Edition, which allows only one user and one computer. Those looking for a program that can be shared by multiple users should consider the Family Edition.

"There are books for which a review is almost superfluous: you can tell, just from the cover copy and an excerpt, how you're going to feel about them. Marlon James's new novel is such a case. An ambitious, epic, intense exploration of Jamaica's recent history, told in multiple voices and spanning decades and nations? Such a thing appeals or it doesn't, especially after one samples a few of the voices and discovers the dense complexity of James's prose. This is a novel that requires a commitment of time and intellectual energy, but as is so often the case perseverance will be rewarded, with a terribly vivid evocation of place that is also a portrait of how violence perpetuates itself, and how people learn to live with that. There is, perhaps, a fine line between a novel of great scope and a novel that's overstuffed, but in an age where literary ambition too often involves streamlining one's imagination into elegant nothingness, overstuffed may be preferable. This history is not brief, and there are definitely more than seven killings, but that's far from a bad thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFN79O4HEAWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159448600X#wasThisHelpful","R2KFN79O4HEAWJ","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are writers whose genius is easy to describe, and there are writers like Alice Munro. There's nothing flashy about her short stories: no density or complexity of plot, no genre elements or post-modern structural tricks, very little humor. The prose has few superficially distinctive characteristics. And yet her work is, once you learn to read it, every bit as involving as fiction with a more obvious ""hook,"" and this hefty selection of stories from the second half of her career (companion to an earlier volume, Selected Stories: 1968-1994) is a fine introduction that will leave many readers, as it left me, wanting more.I refer to learning to read Munro's stories. This may make them sound like work, but that's not really the issue. It's just that Munro is a subtle enough writer that the depth of her stories is easy to miss if you're used to literary fiction that hammers its themes home, to the slice-of-life story that has marinated in its own meaning. The way Munro manipulates time, moving forward and backward in the lives of her characters, may seem arbitrary, and her endings can inspire the kind of bewilderment contemporary short stories often produces in those used to more plot-driven fiction. The focus on the details of daily life and of the natural world can feel stifling.Readers who find themselves experiencing such frustration with the collection's early stories might wish to jump ahead to the title story, or ""Post and Beam,"" or ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage."" These are, to my mind, some of the finest stories in the selection, and their endings provide a more graspable thematic tying-off than others. You can see, then, how Munro's chronological jumps emphasize the enduring power of terrible experiences, and the more terrible fact that we learn to live with them. You recognize that the focus on quotidian details is at once a reflection of their importance in our lives and a way of emphasizing the stark reality of the larger forces that intrude upon us at unguessable intervals. Family dynamics are central to these stories, perhaps because it is with family that we feel most acutely the tensions among who we pretend to be, who we want to be, and who we actually are. Many of Munro's stories have dark or bleak undercurrents, not because hers is a grim imagination but because the world she so faithfully records is a cruel one.Part of the pleasure of reading a career-spanning (or half-spanning) volume is recognizing amid the scope of a writer's vision recurring themes and motifs, the way real life is worked and reworked into fiction. In the present case that process is more visible than most, as this selection includes several of the more explicitly autobiographical stories collected in The View from Castle Rock. Reading these stories one observes not only the origins of some of Munro's character types (the sickly mother, the bright, ambitious, rather callous young woman) but the deep and natural realism of her voice and style: there is no sense that these stories are more realistic, more ""true-to-life,"" than the purely fictional ones.Indeed, if I had to reduce Munro to the kind of blurb that could be printed on a book cover, I would say that she is a supremely gifted realist. This is no small praise, especially as I'm not a particular admirer of realism in fiction. It seems to me that apt description of the human condition usually involves a layer of artifice, a conscious structuring to highlight the meaning of the particular aspects one has drawn forth from the bubbling cauldron of our lives. But Munro needs no such devices. She has the eye and the voice of the true realist, which focus not on the telling detail and the apt metaphor but on the thing itself, simply and accurately described. The title story for this selection is well chosen; its dual reference, to the meticulously described dwellings and social behaviors of an extended family, and to their complicated emotional dynamics, captures the way Munro's realism is no mere cataloging, but a profound wisdom about the relationship between environment and character. These unforgettable stories are, in every sense of the phrase, richly furnished, and they more than make clear why Munro is widely considered the greatest short fiction writer of our time..","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BM8GSZB2EWMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874104#wasThisHelpful","R1BM8GSZB2EWMP","A15ANBKUY4JSPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ANBKUY4JSPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wagner's exhortation ""Kinder, schafft Neues"" ('Children, create something new') has perhaps been over-used and abused to some extent to permit some wild indulgences, none more so than in the festival dedicated to the composer at Bayreuth. The recent years under the directorship of the composer's great grand-daughters Eva Wagner-Pasquier and her half-sister Katharina Wagner have been highly controversial, but more than just generate controversy the aim has been primarily on the modernisation of an institution that Tom Service described in the Guardian in 2006 as ""a byword for conservatism and fossilised values"". As some of the greatest works ever written, it would be a disservice to Wagner's operas to treat them as anything less than living, breathing art and Bayreuth during this period would strive to challenge not only the audience, but the validity of Wagner's operas as well. Some of the productions in this period have been more innovative and successful than others, but unquestionably they've drawn attention back to what Wagner's operas mean and how they are still relevant to the 21st century.It wouldn't be unfair however to say that the new regime at Bayreuth got off to a shaky start. As a key Wagner work, since it is about the balance of respecting tradition and 'making anew', Katharina Wagner's first production of Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnberg (2008) proved to be something of a bold statement of intent. As Klaus Florian Vogt's Walther von Stolzing scrawls and spills white paint over every object and person on the stage, the balance would appear to be heavily skewed towards desecration and irreverence for the old ways, almost to the point of anarchically destroying the past in order to make anew. Franz Hawlata's Hans Sachs is good, and Michael Volle is a blistering Beckmesser, but although the musical performance is robust the whole production fails to find the warmth, humour and humanity at the heart of the work.Tankred Dorst's 2006 Ring cycle predated the changeover, but it remained in place through the larger part of the period that the festival was under the directorship of Wagner's great-granddaughters. The only part of the cycle to see a video release was a 2010 performance of Die WalkÃ¼re. It's not terribly impressive, looking largely traditional in the main but for some odd directing choices and, since the rest of the cycle is not available to make sense of them, some obscure concepts bolted on. Musically, it's forcefully conducted by Christian Thielemann and there are some good singing performances from a gorgeously lyrical Johan Botha as Siegmund, Edith Haller as Sieglinde and Kwangchul Youn as Hunding. Albert Dohmen and Linda Watson however make unconvincing father/daughter relationship as Wotan and BrÃ¼nnhilde.Since Tristan und Isolde is a fairly conceptual work in the first place, the main thrust of the work taking place on a philosophical and spiritual plane, there's licence to deviate from the earthly locations in the libretto. Even so, Christoph Marthaler's production recorded at the 2009 festival is extravagantly eccentric in mannerisms and staging. Randomly set on what looks to be a 1930s cruise liner, the three acts are layered one on top of the other on rising tiered sets. It's hard not to be entranced however by the production or moved by the sheer power of the work, which is given a fine account under the baton of Peter Schneider, and there are compelling central performances from IrÃ©ne Theorin and Robert Dean Smith.For pushing the conceptual to extremes in its exploration of the works themes and where they stand today, it's hard to imagine any idea more bizarre than setting Lohengrin as a laboratory experiment using rats. As strange as it might seem there are nonetheless rather more bewildering productions of Wagner out there (and in Bayreuth) and Hans Neuenfel's production, recorded here at the 2011 festival, meaningfully explores some problematic areas of Wagner's historical view of society. Some of the divisions are rather simplistically drawn however, the conclusions are unconvincing and it often looks very silly indeed, but there are good performances from Georg Zeppenfeld, Klaus Florian Vogt and Petra Lang (one of the truly great Ortruds I've seen). There's a fine musical performance conducted by Andris Nelsons, even if it doesn't really complement the stage production.With a cyborg Dutchman on a data information sea, it's initially difficult to understand the purpose of Jan Philipp Gloger's concept for the 2012 production of Der Fliegende HollÃ¤nder. It soon becomes clear in this 2013 recording of the production that there's clear adherence to the dramatic and mythological strengths of the work and a superb performance of the ""joined-up"" version of the three-act opera conducted by Christian Thielemann. Broadly speaking it views the work in the context of the incompatibility and conflict between love and business, a subject that plagued Wagner most of his life. Without belittling the importance of Wagner's view of mythology it manages to bring it back to human terms without losing any of the grandeur of the work. Ricarda Merbeth is outstanding as Senta, Franz-Josef Selig a solid Daland and Benjamin Bruns a bright, golden-voiced Steersman. The choral work too - so important to this work - is impressive.The abstract conceptual clearly dominates in the Bayreuth 2014 TannhÃ¤user with a stage set constructed out of a number of art installations that were never created with Wagner's opera in mind, but the pieces by Joep van Lieshout do form an interesting if imperfect dialectic with Wagner's work. Director Sebastian Baumgarten follows a similar path to Hans Neuenfels' Lohengrin for Bayreuth, viewing the work as a model of society, taking in Wagner's perspective and extending it to a more modern outlook. Whatever you make of the stage production, musically it's a glorious affair, conductor Alex Kober drawing out the true delicacy and poignancy within the work. There's not a trace of heavy-handedness, yet all the force and dynamic is there. Camilla Nylund's Elisabeth matches the Romantic delicacy of the score perfectly while Torsten Kerl balances well the more dynamic character of TannhÃ¤user.The Blu-ray discs are all superb presentations.  The quality of the image and the high-definition uncompressed surround mixes of the performances are just incredible.  Each of the discs contains a making of feature and interviews that explore the productions, the concepts and all the back-stage preparations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RRKAOMG8ZVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JWUXWO#wasThisHelpful","R17RRKAOMG8ZVU","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an ingenious and sinister little book this is!  It subtly manages to unsettle the reader right from the outset when Justine Merrison has a strange premonition.  She, her husband Alex and their daughter Ellen are moving out of London, Justine leaving a stressful job as a TV drama executive to settle for a quieter life in their new home in Devon. The premonition isn't wrong, and Justine's life is far from quiet with the strangest things that go on in that part of the world.What is terrific about A Game For All The Family is how Sophie Hannah builds on similar little hunches and feelings in several other simple little events that on the surface don't seem worth worrying about, but are very odd if you think about them too much.  As a TV drama producer, Justine is well aware of the concept of the 'unreliable narrator', but you begin to doubt yourself the reliability of what Justine is telling you.  How much is real and how much is cumulatively built up and blown out of proportion by Justine's imaginative interpretation of hunches?It's at least clear that something strange is going on.  Not least because there seems to be another 'unreliable narrator' in a story that Justine's daughter has suddenly taken an urge to write about an 'alternate' family living in their new house who are subject to the murderous acts of one of the youngest daughters.  These chapters, which bear some parallel with events in the real world, appear at regular intervals before each chapter and really add to the sense of a weird conspiracy being waged against Justine.Although it is fascinating to see how things develop, what really counts here in such a tense, and twistedly imaginative fiction is how convincingly the author can carry off the resolution and rationale for it all.  Sophie Hannah comes up with some credible explanations, which is no mean feat, but some of the character behaviour and motivations are questionable.  On the other hand, this just leaves just enough doubt for the reader to question whether they've really got the whole story from Justine here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R374I4ZBVXB21W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444776037#wasThisHelpful","R374I4ZBVXB21W","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So brilliant was the opening book in the Red Rising trilogy - a debut novel too! - that it should have made the follow-up Golden Son all the more near-impossible to live up to. The promise of Book 1 Red Rising however and the potential it opened up left little doubt that Pierce Brown had the ability to take it to the next level. If it doesn't quite raise the game substantially, at least not until the big cliffhanger finale on the final page, Golden Son is nonetheless an impressive follow-up every bit as good as the first.Every bit as good, but despite taking the battle to a new arena, not really that different. It was always going to be interesting to see where Brown would take the space opera elements of the trilogy after the rather earthbound (or planet bound) war gaming adventures of Red Rising. Anyone expecting a continuation of the war games in space will however soon find that this side of the story is discarded rather quickly. Darrow, our hero, has rather bigger fish to fry, or bigger ships to fly, in his role as an underclass Red agent of the Sons of Ares infiltrating Gold society that dominates the rule of the planetary system.What's great about Golden Son is that Brown doesn't waste time explaining the colour/caste system. It's already been well established and just in case you need reminding, it's there for reference at before the start of the book. The author has many other ideas and twists, battles, schemes and intrigue he wants to play out, and he gets straight into it with scarcely pause for a breath. In some ways, this is just a continuation of the flag-gathering/plotting and overthrowing of power that dominated the war games of Red Rising, albeit on a level that is rather more 'real' and likely to have a big impact on society. Which is what Darrow's objective is all about.As thrilling as it is to see this taken to a new SF space opera level, there remains a strong core philosophy to the book that gives it a little more substance than other books of this type. There is something here worth fighting for that has universal and real world relevance - ""It's there, even if you never see it till the end - that spark of individuality, of freedom"". This is what drives Darrow to seek to support and use to overthrown tyranny. It's also what gives Brown the freedom to work with real-world models (mainly Roman) of rules of engagement and the art of war, and yet keep it real, rewriting the rules, keep you guessing, and constantly surprising the reader. The final part will undoubtedly mark Red Rising out as one of the best SF trilogies of recent times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7ZY7NSENGDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345539834#wasThisHelpful","R1G7ZY7NSENGDL","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good people at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro aren't afraid of applying a little ironical distance to their productions when the occasion demands it. It's not just a case of being clever and modern, as much as the only way of reaching back and finding a way to revitalise works that in the present day would seem a little stagy and conventional. Pleasant, inoffensive, contrived, conventional in the extreme, the one-act 'farsa giocosa' Il Signor Bruschino is such a minor work that would probably otherwise forever be consigned to obscurity if it were considered in terms of its modest surface merits. Perhaps it dserves more than that.Here, Teatro Sotterraneo come up with the idea of setting the work in a Rossiniland theme park where visitors, tourists and school groups can wander around and see little scenes from in the maestro's works performed by actors in outrageous wigs and colourful 'period' costumes. They munch some popcorn, take a few selfies and then move on to the gift shop or to the next attraction. Inevitably, when there are signs advertising Il Barbiere di Sevilla, La Gazza Ladra and Guglielmo Tell, there's not a lot of reason to hang around the Il Signor Bruschino too long, but a few adventurous souls or couples who have wandered off the beaten path and ended up there seem to enjoy the modest charms of this unusual work.It's never going to be thought a great opera, and even a little ironical distance isn't going to bring out any surprise revelations here. The comedy still falls flat more often than not and the setting does tend to characterise Il Signor Bruschino as a bit of a pastiche or a parody. There is some genuine engagement that comes through however between the 'actor's performance' of the opera and the visitors who stop by. A young couple, for instance, soon lose interest in the plot and are more interested in each other, but it ties in well to Gaudenzio's infuriation with young people being oblivious to those who are trying to act in their interests, or at least think they are. It's nothing profound, it's not particularly clever, but it connects the world of Rossini with the modern world in a nice way.Musically too there are of course some wonderful Rossini-isms. The overture is a delight (as they always are with Rossini) and the composer still fills the work with vivacious music, catchy melodies, the occasional bravura aria and a particularly wonderful trio. There's a danger that ironical distance can introduce a measure of singing by numbers, not really giving the performers anything substantial to engage with in characterisation that is already insubstantial to begin with. You feel this is the case initially with the bland romantic leads of David Alegret's Florville and Maria Aleida's Sofia, but the singing is wonderful and beautifully suited to the roles, Aleida in particular making rather more of the role with some virtuoso singing. Carlo Lepore and Roberto de Candia however bring great comic vitality to the father roles and Chiara AmarÃ¹ is a bright Marianna.On Blu-ray, the opera is given the usual high standard of presentation. The image is perfect and the sound in particular gives a fine indication of the quality of the score and how well Daniele Rustoni conducts the performance. It could be a little less 'classical' and a little more free and energetic though you feel. The extra features on the BD include a Cast Gallery and a short Making Of that explores Teatro Sotterraneo's thoughtful and irreverent approach to directing the production. The BD is region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29KXT0NYRLWO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZGYC3G#wasThisHelpful","R29KXT0NYRLWO9","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always controversial in their revisionist approach to Wagner's legacy, the 2014 TannhÃ¤user is fairly typical of recent Bayreuth productions. Director Sebastian Baumgarten's idea is to bring together several art installation pieces by the artist and sculptor Joep van Lieshout. These pieces, with names like Alcoholator, Disciplinator and Technocrat, are processes that produce a 'biogas', the whole system forming a kind of working model for the cyclical human and bodily processes that generate life and, by extension, art. Which, even though they weren't created with Wagner in mind, is more or less what TannhÃ¤user is about.It's a little more complicated than that. There's the co-dependency of physical and the spiritual, but also an outlook on society as a whole, on the role of the artist, and of course it's all tied up in Wagner's own complex and contradictory impulses, political vision and developing philosophical outlook. Baumgarten's TannhÃ¤user follows a similar path to Hans Neuenfels' laboratory experiment 'rat' Lohengrin for Bayreuth, viewing the work as a model of society, taking in Wagner's perspective and extending it to a more modern outlook. It's not so much trying to update it or make it fit as use it as a means to revisit the work and explore whether it really has something new to inform our view of the world we live in today.I'm not sure that the director really manages to draw anything new out of TannhÃ¤user, but it does encourage anyone who thinks they are familiar with the work to reconsider more deeply what it is about, and question whether those contradictions and inconsistencies within it aren't actually essential to its purpose. It does at least, I find, explore the characters in greater detail, and not just TannhÃ¤user, but also Venus and Elisabeth and the relationships between them. Wolfram von Eschenbach also comes out of this production with a role that suddenly seems more significant, but it seems to me that as much of the strength of the characterisation here is also down to how it is performed.Whatever you make of the Bayreuth stage production, musically it's a glorious affair that does open up the work and reveal new qualities. It's not a forceful, driving Wagnerian interpretation, but one that finds the true delicacy and poignancy within what is surely the most Romantic of Wagner's works on the misunderstood, suffering artist as national or social hero. Alex Kober's conducting of the orchestra is outstanding and the chorus are superb, as they really have to be in this particular work. There's not a trace of heavy-handedness, yet all the force and dynamic of the work is there, measured and applied in such a way that it works hand-in-hand with the production.The singing likewise is never forced. I thought at first that Camilla Nylund was underpowered here as Elisabeth. Knowing what she is capable of, it sounded like she was conserving her voice, but the more gentle delivery and the colour that Nylund is able to apply actually pays dividends with Elisabeth and her nature here. This is also borne out in the performances of Michelle Breedt's Venus,  but particularly in Markus Eiche's excellent and impressive Wolfram. The complex character of TannhÃ¤user is another matter however, and requires a different approach. Torsten Kerl achieves a good balance between the more lyrical side of his character and the Romantic heldentenor, his performance also covering all the playfulness, bawdiness, irreverence and the more serious, spiritual as well as the vainglorious sides of the character.The Opus Arte Blu-ray release presents all the colour and brightness of the busy Bayreuth stage very well. Spread over two BD50 discs, there is the option to view the musical performance alone or, if you've an hour or so to spare and are interested in the set as an art installation piece, you can view it interspersed with all the extra performance art set-pieces in-between. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1, both giving an impressive full uncompressed true HD sound. The interviews on the disc and in the booket provide much more useful information about the concept. Subtitles on the disc are English, French, German and Korean only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNMSK1POH3XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YASQX3G#wasThisHelpful","R3CNMSK1POH3XL","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an action thriller, Rob Boffard's Tracer is fast moving and purposeful. As a science-fiction book, it's a lot less convincing. It's well researched and the situation is credible, but it doesn't really take advantage of the situation to explore any new ideas.The SF premise is promising. The planet now destroyed, the population of Earth now live on Outer Earth, a constructed ring of six sector above the planet. Due to the limited means for producing food and retaining water, existence is precarious. It's also precarious when you're Tracer like Riley Hale. One of the Devil Dancers, Riley is a courier who knows her way around the ship better than anyone, but its always a risky job transporting unknown goods. Life is about to get more precarious, with the growing presence of a cult called Sons of the Earth, who believe Earth can recover and replenish if they destroy all mankind.There is no shortage of action or momentum as Riley races from one dangerous situation to the next, and the stakes are undoubtedly high, but in reality the plot of Tracer is thin and motivation is weak. Some effort is made to give the villain of the piece Darnell some family history and background, but little of it is meaningful. Ultimately, he has all the characteristics of a Batman villain without the colourful costume, cutting into TV broadcasts (complete with crackly static) and making terrorising threats of imminent death and destruction.That's fun as far as it goes, and there are some promising areas opened up later in the book, but in terms of SF ideas there are no great human or scientific questions explored here other than survival. Even that is brutally handled, the level of violence and the vicarious wholesale slaughter that occurs every couple of pages is dishearteningly free and callous, with even significant characters blithely wiped out in the stroke of a pen. Action scenes leave no cliche unturned (""You go ahead, I'm injured, so I'll stay back and hold off the overwhelming odds against you single-handedly to buy you some time"" type of situations).Although mostly restricted to a lot of running and fighting, the scope opens up a little by the time we reach the conclusion, and there are undoubledly other areas of Outer Earth for a Tracer to explore in Book 2. A little more SF and a little less comic book villainy and there could be interesting things to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHU0I5AOPUMAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0356505138#wasThisHelpful","RHU0I5AOPUMAG","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The science-fiction premise of Way Down Dark, part one of J.P. Smythe's Australia Trilogy, is far from original. A space-ship, called Australia, is a generation into its long journey into interstellar space, its human population looking for a new planet to colonise, with vague references to an Earth over-population crisis exacerbated by climate change. Over that time myths have developed and the social structure of the ship has evolved into dangerous gangs and mysterious cults of Lows, Pale Women and Bells, each of them struggling for power or simply trying to stay alive.The main content of Way Down Dark isn't particularly exciting in its development either over this first part. Basically, the social order is on the verge of collapse, the Lows making violent incursions into the upper levels, killing, abducting and destroying, threatening not only the balance of the social structure but the ecosystem on Australia, and even the integrity of the ship itself. The main part of the novel revolves around Chan, a young woman who looks after the arboretum on the 50th floor, struggling almost single-handedly to hold back the tide, keep alive and rescue others.What will keep you involved as you go from one battle/escape wound/recoveryto the next are the hints that there is something we don't know, and that all is not what it seems. Of course, there is a twist that comes in towards the final third of the novel (there are some clues) that hits home at the end, but again it's not anything new as far as SF novels about generational space travel go. Whether the story, like the population of Australia, is going places or going nowhere however, remains to be seen...","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143SQHTY7U2SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGLKI74#wasThisHelpful","R143SQHTY7U2SX","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Along with Der Rosenkavalier, there seemed to be a little more of a back to basics approach in the new 2014 Glyndebourne productions.  Even just putting on Verdi's La Traviata can be seen as a safe choice, but that's only the case if it's smothered in conventional stuffy Parisian Belle Epoque decor. Hildegard Bechtler's set designs do well to avoid such trappings without losing any of the glamour and sophistication that we associate with the work's location and settings. The set and costume designs are smart, elegant and eye-catching, the stage immaculately lit and coloured. It has the virtue of being ever so tastefully modern and stylish without being tied to any specific period. It's updated without taking any real liberties with the actual concept or characterisation, but it doesn't provide any new insights eitherAs safe and consistent as it is, you'll still recognise that no matter how often you hear it, La Traviata is one of the greatest works in all opera. In comparison to some rather more adventurous recent productions that have explored its passions with rather more vigour, the Glyndebourne is however just a little bit dull. It looks gorgeous, but Tom Cairns' direction is rather safe and unadventurous with a work that needs to and really ought to have a little more bite. There's nothing in the least bit radical attempted here. The fading glamour of the courtesan is maintained without highlighting or emphasising any of the harsh realities of prostitution, the social attitudes towards sexually liberated women, and without dwelling on the grim reality of Violetta ValÃ©ry's decline, illness and death. There are a few swoons and falls, but all within the romanticism of operatic heroines dying from consumption. None of the characterisation deviates from the well-established depiction we have of these characters.And why should it? Arguably, Verdi's remarkable music - the composer in the full-flower of his genius here - carries everything that is necessary, expresses everything that he couldn't explicitly place on the stage. Mark Elder, conducting the London Philharmonic, matches the elegance of the production and it's delicately and sensitively performed with true dramatic drive, but there's just not enough of the Verdian passion in this supreme example of the composer's craft. This is a hugely dynamic work that is all about passion and death, from the first stirrings of love to full-blown ecstasy, running through fear, betrayal and jealousy in Violetta's rapid decline into delirium and death. It's a beautiful production, consistent of purpose and design, and it's wonderfully played, but there's very little sense of the full sweep of Verdi on the stage or from the pit.If there's one aspect where Glyndebourne play less safe and take something of a chance, it's in the casting. First and foremost is Venera Gimadieva's Violetta. A star at the Bolshoi, this is an impressive introduction for the young soprano at Glyndebourne. She doesn't have a big soprano voice and it's not a showy star performance, but Gimadieva sings the role beautifully and looks wonderful. It's not a nuanced performance by any means, her presence is a little cold and she lacks the kind of complete absorption in the role that a more experienced soprano can bring to it, but that could be down to the fact that the solidly traditional characterisation gives her nothing new to bring out of the role either. The same can be said for Michael Fabiano. His Alfredo is beautifully sung in a distinctive and modern tenor voice, and competently performed in a way that makes his character's behaviour totally credible. But it is also totally familiar, with no real insight or exploration of the character at all.Glyndebourne's colourful productions always look fantastic in High Definition and La Traviata is no exception.  The detail is all there in the richly detailed and dark bold colouration of the filmed performance, and the musical tracks are well defined. There are a few informative extra features including an interview with Mark Elder and the cast that considers the attraction of La Traviata and what makes it great.  Another feature looks at the costume, set designs and choreography for this production.

"History hasn't been kind to Richard Strauss's first two operas Guntram (1894) and Feuersnot (1901), both of them better known now by reputation than through actual performance. It's common knowledge that the influence of Wagner was still very present in Strauss's early operas, slavishly so in Guntram, self-consciously in Feuersnot. Not that you would have had much of an opportunity to reevaluate these early operas. One welcome exception, thankfully recorded and preserved for release on Blu-ray, is the rare staging of Feuersnot at the Teatro Massino in Palermo in 2014. Directed by Emma Dante and conducted by Gabriele Ferro, it's a thoughtful and entertaining production that plays to the strengths of the work and overcomes many of the problems that prevent it being staged more often.The main problem with staging Feuersnot, I imagine, is that it's hard to know quite how to pitch Strauss's undoubtedly self-indulgent attempt at parody in the work, and actually make it entertaining. Strauss isn't exactly obscure about his intentions in how he sets himself up as the successor to Wagner writing his own version of Die Meistersinger von NÃ¼rnburg, and presenting himself, in the guise of Kunrad, as something of a stud into the bargain. Musically, he makes a more persuasive case, taking Wagner's mystic spiritualism and giving it a more earthy sensuality.  It could be considered vulgar, but this is entirely in keeping with other Strauss works of this time (Ein Heldenleben in 1898 and Symphonia Domestica in 1903) that would elevate the personal and the domestic to grandiose levels. Or simply find them subjects more worthy and relevant to the present day.The 'legend' of Feuersnot is a thin one, even for a one-act opera (a 'Singgedicht in one act'), with little dramatic drive. Emma Dante however recognises that it's about music and not magic, and brings that not terribly well concealed subtext out in a number of ways. She also attempts to capture the huge variety and dynamic that lies within the score and represent that on the stage with circus acts and dancers to give an impression of constant colour and movement. This can be entertaining and sometimes annoying, but it does certainly bring some liveliness and a certain tongue-in-cheek irreverence that adds to the tone and enlivens a staging of work. The final 'fire dance' scene in particular more than justifies the approach, finding a colourful and meaningful way to represent the otherwise problematic ending.The musical performances all contribute to making this an 'illuminating' production of a rare Strauss opera. Gabriele Ferro underplays the Wagner and emphasises more of the familiar later Strauss characteristics in the score. Nicola Beller Carbone has Wagnerian strength aplenty in the role of Diemut, and although Dietrich Henschel doesn't quite have the force or the volume for a heldenbaritone he sings and plays the role of Kunrad with a mischievous sparkle and verve. None of this is perhaps enough to see Feuersnot reconsidered as canonical Strauss, but it is unquestionably Strauss, and presented in the best possible light here.The 2014 Teatro Massimo production of Feuersnot is released on Bluray by Arthaus, and it looks and sounds terrific in High Definition. The BD has a 12-minute 'Making Of' that gives some insights into the work and the approach to it, and there is also an informative essay on the work in the enclosed booklet. The disc is region-free, but subtitles are in English, German and Korean only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15351NZLYKP24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USQR9SW#wasThisHelpful","R15351NZLYKP24","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christof Loy's strength as a director, as he demonstrates here to remarkable effect in the Deutsche Oper's production of JanÃ¡Äek's JenÅ¯fa, is the depth of characterisation he brings to the drama. It's never an imposed reading, but one that can be found in the music itself - no more so than in JanÃ¡Äek's extraordinary score for this work, one of the greatest operas of the 20th century.The setting in Loy's productions might not always conform to the letter of the libretto, but he nonetheless invariably creates a strong environment for the characters to work in and reveal their inner lives. The tone is established from the outset in a silent scene that shows Kostelnicka brought into an interrogation room. Understanding Kostelnicka's motivations is important, but it has to be seen in the context of the village community in which the opera is set. For Loy all is needed is plain costumes and an austere white box with sliding panels that open up and close JenÅ¯fa off from the community outside. After a while however, you scacely notice the set, so effective is the more significant drama being played out in it.The true impact of it all is only really noted by the time you get to the epilogue of JenÅ¯fa, surely one of the greatest moments of human feeling ever achieved in any opera. In order to reach that moment of near-transcendence, Loy first needs to show the full horror of what leads up to it. He manages to get to the real human tragedy of the story thought the misguided actions of Kostelnica and Laca, and that's helped considerably by two extraordinary performances in those roles. Jennifer Larmore is simply the best Kostelnicka I have ever come across. The scene where she resolves to remove the baby from the picture is chilling and credible, as is how she remains affected and weighted down later as a consequence of her actions. The singing is incredible, but there's also real personality and meaning given to the words and how they manifest in her actions.Laca's role is a dual one that is rather more complex than the character's simplicity of expression would suggest, but all the contradictions and their implications are fully brought out in Loy's staging and in the performance by Will Hartmann. The depth of the tragedy that he has a major hand in setting into motion and the manner in which it is depicted however ensures that the sense of love, repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation that follows is even stronger. Hartmann not only captures that stupid blind, jealous rage of Laca, but also his sensitivity and the depths of his feelings for JenÅ¯fa, unconditionally defending her from the community outrage.There's a danger that JenÅ¯fa herself could remain a passive figure in the opera with no ability to direct her own fortune, her own passions subject to the actions, whims and projections of others. Her beauty and the purity of her feelings is important however and that comes through intact, if inevitably scarred. Michaela Kaune isn't as strong an actor as Larman, but the expression of the essence of JenÅ¯fa is all there in her singing and performance and she clearly puts everything into the role.Similar attention is applied even to secondary roles, but none of Loy's ideas or interpretations exist in isolation or are created out of nothing. All of this is there in the libretto and in the score itself and Donald Runnicles ensures that the precision of the rhythms and their emotional undercurrents all perfectly match the composer's intentions as well as what is happening on the stage.On BD/DVD, Brian Large elects to cut out the audience applause between acts, allowing the force of the drama to playing the drama straight through, and it does make a significant impact, Loy's direction and the acting performances drawing you right in. There are no extra features on the BD50 disc, and the image and audio are reasonably good, but not exceptional. Subtitles (which can only be selected from remote or pop-up while playing) are in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Japanese.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H71GWSHWGZHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUKHZJM#wasThisHelpful","R2H71GWSHWGZHN","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As in the case of Altyn Tolobas, the first of Boris Akunin's novels featuring Nicholas Fandorin (the great-grandson of his Imperial Russia great detective Erast Fandorin), the first volume of this two part follow-up is very much concerned with blood-lines, with heritage and with its relevance to what it means to be Russian in the present day.  Like the earlier book this is brought out in Extracurricular Reading (as its Russian title translates) by a comparison in alternative chapters between Nika in the present day and the adventures of one of his other ancestors in the past.That ancestor this time is Danila Fondorin (a variation on the name of Von Dorn, Cornelius Von Dorn being the ancestor who brought the bloodline to Russia in Altyn Tolobas), a doctor and former personal secretary to Catherine the Great.  The historic part of the story however mostly focuses on another unusual character, Mitia, a gifted six-year old, well-read and with a prowess in mathematics, who is introduced into the royal court by his father as a kind of novelty figure.  Mitia soon becomes involved in plot and intrigue when he foils a plot to poison the Empress, and when he is later caught up in an attempted abduction by the conspirators, he meets and engages the help of Danila.In the Nicholas Fandorin storyline, Nika has set up an advisory agency - The Land of the Soviets - confident that he can offer a solution to any problem to those in need.  Although the term soviet means 'counsel' or advice in Nika's mind, it obviously has other connotations that make him the target for a secret agency who have assassinated several wealthy businessmen and were about to pass a death sentence on Nicholas.  Those connotations and the implications of the Soviet title and the groups that have arisen out of the old regime, are of course used by Akunin to consider other aspects of present day Russia and its more recent historical legacy.  Unfortunately, that really just means that, like Altyn Tolobas, Nika is once again involved in a lot of running around, chased by corrupt policemen and Russian mafia types.In a curious attempt to connect the two threads, the Danila story seems to take a life of its own as a project for a video game being developed by Nicholas in his spare time.  Akunin has some very strange ideas about what's cool in the modern world.  At least however he has dropped Nicholas' affectations for limericks, rollerblades and Chris Deburgh.  Both parts of the story are typical Akunin adventures, but nothing special as crime thrillers.  Akunin of course never writes straightforward thrillers, and Extracurricular Reading likewise explores various aspects of what it means to be Russian from a contemporary and from a historical viewpoint, and there are some nice observations and references.  There are a few other notable features here, not least Nicholas's ass-kicking ployglot transgender assistant Valia Glen, where questions of identity are far more complex.Never quite up to the standard of Akunin's Erast Fandorin or Sister Pelagia novels, the Nicholas Fandorin books so far are of curiousity value only.  It doesn't appear that the Nicholas Fandorin books are going to be published in English, or at least not until the Erast Fandorin novels are exhausted (which could be a few years yet).  The French translation of Extracurricular Reading (Bon sang ne saurait mentir) is split across two volumes, with an abrupt and unnatural conclusion at the end of the first volume that indicates that the book was never meant to be divided up in this way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78SDRHKLDKDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2264050675#wasThisHelpful","R78SDRHKLDKDW","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about Edan Lepucki's California is not just the way that the author envisions and describes the social breakdown of a near-future United States, but the fact that she makes it seem scarily inevitable.  It's closer to JG Ballard then than the more fashionable Cormac McCarthy that California will inevitably and misleadingly be compared to.  While it's just as good as capturing that sense of a world turned upside down by natural disaster - with some man-made assistance - and even has some of Ballard's ambiguous character types, California doesn't quite bring it all together into a conceptual whole with the same sense of deranged visionary zeal as Ballard.Only touched upon in passing, the sense of what has happened to the US is nonetheless convincingly real in the light of disasters like Hurricane Katrina.  A cataclysmic earthquake, the depletion of oil reserves, a few other natural disasters and a flu epidemic following in quick succession and it's surprising how rapidly all the institutions we once relied upon for security and stability collapse.  In the aftermath of the crisis - one that it appears that has slowly gaining momentum rather than happening in one big crash - society has been reduced to a few isolated Communities zealously guarding what they can grab hold of, protecting themselves from Pirates and other individuals striking out and attempting to live on what little patch of land they can manage.Lepucki's depiction of Cal and Frida is likewise subtle and realistic in how they each view and relate to this new reality, giving a personal view of the situation and hinting at some wider implications.  Frida's brother Micah, who was involved in activism and terrorism prior to the eventual collapse, extends that look back to the past and gives some background on the days leading up to it, while the fact that Frida believes she is pregnant has implications and concerns about what the future holds. This forces them to seek help from one of the secretive communities, where they meet Mikey.  More of an ambiguous Ballard figure, revelling in his newfound position of power and better equipped to cope with its challenges, he represents just how closely linked and interdependent are the forces of order and chaos.Having set this all up so well and holding you through the revelations, California never really seems to amount to anything however and there's a sense that it kind of fizzles out.  We are left with implications of further unrest and upheaval to come, which does provide a suitably sinister open-endedness, but there's also the feeling that Edan Lepucki hasn't really been able to satisfactorily bring all these intriguing elements into something greater.  There's surely a lot more to explore here however, so perhaps a follow-up isn't out of the question. At the very least we have an interesting new author here who can write well and engage with important contemporary issues that will eventually affect us all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A5LAHX3YSIXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFHG13M#wasThisHelpful","R1A5LAHX3YSIXC","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's 1945 and someone is killing soldiers in Berlin.  That might not sound terribly surprising, but the war is supposed to be over at this stage.  These killings however seem to be connected to the atrocities that occurred in Berlin as Russian and allied troops arrived in the city and divided it up into French, Russian, British and American sectors, and soldiers from all those nations are being lured, ambushed and executed by an unknown killer.What has this to do with Kasper Meier?  Like most Berliners who survived the war, he keeps alive doing small favours, trading goods and information for scarce basic provisions and medical supplies on the black market.  Kasper Meier knows the benefits of lying low and minding your own business, but a young woman, Eva Hirsch - a rubble girl working on one of the clearing teams of Frau Beckmann - has approached him using blackmail to obtain information on a British pilot they are looking to find.  As if that's not enough leverage, Meier is also harrassed continually by Frau Beckmann's terrifying twins.The Spring of Kasper Meier works well on a number of levels.  The ruined Berlin of 1945 serves as a fine backdrop for a thriller, the military control and zones making movement and travel difficult and risky - particularly for anyone dealing in stolen and black market goods.  There are however other unknown dangers, and Ben Fergusson does well to relate them to Kasper Meier's position.  Considering his background and experiences, he has every reason to be wary and necessarily resourceful.Ultimately, The Spring of Kasper Meier manages bringing the personal and the historical elements together well to tackle bigger issues of the complexities of morality and individual actions during very extreme times.  In this post-war devastation it's more than just being a fight for survival or a settling of scores ('""My nephew died of pneumonia this winter.  Christmas Eve.  Never got to see 1946"" - ""He didn't miss much"", said Kasper'), it's about confronting the personal demons that have been awakened and let loose in such savage times and finding a way to live with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWDWLGLPMYUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFHG0TC#wasThisHelpful","R1EWDWLGLPMYUS","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her latest book Michelle Lovric finds a fascinating suitable subject that proves to be worthy of the talents of the author of The Book of Human Skin.  The True and Splendid History of the Harristown Sisters is another wonderful, imaginative and often sensual exploration of human experience from an unusual perspective, and this time it's all ""tied-up"" in hair.  After the huge scope and ambition of The Book of Human Skin however, it's possible that one might also be just a little ""let down"" by all the hair-raising business and domestic matters in the author's latest book.There's not much chance however of the reader being anything but dazzled by the brilliance and wit of the creation of the seven Swiney sisters, or as they become known by their stage-name, the Swiney Godivas.  Famed for the extraordinary length and lustre of their hair (Lovric every bit as creative in her descriptions of the ladies' hair as she was about the tint, texture and tone of skin in her last book), the sisters achieve great fame for their songs, plays and routines (scripted by flame-haired narrator Manticory) that show off their most alluring attributes to ""foxy"" men and admiring ladies.  Their fame attracts business proposals that make them very rich indeed, but their impoverished background and uncertain parentage comes back to haunt them, with internal strife and rivalry between the sisters exacerbated by love interests who like to ""butter their bap on both sides"".What is marvellous about the author's writing here is how well she adopts and creatively exploits situation in post-famine rural Ireland, bringing in all kind of cultural and social references (much as she did with Venice in her previous novel), as well as delighting with a ""generosity of syllables"" in the rich language of insults and ""ballyragging"" that are traded not just between the sisters but in a much more authentically vicious and violent manner between the eldest sister Darcy and her nemesis Eileen O'Reilly, the butcher's daughter.  Darcy however has a manner that ensures that she finds plenty of other enemies as targets for her invective as the girls move to Dublin, Venice (inevitably!) and on to greater things.Lovric again manages to bring in several other relevant themes that elevate the book, to much more than just a period historical fiction, some of it relating to the exploitation of women and the part they play themselves in their own downfall, to the shady nature of business practices and the dangers of attracting the attention of the press (""Newsprint is black for a reason"").  Primarily however the book is concerned with female issues and the domestic arrangements between the seven sisters and their lovers, which would be tedious at this length were it not for the richness of Lovric's descriptions and the imaginativeness of the situations.  I found it a little over drawn-out this time, but Lovric is a hugely talented writer, clearly capable of turning her hand to any subject and making it truly magical.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNH2SYOZB9ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408833417#wasThisHelpful","R2KNH2SYOZB9ZT","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The purpose or indeed the true worth of Ariadne auf Naxos isn't always immediately identifiable.  Like Der Rosenkavalier, Arabella and Capriccio, the opera is partly a homage to opera and older forms of music and in how they clash with a more modern sensibility, and partly it's an experiment with style and form.  Musically and poetically it's clearly a work of exquisite beauty and sophistication, but isn't it really just a frivolous exercise that's overly contrived and ultimately inconsequential?  Ariadne auf Naxos, of course, is only silly and inconsequential if it's allowed to be and only if it's played either too straight or its seemingly one-note joke is overplayed for laughs.  It's extremely rare that a director is able to get to the heart and true genius of the work in the way that Katharina Thoma does for the 2013 Glyndebourne production.The coming together of high art and low entertainment to reach out and say something meaningful to an audience is the ""message"" of Ariadne auf Naxos.  Zerbinetta's deflating of the lofty expressions of Ariadne's self-indulgent grief (What she really needs is a new man!"") reflects a belief that life's difficult questions may indeed be found in life's simple pleasures.  Does the opera however really need so much artifice to deliver such a simple sentiment?  Well, Ariadne auf Naxos is about the transformative power of love, the creation and realisation of one's dreams and illusions, the creation of ""little gods"", and in a way that's what opera does too.  It's not life, it's an artificial construct, but it's one that nonetheless contains essential truths, real emotions and feelings and stagecraft and illusion is very much a part of the package.The WWII period setting for this Ariadne auf Naxos has proven to be controversial in some parts - which I find hard to believe.  In reality it's fully supportive of the themes of the work and its opera within an opera conceit by cleverly placing its country estate setting within the country estate setting of Glyndebourne.  More than just being a clever self-referential idea however, Katharina Thoma makes the essential conflict within the opera work by relating it back to an issue that plagued Strauss and his librettist Hugh von Hofmannstahl through most of their working lives - the question of the split between the world of the artist and reality.  His career spanning two world wars, the question of whether the artist has any responsibility for what goes on in the wider world or whether they should remain above politics and concerned only with essential universal questions of human nature was a particularly thorny question for Strauss as a German composer.It's not difficult to see Strauss' personal dilemma in the character of the Composer and his horror of the desecration of his glorious work of art - ""Why drag me from my world into this?"", he asks as fighter planes fly over the stately home, bombs explode and masonry falls from the ceiling onto the stage.  The actual performance of the combined operas takes place subsequently in the same stately home that has now been converted into a field hospital for the wounded.  Looking like a WWII entertainment company, Zerbinetta's chirpy optimism however represents the spirit and tenacity of the ordinary citizen to pull through, no matter how bleak the situation, although she herself exhibits signs of PTSD-induced delirium.  Bacchus arrives as a battle-weary fighter pilot ready to assist Ariadne through to the promise of the new post-war world.  This is simply marvellous characterisation and presentation.  The power of art, theatre, music and - very specifically - music and opera to transform and illuminate reality is exactly what Ariadne auf Naxos sets out to demonstrate.  There's nothing frivolous about it.And if the stagecraft helps brings these elements out, the performances are no less critical to getting the message across.  Soile Isokoski is a soaring Ariadne, Sergey Skorokhodov a suitably heldentenor Bacchus, Kate Lindsey an intense Composer, singing marvellously and even making her presence felt in the second part, Laura Claycomb a sparkling Zerbinetta.  Vladimir Jurowski draws out the delicate beauty of the opera's reduced ensemble instrumentation, tying its deceptively simple melodies accurately to the tone and the intent of the production.  The region-free Blu-ray presents the production well on a BD50 disc, with extra features that look at the design and concept.  Jurowski is particularly impressed at how insightfully the production draws out all the meaning of a difficult work.  Subtitles are in English, French, German and Korean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL98CJXPT8TLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQHWAJG#wasThisHelpful","RL98CJXPT8TLZ","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You never know quite what to expect from a new Bayreuth production other than the certainty that it won't be a ""traditional"" staging of a Wagner opera. Jan Philipp Gloger's concept for the 2012 production of Der Fliegende HollÃ¤nder for example, is initially difficult to figure out, but there are a few things that stand in its favour that suggest that it at least holds true to the spirit and intention of the work. One is its adherence to the dramatic and mythological strengths of the work, the other is the quality of the performance itself, conducted by Christian Thielemann and sung well by a strong cast.It's not immediately obvious what the setting or the intention is here from the first act, and there's not much that appears consistent in the tone or the concept in the acts that follow either. Act I seems to suggest a futuristic setting, dark walls of a motherboard lighting-up with the flashes of the storm, one that seems to derive directly from the ominous and unnoticed approach of the cyborg Dutchman's phantom ship. Act II doesn't enlighten matters any, the female chorus not a group of wives-a-weaving but workers in a factory packing fans into boxes. Among this group of sweetly singing industrious ladies, Senta comes across as a bit of an odd-ball - dark, gloomy and not a little deranged, crafting an abstract sculpture of the mythical Dutchman out of spare bits of wood, black tar and packing.Things do start to fall into place in Act III (although it might help if you refer to the director's notes on the production in the accompanying booklet). Broadly speaking it's not that far removed from Martin Kusej's interpretation for De Nederlandse in terms of how  the subject of Der Fliegende HollÃ¤nder is viewed as a question of love versus commerce. According to Jan Philipp Gloger, the Dutchman's curse is to be ever in search of new markets and increasing his profits. Weary of the pace of modern life and cold practicality of business, he needs to find some peace and get back in touch with real human feelings. This is a credible reading of the work, but it also takes into consideration Wagner's belief in the romantic and ennobling power of myth, converting Senta into a makeshift angel, her actions inspiring her co-workers to recognise her human sacrifice in a commemorative object d'art. That sounds belittling of Wagner's mythology, but it actually brings it back to human terms without losing any of the grandeur of the work. That's emphatically all there in the music.Christian Thielemann's conducting of the Bayreuth orchestra might perhaps be a little unadventurous, but it's perfectly attuned to the dramatic performance and the singing. Unshowy, it's sensitive to the intricacies of the score, muscular where required, light and lyrical in other places with a true romantic sweep and dramatic drive. It's wonderful to hear, but even more impressive in how it connects with all the points of the dramatic staging. The singing here is very strong in all the roles. Ricarda Merbeth in particular is outstanding as Senta. Merbeth not only meets all the technical requirements, she delivers it with ringing lyricism that captures the magical as well as the all too human nature of her character. She's at her best in the critical Act II scene with the Dutchman which has to make this unlikely couple seem credible and she and Samuel Youn do indeed 'click' and work together wonderfully.  You can't fault the casting in the other roles here either and the choral work is outstanding.On Blu-ray, the 2013 Bayreuther Festspiele production of Der Fliegende HollÃ¤nder looks and sounds tremendous. Extras consist of short interviews, the most notable an entertaining interview with Christian Thielemann being amiably(?) spiky and contrary, clearly knowing his own mind with respects to Wagner and this work.

"AndrÃ© Modeste GrÃ©try is another of those composers who were wildly popular in their time but whose work is now considered somewhat unfashionable and unlikely to click with a modern audience. The spoken dialogue, comic diversions and pleasant melodies of the French opÃ©ra-comique operetta form is far removed the sophistication of GrÃ©try's contemporary Mozart. Written in 1791 (the year Mozart died) for Paris audiences by a composer who came through the French Revolution, the timing of his version of the William Tell story at least gives it some historical interest. It gives much more than that however in this terrific production from LiÃ¨ge, which goes to great lengths to reproduce the authentic nature and the spirit of the work, and manages to do so to great effect.Running to only 85 minutes in length, GrÃ©try's version of Guillaume Tell is considerably more concise in its treatment of the historical drama than Rossini's final masterpiece, but by and large the main points are the same. The composer even finds plenty of opportunity within this short running time to introduce all those little colourful interludes and songs that seem to have little relevance to the actual drama but are so much a part of the opÃ©ra-comique style. The comic drama, singing and dancing tends to dominate the earlier part, it has to be said, with the real drama taking place mostly off-stage.  We get reports of Gessler's tax-demands that affect the little Swiss canton, we hear about the blinding of the elder Melktal, and we are told about the new edict to bow before Gessler's authority, but none of it is actually shown.  William Tell's defiance of the ruling isn't shown either, but the challenge to shoot an apple set on the head of his son is there. That bit we most definitely don't miss out on.Despite the unusual approach to the development of the drama, with many diversions of local colour and humour, GrÃ©try's Guillaume Tell is nonetheless wonderfully constructed, hitting all the necessary dramatic points with plenty of entertainment and colour. It's also performed that way in this charming production of the work by the OpÃ©ra Royal de Wallonie. There's a lot of comic exaggeration in the long drawn out phrases and curious intonations of the spoken dialogue, which apparently is an historically accurate way of performing an opÃ©ra-comique.  It takes a little getting used to, but it does add something to what might otherwise sound silly - even if that is just more silliness. Most disconcertingly, it's even used during the grave account of the elder Melktal's blinding, which makes it curiously funny and disturbing at the same time.Elsewhere there's a similar approach to the staging, which on the one hand looks cheesy with its old-fashioned Swiss country village setting and painted backdrops (including a wheeled on cow that leaves behind a bit of a mess), but it also captures the contradictory nature of this Guillaume Tell (and perhaps GrÃ©try's ambivalent response to the Revolution which did him little favour as a composer and citizen of Paris). It gets across the spirit of the work in a way that feels authentic, or at least appropriate. This tone and its effectiveness is best exemplified in the battle scene which is played out with cardboard cut-out soldiers operated by puppet strings. A little more modern technical wizardry is called for in the critical apple shooting archery scene - a neon-lit arrow flying with slow-motion sureness on the darkened stage towards its goal - but again it all fits marvellously with the tone adopted.The acting and singing performances are all also very much on the same page. The performances never pretend to be anything other than fully theatrical, but they are taken seriously within this context and never resort to tongue-in-cheek making fun of the work or its stylisations. This has been typical of OpÃ©ra Royal de Wallonie productions under the direction of Stefano Mazzonis di Pralafera, and once again it proves to be the best possible way of presenting this kind of material. Also typical of the LiÃ¨ge company is the use of a strong regular cast of Belgian singers for such home-grown works.  Accordingly, we have the usual solid performances from Marc Laho as Tell, although his character is somewhat surprisingly not tested with any arias in this work, Anne-Catherine Gillet as his wife (taking most of the main arias and singing them wonderfully), with Lionel Lhote as Gessler and Liesbeth Devos as the Tell's daughter Marie. With this kind of presentation, GrÃ©try's Guillaume Tell becomes more than just a fascinating historical curiosity and comes fully to life once again as a marvellous entertainment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCFVS77Z6OGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ3OY8M#wasThisHelpful","R1BCFVS77Z6OGL","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At its best, opera can be one of most progressive, cutting-edge artforms out there, continually pushing stage-craft and the art of performances to new heights, using live cinema and webcasts to take opera out of the dusty theatres that remain the preserve of a privileged elite and strive to make it fresh, modern and accessible to a wider, younger audience. Broadcast live on Austrian television from an aircraft hangar, Die EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail Live at Hangar-7 in Salzburg is a fine example of the innovation and creative forces that go into modern opera productions. I don't think that this Blu-ray release of the event will convince any of the traditionalists out there, but at the very least this is an ambitious and largely successful attempt to approach Mozart's entertaining opera in a new, fresh and original manner.Basically, this is an open-air performance shot in a vast hangar/terminal/museum that holds aircraft, helicopters and classic cars in a boldly coloured, modern, high-tech building with plush cafÃ©s and lounge bars. The performance takes place on 10 or 11 stages that have been set-up around the building, the singers moving from one to another seamlessly down ramps and on platforms, singing into clearly visible radio-mic headsets. The Camerata Salzburg orchestra play live from Hangar-8, while the audience (in expensive suits and dresses, carrying glasses of champagne) wander around freely, listening to the live play-back on in-ear headphones, while skipping back occasionally so as to dodge camera crews and avoid bumping into the performers.The concept for the production takes the opera out of the Turkish seraglio and finds another means of showing women used as commodities by re-imagining Bassa Selim as a fashion designer with a private (sponsored) jet-plane, his seraglio a sweatshop of seamstresses who manufacture his clothes. You might be less inclined to go along with this were the quality of the performance compromised in any way, but it's not at all. DesirÃ©e Rancatore had the unenviable task of replacing an indisposed Diana Damrau in a highly unconventional production at very short notice and does exceptionally well considering. Rebecca Nelsen is a rather more confident Blonde and Javier Camarena a reliable Belmonte. Kurt Rydl isn't the steadiest as Osmin, but gets by and with Thomas Ebenstein a fine Pedrillo, this is a cast who are more than capable of doing the work justice.The use of radio-mics allows for softer and sweeter singing that doesn't have to soar above the orchestra and this works well for the singers here. Some might see that as an unacceptable compromise, but it gets the best balance between the singing and the orchestra and it's the end result that counts in this production. With Hans Graf conducting the Camerata Salzburg through an elegant account of the work, it adds up to an impressive and sometimes stunning production of the work. Conceived with a filmed broadcast in mind, the production also looks and sounds simply fabulous on Blu-ray. Extras include a full 'Alternative Cut' which is however rather pointlessly presented in a tiny window in the corner of the screen of the main film. Surely this would have been a good opportunity to put the neglected 'Angle' button on the remote to good use? A 27-minute 'Making Of' answers most of the questions you might have had about the logistics of putting on a production like this. The disc is BD50, region-free, with subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KK69YR8I1UWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXGNU8M#wasThisHelpful","R2KK69YR8I1UWZ","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ÄŒeskÃ½ Krumlov Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has one of the oldest working Baroque theatres in the world and as such it's a fine place to re-examine one of the most important works in the entire opera repertoire in a hopefully more authentic light. With VÃ¡clav Luks conducting the period Collegium 1704 orchestra, a traditionally-informed stage production lit only by wax candles and countertenor singing the role of Orpheus, this Orfeo ed Euridice is undoubtedly closer to the original than most other productions.  There are however a few caveats that can be given about the nature of the film itself.Primarily, this production of Orfeo ed Euridice is shot as a film, which does take away somewhat from the charm of seeing it performed in a Baroque theatre.  It's not filmed in the traditional manner of a live theatre performance, but it is clearly a live performance, shot over a number of takes, with perhaps a small amount of overdubs.  Musically though, it sounds wonderful, the theatre creating a natural acoustic reverb rather than an amplified sound.  There is rather a harder edged gut string pluck and rhythm that isn't quite so smooth, and heard this way it does present the opera in a new light.This works wonderfully when its performed in Act I on the stage of the Baroque theatre where Orpheus mourns the death of Eurydice.  It's old-style theatre, with painted forests to the wings and a sea at the back with old-fashioned pulley-operated rolling sea effects.  Amore too descends in an authentically shaky manner on a mechanical cloud to give Orpheus a chance to bring his beloved back to the land of the living.  Unfortunately, once Orpheus descends through the trapdoor to the Underworld, much of the remainder of the performance takes place in the wider setting of the backstage and the caverns of the castle and - other than the Elysium scene - not on the stage at all.The locations backstage and in the wings are at least well used in this respect, retaining the candlelight illuminations, giving the underworld a suitably eerie and otherworldly appearance.  Even here, with wooden beams and stone staircases, there are no anachronisms, although you would suspect that the Furies might be familiar with the ""zombie shuffle"" choreography of Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video.  There are also some clever touches like the play of shadows embracing and holding hands as Orpheus leads Eurydice out of the underworld that don't need to rely on special effects.  The idea is nice, playing on the magic of the theatre experience and how it extends beyond the stage and takes on a life of its own, but I did find that the 'film' concept and editing distracted a little from the power of the work itself.The original 1762 Vienna edition of the work has also been cut back slightly with most of the ballets shortened or excised entirely.  The Act III Scene 3 dances, for example, are all missing.  I suspect that the decision was made for artistic reasons (Bejun Mehta is credited also as Artistic Advisor here), since they get in the way of the clear narrative flow that is needed more for the film than a stage production, but such cuts aren't unusual. This is however a good account of the work that sounds wonderful, matching the stripped-back reformist nature of the work with a reduced period orchestra.  The casting is also good with Bejun Mehta's sweet countertenor giving this Orpheus a suitably lyrical quality, Eva Liebau presenting a strong Eurydice and Regula MÃ¼hlemann a bright Amore.On Blu-ray, this looks very fine indeed.  There's a slightly softer edge to the image on account of it being filmed by candlelight, but it's clear and detailed with lovely tones and textures.  The audio mixes are PCM stereo and DTS HD-master Audio 5.0.  The mix is bright but there's a pleasant naturalness to the sound.  The balance between the voices and the orchestra is different in the two mixes, the surround track seeming to make more use of reverb and give prominence to the voices, while the stereo track is more direct and evenly balanced.  There are no extras on the BD25 region-free disc (a documentary on the restoration of the theatre can be found on the DVD/BD release of Domenico Scarlatti's Dove Ã¨ Amore Ã¨ Gelosia), but the booklet gives some background on how the film was made and the history of the Baroque theatre.  There's no synopsis provided, but the plot of Orfeo ed Euridice is simplicity itself.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPLKW08N3CTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAAOTOE#wasThisHelpful","R3NPLKW08N3CTM","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are good reasons why you probably don't often come across productions of Leonardo Vinci's Artaserse. Written in 1730, there are the usual musical and staging questions to resolve in how to present opera from this period , but this one is even more rarely performed since it requires no less than five countertenors to sing the extravagantly arranged castrato roles of the work. And not just any five countertenors , but you really need five of the best in the world to be able to do any kind of justice to this particular work.The arias and ariosos are not long-winded or overly ornamented, but they are demanding nonetheless and really require virtuoso control. Each role moreover clearly has been composed for a specific type of countertenor voice. It can be difficult to distinguish who is who with all the outlandish costume changes, wigs and face-paint - to say nothing of the difficulty of determining role gender - but every single countertenor voice here has their own unique sound and character, and each are outstanding within the role they play. Arbace has arguably the most traumatic dilemma, consumed with guilt over the death of  Serse and unjustly accused of murder himself, Franco Fagioli is outstanding in how he plays out this inner turmoil. It's Philippe Jaroussky as Artaserse however who has to balance the sense of friendship and fairness in dealing out justice with the shock of his father's violent death, knowing that much lies in the balance.The romantic complications of Semira and her conflicted sentiments would seem less important, but Valer Barna-Sabadus' astonishing delivery will convince you otherwise. This is where the real quality of Metastasio's libretto shows, giving each characters the opportunity to express their sentiments in such a way that the listener is swayed between them and sympathetic to their plight. If you've the right singer in those parts, the effect is even more pronounced, and that's the case here with Max Emanuel Cencic's Mandane, with Yuriy Mynenko's Megabise and even with Juan Sancho's Artebano. The music is exquisite - and it's marvellously played here Diego Fasolis conducting the Concerto KÃ¶ln from harpsichord - but perhaps not so much that it stands out from other settings of the work or indeed other opera seria works like it. What makes Vinci's version extraordinary is indeed its setting for five countertenors. That is what is so impressive about it, and when it has singers of sufficient calibre, it raises the work to another level entirely.The direction by Silviu PurcÄƒrete plays on what is undoubtedly the unique selling point of this version of Artaserse as being possibly the greatest showcase for the divas of early opera, the castrato. With its extravagant costumes and five lighted theatre make-up mirrors placed to the sides of the stage, there's a lot of preening and posing on the part of all the leads, but there's more to this than just showmanship. It's always a challenge to make a Baroque opera lively and visually engaging, and this one does it by representing its extravagance and its heightened theatrical qualities. Naturalism is not an important factor here. The theatricality of the staging is emphasised by the manner in which this performance is recorded. Aside from the dressing-room mirrors at the side of the stage, the camera occasionally follows character exits backstage, or shows them preparing for their entrance, adjusting costumes behind screens that are being wheeled across the stage by stage-hands. Some might find this distracting, but visually and conceptually it holds attention, and that's what is important.In the absence of a Blu-ray release, the Erato DVD presents the work relatively well if all you are interested in are the basics of the performance. In terms of technical specifications however it's well below the standard of what is more commonly offered for opera on Blu-ray releases. The image quality is clear and stable, perfectly fine for Standard Definition with the performance spread across 2xDVD-9 discs. The audio mixes are LPCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 in 48kHz/16-bit, the sound clear and bright with natural stage echo preferred over pristine clarity. The DVD is region-free, the subtitles English, French, German and Italian. And that's about the best you can say about this release. There are no extra features, there's no booklet, there's no synopsis -nothing. For such a rare work as this, staged so well and unlikely to be revisited anytime soon, that's very disappointing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54MTNQXQGLFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ3L25M#wasThisHelpful","R54MTNQXQGLFL","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pink Suit is about much more than the creation of the iconic costume Jackie Kennedy was wearing on the day in 1963 when her husband John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas.  It's also so much more than an insight into the fashion industry during its golden age, but undoubtedly this is also a significant and fascinating aspect of Nicole Mary Kelby's novel, particularly in the loving attention to detail that goes into her descriptions of the cut and craft of the Chanel design, as well as the controversy over the copies and the competition.The creation of the famous pink suit however is actually delicately undertaken by a Manhattan fashion house, Chez Ninon, where Kate is a seamstress.  It's a higher class knockoff copy designer house, a kind of a front to ensure that the First Lady is seen to be supporting the US fashion industry and not spending a fortune on importing a fancy French wardrobe.  It's Kate, tasked with replicating the Chanel suit, who is the focus of the novel.  Coming from an Irish immigrant family, her experience and background extends our view of the period, taking in life on the streets in New York for ordinary people during extraordinary times.Kate's personal circumstances places her in  a perfect positioned to capture this sublime moment in history; in near-touching distance with celebrity, hoping to start her own fashion house, but feeling the down-to-earth tug of family responsibility and the pressure to marry a fiancÃ© who is a butcher by profession.  That is a fascinating and infinitely more interesting area to explore than adding to the crowded field of literature on the sordid history of JFK's term of office and the conspiracies surrounding his assassination. From this perspective, the evocation of the period is just wonderful, the writing capturing the buzz of the Catholic Irish-American community of New York, the glamour of the fashion industry, and the feeling of being at the centre of the world.Nicole Mary Kelby's writing is almost miraculous in how she is able to create a sense of something greater out of something so seemingly prosaic, mirroring Kate's experience with Jackie Kennedy's.  I don't for a second believe that an Irish butcher boy and a back-room seamstress are capable of expressing their feelings for each other and for the intricacies of their humble professions in language that has such poetic resonance for life and living, but it's easy to feel that this is the poetry of their souls and the magic of the age.  It's simply gorgeous heartfelt writing of remarkable insight and a beauty of expression that gives us a sense of what it must have been like to live in a time when everything was greater, when anything seemed possible, when the dream of perfection could be summed up in an exquisitely tailored suit.  For an all too brief while at least.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16EY8ZBG3ZHUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316235652#wasThisHelpful","R16EY8ZBG3ZHUT","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that attracted me to this book was the setting.  1935 in Italian occupied Eritrea is an interesting time and place, not quite war time, but moving in that direction.  The second thing that interested me was the title.  The Italian perspective of the events that brought them into the war on the side of the Germans is complex and rarely covered in fiction, so a look at them from the view of a ""good Italian"" also promises an intriguing moral angle on the situation.Stephen Burke's novel doesn't disappoint on either of those questions - or at least not until the latter chapters that seem to bring some of the most interesting events leading up to the war in North Africa to a rather hurried conclusion.  Initially however, there is indeed something Graham Greene-like about the moral position of Enzo Sacchi, a young man from Genoa who finds himself harbourmaster at the port of Massawa.  With Italy about to expand their colonisation of the region, does Enzo even have any say in whether he follows the orders that will bring death and devastation to Ethiopia.Enzo has another dilemma over whether he is being complicit in the exploitation of the natives when he takes on a cook/cleaner, expecting her to also share his bed.  It's common among his friends to have Eritrean mistresses, but in Enzo's case, he wants to believe that Aatifa isn't being forced into the arrangement.  Just to complicate matters, the Italian authorities are planning to clamp down heavily on such ""fraternisation"" with those of ""inferior race"".  Enzo likewise believes that he and his compatriots are bringing order, development, civilisation to a deprived region, and that sometimes war is necessary to achieve that, so Enzo's role as a ""good Italian"" is not so clear-cut.Burke manages to treat this situation realistically then, if not quite with the deep existential anguish of a Graham Greene character.  This leads things to unravel somewhat in the latter part of the book, particularly when the war extends into the region.  We get some perspective on this from the experience of Enzo's friend Salvatore - and find out about some horrifying war crimes - but it's a little too cursory in this area and seems more concerned with resolving the romance story.  Neither aspect rings true or realistic in its resolution, but that doesn't detract too much from the qualities of the novel elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOFT519LZ6PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848549148#wasThisHelpful","R2MOFT519LZ6PQ","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There'll be a few eyebrows raised at the realisation that not only does Tom Thorne not get fired after the fiasco of his action in The Dying Hours, but he actually gets promoted.  Or rather, reinstated back to his position as Detective Inspector.  Billingham slightly glosses over this issue - investigation ongoing - but does present a kind of rationale for it.  Thorne is needed for a very special task, a prisoner escort operation to locate a buried body that a serial killer has owned up to many years after his imprisonment.  Thorne is needed because he's had dealings with the prisoner in the past.  A guy called Stuart Nicklin.Having Thorne back as DI and bringing back Stuart Nickln (from Scaredy Cat) would seem like Billingham is returning to safe and familiar ground, but surprisingly, The Bones Beneath takes Thorne away from his familiar London stomping grounds for a very different setting - a small remote island off the coast of Wales, Bardsey Island.  As you can probably guess, having Thorne and deadly serial killer Nicklin together on an isolated island, with limited communications with the mainland, is going to be a bit of a tense and dangerous situation.  Particularly when you know that Nicklin has specifically requested Thorne come along, and that he has brought another prisoner along for motives that aren't immediately clear.  There's clearly more to this than just a buried body.In the afterword, Billingham confesses to there being a bit of himself in Thorne, but I think there might also be a bit of Nicklin in there as well.  I'm not saying he's a serial murderer (although he is responsible for a number of horrible deaths in his writing career), but he does have a great ability to get into the heads of his characters, explore the cracks in their personalities and exploit them to great effect.  That's the great strength about The Bones Beneath, even if you have some doubts about the viability of the plot regarding the security arrangements put in place for such a risky venture.  There's a real battle of wits here between two complex characters, and there's more besides in the other strong secondary characters he has developed (although it seems Billingham still doesn't really know what to do with Helen Weeks).Billingham is also successful in how he places Thorne in a new environment.  Away from the London-based books, The Bones Beneath adopts a completely different kind of pace that emulates the undulations of the Welsh countryside, the unpredictability of the tides and the possibility of stormy weather.  The plot runs pretty much along expected lines for the job in hand, but what makes it so readable is Billingham's writing and his ability to define characters and situations with a few terse words of exchanged dialogue and black humour.  As well as the potential (certainty) of Nicklin's motivations being other than they appear, there are also the usual few unknowns weaved into the plot that promise a big twist.  I'm not sure it's an entirely plausible one, but this is nonetheless a welcome change of pace for Billingham and Thorne.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPTOLWXE6A55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802122485#wasThisHelpful","R2VPTOLWXE6A55","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's quite clear from the extra features of the BD release that the cast and creative team behind the 2013 Glyndebourne production of Don Pasquale are of one mind about what is the essential purpose of the work. The audience should come away from a performance of Donizetti's charming and delightful comedy feeling that they have been amused and entertained. And they are absolutely right. Don Pasquale is a very funny work, it has some amusing comedy characters and situations, some lively melodies and songs. So why then does the Glyndebourne production feel so lifeless and just plain unfunny?Well, for a start everything feels forced. The work demands a lightness of touch from both the orchestra and from the cast. Not necessarily subtlety - you can ham-up Don Pasquale as much as you like and it can still be riotously funny - but with at least some measure of fluidity and consistency. Enrique Mazzola at least understands and projects the right tone for the work and the London Philharmonic fairly romp through the work, but the staging, the direction and a few of the the performances leave something to be desired. Many of those elements introduced in the form of props are bewildering and just plain unfunny. Characters that are witty and entertaining in their own right are inconsistent here, working against the natural humour towards a forced twist that doesn't really work.Some good singing and comic timing can hide a multitude of sins and implausibilities in the plot, but none of them really seem to make the characters work. You would think that the bubbly and irrepressible Danielle de Niese would at least make a sparkling and bright Norina, but she looks and sounds uncomfortable in the role, her singing a little strained and the effort showing in her exaggerated actions. It might look fine in the Glyndebourne hall, but in close-up in High Definition it seems overplayed. By way of contrast Nikolay Borchev doesn't quite have enough personality or a voice big enough for the role, but he copes well with the singing and with the characterisation that he's been asked to play. Alek Shrader lovely pure tenor voice is on form here, but any impression that he might have made suffers from the lack of direction and trivialising of his role in this production. Alessandro Corbelli too is left to make what he can out of his Don Pasquale, but does so marvellously with a luxurious tone, precise enunciation and deft weighting of delivery.These are small compensations though for the lack of real wit and humour in Mariame ClÃ©ment's characterisation and direction. Comic opera is difficult to carry off, but when it's done right it can be dazzlingly brilliant. Unfortunately once you've seen one such a work done really well it does colour your view and sets a standard that is hard for others to live up to. In this case of Don Pasquale, the Met's production with Anna Netrebko's Norina is a masterclass in comic opera performance. The attention to character, situation and comic timing in that production makes it all look so effortlessly easy, and emphasises just how forced and awkward the Glyndebourne one is by comparison.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJNQLJKKO35K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J92CSDW#wasThisHelpful","R3LJNQLJKKO35K","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some respects, Adam Brookes' Night Heron is a standard and even run-of-the-mill espionage thriller. The operation here runs along familiar lines, with stock characters and shady agencies. There are however a few points where Night Heron stands out from the crowd. One is that it's set in China, a place of major significance in the world today, and one whose actions and growing power is still largely unknown. Another point in its favour is that this is the debut novel from a former BBC correspondent in China, so it's written with an on-the-ground familiarity with the subject.What is most interesting about this spy thriller however is the nature of the informant. Peanut/Li Huasheng, code-name Night Heron, has helped the British Intelligence before, but it was 20 years ago. In he meantime he's been locked away in a ""labour reform faculty"" in the Qinghau desert. On escape he attempts to reopen his links with British Intelligence through a journalist in Beijing, Philip Mangan, with the offer of access to top secret missile information in return for getting him out of China. What Peanut doesn't know however is that a lot has changed in China and the world in the last 20 years, namely computer systems, mobile phones and other communications technology and with it the whole new world of cyber-espionage.It's not just that technology now provides access to vast amounts of important information for people with the right connections, but it has also improved security and counter-espionage, with mobile tracking devices, camera surveillance and advanced warning systems against hacking and unauthorised access. Peanut is in way above his head - which is a scary place to be here - but the kind of information he has access to is tantalising to the Intelligence agencies who are willing to use a British journalist. Despite the potential dangers, Mangan is persuaded to cooperate.The espionage operation elements of Night Heron aren't particularly new, but the implications of the use of information technology, the ability to gain access to whole digital databases instead of mere paper files, and the nature of system security with the involvement of corporate interests is highly topical and relevant. Brookes actually deals with both aspects well, thrillingly and convincingly detailing the hierarchy, power-play and conflicting interests of the secret service while considering and clearly laying out - as if it wasn't already clear from the revelations of Edward Snowden - the vast implications of who has access to this information and how they intend to use it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2KR7EHGLI4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAT9L5G#wasThisHelpful","R3K2KR7EHGLI4B","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't be fooled by the premise. The second book in Laurence Donaghy's the Folk'd trilogy might on the surface appear to be delve into a Terry Pratchett-style comic fantasy set in the world of the little people as its hero Danny Morrigan disappears down a hole at the end of Book One, but if you're familiar with the legends of Celtic mythology you'll know that they have a darker, more sinister side. Don't be fooled either by the Quentin Tarantino-like use of inventively foul-language and acerbic humour, because there's also a darker undercurrent here where real human concerns are at stake. But then you've probably read Folk'd by this stage, so obviously you already know all this.You'll know this already but if you've forgotten or have had your memories played around with by the little folk, there's a helpful synopsis at the start of the second book that reminds you how Danny Morrison's life has been turned upside down. Not that it was much of a life in the first place, but it was his life, his job, his girlfriend, his baby and God knows he'd suffered for them. Now they're all gone and Danny is, to put it in movie trailer terms, one man on a personal crusade through a mystical land on a mission to recover the life that has been taken from him. Armed with only his quick wit, a deadly arsenal of Belfast put-downs and hard-man bravado, he will take on the massed hordes of underworld demons and ancient tribes of Celtic warriors. They're in for a right good slegging and no mistake.What's marvellous about the sequel to Folk'd is that Laurence Donaghy manages to make the subject ever darker in terms of the horror and what is personally at stake without losing a fraction of the sarcasm, irony and general contempt for the conventions of traditional fantasy. Wee bearded men in funny hats, monstrous creatures from the dark side, ancient gods and goddesses are regarded equally by Danny with casual contempt in his Orphic determination to regain the life he has lost from the Otherworld. Partly that's down to the author's well-defined sense of Belfast characteristics, partly it's down to the gravity of what's at stake, but it's also a sign of real development in Donaghy as a writer. The sentiments and the humour are so well expressed and interwoven that they seem to come authentically from personal experience and observation. Brilliantly and humorously described in the first part, this characterisation only acquires greater depth in the second book.Those gaps in Danny's family history in the first book weren't just glossed over background then (not that you ever thought they were) or indeed merely just plot devices to allow for not so surprising revelations (""Danny, I'm your father!""), but it's the gaps in a troubled family history that Danny has hesitated to deal with and suppressed that not only come back to haunt him now, but they've defined to a large extent who he is and how he behaves now. Which is with a great deal of self-defensiveness and hugely engaging humour that comes from a very real place. Talk about exploring your roots! Danny's stretch back to 247 BC to the time of the Tuatha De Danann and Folk'd Up consequently operates on several levels of reality and covers a lot of ground in between, equally strong and vividly realistic on the ancient mythology side as on the present-day of reality where those left behind at Danny's disappearance have to start to pick up the pieces of their fractured reality. Since it often feels like real-life Belfast does actually exist in a Twilight Zone of its own this is not so much of a stretch maybe, but it's constantly inventive and always capable of surprising. And still very funny - seriously funny even. This is a fine sequel to an impressive debut, it's going to be very interesting to see where the author takes us in the concluding part of the Folk'd trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3B9RC5I56TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6L72M2#wasThisHelpful","R1N3B9RC5I56TB","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can Madama Butterfly survive a production without the cherry blossoms, silk kimonos and bamboo houses with paper screens? If Puccini's masterpiece is strong enough to stand on its own terms without the kitsch elements, there are nonetheless certain expectations for a stage production that perhaps shouldn't be meddled with too much. Vincent Boussard finds a way to retain the essence of this imagery in a relatively minimalist fashion in this Hamburg production without losing anything of the exotic spectacle. There are however one or two interpretative twists here that not everyone will agree work well or even consider necessary.The costumes, by Christian Lacroix, look stylised traditional with obis and big hats, although reflecting Cio-Cio-San's adoption of American ways she wears jeans and a sweatshirt for Act II. In terms of the set design itself however, this Madama Butterfly looks every bit as minimalistically oriental and yet subtly elegant as it ought to do. The set for the entire three acts is based around a spiral staircase at the centre of the stage, with only large panels behind. These however slide back to open up to the seasons and the passage of the day outside, as well as being used for off-stage locations for Madama Butterfly and Suzuki to retire to at significant points. It's very much an 'interior' design then and functional for the purposes of the work, but a subtle play of light and colour suggests other moods and situations.If it's all about establishing the essential mood for each scene, you could say that Boussard's production is a little over-elaborate in its use of colour, but there's no doubt that the set and lighting follows and relates closely to the score. There are rapid switches between one extreme emotion and another in Madama Butterfly, between romantic illusion and harsh reality and Puccini holds an amazing suspended tension between them. Boussard's production, mood and lighting, follows these developments very closely but it leads the director to make a few decisions that don't perhaps hold up well. One can understand how Cio-Cio-San can make a little shrine of artefacts to her delusions, but whether those should be seen as extending to their child is another matter. It's clear from the libretto that the child is real, but Boussard muddies the issue by using a large doll instead of a real child. He also takes the final scene off-stage, which is a brave decision, but there's no denying that it robs the conclusion of some of its intended emotional impact.If the intention is to let the strength of the music and the singing speak for itself, at least the Hamburg production has some fine singers who are capable of giving the work a full and nuanced expression. It's absolutely essential that you believe in these characters that are so well written by Puccini (in spite of some stereotypes).  If sung well they really come to life and they certainly work here. Freed from the usual mannerisms, Alexia Voulgaridou is able to emotionally delve into the work anew and sings wonderfully and with tremendous force. It's a riveting performance. Teodor Ilincal is a lyrical tenor in the classic mould, his B.F. Pinkerton naive and romantic rather than exploitative and insensitive. Christina Damian's Suzuki is also very fine and adds considerably to the overall quality of this production. As too does the excellent account of the work by the Hamburg Philharmonic conducted by Alexander Joel.On Blu-ray, the video transfer is very good. It looks a little softer than most, mainly on account of the colour saturation, but the colour reproduction and the beauty of the set is impressive. There's only one audio track on this release, a PCM stereo track, but it's strong and gives a good account of the singing and the orchestration. Other than trailers, there are no extra features on the BD, but the booklet comes with an interview with Vincent Boussard that discusses his approach to the work. Region-free, subtitles on the release are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIGOVSD66QHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKXQUQW#wasThisHelpful","R2PIGOVSD66QHV","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may be a little unfair on the composer of Der Rosenkavalier, Ariadne auf Naxos and Die Frau ohne Schatten, but for sheer visceral impact, to say nothing of their influence on subsequent 20th century opera, none of them can match Strauss's two early one-act tone-poem operas Salome and Elektra. Salome in particular, as the composer's first foray into this new and unexplored territory, still has that impact of shock and awe in the sheer force of its musical expression. Undoubtedly, the method developed by Richard Strauss was a direct response to Oscar Wilde's deliciously decadent play that was the source for Hedwig Lachmann's libretto for the opera. Strauss aligns the music to the text with unerring precision for its mood, drama and psychological content. The lush orchestration for the rapturous declarations of Salome's appeals to Jochanaan clash extraordinarily with the harsh dissonance of the vicious barbs she throws at him when those advances are rejected.Gabriele Lavia updates the period of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna production to Strauss' time, with soldiers wearing period military uniforms with helmets and lances, and Salome looking like she stepped out of the ballroom from a production of Arabella. The work doesn't appear to gain anything though this updating, but it looks good and matches the dark mood of the piece well. The stage for the most part remains stark and bare, the floor of Herod's palace a jagged stepping of shattered red marble, but the key scenes are all handled effectively, Jochanaan is hauled up out of a crack in the floor enchained and in a cage, a large magnifying glass amplifying the emotional and erotic tension of Salome's dance. The traditional head on the platter scene is handled differently here, but the conclusion is still suitably and floridly gruesome.Musically, it's initially hard to distinguish the detail in the somewhat echoing sound mixes, but Nichola Luisotti seems bring out that important balance between the lush orchestration and the cutting edge of the rising dissonance. It's played and sung with wonderfully compelling fluidity, gripping you and holding you right through to the conclusion that should always leave you semi-stunned and breathless. That's certainly achieved here. Evidently, much also relies on the cast and Erika Sunnegårdh has strong presence as Salome, handling the singing challenges of the role and fitting well within the nature of the production. Mark S. Doss is a suitably grave, deeply-intoned Jochanaan, but with superb clarity and force of expression. The fact that we also have a strong Herod in Robert Brubaker and an impressive Heriodias as well with Dalia Schaechter is a bonus.The Blu-ray from Arthaus looks terrific on a BD25, region-free disc. The DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 surround track tends to give more space to the ambience with the result that it sounds a bit indistinct and echoing in places. The LPCM 2.0 track is 'bright' but more focussed and sounds better through headphones. There are no extra features other than trailers for other releases. Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1861TVVI98Q0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKXQTTK#wasThisHelpful","R1861TVVI98Q0Q","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When issues related to the working class communities of Glasgow are tackled - in my experience more often in cinema than literature (in Red Road, in the films of Ken Loach and Peter Mullan) - it's to depict sordid situations of drugs, alcohol, poverty, abuse, deprivation and street violence (Mullan's brilliant 'Neds' being the hardest-hitting of all).  Rachel Seiffert's The Walk Home deals with similar ground-level issues, but from a perspective of a community that rarely has a voice in UK literature - the working class loyalist Protestant and Orange communities living in the schemes of greater Glasgow in places like Drumchapel.Rachel Seiffert made her mark with The Dark Room (filmed as Lore) and The Way Home similarly deals with social upheaval, family troubles and absent parents, but the subject seems closer to home this time and the situation rather more complex.  The focus is divided between Graham and Stevie (the connection between them soon becomes clear), Graham meeting Lindsay, a young 17 year old girl, while playing with his Drumchapel Orange Lodge band in Co. Tyrone in Northern Ireland.  When the girl turns up pregnant in Glasgow, the young couple try to make a go of starting a family and keeping it together, but old traditions, the past and family troubles prove hard to put behind them.Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Seiffert doesn't wallow in the misery and there's precious little conventional violence in The Way Home.  The violence is of different kind, the kind inflicted on families and individuals who strive to better their lives and escape from the trappings of the past and their community.  A lot is left unsaid, but suggestions and implications are left open, in particular with relation to Lindsey's family in Northern Ireland.  The story doesn't go there, but you can tell from the young girl's responses to her background and her speed at leaving home, that there's a lot there you don't want to get into.The Walk Home is, I found, an incredibly sad book.  The ending is pretty much a killer, but there's a deep existential sadness related to these family issues that suffuses the whole book.  It's not a pleasant or a light read, it doesn't find any easy answers or resolutions for its characters, and the outlook is quite bleak, but it's an involving and authentic look at the lives of a community whose voice and whose problems are often misunderstood, if they are considered at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2K7OEXND6ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAT9J44#wasThisHelpful","R3B2K7OEXND6ZR","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While masterpieces like La BohÃ¨me, Tosca and Madama Butterfly need no special pleading, Puccini's contribution to the opera as pure entertainment is one that is often undervalued, and his compositional gifts consequently are often underestimated.  Turandot, for example, with its fairytale plot, has all the elements for a grand entertainment but doesn't seem to offer much of human interest. If it's not dealt with effectively, it can be just a mess of Orientalist clichÃ©s, with situations calculated specifically to run through the numbers, all built around the showcase aria of 'Nessun dorma'. A cold and cruel Princess, with a series of riddles for suitors who will be executed should they fail, whose heart is melted by a valiant Prince, this is Life, Death and Love writ large with very little in the way of genuine human sentiments. Or so it seems. LiÃ¹ is of course the saving grace on that front, her sense of honour, duty and love igniting feelings of compassion in the Princess Turandot, and it similarly opens a way to the heart of the audience.And this, while it seems sentimental and calculated to put it in those terms, is primarily the strength of Puccini. He always finds a way to touch the heart of the listener, and more than just being entertainment, that's the critical element that needs to be in place. If it doesn't obviously provide the necessary heart, Andrei Serban's production for the Royal Opera house (dating back to 1984) at least exploits the entertainment value of Turandot, with all its Oriental exoticism and regal glamour. The set is grand but unfussy, requiring no major set changes just the addition of props - pagodas, masks and banners - between scenes. The background is however surprisingly dark, and doesn't show off the full impact of the set. The costumes are typically bold Serban primary colours, and full use is made of the stage with good blocking of the characters with masked dancers to add life and movement.There's nothing here in this production or in the performances however to make you sit up and be willing to explore the qualities that are there in the work and find the warm heart behind it. It all feels a little perfunctory, and it's not just the fairy tale element or the use of masks that make it somewhat inscrutable. Henrik NÃ¡nÃ¡si's musical direction doesn't really manage to bring the score to life either, but it and the staging mainly provide the context for this production and they do that fairly well in the necessary places. 'Nessun dorma', for example, isn't overplayed as a showpiece but kept in its dramatic context. LiÃ¹'s death is most affecting here, as it must be, and Turdanot's discovery of the name that that has eluded her - not Calaf as much as Love - brings the work to an unquestionably powerful conclusion. The lack of imagination elsewhere however means that it's the singers who have to make up for the dramatic failings.The singing performances themselves are good, but a little more dramatic direction however might have made a real difference. Marco Berti has all the right Italian tenor characteristics that you expect to hear in this role, even if it is clearly a stretch for him in places. More of a failing is his acting ability, and you don't really get a sense of the importance of his task of Calaf being emotionally engaged with the enormity of the riddle challenge and potentially facing death the next morning - it all seems more like an act of bravado than true love. Lise Lindstrom is very capable in an unquestionably tough role, but is a little on the strident side. There's plenty of ice but no fire of passion. A little more vulnerability would bring a little humanity to her Princess Turandot. Eri Nakamura is a fine LiÃ¹, apparently light of voice but there's a robustness here and her top notes ring out beautifully. Raymond Aceto's Timur is solid, with clear enunciation in his deep bass.The quality of the Blu-ray is, as expected from Opus Arte, of a typically high standard with a clear image and strong audio tracks go. The release also includes a 8-minute introduction and a 4-minute Behind the Masks feature on Ping, Pong and Pang. The performance can be played with these features included, or as separate Acts. There's a synopsis in the booklet, which also has a good essay by Linda Fairtile on the creation of Puccini's final opera which remained unfinished at his death. Like most, this version uses the final scene completed by Franco Alfano. The BD is Region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Korean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7TV212OZW2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPDJN0W#wasThisHelpful","R3O7TV212OZW2M","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first part of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy manages to present a vaguely unsettling new spin on what amounts to a familiar SF situation where a group of explorers face unknown dangers in a hostile alien environment.  Just to raise the tensions, the volunteers are aware that they are not the first explorers of Area X either.  This, we are told, is the twelfth expedition (but you'll soon find that you can take nothing as written in Annihilation), the previous expeditions having ended in rather strange and inconclusive terms, with scientists and investigators wandering off, disappearing or committing suicide.  What's strange about the alien environment of Area X however is that it appears to be an area of natural wilderness on Earth.In fact, Annihilation initially bears more than a passing resemblance to Andrei Tarkovsky's remarkable and influential film Stalker, but only as a jumping off point.  In contrast to Tarkovsky's poetical allegory there seems to be a more conscious attempt to tie events to a meaningful new view of reality, or perhaps to a psychological reality.  That, however, is hard to determine from the first part of the trilogy alone.  Like ""the Zone"" in Stalker, the four explorers who pass over the vague boundary into Area X don't have names, just professions, the team consisting of a biologist (the narrator), an anthropologist, a surveyor and a psychologist.  We are led to believe very early on that the narrator will be the only surviving member of the team.  Things evidently are going to go very wrong.The dangers of Area X aren't immediately apparent.  It has been mapped before, and resembles a regular piece of Earth coastline, one that is dominated by a lighthouse.  The twelfth expedition however quickly discover an unusual structure not previously mapped, a wide tunnel that goes deep underground, which the biologist nonetheless feels compelled to describe as a ""Tower"".  What lies within is best left for the reader to discover, but suffice to say that it would in any case be difficult to describe and that it does indeed pose a deadly threat to the explorers.  Even what that threat constitutes however is difficult to pin down, since the biologist's testimony - like everything else in Area X - is somewhat compromised by the fact that nothing that happens in this strange environment can be taken at face value.The difficulty of pinning down what Annihilation is about might present a problem for some readers.  There's clearly an allegorical side to the work and distinct parallels can be drawn to the few pieces of information (facts are hard to determine) we have about the biologist's life and personality, her interest in the study of life in tide pools in particular matching up with some aspects of what is discovered in Area X.  What is clear however is that Annihilation works equally well as a tense SF adventure in its own right - slight in page-count but full of incident and ideas - while also being a fascinating opening to the first part of what looks like being a compelling trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO531GUW6EX9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374104093#wasThisHelpful","RO531GUW6EX9V","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there are undoubtedly critical elements that it's important to get right in the earlier parts of the tetraology, it's GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung that is ultimately the real test of any Ring cycle. After the years of hard work preparation that go into putting on a work of this scale, it has to come together meaningfullly at the end. It really wouldn't do if the epic end of the world finale of GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung proved to be anticlimatic. The La Scala production is certainly unconventional in how it presents that all-important conclusion, but I don't think anyone could say that it is anything but bold and deeply impressive.There is at least one important aspect to the La Scala Ring that has remained consistent and left no cause for concern about how the final segment would play out, and that's Daniel Barenboim's contribution. The sheer scale and ambition of Wagner's masterwork means that GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung has to bring together all the earlier themes and leitmotifs the earlier works and bear the conceptual weight of the Ring as a whole. It's an enormous musical challenge, but Barenboim has been remarkably consistent and adaptable to Guy Cassiers' concept and he conducts the orchestra of La Scala through the varied tones of this particular work with a beautiful fluidity and a rising sense of urgency. It feels of a whole in a way that GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung rarely does, consolidating those elements elaborated in the earlier parts into something much grander than their constituent parts.There has also been a strong consistency to the look and feel of Guy Cassiers' production design, even if any deeper meaning or significance has been hard to determine. The source of certain imagery that has cropped up regularly throughout the cycle however is revealed here - in all its glory at the finale - to have been inspired by Jef Lambeaux's relief sculpture 'Les passions humaines'. This certainly gives substance to imagery and the ideas the director has been working with and leads to an immensely powerful conclusion, finding a strong visual concept that supports and illustrates Wagner's music and ideas, even if it doesn't add anything new to our understanding of the meaning of Der Ring des Nibelungen.  In itself it's also a stunning state-of-the-art visual spectacle that has the look and conceptual qualities of an art installation. In that environment, there's inevitably an awful lot of standing and declaiming out to the theatre and very little interaction or dramatic interplay between the characters, but with Barenboim conducting this is every bit as ""momumental"" as GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung ought to be.Sadly here we lose Nina Stemme, who made such an impression as BrÃ¼nnhilde in Die Walkure and Siegfried, but IrÃ¨ne Theorin proves to be a more than worthy replacement. She's perhaps not as strong across at the lower end of the range, but her top notes hit home in a performance that is full of fire. Just about passable in Siegfried, Lance Ryan's weaknesses are however cruelly exposed in the more open and testing environment of GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung. His delivery is sometimes good, particularly in shorter phrasing, but any long notes waver around wildly. I'm not sure that there are many heldentenors around nowadays though who are capable of holding down this role, and at least he appears fully engaged in the role. Mikhail Petrenko sings Hagen well, although his delivery is a little too Russian in declamation. The other roles are more than competently played by a strong cast that includes Gerd Grochowski, Johannes Martin KrÃ¤nzle (as a disturbingly distorted version of his already sinister Alberich), Waltraud Meier and Anna Samuil.A four hour forty-five minute performance is a lot to get onto a single disk, even a BD50 Blu-ray, but the image and sound quality hold up alongside the fine presentation of the other releases in this cycle. Like those, the BD is region-free, with subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean. These can only be selected from the player remote or from the 'Pop-up' menu during playback. There's no synopsis in the booklet, just a fanciful essay that unconvincingly attempts to link GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and with the Belgian Congo. It does however provide that useful information about Jef Lambeaux's 'Les passions humaines' sculpture, which might otherwise not be recognised. Its significance however can fully be felt in this powerful conclusion to an intriguing Ring cycle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAAN8AEJ9IZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I32ALZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3UAAN8AEJ9IZ8","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would imagine that it's difficult for any writer to find any new spin on vampire lore, but Marcus Sedgwick has a fair go at it in Love Like Blood.  He not only finds two new ways of looking at the subject that consider arcane aspects of the love of blood and the drinking of it from a scientific and a religious perspective, but he ties them together well and with some conviction.  More importantly however, Sedgwick creates a thoroughly delicious horror-thriller that is never short on new twists and escalating developments.The scientific context of the study of blood, its properties and various mysterious practices associated with it, comes from the character at the centre of the book.  Charles Jackson is a doctor, a consultant in matters related to blood diseases, but specifically on the subject of haemophilia.  And interest in blood, the love of blood and love as blood all come together in 1951 when Charles encounters a beautiful American student in Paris who is writing a thesis on the use of blood in Dante's Inferno.  Charles however has seen her in the company of a strange foreign gentleman who be believes is the same person he saw drinking blood from a woman soon after the the liberation of Paris in 1944.The religious aspect is a bit more of a stretch, since it relates to Christian Eucharistic practice of drinking the ""blood of Christ"", but Sedwick has plenty of other references to strange Christian practices involving the saints and bloodletting that make the otherwise unusual combination of vampires with crosses an intriguing one.  The thriller elements of the novel are fairly standard when Charles stumbles on their activities and has to go on the run from these dangerous figures - and it involves a fairly convenient and timely large inheritance - but combined with the unique spin on the vampire mythology, Love Like Blood is indeed never less than thrilling all the way to its deliciously twisted, if somewhat hurried conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209T9TBFA3CH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144475193X#wasThisHelpful","R209T9TBFA3CH5","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the impression the title might give, The Enchanted is potentially a very despairing novel based on a very dispiriting subject - the lives and the fate of criminals on death row in a US penitentiary.  There is a glimmer of hope there however, and usually when you go to the darkest places that the smallest light shines brighter.  Rene Denfeld paints the subject so black that it almost obscures everything else, so it's a testament to her writing (and her experience) that she nonetheless finds that small measure of hope that makes all the difference.Rene Denfeld is in real-life a death penalty investigator and has written several non-fiction books based on the subject, so there's no doubting her credentials.  There's no doubt either that her account of prison life is accurate and without exaggeration, which is however not much comfort.  Death, despair, rape, murder, corruption, drugs, the dregs of humanity are kept in abominable conditions, fed on a diet of near-poisonous slops and have no recourse to any kind of humane treatment or a sympathetic ear, much less any kind of justice.  Worse are those ghouls that prey on incarceration and human misery for profit.  When a prisoner dies or is put to death ... well, that's one of the grimmest descriptions you'll find in The Enchanted, and that's saying something...There's also a death penalty investigator at the centre of The Enchanted.  The 'lady' (that's the only way she is known) is looking into the background of York, a murderer on death row whose unspeakable crimes are just too horrific to relate, who admits his guilt and actually wants to be executed.  He doesn't want an appeal put in on his behalf, the lady investigator has a duty to uphold, just like the priest who visits and is helpless to reach these men.  Why do they do it?  Why would you even want to get deeper into their appalling lives?  Well, both the lady and the priest have their own troubled backgrounds, but at the heart of it is an important recognition and a basic human need that has been all but forgotten and denied to these prisoners.  They care because no one else will care.Writing from her own experience as a death penalty investigator is insightful enough, but The Enchanted is a work of fiction and Rene Denfeld attempts to show a number of perspectives, including that of one of the most disturbed prisoners on death row, Arden, who has a very unusual perspective on the prison and the world outside.  Amazed by the lady's courage, Arden recognises the hope she inspires and even wishes her happiness.  ""Is that what you call love?  Is that what you call hope?"" he wonders.  And if the meaning of what people like the lady and the priest do can reach even Arden, there's hope that the same sentiments will come out of this dark story and also touch the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUVQCF0DLC3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062285505#wasThisHelpful","R1BUVQCF0DLC3P","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice' would have been a work that chimed with Benjamin Britten's sensibility on a number of levels.  It deals with several recurring subjects - children, innocence, death and corruption - that can be found in the composer's most famous works. If Britten's final opera has however never achieved the same recognition or popularity as his masterful treatment of those themes in Peter Grimes and The Turn of the Screw, it's probably less to do with the strength of the musical composition itself - which is among Britten's most adventurous and powerful - as much as the difficulty of presenting the awkward subject matter and the dark undercurrents found in Mann's short novella in an accessible way to a modern audience.Thomas Mann's extraordinarily rich work is however fully comprehended by Britten and brought across into musical terms with remarkable facility and precision. The libretto, by Myfanwy Piper, captures the detail and essence of the work while Britten's extraordinary music allows us to sympathise with an elderly writer's queasy fascination for a beautiful young boy observed on the Lido beach in Venice, revealing and expressing deeper undercurrents, unspoken suggestions and perhaps undignified sentiments and human weaknesses. Most obviously there are Eastern references in the music and the instrumentation that speak of the Sirocco conflating it with Aschenbach's old age, sickness and corruption, but the musical language and small-scale, chamber-like structure finds other unconventional means of expression, including a counter-tenor to sing Apollo and using a dancer instead of a singer for Tadzio.Small-scale and intimate it may be, but the sweep of the ideas expounded requires a much bigger canvas, and that presents certain challenges for the theatrical presentation of the work.  Deborah Warner's critically acclaimed production for the English National Opera with Tom Pye's inventive set designs achieve that quite brilliantly. There's an openness and simplicity here that works with the text of the libretto without over-illustrating it, creating the mood and atmosphere of Venice through the use of colour, light and silhouettes suggesting water and skies. It looks ravishingly beautiful as well as creating a vivid openness for the opera to work within. The space also allows room for the ballet dancers to express all that youthful freedom and ambiguity that is contained within the figure of Tadzio, or projected upon him by Aschenbach.  A lot evidently rests on this first-person perspective of Aschenbach and it could hardly be better expressed than in John Graham-Hall's performance here.  It's a role that requires commitment and sensitivity to the variations of tone in Aschenbach's descent from order to chaos, and Graham-Hall's demeanour from sophisticated traveller to crumpled madman is perfectly judged and delicately phrased throughout.English National Opera have really only recently embraced the idea of filming, broadcasting and releasing productions for the cinema and DVD, and if this production is anything to go by, we've lot to look forward to in future projects.  On Blu-ray this looks and sounds outstanding.  The image quality is crisp and captures this magnificent, colourful production beautifully.  It might even be a little to clinically perfect for some.  The audio tracks are impressive, both LPCM 2.0 and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 crystal clear, revealing all the detail of Britten's unconventional instrumentation.  You can hear every single instrument and note in the superbly balanced mix and the quality and clarity of the singing.

"Siegfried, the second day opera in La Scala's new Ring Cycle doesn't reveal any new angle on what has come before or expand on any identifiable concept, but even with variations in casting it remains consistent in look and feel and has the appropriate sense of the epic scale that is required for this part of Wagner's masterwork. It benefits however from another robust performance from the orchestra under the direction of Daniel Barenboim, from some good singing performances and even one or two exceptional ones. When it comes to a work as challenging as Siegfried, you can't really ask for much more than that.Guy Cassiers' direction and stage design is however also a crucial supporting element that brings a sense of wholeness and consistency to this Ring cycle. The production design remains fairly abstract, with little sense that there's any deeper meaning behind the concept, but it has a fine dark and otherworldly mythological quality that suits the presentation. It may not be naturalistic, relying more on lighting effects, projections, and dancers, but it creates an impressive spectacle.  At the same time however, it's a fairly basic and static staging that gives Siegfried and BrÃ¼nnhilde very little to work with. This is a failing throughout Cassiers' Ring cycle, with very little attention paid to the acting and stage direction and only Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's dancers providing any sense of flow and movement.Lance Ryan's Siegfried is far from perfect, but he at least remains undaunted by the challenge and comes through the experience here relatively well.  He's often imprecise and strained in pitch, but he has stamina and enough character to fill the role in the absence of any real acting direction. On occasion, such as his fine soliloquy outside Fafner's cave, he's often good or at least good enough, which in itself is no small matter. Peter Bronder is a superb Mime; singing well and full of character he pretty much carries Act I. The third Wotan/Wanderer in this Ring Cycle, Terje Stensvold is also good, but it's a static performance that shows little personality or emotional engagement. Johannes Martin KrÃ¤nzle reprises his excellent Alberich from Das Rheingold, injecting the Dwarf with the necessary darker edge here.What really raises this Siegfried however and is worth waiting for is Nina Stemme's BrÃ¼nnhilde. In Cassiers' vacant but spectacular production, Lance Ryan alone could never carry the weight of the third Act, but with Barenboim directing the musical force and Nina Stemme's beautiful rich tone giving it real emotional meaning, it gets there in some style.  The specifications of the Arthaus Blu-ray remain very fine for this series of Ring operas. Despite the darkness of the stage and the complex nature of the lighting and projections, the image is clear and stable. The audio tracks too present the singing and orchestral performance well in the PCM stereo and the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 surround. Other than trailers for other works, there are no extra features on the disc. Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.

"Stradella is an unfinished work by CÃ©sar Franck - better known for his symphonic writing and pieces for the piano and organ - written in 1837 when the composer was just 15 years old and only rediscovered in 1984. The orchestration of the unfinished piece was completed by composer Luc Van Hove, who fills out the sweep of Franck's lush Romanticism to make something more of this otherwise relatively slight work in its first ever staging. Not a major Franck work by any means, but under the musical direction of Paolo Arrivabeni and with an impressive gathering of Belgian opera talent, Stradella is a fascinating addition to the Belgian-French repertoire.The plot of Stradella is relatively simple and unburdened with anything like psychological motivation or even depth of character. The Duke of Pesaro has ordered his lieutenant Spadoni to abduct the beautiful maiden Leonor in the middle of the Carnival in Venice. Having locked her away in his mansion, the Duke tries to win her love by employing the famous singer Stradella to woo her, unaware that Stradella and Leonor are actually an item. As well as being one mighty coincidence, one would think the Duke might have taken some time to investigate Leonor's love-life, but as I say, such details seem to be of little concern to the young Franck, who instead focuses his attention on exploring the romantic tragedy aspects that this situation gives rise to.Franck's symphonic scoring would certainly be influenced by Wagner later in life, but here the composer favours the more melodic approach of Gounod - the 'Ã€ demain' duet between Stradella and Leonor early in the first act before the abduction reminiscent of Faust - but it bears a closer relation with the composer's near-contemporary Massenet in this regard. It's a slight work, but the LiÃ¨ge production makes it something more of an event with a spectacular water-based production. Everyone here is kitted out in wetsuits or wearing macs and carrying umbrellas, the singers wading waist deep in water for most of the performance. There may not be much justification for the amount of water that fills the stage (45,000 litres apparently), but it certainly allows for some imaginative visuals, particularly in the brilliantly staged finale with a floating fish which proves to be something of an impressive technical achievement.The deluge of water and the design of the sets however have something of an absorbing effect or dampening of the sound (in more ways than one!). With huge downpours occurring it can also be more than a little noisy in one or two scenes. Even though they remain semi-submerged for the entire length of the work, the Belgian cast perform as well as can be expected. Soprano Isabelle Kabatu has the necessary range and depth for the role of Leonor, but struggles nonetheless on one or two occasions to rise above the stage noise and the orchestration. There are no such problems for the Belgian lyric tenor Marc Laho however, who lets none of the bizarre stage directions get in the way of a well-delivered performance, his singing clear and resonant with lovely tone, expression and diction. Bass-baritone Werner van Mechelen is a worthy counterpart to Laho's Stradella as the Duke's lieutenant Spadoni.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXUKX7LSKLP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQJS3M#wasThisHelpful","R1PXUKX7LSKLP9","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was certain I wasn't going to like this and not just because I have a prejudice against novels that have an appendix of recipes at the end.  It's more however that the premise seems very old-fashioned - a '84 Charing Cross Road'-like written correspondence between a lonely rich lady living in the English countryside and an American author that develops into something special.  But then the characters are of that generation, both of them approaching 50, both reaching a point in their lives where it's time to look at where they are and re-evaluate if it's where they hoped to be.  That's not really much of a recommendation either.  What makes you keep reading That Part Was True however it that it is realistic, deals with real-life issues, and the author's handling of the subject keenly recognises this and never lets it slip into idealism or sentimentality.That's what keeps you reading even if you don't find you particularly relate to the characters or their circumstances.  At 48, Eve is of a nervous disposition, divorced, has been bullied all her life by her mother and has never really found her own place in life, but, being from a well-off family she's never had to worry about work, helping out part-time in a charity shop.  It's there that she picks up a crime-fiction book by author Jackson Cooper, and particularly liking one description of the joy of ripe fruit, she writes to the author and finds that they have a mutual love of food.  Even though he's a successful author Jack has also reached a turning point in his life, both personally and professionally, as he approaches his 50th birthday.So how can you make this sound appealing?  I'm not sure I can, but Deborah McKinlay certainly manages it.  If I were to describe the plot, it would be all about wealthy middle-class middle-age concerns - preparations for Eve's daughter Izzy's wedding featuring prominently with tantrums thrown and panic-attacks ensuing as it raises unwelcome memories - and an ex-husband - for Eve.  Jack meanwhile broods over the women in his life and whether he wants popular success as a writer or personal satisfaction, and increasingly he's only finding that in cooking.  Intersperse that with some polite but mildly flirtatious correspondence in the exchanging of recipes and the story doesn't seem to amount to much.The situation might sound predictable and dull, but the characters are well-drawn, familiar, recognisable types that are treated with some measure of love and attention by the author.  That alone is enough to make That Part Was True a pleasant read, but there's actually a lot of subtlety in the characterisation as well.  Surprisingly, that shows in the recipes as well and the manner in which they are exchanged, both managing to show their true character more here than in the sometimes awkward personal exchanges.  What sealed the success of the book for me however was the conclusion.  With this kind of plot, it has to be handled realistically without sentimentality, but still satisfy the reader.  Having brought the reader along the journey, Deborah McKinlay doesn't let you down and handles the ending with the same delicacy, wit and gentle charm that is found elsewhere in the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20GQNCJYBGA6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455573655#wasThisHelpful","R20GQNCJYBGA6F","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is very hard to take Le Comte Ory seriously, but as it's a comedy, there's no reason why you should. In the case of this 2009 Rossini Opera Festival production however, the director LluÃ­s Pasqual unfortunately feels the need to impose a structure on the work and a distancing device of a play-within-a-play that is neither meaningful nor sympathetic to the comedy. Fortunately, despite the casting here not being as stellar as you might expect for quite demanding roles, the Pesaro production at least works very well musically and in terms of the singing.Evidently then, the 2009 Rossini Opera Festival production isn't set during the time of the Crusades but rather, for no apparent reason, takes place in the Grand Hotel Rossini during the Belle Epoque on a set that looks more like La Traviata, with much of the action taking place on a billiard table and there not being any real effort put into making all the disguising and dressing up even half-way convincing.  According to the booklet that comes with the DVD/BD release, the explanation for this is that the story of Le Comte Ory is being put on as a parlour game by a theatre group in order to explore their own erotic fantasies. You wouldn't know this otherwise, but even when you do know it, it still seems like a pointless conceit, particularly as the director seems to have forgotten that the work is actually supposed to be a comedy.What the Belle Epoque setting does however, perhaps inadvertently, is actually emphasise the elegance and sophistication of Rossini's brilliant compositional skills. The score is sympathetically conducted in this respect by Paolo Carignani. Unsurprisingly, since it is mostly derived from Il Viaggio a Reims (a delightful work that was until relatively recently believed entirely lost), it moves at a spirited pace with a musical style that is indeed sparkling with elegance, cleverness and wit. Although they aren't given much support from the director and are no match for the incredible singing in the Met production, the singing is also very good. Chinese tenor Yijie Shi has the right kind of voice for high and lyrical Rossini roles like this. If you close your eyes, at times you could swear you're listening to Juan Diego FlÃ³rez, albeit not with the same force. Laura Polverelli is a fine Isolier and MarÃ­a JosÃ© Moreno brings the necessary elegance and charm to her Comtesse AdÃ¨le.The BD includes a 26-minute Making of made up of interviews and behind-the-scenes rehearsals.  As usual the irrepressible Alberto Zedda, the artistic director of the Rossini Opera Festival, provides some insightful comments on the work and its place among Rossini's operas.

"It's hard to judge and define what makes a work of modern opera great when you don't have history and the legacy of the composer to look back on. In the age of DVD and Blu-ray you can judge for yourself now whether a work has merit by how much it draws you back to view it again. On that basis, standing up to repeated viewings that reveal new elements, George Benjamin's Written on Skin is undoubtedly one of the best new opera works of recent years, a work that creates a compelling musical and narrative language of its own that creates a world that resembles little else out there.The question of events retaining or gaining significance with time is, not by chance, a large part of what Written on Skin is all about. Based on a 13th century work by the troubadour Guillem de Cabestaing (Le Coeur mangÃ©), Written on Skin intentionally and very specifically filters a very old story through new eyes and with a modern sensibility. The medieval story involves a wealthy landowner, the Protector, who wishes to have his achievements and his pre-eminent place in the world to be immortalised by hiring an artisan to create an illuminated manuscript. His wife however wishes also to have her place in this world redefined and encourages the Boy to make the woman real. Starting to think for herself and act of her own accord undermines the Protector's position, so that when he discovers that his wife has cheated on him, he kills the Boy and serves his heart up to her to eat.Crimp and Benjamin however use a framing device of 21st century angels in an adjoining ""workshop"" recreating and taking part in the drama. It's a very post-modern device in how it alerts us to the fact that the drama is an artificial construct. The intention however is not to distance the viewer from the original story, but to actually show that despite the passing of time, despite the artifice of staged drama, that great art - and specifically opera - can be transforming, but also violent and even dangerous. The opera itself is an Illuminated Book that immortalises events and puts them into a format that can allow us to viscerally experience the past. If at times Written on Skin does then feel like a calculated intellectual exercise, it's not a cold one, but one rather that is bursting with ideas, passions and meaning.Much of that is down to the concision of the dramatic setting and the precision of the words used in Martin Crimp's text, but it's brought to life by the equally precise and considered musical score by George Benjamin. It does exactly what the music ought to do, flowing behind the words and ""illuminating the page"", accompanying the emotions, pushing them, but also filling in-between the layers. The writing also gives due regard for the words and the voices to sing them. It's not about singing beautiful phrases, but finding a voice that dramatically expresses the text and character. You can't ask for better singers in that regard or more fully committed and indeed technically accomplished performances than those given here at Covent Garden (as at the original world premiere in Aix-en-Provence), by Christopher Purves as the Protector, Barbara Hannigan as AgnÃ¨s and countertenor Bejun Mehta as the Boy.Katie Mitchell's direction makes note of the artifice in Vicki Mortimer's boxed design with angel workshops surrounding the scenes where the drama is played out, but fully recognises the human passions that are played out within it. As with the world premiere in Aix, the composer George Benjamin conducts his own score. That score is given a beautiful sound stage in the audio tracks on the Blu-ray release. The image quality is clear and, with a wider than usual 2.35:1 image (with thin black bars at the top and bottom of the screen), it looks quite cinematic. Overhead cameras with wide angles are occasionally used to present a different perspective on the drama. The extra features on the BD are brief but informative, with a 5-minute Introduction, a 2-minute interview with Benjamin and a Cast Gallery.

"At the heart of Rimsky-Korsakov's The Legend of Invisible City of Kitezh is an epic battle between the forces of good and evil that recounts the legend of the invasion of the city by Mongol hordes. The librettist for the work however, Vladimir Belsky, also brought Christian elements into the story from the legend of Saint Fevronya and from folklore that lift the work towards flights of spiritual mysticism and rapture. There's something of a gulf then between the realistic literal depiction of the horrors of war and the pantheistic depiction of nature that doesn't entirely come together in Rimsky-Korsakov's score, but in many ways it just makes it all the more fascinating. I'm not sure that either the conductor Marc Albrecht or director Dmitri Tcherniakov manage to reconcile the inconsistencies in the opera, but it remains a glorious, intriguing work.The first thing to note about Tcherniakov's direction is that he changes the plot slightly in order, presumably, to highlight the contrasts in the work and perhaps find a way to bring them together. Consequently he invents an 'end of the world' scenario, where Fevroniya is not some holy fool who communes with nature in the woods, but has fled there because, in Tcherniakov's prelude description, ""after what has happened on earth, life can never go on as before"". The beautiful set for Act I and II consequently depicts a Tarkovsky-like post-apocalyptic spiritual view of nature seen in The Sacrifice, while the long central third act highlights the ugliness of drunken revelry, the horror of the invasion of the Tartars and the lamentations of the citizens at the destruction that has been visited upon them. Tcherniakov isn't able to bring the two views convincingly together in the third act, which should be the dramatic turning point but - as beautiful and uplifting as the music is - it's debatable whether Rimsky-Korsakov, the composer opposed to the religious Wagnerian liturgical touches of Belsky's libretto, manages to reconcile them either. Despite this, and despite the staging attempting to undercut the mysticism further, the third Act is still wondrously operatic.If it all does indeed manage to come together and even raise itself onto another plane by the final fourth act, much of it is to do with the singing and Rimsky-Korsakov's writing for the voice. There are no real arias in The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, or overt folk dances and set pieces that you might find in other fairytale works by the composer like Sadko or The Golden Cockerel. It's more through composed, with a Romantic sweep and even some Wagnerian quotes in spite of Rimsky-Korsakov's opposition. It's the naturalistic roll of the Russian consonants however, flowing out unstrained in long solid arioso singing and in glorious, glorifying choral arrangements that anchor the sentiments in the real world even as they achieve a level of rapturous transcendence. The Amsterdam production is marvellous then in that it has the deservedly much-praised chorus of the De Nederlandse on fine form, but it also has a fine mostly Russian cast that give solid, unfailing performances throughout. They are led by the young soprano Svetlana Ignatovich, who fulfils every vocal and visual requirement for the saintly role of Fevroniya, her transformation into martyrdom and sainthood at the end of the work achieved with an ecstatic acceptance of her fate.Tcherniakov again downplays any elaborately literal vision of paradise much in the same way that Rimsky-Korsakov refuses to let the music push it too far (the direction of the orchestra under Marc Albrecht similarly restrained yet ecstatic, resisting the usual Russian bombast), but everything that needs to be expressed has been done so in the writing for the voices and in the performances here. There are hints at conflicts between the music and the staging in the short 20-minute featurette that provides an informative look behind the scenes at De Nederlandse. The High Definition transfer is superb in terms of picture and sound. The BD is region-free and subtitles for this release are in English, French, German, Dutch, Japanese and Korean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NQ7WIOBA3OX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJ6KCQQ#wasThisHelpful","R18NQ7WIOBA3OX","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though it's come late in the year of the centenary of the birth of Benjamin Britten, has done much to consolidate and even raise his reputation as Britain's greatest composer and highlight some unjustly neglected works. It must be hoped that this belated release of David McVicar's 2001 production of the Rape of Lucretia for the English National Opera, recorded by the BBC at the Aldeburgh Festival, will bring this work - more deserving perhaps than Gloriana - to the attention of a wider audience.Following Peter Grimes, The Rape of Lucretia marks something of a rethinking of approach to opera that would have a significant impact on the style of much of the composer's later dramatic works. The subject of The Rape of Lucretia then is a sparse but powerful one which, when combined with Britten's musical scoring of it, is almost harrowing in its intensity. It's not difficult to see here themes that preoccupy Britten throughout his musical career and even in his personal life relating to the corruption of innocence. Lucretia, for Britten however is about much more than just the defilement of a woman's saintly virtue, but touches on the nature of society and the values that it assigns to men and women. In particular the work questions the nature of violence, in war and as a characteristic of men, and challenges whether pacifism isn't truer to the better nature of mankind.It's Britten's musical arrangements however that are most innovative, distinctive, modern and relevant. The reduced orchestration highlights the expression of individual instruments and heightens the dramatic tone and tension of the subject. Rarely does the music rely on any conventional signposting that tells you how to react to the drama, but instead it fulfils the primary function of music in opera by exploring below the surface and revealing other depths. It's beautiful and haunting, underpinning the drama in Britten's own developing idiomatic language, but also his own personal convictions that were so out of place with the accepted conventions of prevailing social attitudes of the time. The use of male and female soloists as a 'chorus' is an important device that allows this wider perspective and provides a contemporary relevance, and not insignificantly, it's a device that is used in a very similar way more recently by Martin Crimp and George Benjamin in 'Written on Skin'.If it's difficult to point to any specific directorial choice that evidently has an impact on the performance, what is clear nonetheless is that David McVicar gets the mood exactly right. His direction of the singers and the acting however is what ultimately makes this a truly great production, and the cast here is great. Sarah Connolly isn't yet in her prime here. She is still terrifically good, it's just that she's even better now. Christopher Maltman too has also matured into a better singer, but he has always been a good actor. If his performance here is just a little too creepy and disturbing, that isn't a bad thing with this work. John Mark Ainsley is at his best here as the Male Chorus and with Orla Boylan good as his counterpart, the Female Chorus. All the roles really are just terrific and the measure of the success of the production is that it's about as intense, well-sung, painfully well-acted performance of The Rape of Lucretia as you could wish for, a perfect match for Britten's remarkable score, which is revealed in all its brilliance here by Paul Daniels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1QO92PAEGSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFYJI7M#wasThisHelpful","RK1QO92PAEGSJ","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short review is that Stay Close, Little Ghost is a story about love, relationships and breakdowns.  The narrator, Oliver, has just come out of one bad relationship when he meets the wild, beautiful and flirtatious Yuki, whose irrational behaviour pushes him to the brink of a complete breakdown. The longer version of a review of Stay Close, Little Ghost is... well... it's complicated.Stay Close Little Ghost is a slim little novel, but it delves into its subject in startling detail and in a manner that keeps the reader alert for nuances and clues.  Oliver Serang's narrator probes for meaning and understanding in the mystical forces between two people with a hypersensitivity to those complex undercurrents, never relying on conventional descriptions or common notation.  He makes use of unusual devices - a little wolf in the belly, for example, that sniffs and howls at those signals that go unnoticed by most people - as well as strange symbolism, portentous dreams and signs.At times, Oliver Serang's writing style reminded me of the Symbolist writers, of Maurice Maeterlinck or Fyodor Sologub, which is not a route commonly followed in modern literature.  Serang however applies this style meaningfully, creatively and in an entirely modern context with the intention of delving more deeply to get past the convenient fallbacks that writers usually rely on when exploring this subject.  It's not always easy to follow but it ensures that the book pulses with the vibrant imagination of this unique outlook without ever becoming precious or pretentious.  It's like a literary form of synaesthesia, the author resorting to abstract visual references to describe the indescribable, mapping out relationships on a magic diamond, or finding a mathematical solution to the placement of four-leaved clovers in a city.There's a clue to the romanticism that lies at the heart of the book in those two examples, as well as the narrator's attempt at understanding the workings of the world through Swan Lake and an analysis of the cry-baby heroes of fairytales.  Nothing however is so easily pinned down and Oliver's experiences and some David Lynch-like blurring of the boundaries between nightmares and reality take him to much darker places.  Stay Close, Little Ghost is all about trying to fit into a spiky world without becoming spiky yourself, finding the colour of your own love and doing whatever is necessary to stop your soul turning grey.  As that description implies, the journey and any answer the reader might find is anything but conventional, but when you've been to some dark places, perhaps it's that kind of fresh outlook that is really needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF3KDEKJI2WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615855164#wasThisHelpful","R2BF3KDEKJI2WR","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LeoÅ¡ JanÃ¡Äek's The Cunning Little Vixen really is one of the great opera works of the 20th century.  It deals unsentimentally with a subject as big as the wonder and magic of life, the joys and the sadness it brings and the very nature of how those things are all tied up in the passing of time.  All of that is contained in JanÃ¡Äek's beautiful, lively score and how it matches the situations.  In terms of the singing and the musical performance, this 2009 production at the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino gets everything right, finding the right tone and revealing the true beauty of the work.  There's a tricky balance to maintain however in terms of how to pitch the production so that it's not viewed as a children's opera, and that's not managed quite as well in Laurent Pelly's production.Musically, this is a beautiful account of this extraordinary work that uses the full orchestra but lets you see the importance of each individual instrument to the whole (much like the subject of the work itself).  The pacing is all-important then, and I love the tempo that is measured out here by Seiji Ozawa, allowing the score to breathe and weave its magic, giving the voices of the singers room to place their characters within the fabric of its world, who are subject to its rhythms but view them in their own subjective context.  Like the music, the use of voices is an integral part of the work then and it's sung wonderfully here.  From the chorus to the individual performers, the singing really can't be faulted, Isabel Bayarakdarian, in particular bringing all the necessary character to Vixen Sharp Ears, much of which comes essentially with the precision and expression inherent within JanÃ¡Äek's writing for the voice.  This is as fine an expression of that as you will find.  Quinn Kelsey may look a little too young for the gamekeeper, but he sings the role well, and maybe even better than most.There is a tendency to play up the cuddly animal aspects of The Cunning Little Vixen to make it appeal to a younger audience, when in reality there is nothing at all cute or sentimental about the work.  Laurent Pelly's designs for the production are visually impressive and colourful, providing all the necessary situations with a certain amount of style.  On the other hand, but it's all a little too safe and sanitised and definitely falls on the side of it being a cute animal opera.  The harsh and sometimes unpleasant realities of nature don't really feature, the opera lacking, for example, any blood or mayhem or indeed any frolicking in the hen house.  There's only one brief moment where Pelly really tries to draw the connection between the animals and the humans, showing vixen in a dream having the shadow of a young woman, but other than that Pelly lets the work speak for itself.The production design might not capture the full earthy beauty of the work or its intent, but it still has many good features.  The badger's set shown in cutaway cross-section is impressive and the transformation of the set from that into PÃ¡cek's Inn is brilliantly achieved.  The recreation of animals and their movements is also very realistic.  The foxes in particular look authentically like a mix of human and fox, while the other creatures are similarly easily identifiable.  If it is a little too sanitised, this Cunning Little Vixen at least never falls into the trap of sentimentality.  As good as they are here, the performances and the music would never allow that to happen, and all the essential points, the purpose and the sheer beauty of this remarkable work come across wonderfully.

"Though it's come late in the year of the centenary of the birth of Benjamin Britten, has done much to consolidate and even raise his reputation as Britain's greatest composer and highlight some unjustly neglected works.  It must be hoped that this belated release of David McVicar's 2001 production of the Rape of Lucretia for the English National Opera, recorded by the BBC at the Aldeburgh Festival, will bring this work - more deserving perhaps than Gloriana - to the attention of a wider audience.Following Peter Grimes, The Rape of Lucretia marks something of a rethinking of approach to opera that would have a significant impact on the style of much of the composer's later dramatic works.  The subject of The Rape of Lucretia then is a sparse but powerful one which, when combined with Britten's musical scoring of it, is almost harrowing in its intensity.  It's not difficult to see here themes that preoccupy Britten throughout his musical career and even in his personal life relating to the corruption of innocence.  Lucretia, for Britten however is about much more than just the defilement of a woman's saintly virtue, but touches on the nature of society and the values that it assigns to men and women.  In particular the work questions the nature of violence, in war and as a characteristic of men, and challenges whether pacifism isn't truer to the better nature of mankind.It's Britten's musical arrangements however that are most innovative, distinctive, modern and relevant.  The reduced orchestration highlights the expression of individual instruments and heightens the dramatic tone and tension of the subject.  Rarely does the music rely on any conventional signposting that tells you how to react to the drama, but instead it fulfils the primary function of music in opera by exploring below the surface and revealing other depths.  It's beautiful and haunting, underpinning the drama in Britten's own developing idiomatic language, but also his own personal convictions that were so out of place with the accepted conventions of prevailing social attitudes of the time.  The use of male and female soloists as a 'chorus' is an important device that allows this wider perspective and provides a contemporary relevance, and not insignificantly, it's a device that is used in a very similar way more recently by Martin Crimp and George Benjamin in 'Written on Skin'.If it's difficult to point to any specific directorial choice that evidently has an impact on the performance, what is clear nonetheless is that David McVicar gets the mood exactly right.  His direction of the singers and the acting however is what ultimately makes this a truly great production, and the cast here is great.  Sarah Connolly isn't yet in her prime here.  She is still terrifically good, it's just that she's even better now.  Christopher Maltman too has also matured into a better singer, but he has always been a good actor.  If his performance here is just a little too creepy and disturbing, that isn't a bad thing with this work.  John Mark Ainsley is at his best here as the Male Chorus and with Orla Boylan good as his counterpart, the Female Chorus.  All the roles really are just terrific and the measure of the success of the production is that it's about as intense, well-sung, painfully well-acted performance of The Rape of Lucretia as you could wish for, a perfect match for Britten's remarkable score, which is revealed in all its brilliance here by Paul Daniels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QX645LLFIZCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGYMX5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1QX645LLFIZCL","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As he alluded to in his previous film Himiko, the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 had a deeply traumatic impact on the nation of Japan, but it also clearly made a big impression on Sion Sono as a filmmaker. Land of Hope deals with the subject a little more directly than Himiko - even if there are some characteristically quirky touches from this director - in order to make the important point that vital lessons haven't been learned and that Japan is in danger of ignoring the very serious risks that the disaster has had upon the nuclear power station at Fukushima. Land of Hope creates a fictional town called Nagashima for this purpose, but the implications of this merging of the towns Nagasaki and Hiroshima are all too apparent.The focus of Land of Hope is not so much on the immediate impact and devastation caused by the next earthquake however, but the aftermath. Here, mirroring the absurdity of the response to the Fukushima meltdown, the authorities answer here is to set up a hopelessly inadequate ""exclusion zone"" perimeter that is as useless as it is arbitrary. As one of the people affected here furiously observes, how can one side of a street be dangerous and the other side not? It's not as if the radioactive contamination is going to respect a few barriers and some menacing threats at the perimeter signposts.It's also a useful division for the director to exploit and he examines how people on both sides of the divide are affected, one couple on the wrong side of the exclusion zone sent to a temporary shelter where they are given no information about their home and relatives, while another young couple in the supposedly ""safe"" area decide to leave their parents right on the edge of the zone and seek a safer place to start a family. What seems to worry Sion Sono most however is the fear of the people to confront the reality of the situation. The government can't be trusted and give misinformation about the extent of the nuclear leaks, while the public are reluctant to be seen as responding hysterically for fear of spreading further panic.If it were a mainstream movie, you might think that some of the director's techniques were a little heavy-handed, but this is a Sion Sono film and this is a director who will use whatever means necessary to make an impression, and here he has every reason to do so. ""Why aren't you worried?"", screams Yoichi to his fellow workers who make fun of his wife's paranoid response to her pregnancy by wearing a heavy-duty radiation suit and sealing up doors and windows. This is one subject that Sion Sono is very serious about, and he makes the point very strongly indeed. The very real threat of ignoring or underestimating the danger is still there to see in the mud ghost-towns of the Japanese coastline, and the director makes powerful use of the images - scored to the Adagio from Mahler's 10th - which are more surreal than anything that can come from the mind of Sion Sono. Well, almost...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUCK53Q4VD10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKGPZ0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1BUCK53Q4VD10","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when you combine a distinctively unnerving filming technique with a character who is more than a little mentally off-balance?  Well, obviously you have a Shinya Tsukamoto film and everything that that entails, which means a deeply unsettling film that becomes even more unnerving as the horror deepens, but that can also include a deep, dark vein of black humour in that and perhaps less predictably in the case of Kotoko, even a surprisingly almost uplifting ending.For most of the film however, the viewer shares a very disturbing view of the world through the eyes of Kotoko, a mentally disturbed and self-harming woman, a mother who is probably paranoid-schizophrenic and consequently a danger to herself and her baby.  She sees people as doubles, one of whom she considers a potential threat to the baby, but she isn't able to separate the reality from the threat, and this leads to some considerable problems with sociability.  Eventually, much to the relief of the viewer, her baby is taken away from her, but this inevitably only leads to a rise in violence and self-harm against herself.  For a brief while, a man (played by Tsukamoto himself) helps her out of her dark place, a writer who seems inured to the extreme violence Kotoko inflicts on both of them.  And Kotoko wields a pretty mean fork.  It seems fairly certain however that all this is not going to end well.Kotoko is pretty gruelling stuff then, and it makes for a deeply uncomfortable 90 minutes viewing, but a lot of the reason why this is so horrific is because Tsukamoto makes it so disturbingly realistic.  The technique is brilliant, achieving an immediacy through the use of hand-held digital cameras, with jumpy edits and a familiar unsettling use of lighting and sound.  The low-fi use of technical effects is also just as effective as it is characteristic of the director of Tetsuo, particularly in the bizarre transformation of Kotoko's apartment close to the end of the film.Principally however it's the compelling and utterly involving performance of singer-songwriter Cocco in her first amazing acting performance that ensures that you aren't just plunged into a deeply terrifying nightmare, but that you can still see the humanity of Kotoko buried within it.  It's an outstanding performance.  Despite the bleakness of the situation and a still uncertain longterm outlook, that small remnant of humanity and hope remains at the very end of the film, and it is most affecting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16JJB06EF7NA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ACGLTO#wasThisHelpful","R16JJB06EF7NA2","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The degree to which Guy Cassiers' direction for Das Rheingold successfully set the tone for the rather more epic scale of the works to follow in La Scala's Ring cycle is immediately clear from the outset of Die WalkÃ¼re. The darkness, the menace and the threatening tone carries over perfectly into the epic storms of creation and the flight of Wehwalt/Siegmund and draw us compelling into Die WalkÃ¼re. Almost every Ring cycle however involves compromise of one sort or another and here it relates to choices made in the casting and in the singing. Neither however are so great that they detract in any significant way from the overall success of this critical juncture in La Scala's Ring cycle.Most notably - although it's by no means critical - there's no consistency here in the casting of Wotan and Fricke. RenÃ© Pape and Doris Soffel give way here to Vitalij Kowaljow and Ekaterina Gubanova, both of whom however perform very well even if they don't have the same degree of stature or personality as their predecessors.  There is perhaps some degree of compromise in the casting of Waltraud Meier and John Tomlinson. Neither is at their peak now and it shows in places. Tomlinson's ability and presence however, his deep understanding of Wagner's music and how it informs the characters even in a relatively minor role like Hunding, stand him in good stead here. The same could be said about Waltraud Meier, but her lighter touch works perfectly with Barenboim's dynamic approach to the score here. In terms of experience, expression and sheer professionalism, not to mention a voice of quite lyrical beauty and true force where required, Meier however really comes through.All the roles in Die WalkÃ¼re are important to the overall fabric of the work, but the ones that can make all the difference are Siegmund and BrÃ¼nnhilde. Simon O'Neill sets his own pace it seems, not always following the tempo set by Barenboim, but he sings well and gets across the necessary sympathy and nobility of his character. Nina Stemme however is just phenomenal as BrÃ¼nnhilde, and that's really what raises the overall high standard of this Die WalkÃ¼re. Her's is a voice of immense richness of timbre, but BrÃ¼nnhilde is by no means a role that can carry the work in isolation. It needs to work alongside the other characters and that's where the strength of the casting really shows. To use one example, the critical scene of Siegmund, Sieglinde and BrÃ¼nnhilde in the woods during Act II, Scene IV is telling in this respect. It's just stunning, the singing and expression of sentiments coming together, working in perfect accordance with the staging (light shading trees turning into shards of ice) and with Barenboim's orchestration to haunting effect.It's Daniel Barenboim of course who is instrumental in bringing all this together quite so successfully. He adjusts somewhat to the strengths and weaknesses of the singers in a way that gets the very best out of them, but he also responds to the full dynamic of Wagner's score, allowing the lyrical romanticism of the work to be expressed in the simple beauty, tone and melody of the music itself as much as in the measured force of the delivery. Act I in particular benefits from a more sensitive and lyrical approach to Siegmund and Sieglinde's encounter, but Barenboim is just as expressive when the underlying menace erupts, in the passages of shimmering ecstatic rapture and in the whole range of emotions that the grand scale of the work encompasses. It's a sheer tour-de-force that allows the score space to breathe and assert it own power without ever overplaying its hand or over-emphasis.That all works in perfect accord then with Guy Cassiers' understated direction for the stage, which is more about mood than strict representation. In this respect it's not dissimilar to the Met's recent Ring cycle, only with a set here that achieves the necessary impact much better and in a far less complicated manner than Robert Lepage's Machine. Following on from Das Rheingold, Hunding's lodge is a cube of light in what looks like a dark cave of glistening light projections. Act II, with a spinning globe connecting Valhalla to Earth, remains abstract but attractive to watch and feel without there ever being any sense of a ""concept"" being forced on the work and without distracting from the performances. The circle of fire conclusion is less of a spectacle, but that's in tune also with the simplicity and beauty of the line established by Barenboim's conducting of the work. It's not exactly traditional, but it all looks gorgeous and works well.The Blu-ray from Arthaus looks and sounds fabulous, the full-HD image and the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio sound mixes perfectly representing the essential tone of the production and the performances. Other than a couple of trailers, there are no extra features on the disc. The BD50 Blu-ray is region-free and subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6GSN7D9NIPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEMGCFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3K6GSN7D9NIPX","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rosa Rankin-Gee's debut takes a curious approach to structure and content that makes it feel like something less than a conventional novel, but something more than a series of connected short stories. This however is less in the spirit of experimentation with the format as much as meeting and matching the rhythms of the lives of the three young people who meet on summer in Sark and fall in love. Three people is an odd number for any love affair, and yes, inevitably, it leads to deep complications for all concerned.The novel is divided into two distinct sections. The first half is novella-like, related from the perspective of Jude, a young 21-year old girl who is engaged for the summer as a tutor for Pip on the island of Sark. Her time there seems fairly uneventful and even commonplace, Jude seemingly never fitting in or feeling entirely comfortable with Pip or sharing a room with Sofi, a young Polish girl from Ealing who is engaged there as a cook. They go for walks, cycle, go swimming and meet some Czech boys staying on the island, but nothing apparently out of the ordinary. There's little sense even of a narrative direction, just a series of impressions that somehow manage to get it across that Jude is nonetheless experiencing a summer of love that is going to have an important impact on her life.There's little that is made explicit about these feelings until close to the end of this section, but in the playfulness of the dialogue and the imaginative and original use of language (particularly from Sofi), you sense the deeper undercurrents at work. The second half of the book feels less satisfactory, revisiting Pip, Jude and Sofi at different times in the subsequent ten years or so through a series of fragmentary short-stories where you have to gradually work out from the dialogue who we are dealing with, what the time period is and in what circumstances the characters are living ...or, well, maybe coping is a better word. It feels like the author is playing with you, withholding information until the last moment, but on the other hand, this sense of being lost in the middle of something unknown does create exactly the right kind of sense of dissatisfaction that is vital here.This then, more than anything, is what the novel best achieves, communicating those feelings to the viewer outside of a conventional narrative plot. ""A tugging at the base of your stomach"" is one phrase that is used in the book to describe the sensation of being in love with the wrong person, of love being unrequited, of opportunities being missed, of regretful longing for the past, and it's a feeling that will be painfully recognisable to most readers. Rosa Rankin-Gee manages to hit the reader right in that delicate place through her writing across the whole of The Last Kings of Sark, and gut reaction is really what counts in this lovely little novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QV8ZDZYW6GH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI7HN0C#wasThisHelpful","R2QV8ZDZYW6GH4","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You don't want too much to be concrete and literal in the strange indefinable world of Allemonde that Debussy and Maeterlinck evoke so enigmatically in PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande. You can't have the characters float around aimlessly like ciphers (even if Robert Wilson has successfully proved otherwise), but you need to recognise that there are passions here as deep as the wells in Allemonde that the characters keep dropping precious objects into. Nikolaus Lehnhoff is particularly successful in this 2012 Essen production PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande not only in how he connects the semi-abstract altered-states to an underpinning realism, but in how he gives due attention to Golaud, a the figure whose nature and actions arguably have a more significant impact on the tone and the direction events take than the main characters.The establishment of a suitable environment for Allemonde is critical also, and that's central to Lehnhoff's concept. The castle where one never sees the skies, the caverns and the wells all evoke a specific atmosphere of oppressiveness and Raimund Bauer's sets bring all this together into a boxed structure that is classical and symmetrical in a way that imposes a sense of order and consistency. There's considerable attention paid however to thee subtle changes and the emotional undercurrents that are expressed in the score. I don't think I've never seen a production of PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande that adheres to and matches the moods and rhythms so well. Much of the personalities of the characters in the work however is also conveyed in the very timbre of voice and the expression and weight given to the parlando expression of the singing.Jacques Imbrailo's PellÃ©as is therefore lyrical but conflicted, driven by strange urges and entranced by MÃ©lisande's hair, passions that the world of Allemonde is unused to. As MÃ©lisande Michaela Selinger personifies this complicated bearer of dangerous beauty, delicate and sensitive, yet confused and exasperated with her condition - the victim (or catalyst) of an unknown trauma in the past doomed to perhaps repeat it. It's Golaud however and the tormented state of his mind filled with suspicion and fearful of betrayal, who arguably asserts the most influence over events, the direct agent at least of the tragedy that ensues. He is however also the injured party, tormented and to be pitied. I've seen Vincent Le Texier sing this role before, but never so soulfully and never so sensitive to the rhythms of the music that seem to be opening up his soul every time he speaks. He's the dark heart of this PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande, the personification of the Allemonde whose sense of order and solidity is broken down by the presence of MÃ©lisande.There is undoubtedly an element of haunting detachment to PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande, but this production still comes across as a little bit cold. There should perhaps be a better balance between the warmth of the score and the singing and the coolness of the production, but that perhaps doesn't work as well on the screen as it might have in the theatre. A gauze screen at the front of the stage softens and diffuses the light, so the clarity you might expect to see in a High-Definition recording is reduced to indistinct softness and haziness. The musical performance under Stefan Soltesz is as beautiful as you would expect, but it doesn't have a fullness of presence in the audio mixes either.The Blu-ray has optional subtitles in French, German, English, Spanish, Italian and Korean. These can only be selected during play through the remote or the pop-up menu. There are however fixed titles on the screen in English in the musical interludes between scenes that give a synopsis of the next scene like a strange foretelling of events. Other than a couple of trailers there are no extra features on the production, but the director provides some thoughts in the enclosed booklet, and Debussy's own description of how he came to write PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande is also included. The disc is all-region.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YAIO262YK0BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEMGCB0#wasThisHelpful","R1YAIO262YK0BB","A3ODKKGVALLI2G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKKGVALLI2G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The mini quadcopter is a ton of fun. I personally use this for the dorm. I have a ton of fun just flying it around when I have nothing  better todo. The flight time is around 7 mins which awesome. Plus they include 2 batteries so you can really have a good time. The charger itself can charge to batteries at once. I only takes around 10-15 mins to charge up the batteries.  The remote control needs 4 AA batteries that are not included in the package.Now for the performance of the quadcopter:This quadcopter is super easy to fly. I mean I had no problems flying this bad boy. There is an option that allows you to adjust how quickly you want the quadcopter to react. Basically you can have it make sharp turns if your experience or you can set it up for an easy flight.Design: The quadcopter is small and has an awesome black and green look. I know anyone would think this is an awesome quadcopter. Another great feature about this quadcopter is the fact that it has a camera to record video. Its awesome to watch the footage of the quadcopter in action. The camera quality is 720p which is alright. You definitely can get some videos with this camera. Overall I think this is a great quadcopter epically for the price. You can't beat the price of this quadcopter.  Overall I was very impressed with this product.

" 4:01 Mins Looking for a good time? Here it is! This hover board is going to bring you a good time. They are a ton of fun to ride as well as very easy to ride. It takes a couple tries to get use to riding it and feeling the board out. The board is very responsive which is nice when making sharp turns. I personally like the all black board. It makes the hover board look very sleek and classy. The black board has blue LED lights on the front side. The LED lights will blink when you press pressure on the side. I'm glad to see the price of the boards are going down. For example this board is $400 dollars. Compare to last month it was $500 dollars. The price drop is awesome to see. The only thing to note is the weight. The Segway are heavy to  carry around.

"Why would someone want to buy a MP4 player. Well the number one reason why is because it's cheap. It plays music just fine. The number one reason why it's a hit is because of the price. Using on of these is great because I don't have to worry about it getting stolen. If someone steals it, it's going to suck but at least it's not an iPhone. This MP4 can download music and more. It's a 16 gb so its definitely a good size. I highly recommend this product for kids. It's cheaper than buying them a $150 dollar iPod. The MP4 is built nice so you won't have to worry about it breaking. Another great thing I like about the MP4 is it has a SD card. That means you can expand the memory.

"This is a really cool idea when you get to try it out. It's a ton of fun to just see where technology is taking us. Putting together the cardboard box took me a couple try's but once I got it, I was ready to go. Now I did need to tape one of the sides to keep it from falling apart. Once I did that I was able to have some fun. Now it had a hard time fitting an iPhone 5s into the cardboard VR glasses. It didn't want to stay in place. The iPhone 6s Plus was a perfect size for it.  You don't have to worry about your phone falling out because there is velcro to protect it from falling. Overall I am very happy with this product and the only way to experience it is by seeing it.

The only thing I recommend is being very close with the person because you will be right next to them. I was surprise to know that this hammock could hold up to 660 pounds. That's insane for a hammock. I didn't know a hammock could hold that much. I love the colors of the hammock there very nature style.

"Everybody always can benefit having an extra lighting dock cable. Especially if you have a fair amount of apple products. Like me I am always running short on Apple products.I always tend to lose of break them. Here's what makes this cable nice. The built quality. The cord itself feels heavier than the cord provided by Apple. The wire is strong which means it will last longer. The cable itself is 4 feet long. That's definitely longer than the Apple cable that is provided.  I was definitely happy with this cable because of the quality that went into this cable. The cable cost around $14 dollars which isn't terrible for the price. Overall this is a great accessory to have specially when traveling.

" 4:45 Mins This is a great tablet for the price. I think amazon did it right by making a tablet for $50 dollars. Amazon is taking a dive in the right market place. There arenâ€™t many name brand names that have a tablet for under $50 dollars. Let me know if you are interested in seeing comparisons of other $50 dollar tablets. This tablet is great for kids. First because of the price, not many parents want to pay the amount of money an iPad cost. The performance of this tablet is great. I was very impressed the way this tablet performs.  Playing games on the new kindle work great. There is no lag when playing games. Watching videos are great; you still get a crisp and clear screen. The audio isnâ€™t the best by headphones can fix that.

"I did not know what to expect when I got this LED light in the mail. I thought it would have been a little bigger than what I expected. It's a pretty small size.  Don't let that fool you though.

The LED light has a 550mAh  battery life which basically means you will get around 2-3 hours of battery before you have to charge it up again.

"I did some quick math. Twelve grooming sessions each @ $50 is $600/year, $6,000 over ten years, and $9,000 over the 15-year expected lifespan of my Cockapoo named Bentley (assuming the cost remains the same). Thatâ€™s insane!So I decided to watch some YouTube videos, and figured â€œHey, I can do that myself!!!!â€. Went to Amazon.com and found this Wahl groomer. I use a Wahl on my own hair and figured they have great quality, so why not try it?After reading the reviews here, I decided on this grooming set. It comes with a single speed corded unit, battery operated unit, a # of plastic snap on length attachments, a DVD, and a barber scissor. Hereâ€™s my review of the components.Scissor: It cuts, but not well. Iâ€™ve used barber scissors, and thereâ€™s no comparison. So I bought a new pair for $13 and am very happy. The ones with the set are great for paper, but not for dog hair. They pull way too much and don't cut crisply or evenly.Snap-on Guides: Go on very easily, and I imagine they would serve a purpose for longhaired dogs. But for my baby, his hair needs just a 10 and 7 blade (the latter is not included).Cordless trimmer: Worthless, in every respect. The battery cover kept popping off. I finally taped it on to keep it there. The power is inadequate for anything other than the hair between the digits of the paws. And even then, it's very weak and took too much time. I had a hair scissor which I used and it turned out well, albeit very time consuming. It did a good job on my sideburns. But for dogs? Not worth it.DVD- Youâ€™re better off going to YouTube and watching the grooming videos, of which there are dozens. This DVD is a relic of a time before YouTube, is an inferior quality with limited explanations, and hardly worth the time. Your minutes/hours are better spent surfing the web for grooming videos. There are some excellent ones that I came upon, varying from 3-25 minutes.Corded trimmer: This is really the heart of the system, and in my opinion, it is lousy. It wonâ€™t cut Bentleyâ€™s hair well, which is not thick at all (bathed him in the morning and cut in the evening, so it was completely dry). It pulls the hair out more than it cuts it. I had to constantly oil it, clean it, and do multiple passes over the same area. I didnâ€™t use any attachments, only using the 10 blade it came with. On Bentleyâ€™s belly, it didnâ€™t leave a close cut at all. It fluffed it up, yes, but cut? Not really. On his face, it pushed the hair around, but didnâ€™t provide adequate cuts. Further, the blades are not interchangeable except with a screwdriver, so swaps â€œon the goâ€ are not possible.So, I decided to get the Oster A5 two-speed, and the difference was immediate. It was like going from chopping wood with a hammer to cutting butter with a warm knife (http://www.amazon.com/Oster-2-Speed-Professional-Animal-Clipper/dp/B000LRN31A/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1434823584&sr=8-16&keywords=dog+trimmers).Another calculation: At $50, the Wahl = one grooming session; the Oster A5 two-speed = 2 ½ sessions. Over the lifetime of my dog, Iâ€™ll be doing about 200 cuts. That extra 1 Â½ session of cost to buy it at $113 spread out over 200 sessions and 15 years is insignificant.This is a classic case of â€œyou get what you pay forâ€. For the extra $65, isnâ€™t your doggie worth it? Plus, donâ€™t forget to account for the huge time saving with the Oster, and it actually costs LESS (due to hours saved, and spent doing more productive things) than this underpowered Wahl grooming unit.Do yourself a favor and get the Oster A5. Thatâ€™s my unbiased take. (And no, I don't work for Oster.

"I've mounted about a dozen TV's in my life and ever found a wall mount worth a damned. Until this one. It is SO easy it's hard to fathom it took this long to come up with the solution. You simply bolt it to the wall (you'll need a level to ensure it's vertical). Next you mount the included bracket to the TV with four bolts. Then, you slide it over a little hook on the end of the arm, secure it with two bolts so it doesn't slide up and off (as if thats gonna happen on its own), and you're done. It then extends about 18"", swivels left/right, and up/down if you loosen a bolt then retighten. It installed in 20 minutes and my 40"" TV is entirely secure. Plus, I can finally get to the rear plugs, something you can never do with flat mounts, which leave about 1"" between the back of the TV and the wall. Your hand can't possibly fit in there. In my upstairs TV, a cable fell out, so I had to take the entire TV off the wall, reattach the cable, then have to hang it blindly, trying time and again to find the catch hooks on the wall mount, which you can't see with the TV so close to the wall. I'll never get a flat mount again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WYPQ9YBGDJ25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00393KNVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WYPQ9YBGDJ25","AG6JJG6UOKBX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6JJG6UOKBX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works better than old hard strap. It fits around the chest, with an easy open/close hook. The hard monitor buttons to the soft strap, so it can be removed to wash the strap. It has to be synched with the Garmin device the first time, then it's hooked up for future uses. The battery change takes a small Phillips head screwdriver to remove four screws, then pop in a CR2032 battery.Adjusting the length of the strap is difficult, as it's not just a standard sliding clip. For some reason, Garmin has taken an elegant solution and made it very difficult, with three, not two, loops to account for. No idea why, but I'm glad I only had to do it once. Overall, an upgrade from the hard plastic monitor this replaced.But beware of this: Garmin RECOMMENDS you not use this, or any, of its monitors with a cycling jersey. Read that again: a device designed FOR cycling is not to be used WITH a cycling jersey. Why? Because cycling jerseys have mostly polyester, and when they flap against the monitor (as it of course does with wind hitting your chest if you ride over 3 mph), it causes static interference and your HR displays 180+. So, on those rapid descents, I have to hold the jersey off the strap, or my HR is wacky. This has been documented on cycling blogs for years, but Garmin refuses to shield it from this interference, which probably would add $1 to the cost. I tried electrical tape on the side facing my jersey, which worked, but it kept falling off due to sweat. I queried their CSR about why they don't make one for cycling jerseys, and she said she only works in customer service, and isn't an engineer.So, you need it for a Garmin Edge for cycling, but your HR #'s may not be accurate. Thus, 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XMJUQ17657K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI9X1QM#wasThisHelpful","R37XMJUQ17657K","AG6JJG6UOKBX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6JJG6UOKBX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will file a complaint with Amazon.The product photo is deceptive and shows no logo, but what I got has an ugly Tesla logo.  I ordered the product code TM-R01-BB_XL which is black with no logo but they shipped me TM-R34-BLY_2XL with an ugly Tesla logo.  I've had people ask me if it's associated with the car maker.I'd be pretty happy if they shipped me the product I ordered.  I even tried ordering two more times and each time they shipped me the wrong product with the ugly logo.Too bad because the product isn't bad.  Think of this as a very nice fitted tight outfit.  Don't expect it to compress much and don't expect it to hide any fat rolls you might have.  If you have a very fit body, this thing looks awesome.  For me I don't always want the compression and it allows blood to flow freely.  The material is soft and smooth and breathes fairly well.  Great for indoors or warmer outdoor weather.  Don't expect it to warm you on a cold day.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340N2GQYX7AZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4GW7YW#wasThisHelpful","R340N2GQYX7AZ5","A319ZSLHK97E7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A319ZSLHK97E7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just bought my nephew who is going to college an HP Stream 13 for $230. Beautiful and powerful computer, but it took me 90 minutes to remove all the stickers and all the crapware & adware.  I still need to offload the recovery partition to a flash disk to recover the SSD storage. It has a total of 32 GB SSD storage so every bit counts.  I'm also waiting for a 64 GB MicroSD card http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVPU7AO so I can expand the storage.Removing the crapware and adware took 2 hours plus another hour to install Windows update.  I removed all the browser extensions and add-ons in IE and then installed Chrome. Then I installed CCleaner and removed McAfee anti-virus so that I can just use the free Microsoft AV. Also removed a bunch of bloatware like Cisco wireless networking utilities like LEAP and Apple Bonjour. Removed the Realtek card reader software since it slows the card reader down. Then downloaded fresh Realtek card reader driver and manually installed the driver without using their setup program.UPDATE - I had to remove all the HP tools (support and registration) as well.  They were intermittently hammering the CPU to 100% and other people in HP forums were complaining about this problem.  Once uninstalled, the CPU usage problems went away.  Something else that caused some mildly high CPU usage during media playback was the Realtek DTS audio processing service and I've disabled that and the system performs better.  It was not needed for playback quality and it was actually detrimental to audio recording quality.The thing that slowed me down was that I had to gather my nephew's personal info to create a Microsoft account for him. It was mandatory since this is the free version of MS Windows 8.1 (with Bing). But the MS Account allows him to use MS Office online for free so it's worth setting up.  I also had to carefully remove 3 stickers on the keyboard rest. Intel sticker was tilted. Now it's a beautiful clean system and it boots very fast and loads everything fast. It handles most computing tasks just fine and now I'm loathed to give this away.Some people will complain about the 2GB of RAM which is not expandable, but I never have any problems with 2GB RAM because I don't leave a 20 browser tabs open.  You're not going to use this laptop for 3D intensive gaming or 3D rendering so the RAM shouldn't be an issue.  I have a desktop computer with 8 GB of RAM for running games and virtual machines and content production and no one should expect the HP Stream 13 to perform this role.  It runs fewer than 10 web browser tabs just fine and it's extremely snappy running Microsoft Office Online or Google apps.I ran a Youtube 1080P on Chrome browser. Google is screwing all of us now by forcing their VP9 codec on us which forces this computer to use software video decoding. This dual-core CPU is pegged at 100% utilization and forced to overclock to 2.58 GHz and it will still hiccup if a youtube ad shows up.  Of course this is just chewing up the battery.  By comparison, I tested a 1080P H.264 .MP4 video downloaded from Google and the CPU hovered around 8% during smooth playback. Google needs to shove their VP8 & VP9 codec where the sun don't shine.  But thank goodness for ""Magic Actions for YouTube"" (a Chrome plugin) letting me disable Google's VP9 HTML5 crap.  Now Chrome runs Youtube in flash mode with H.264 hardware decoding and the CPU hovers around 20%.  Here's a screenshot of the CPU pegged at 100% with VP9 software decode [...].  Here's the CPU hovering at 20% using Flash mode with H.264 hardware decode [...].I've been hammering on this system with tests for over two hours. The Intel N2840 2.16 GHz processor is being forced to burst to 2.58 GHz from all the work I'm throwing at it. Windows Update is hammering the IO and CPU. The brightness level is even set to 60% and the battery level still reads 79% with 4 hours 24 minutes remaining.After all the tweaks and cleanup I've done, the slim HP Stream 13 3.42 lb laptop is running smooth as butter. The 13.3"" 1366x768 non-glare matte screen is the perfect compromise between viewabiliy and compactness.  Would be even nicer if HP could sell us a 1920x1080 13.3"" screen but probably not at the $230 price point.  Another small gripe is that the bezel is a little bigger than I'd like.The Stream 13 has a 720P webcam, but I wouldn't even call it 360P quality. It's incredibly grainy using indoor lighting, but what were you expecting for a $230 laptop?  It's certainly not going to look like the camera on the MacBook Pro. Get yourself a $66 Logitech C920 which has awesome image quality and 1080P hardware encoding if you want a nice webcam.  Even a $29 720P webcam will look leaps and bounds better.On the audio output side, the HP Stream 13 has good sound output from the TRRS jack.  It can drive my large 808 headphones with authority.  By comparison, my Lenovo ThinkPad T430 business laptop couldn't push my 808s at all!  The audio recording on the other hand stinks in the default setting.  The integrated microphone sucks like most integrated microphones on laptops. It is very laggy because of all the noise cancellation algorithms they apply to it. The recorded sound (using Audacity) is noise free but it is extremely unnatural due to excessive noise reduction.  I don't like the recorded sound at all.UPDATE - After disabling the DTS Realtek audio processing, the playback quality was still just as good.  Recording with the internal microphone actually improved a lot.  The internal microphone in the HP Stream 13 actually isn't too shabby.  It is surprisingly usable quality for VoIP or Video Calling.The Stream 13 also has a 3.5mm TRRS phone connector port for headphones and earbuds with microphones. That means you can use the same earbuds with mic that you use with your smartphone. The problem is that while it sounds a lot more natural than the integrated microphone, it's a faint yet noisy signal. The input volume was set to 100% with a 10 dB (fake software preamp) boost and it's still only reaching 20% peak sound levels in Audacity.  My Nexus 4 and Samsung S4 on the other hand produce extremely good quality recordings with the same earbuds or headphones with microphones.  To put this in context, my Lenovo ThinkPad T430 from work has the same audio recording quality problems with the integrated mic and TRRS port.If you want to work around these sound recording issues, buy yourself a $34 Samson GoMic.  It's the best money you'll ever spend on a USB microphone.  The other option is that you can get a bluetooth headphone with microphone since the HP Stream 13 has bluetooth capability.The trackpad on the HP Stream 13 is large and usable.  It supports gestures like two-finger scrolling.  But if you really want a good experience, buy a bluetooth mouse and use the integrated bluetooth in the Stream 13.Lastly, here are the disk performance results for the internal 32 GB SSD storage. It's one of the slowest SSDs on the market, but it's still around 15 times faster than a normal hard drive when it comes to small file transfers.[...]Conclusion:This is a superb mobility laptop for the money, but only if you remove all the crapware and apply all the optimizations I performed above.Summary of crapware removed and optimizations performed.* Apple Bonjour.* Cisco LEAP and EAPFAST* McAfee AV* Realtek cardreader software (note that you need to download just the new drivers and then just install drivers manually without software.  Don't remove if you don't know how to install new drivers because you'll lose the card reader)* HP Tools registration* HP Tools support* Disable Realtek DTS audio effects.  Just type DTS at start screen and the program will pop up.* Install Chrome* If you use Chrome, install ""Magic Actions for YouTube"" plugin for Chrome to disable ads, pick the default resolution, and force Flash mode instead of HTML5 mode.  Flash mode uses H.264 MPEG AVC video which supports hardware acceleration for very low CPU usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVF6X3HT045CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65HZKS#wasThisHelpful","RVF6X3HT045CH","A319ZSLHK97E7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A319ZSLHK97E7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely good quality mic for the money.  It's probably the best USB mic you can get for less than $50.  The raw sound without any noise cancellation gimmick is very clean.  Some USB mics or cameras incorporate noise cancellation in their drivers but it's not a good natural sound.  Cleaned up audio isn't the same as audio that's clean to begin with.You can operate this mic in Omni mode which covers 360 degrees if you're trying to record multiple people.  Omni mode is inherently more noisy but the quality is still surprisingly good.  If you use this mic in cardioid mode, it's even cleaner.  I had to set the input level to around 50% at 20 inches from my mouth.  It's even cleaner if you record at 10 inches and set the level to 25% because it won't pick up as much background noise.This isn't just a microphone, it's also a USB sound card.  You can not only monitor yourself from the Microphone in real-time with the 3.5mm headphone jack, you can concurrently play audio without it being recorded.  This is no small feat!  When I tried to do this with a normal sound card and a normal mixer, I can't play music and record just the mic.  I have to record the background track and the microphone vocals into a single track.  I had to get a second mixer to record only the microphone while monitoring the mic and listening to a separate background track.The Samson Go Mic even comes with a nice hard carrying case.  The only nit pick is that the case can't carry the cable, the mic mount nut, or the plastic cable manager clip.  The cable is also very long so if you're using this clipped onto your laptop, you get a bunch of extra cable in the way.  I'd suggest that you buy a short 1-foot USB-A to USB Mini-B cable to use this product more efficiently with a laptop.Here's a sample I recorded in the three recording modes. It has a 3-way hardware switch. The product drivers install automatically in Windows. I've bought much more expensive solutions (mic + mixer) that don't do half what this thing does.  http://bit.ly/1quPvzVOne minor downside is that this Mic can only be used with a computer.  I was hoping to power it with a generic USB power adapter and use the 3.5mm as a line level output so that I could use this mic with a conferencing speaker phone.  It will not power up if you plug it into a power adapter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7H26B65QN8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R76D42#wasThisHelpful","R2N7H26B65QN8Z","A319ZSLHK97E7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A319ZSLHK97E7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very disappointed with bass. I'm no ""basshead"". I love all kinds of music from popular to acoustic to classical.  The bass in the AKG K240 drops off severely below 50 Hz and is nearly inaudible at 30 Hz even though the product description claims 15 Hz.  Any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion. I personally prefer to leave my music source flat and I don't like using bass boost, but I want to hear natural sounding clear and sufficiently loud bass.Here's a spectral plot analysis of the acoustic music video ""It's Time"" from ""Imagine Dragons"". http://bit.ly/1nbufm8Even though it's acoustic music (they don't even use true bass instruments), there's a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at ""bassheads"" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call ""flat"" or ""neutral"" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.All that said, I will say that I like the build quality and the detachable cable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZW36NIMLUEE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ARCFA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZW36NIMLUEE9","A319ZSLHK97E7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A319ZSLHK97E7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:25 MinsThe solution is a transparent gel with a subtle smell of reminiscent of vanilla.  It evaporates does not smell within a minute. I found it helpful for a small burn I got on  my hand from touching a hot skillet.  It immediately soothed the pain and by the morning my hand did not hurt at all.  I tried it on sun spots, and it does not seem to change their color (2 weeks so far).  Perhaps it needs more time, but based on my experience don't expect quick results.The bottle is small. With the cap on it is 4.75"" tall and slender.  On the positive side it is the size that could be carried along without having a bulk of bigger bottle.I like to see a list of ingredients on products, especially if they claim to be all natural.  Since I was not able to find ingredients on Amazon description or even the company web site so I copied  the list of ingredients from the bottle:Aloe Vera Gel, pentadecanoic acid, octadecadienoic, omega 6, linoleic acid, Ascorbic acid, Hydroxy ethyl cellulose.I received a sample for testing from ASTI. The manufacture does not use animal for testing so they enlisted me as one of the human test subjects.  In terms of brightening dark spots I am not seeing noticeable result after 2 weeks.

" 1:55 MinsI used to see a podiatrist a couple of time a year to grind down a callus on the bottom of my foot that bothered me when I walked for a long time.  Then I discovered these little callus removers and they work as well as my the tool my doc is using. I used it dry, it is not painful at all, it removes dry skin in a very thin layer. I can see skin coming off in powder-like state. I work a few seconds at a time checking the result so I don't remove too much skin.I have tried other callus removers such as files, pummis stone, and chemical solutions. None of them worked well enough to avoid visits to the podiatrist. This grinder is more effective than anything I have tried before, I don't see the need to go back to the podiatrist.The package include the callus remover, a spare grinder roller, a brush for cleaning the grinder.  The grinder runs on two AA batteries, which are not included.This is not my first callus remover, some of them are not as well made as other - some of them did not fit well together.  This callus remover fit well together, all parts lined up well.  It comes with a nice manual - it is in English and has a lot of images that demonstrate how to connect heads, insert batteries, and so forth.This grinder is unique because it also has a nail clipper.  It was a little scary to stick my nail into it for the first time, but nothing bad happened when I did. However, I do not like the way it feels on my nails and I am not planning on using it on regular basis.  The callus remover, however, is great!I received this callus remover for testing and review.

"I really like these gloves but the description of sizing is not right.  It is certainly not XL men gloves.  I am a female with small hands and the these gloves are a good fit for me. I normally wear size small gloves.When measured on the outside the glove is 9.5"" long and 4.3"" wide at the palm (measured just above the thumb). But the gloves are pretty thick.There is about 1/2"" of space at the tip of the fingers. My hand is 6.5"" long (so the there is room for 7"" long hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger).  The width of my hand is 3.25"" and it feels roomy without being way too large, guessing there is bout 1"" of slack on the inside.The gloves come with rechargeable batteries and a special charging cord.  The back of the gloves has a pocket with a connector for the batteries.  There is no on/off  switch, the heating element begins working as soon as the battery is connected.  I was pleasantly surprised that the heat was not only in the back of the hands but in the fingers as well.  The heat was pleasant (i.e. not too hot).  I can feel the battery in the back of my hand, but not the heating elements  in the glove and in the fingers.The back of the gloves has a Velco strip it can tighten the fit of the glove and it happens to be over the battery and prevents the battery from moving around in its pocket.My hands get really cold in the winter, so I am looking forward to being more comfortable this winter. I will post an update if the gloves do not last through the winter.I received these gloves for testing and review as part of a new product introductions.  So far they look promising!

"I just finished  my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems.  Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.' INSTALLATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located several ways.Option 1:  In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".Option 2:  This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"".  When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:1) Log into Amazon2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permin Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""I quote the FAQ answer below:""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""' WHAT IS INCLUDED~~~~~~~~~~~~~I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free if you income is $60,000 or less.' GENERAL~~~~~~~~~~~~~I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.' For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/20/2015. H&R web site says they will become available in January.  To see the latest status you can go to H&R website, click on Dowload software, then hover over  ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Coming soon in January 2016"".When the state forms became available and  teh state software can be downloaded directly from the program.' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'  Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbersIf this happens the person who tries to file their own  tax return gets the following error:IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.What to do if this happens?1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-16. File a police report of a possible identity theftI have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.Ali Julia review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KPGMVN8MVTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01637RMYU#wasThisHelpful","R31KPGMVN8MVTK","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:02 Mins Nice small labels.  They stick well and come off clean when needed without leaving sticky goo.Ball point pen does not write on these labels, but felt pen works very well. The labels are small and have different shapes and sizes.  The largest label is 11/16"" square, the smallest is 1/4"" oval.  Their size works on small bottle and containers or just color-coding.I received a sample for testing and review.

"The entire book is only 76 pages.  It is written succinctly, with examples to illustrate major points.  All chapters are short and written in a simple language, I was able to read it in one sitting.The book helps to answer questions such as when it makes sense to take early retirement (never if you can effort it), how much income you can earn in retirement before you start losing your benefits, what is the difference between suspending your benefits from not filing for benefits until full retirement age, and many more.The book ends with a clear and politically unbiased explanation of the problems facing Social Security and a long list of possible solutions with pluses and minuses of each option.  The author does not make a conclusion on what options are best, rather he leaves the reader to ponder the issues associated with each option.Thank you to CladeBank media for providing me a review copy of this book. This book contains the basic information, but I found it clearly written and succinct. Even though this basic information is available in other places this book is well organized so I could digest it in one sitting.

" 0:17 Mins These are basically knee high.  They are made out of 95% acrylic and 5% spandex.  Because of the materials they are very stretchy and expand to accommodate even athletic calves.  However the top elastic is pretty tight.  They reach right up to the knee and grip on with the tight elastic.  I hope it stretches out a bit as I wear it, I  would have like it to be just a little less tight.  The height of the sock it can stretch from 15 inches to 17 inches. The fit like size 9-11 socks.  On my small foot (size 7) they are a little lose but not too bad (typical fit for a size 9-11 fit on me).These socks are designed for attractive look rather than warmth, the knit is very lacy.

" 0:25 MinsThe solution is a transparent gel with a subtle smell of reminiscent of vanilla.  It evaporates does not smell within a minute. I found it helpful for a small burn I got on  my hand from touching a hot skillet.  It immediately soothed the pain and by the morning my hand did not hurt at all.  I tried it on sun spots, and it does not seem to change their color (2 weeks so far).  Perhaps it needs more time, but based on my experience don't expect quick results.The bottle is small. With the cap on it is 4.75"" tall and slender.  On the positive side it is the size that could be carried along without having a bulk of bigger bottle.I like to see a list of ingredients on products, especially if they claim to be all natural.  Since I was not able to find ingredients on Amazon description or even the company web site so I copied  the list of ingredients from the bottle:Aloe Vera Gel, pentadecanoic acid, octadecadienoic, omega 6, linoleic acid, Ascorbic acid, Hydroxy ethyl cellulose.I received a sample for testing from ASTI. The manufacture does not use animal for testing so they enlisted me as one of the human test subjects.  In terms of brightening dark spots I am not seeing noticeable result after 2 weeks.  I found it to be effective on light burns.Ali Julia review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13O6BLOU4PV2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F7TK4A#wasThisHelpful","R13O6BLOU4PV2C","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:55 MinsI used to see a podiatrist a couple of time a year to grind down a callus on the bottom of my foot that bothered me when I walked for a long time.  Then I discovered these little callus removers and they work as well as my the tool my doc is using. I used it dry, it is not painful at all, it removes dry skin in a very thin layer. I can see skin coming off in powder-like state. I work a few seconds at a time checking the result so I don't remove too much skin.I have tried other callus removers such as files, pummis stone, and chemical solutions. None of them worked well enough to avoid visits to the podiatrist. This grinder is more effective than anything I have tried before, I don't see the need to go back to the podiatrist.The package include the callus remover, a spare grinder roller, a brush for cleaning the grinder.  The grinder runs on two AA batteries, which are not included.This is not my first callus remover, some of them are not as well made as other - some of them did not fit well together.  This callus remover fit well together, all parts lined up well.  It comes with a nice manual - it is in English and has a lot of images that demonstrate how to connect heads, insert batteries, and so forth.This grinder is unique because it also has a nail clipper.  It was a little scary to stick my nail into it for the first time, but nothing bad happened when I did. However, I do not like the way it feels on my nails and I am not planning on using it on regular basis.  The callus remover, however, is great!I received this callus remover for testing and review. I really like the callus remover, the nail clipper feels ""funny"" on my nails, but your millage may vary.Ali Julia review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIGRCODHSPC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NROK4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1IIGRCODHSPC5","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:23 MinsThese TotalCarePro insoles provide no arch support.  It is not for people who have flat feet or seek arch support. The insole are made out of material that looks like neoprene.  It is a thin neoprene insert that provides some minor cushioning.  Inside I can feel 6 metal disks, they do not hurt or interfere with walking. The insole is large but have cutting lines on the sole so they can be cut to the desired size.  The guidelines are larger than women sizes, but I used them for the first cut and then used the sole of the shoe I want to wear them in to trim for a perfect fit.The slight cushioning they provide is comfortable, but there is a problem which prevents me from using the insoles  at this time. The insoles have a strong chemical scent (not unusual for the neoprene products).  I put them in basement to air out.  So far it has been two weeks (15 days to be exact) and they still stink. My experience with neoprene mouse pads that had a similar scent is that it can take many months to air out.I received these insole from TotalCarePro for evaluation with a request to provide an honest review. Getting a free product does not influence what I say.

"This is my first experience w Mr. Beam lights.. but I  am impressed..I was looking for some  security lights to go on my patio .when I saw these I thought ..."" Let give them a try"".. sure beats getting a electrician  out to wire the patio The back of the house is a dead zone re light and an open area behind  so It is always a concern not to have some kind of security lighting out there..well install simple and all I needed was some batteries to get up and started.. After install waited for the evening hours to better angle the lights. I installed one on either end of the Patio deck... but after seeing how they work I  may have to get more for the side of the house as well  The range of the lights is about  30 feet or 1/2 of my deck.... with the install on either side It is easy to tell if some one or something is walking the deck..very Pleased w this product and would recommend it to others that need a simple lighting solution","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197BDA8IX2G3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYHSP9I#wasThisHelpful","R197BDA8IX2G3I","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok this looked like a pretty  cool waterproof  bluetooth speaker........... I tried this to out pool side.. ( always an area i am fearful to take a bluetooth speaker ) but due to  its nice water proof property and solidly secured plug on the rear.. It was a no brainer to  take this little guy outside .......I know it is listed as one for the bath or shower but I seldom spend that much time there, so pool side or  beach side is where this little guy will get  testedFirst it has a nice little hanging handle...So when I took it to the beach.. I hung this on one of the rungs  of the umbrella's... so we had a nice spread of sound over both of us.... This allowed me to  safely secure my cell phone so no chance of an unexpected DUNK in the pool or a splash from the  waves...Set up for this little guy was Simple... follow the well written instruction and pair the music source to the speaker.. and  you ready to enjoy.This little guy does several useful things that I really, really like:When I am floating in our pool  my cell always RINGS.. no way am i busting out of the pool to answer a phone.. but w this little guy sitting poolside. I can FLOAT over to the side and hit the PHONE button and answer it without ever getting out of the water.!!,,My second favorite thing about this unit is I love to listen to audio books will FLOATING in the pool........and it works perfectly to READ to me....Nice clear spoken words.and then when I want to Spicy Music to do my water exercises .......... it is again easy to float over to the side..  switch UP the  sounds from Book to Music  and get my MUSIC to exercise too..Now I would call this unit a sport unit......... is has a nice LOUD volume  but the base is a little on the soft side but that is just find for me.. Again  the spoke word is PERFECT  for my audio books ... and clear sound for phone calls.  and music sound FINE.Now ,I have not tested it to the LIMIT but the written documentation that comes w this says it has a WHOPPING  25 HR  RUN TIME!! ( before recharging is needed ))Honestly, if it even comes close to 12 hours.. I will be thrilled......This one is a definite item going into the suitcase for my nx tripThis item was provided for review.Happy ...........oh yes.........

Once you understand how to set up the blue tooth on  your phone/camera  and pair it with stick.. you nearly DONE..One thing I like about this stick is  is folds nicely and easy to take along  when going out to a park or  picnic or some casual sporting event..One Nice thing that most forget is this can be used as a simple monopod ( similar to a tripod with only one leg).. This can stabilize your cell phone camera to get the best still shot or  videos...  as it really minimizes camera shake when you us it.It securely holds you  cell  so you can raise the stick into the AIR to get an over head shot.....or extend the stick to the  right or left to get beyond a crowd  of people ... One of the nice shots we were able to get was when we used it ground level to get s picture of a frog... close up and right in his face !!So it just expands what you can do with you photography when you use this stick...Well worth the money to  have this much FUN  and get some great photos as wellThis item was proved for a review but I bought 2 more  for  gifts after testing it out.Have FUN and get the MOST out of your cameras on your phones... get a Selfie Stick !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXHYBQ989M7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTZEI3A#wasThisHelpful","R1FXHYBQ989M7F","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item is not going to work for the majority of  people that would most need it,  positioning the magnifier is not easy or even possible if one is trying to use this for the feet. There is only a tiny magnet that  attached the magnifier to the clipper and it won't stay secured as it flips and flops all around.. You cannot position it to give a visual of the nail so you can safely use it without clipping the skin on the foot.This could be dangerous if the person is a diabetic .or has vascular issue of their lower extremities.I am glad I tried this out before giving it to an elderly family member..

Now that I think about it I am going to tuck this away in my suitcase on my nx trip. Always hard to find your way in the dark in a strange house or hotel roomHang it on a towel rack.....when you walk into the bathroom  TA DA.... the light flips on  and stays on long enough.you have the choice of  glow time from 30 seconds, 60 seconds or 90 seconds. The  6 lights are more then bright enough to clearly see in a darken closet or safely navigate  a strange bathroom or stairs.This product ws provided for fair reviewI will be sure to hang this in the guest bathroom when we have  visitors.Just to make them feel safer as wellI might need to get another one for  another closet  It is inexpensive but effective....and I like this darn LIGHT>","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IG2VU2TVWVTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRJSIH4#wasThisHelpful","R1IG2VU2TVWVTT","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect from  a carpet company  but Boy was I in for a Pleasant surprise with this bath rug.This is the NICEST bathroom rug I have ever had.......... super soft, woven very well, NOT STIFF  and with a really really good nonskid backing.And On top of that it is PRETTY.......I have bought so many bath rugs only to be disappointed over and over again.. They look pretty in the store or package but once out and on the floor, they are stiff and  difficult to manage, let along try to wash them.And of all the throw rugs you have in your home, the bathroom rug is one that really needs  washed regularly.The last one I bought looked so nice but the backing was terrible.. if even a sm amount of water got under it, you were slip-sliding all over the floor.That one ended up in the trash promto>>>>> NOT with this Stainmaster .. it is solid on the ground, and w one member of the family that walks w a cane, that is a really important feature. My only negative re this rug it that they don't have a complete bathroom set to purchase and they don't have a long 60' version to put in front of a double bathroom sink. I would be snatching that up ASAP........Otherwise  2 thumbs UP for this one.I am really impressed.. and will be looking for more Stainmaster carpets  Hopefully I will find more in the near futureVery very pleased with his bathroom Rug","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KGJK6TIGB10X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRWBJKC#wasThisHelpful","R2KGJK6TIGB10X","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 9/16/15: I am liking this unit more and more ........We took it on vacation... set up near our beach chairs and listen to beach music while floating on our  pool floats.. for HOURS and HOURS....... never skipped a beat.. perfect function and the battery was still going strong after nearly 6+ hours . Several other guests  commented on the pleasant sounds from it .. and asked for the name of the unit.. VERY HAPPY with this speaker.............................................Now this Ivation Acoustix Blue Tooth Speaker  is the unit I  have been looking for ...........  Can I say"" not too small  , not too large ........but just RIGHT.""........  the size is  sm rectangular box  w 2 retractable handles.. The  access ports are covered by a thick, cover to make the speaker water and dust safe.Several things makes this particular bluetooth speaker  SPECIAL for my use.1.)  the SOUND...........wow.. I wasn't expecting the WOW sounds that came out of this sm speaker..  Now my bench mark for speakers is my Bose Bluetooth.. and this Ivation speaker is on the same level only much less pricey. and w Extra's........I really didnt' expect to hear the full tones and base that came out of it.. I had a friend visiting and she was shocked.. she kept asking  "" was that sound really coming out of that little speaker ? ""  >> YES. it was ........... If I didn't' see the speaker I would never  had thought that a small footprint  unit, like this Ivation,  could produce that SOUND.2.) an Unexpected Treat.........this unit has a FM RADIO.......... now I wouldn't have expected that would have been a big thing but it is ......... what a nice Extra to be able to use the same unit for multiple functions..3.) speaker Phone....... my particular cell phone seems not to have the best voice capture so this function has been a particular bonus  for me.. I made a call last evening and was so nice to have this function available to use4.)  ahhhhhhhh listening to Audible  books.........one of my guilty pleasures when being outside.. I can read and  do some yard work or  float in the pool...... what a  nice, full  sound  of the voices of the  readers .came out of this machine.  Making  listening to audio books so much nicer.Now for me  living near the beach and Pool , the fact that this unit is Waterproof & Dustproof  is a HUGE  selling point........ And having a FM radio on this unit will be very nice as I prefer not to have my cell  phone or tablet near water or sand.This was super easy to pair via bluetooth......... but this unit also provides a Line IN port..  when you prefer to save you battery on your tablet or phone.It has a nice SOLID feel, .. (You can almost feel the quality of the product)... a non slick bottom so it won't slide around on the smooth surface.  and One of my personal favorites a VERY CLEAR and EASY TO READ.  LED screen to tell you what is going on.. i.e Bluetooth, FM radio and the station.  etc..So in a side by side  w my Bose Bluetooth this Ivation Acoustix speaker is  a  solid performer .with MORE options and  security.. I would NEVER take my Bose to the beach or pool side..........but with the security of this waterproof and dust proof unit( and the awesome Performance ) .. It will be my companion for fun in the Sun.  YIPPPPEEEI can't think of anything this speaker doesn't do to make my listening a treat..  and at this price point it is a real  DEAL.This unit was provided for a HONEST review. and that is what this is.........I won't provide anything but honest reviews.I have a  birthday event coming up and, am thinking  this will be the perfect gift for  her.....so need to order one for her.. I have to say I am more and more impressed with this little guy the more I have used it and it will be a welcome item to enjoy my tunes and my Audiobooks for a long time to come. I have several trips planned over the nx few months and this little guy will be easy to pack for my trips..Very pleased w this product....and Highly recommend it  if you want a  wonderful listening experience","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QRWBQNHM333G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ5TDLC#wasThisHelpful","R2QRWBQNHM333G","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was exactly what I was looking for only better.  I wanted  to use this in the bathroom to try to keep the  damp  items OFF  the  floor or in the hamper. This rack works exactly as planned. It fits easily over th door and give me ample room for  robes or  towels etc.Installation..............no brainer.. just hang it over the door.. and this item has  6 hooks which makes it a perfect fit for my use. With the non-slip hooks you can get a evenly spaced item.  And it is not overly  large, cumbersome  or Unsightly, as I have seen in other over the door hangers.  I should have know if Oxo  made it, it would be a good functional product  and they didn't miss the mark on this one either.  I am very pleased w this item and plan  to get another one for our 2nd bathroom and get those  towels and robes placed properly.Good Job Oxo.........

"I was very pleased to get this very nice blue tooth speaker in my hands Right out of the box it looks NICE and feel NICE too ..Several things about this unit makes it a winner for me-First it isn't a wimpy piece of plastic . It has a nice solid feel w some weight to it with a nice aluminium case. I come w a usb charging cable and Line in cord.-Second it has a very nice appearance. about the size of a small rectangle box w a cute grill on the front. The buttons to control the functions are easy access on top of the unit . Several of them perform multiple functions .PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. on how to control the volume, chg the stations and accept Phone calls-Third It has one item the most bluetooth speakers do not have.. a LINE IN port .. so if you want to use that vs sucking up your power on your cell phone you can direct line in with the INCLUDED LINE IN CORD ( yeah !!) I also tried this with audio books.. which was very very nice I like to listen to books on audible while doing house cleaning or kitchen chores. This speaker was clear and made the listening very pleasant .. I could even hear the voices very well over the sounds of meal prep-Forth Pairing was simple w voice cue's-Fifth ...........THE SOUND............Wow was I surprised.. I didn't' expect the nice clear, crisp sounds to come out of this little guy and produces some very nice bass. Now I have a Bose Bluetooth speaker and really this is very close in sound quality.. I played a variety types of music with it and was impressed w all of them..From soulful ballads, to hard rock , contemporary and classical ...........and what is most difficult instrumentals ( in my opinion ) all performed well with good base and clear sounds I can't stress that more .how. CLEAR a sound you get, not muddled or muddy sounds.-Sixth Volume...................WOW. it can really crank out some Sound........much better than most any blue tooth speaker I have used to date.-Seventh Battery life ........ well after playing i for about 7 hours .It still had JUICE.................. This was unexpected but much appreciated.I was provided the product and asked to provide an honest review.I have to say I am more and more impressed with this little guy the more I have used it and will be a welcome item to enjoy my tune and my Audiobooks for a long time to come i have several trips planned over the nx few months and this little guy will be easy to pack for my trips..

"This is just gorgeous Luggage.. and i have  never said that about LUGGAGE before!!!!!.And even though it is beautiful  it is so efficient.The tote is ample size to handle most one would need for a weekend.. w ample pockets on the outside and inside  and  it even hold down straps in side so things do not slip around... I love the  pocket on the  very bottom of the tote to use to separate wet items or dirty items from clean on the return leg of you trip...... Now the  luggage has those amazing spinner wheels I love them...... and w..  the option to expand the  suitcase, it makes this  carry on piece  especially nice for a  short week of travel.It too has some amazing hidden pockets to make it  efficient.

"WOW................ I love them..........love them Super Comfortable...... which is a difficult thing to achieve in ear buds. as well all know.The sound is great the FIT is comfortable... I would never guess these were not the $$$ priced model.... I am sooo pleased I can hardly contain my pleasure.set up was simple.. quick to charge and then easy to pair............ and then sweet sweet MUSIC........... I spent a better part of an afternoon with Mpow bluetooth ear buds while working..all the while listening to a audio book......what a treat.. got a ton of work completed and still got to finish my BOOK.I found them easy and comfortable to wear and use. I have had some high priced both wired and wireless models and eventually then ALL started to feel uncomfortable after a few hours of use....... but I have not found that to be the case with these Mpow's........ They don't seem to exert as much pressure on the ear canal and surrounding area .. but they do still give good sound and reduction in ambient sounds....... all this and Comfortable as well..I was provided this unit as a review item but plan on buying another set for a family member.. I am really delighted with this product.If there are any suggestion I would provide, it would be to the manufacture, is to EXPLAIN how to use the sm bag of additional ear bud modifiers... there is no explanation on how to add or when it would be better to use them or not... a simple one page in the instruction manual would work.. Otherwise many people will toss the bag or worse yet not know what to do w the items and return the product as they can't get it to stay comfortably in their ear... Please.. fix this ..Otherwise I am very happy Camper... and look forward to lots of hours of music and audiobooks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CF8QN4X0A0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWYKDOA#wasThisHelpful","R9CF8QN4X0A0M","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 7/10/15:  I have had this fan for several months and  it is  working exactly as expected.  It is super quiet, we have  it in our living room and  you can feel it but it never makes a sound to interfere w our video watching.  I love love love the remote..... Living in a very warm climate it is so nice to be able to adjust up and down as the evening progresses.. and room temperature changes..  Very Pleased w this fan.-----------------------------------------------------------well I do like all the options this fan offer........from the timer, speed adjustment and MOST Loved, THE remote.what I didnt' like was the assembly......I am not an overly technical person so for me I rely on the instruction.WHoaaa...  that wasn't much help but after struggling and w the aid a a school age child I was able to get this put together. Not because it was difficult but because the directions were poor..First it is a rather light weight product so this item is easy to move around or from room to roomNow  living in Florida I use fan's regularly in all rooms.. This fan will be nice to use in one of the our bedrooms to adjust the fan during the night  when we are just too darn lazy to get up and turn the fan DOWN.. Now we have a remote to take care of that .  ( SMILE !!)) After we got it together, I think we will be enjoying this as the Florida heat come on  I also was impressed  at the very low sound it makes, not like most fan's that sound like a sm jet engine  but it pushes the air around very well.I also like that this unit can be converted to a table top unit as well as a floor stand. unit.  I will use that when working in my kitchen as it can get mighty hot in there during the summer months.My only con is I wish this thing had come put together or at least MORE put together ... otherwise I am pretty darn pleased w this fan..I will be enjoying it  for manyyears  to come..","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CVY8VTX6KKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ1X82G#wasThisHelpful","R21CVY8VTX6KKO","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Inventiv Shower Speaker:  was a pleasant surprise. First didnt' realize I NEEDED  shower speaker.. but what I found out  .. was this is so nice to have in the bathroom to use while grooming,  or putting on makeup etc... I know this is advertised as a shower speaker and of course it will do that  but I just enjoy it as a  bathroom speaker.. This is much nicer than bring a cell phone in to the bath area.It comes w an over sized  suction pad.. that fits nicely. The whole unit is the size of  your palm.  After  charging it up, connect it to  your phone re  bluetooth and away you go>>>> Oh and you can take phone calls as well <<<<< again nice when you are in the bathroom, where I prefer not to take my phone for a variety of reasons.  One reason is  electronics  too close to WATER is not a smart idea.Now this isn't a Bose Speaker but a nice pleasant easy to use speaker with more than decent sound.  This would make a Nice gift and am sure any one that likes music would appreciate this  little speaker. I even used it in the kitchen stuck to the wall.... again so  my cell isn't anywhere near water  or flour  etc.  Easy to accept a call  when I am  busy and not have to go running to fine the cell phone.The item was provided as a review product....This item  has more function than just as a shower speaker... I am sure this can be enjoyed out side on the patio,  as wellHonestly this is  nicer than I expected..........and am happy to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TAPWQDYSUNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGDCBW4#wasThisHelpful","R29TAPWQDYSUNG","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love using  streaming videos for our entertainment,so was very pleased to try this Nexus Player...... I am a long time fan of Nexus products so was expecting  a WOW productWell ........ lets just say it is a work in progress...... and I now understand why they pulled it right after they released it a year or so ago......and Just released it this fall.  It has a sm flat footprint. round in design, that sits  near the TV... no real way to  conceal it... It has  2 inputs. One for  an HDMI cord and the 2nd for a standard USB.In the box is the round flat Nexus Player,,the size of a sm dessert plate.,,, a very simple remote and  2 batteries..... no instructions  nor HDMI cable.......After connecting to the WIFI in the house...  you need to connect to your own Google account...........  once completed.  up pops the  interface on  the screen...  The primary focus of the unit is Google movies, music..etc..... w a sm selection of alternative apps at this time.. i.e  Netflix,  Hulu Plus, Pandora... are examples. but the list is very limitedOnce you select a  app . it is very very speedy...much faster than any other streaming  units I currently own... i.e Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromcast.With no instructions .. is is sort of  a trial and error trying to figure out what works and what doesn't .. I went looking for an instruction tutorial  Appears adequate but I would have preferred a written instruction manual vs trying to find it on line..juggling reading it on a tablet and trying o do the set up.........seems a poor decision in my opinion.Now the remote is super simple..... w minimal function.  It appears all the focus is on the  microphone to allow voice search. with minimal function to the rest of it... I also was  unable to find any way to connect my Nexus tablet or such to the unit. even though it indicates some Casting ability..  but with no instruction.this ...again stymie  my actions.So now I need to do more searching to find out how to access that function......... again a simple instruction manual would have been a very welcomed addition.I am sure I will grow to love this player more and more over time but right now. it has limited access for my needs.. and as I stated before. It appears to be a work in progress. but I do trust Google and expect this to be a shiny example I would love in a few months.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VAQ5UPIFK41U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8U5A7W#wasThisHelpful","R2VAQ5UPIFK41U","A10AFVU66A79Y1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10AFVU66A79Y1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sm battery for the Battery in you cell phone. and In my opinion a absolute necessity if you travelI find these backup batteries to be a real comfort to me when I am out all day.. Always ready to give that extra boost to my rapidly draining cell phoneThe power charger is about the size of a sm handheld double flashlight.I comes w one  dual cord. one end is for a standard USB and the opposite end is  micro USBAfter opening package I promptly put it to charge as know they seldom come charged in the package.. The power cord is approx 10-12 inches  and I found once plugged in a multiple blue lights can be seen w the upper most one  blinking  Once fully charges all the blue lights disappear and are replace by RED lights.. After reading the instruction. it indicated a RED light would show when fully charged  .

No idea why. but just to be sure one is aware of this designIt promptly charged my cell with out any issue. which of course is why we would buy this product. harging from approx 30% to 100%  in approx 1 hr. It is light weight and easy to carry with you.I would have liked o see some sm cloth bag or such to carry both the charger ad power cords otherwise I have to devise something myself so they aren't flopping around on the bottom of my purse.My feeling is if you have a cell phone you NEED a back up power bank.. With this size battery I can get a full  charges out of it for my cell phone. but all phones vary.I like the unit and feel I will get some peace of mind carrying it with me on my travels.

"Update #2 we have now had this unit for 6 months and we are still delighted.. the subtle sounds in the back ground and sounds that are emitted  out of the sides of the unit.  may viewing a  great  movie even MORE  fun... so happy to have this  unit in our home.UPDATE: #2..3 weeks later......... and I am enjoying this speaker system more and more.. I was recently watching a movie and I swear it sounded like total surround sound system........ the squeaky door to my left.......... the sounds of dry leaves being stepped on.my right........ A door bell rang and I could have sworn it was MY DOOR BELL.............. The sounds that come out of this unit are wonderful !! I am so delighted to have this sound bar ............ makes watching movies and TV and real experience.#1 ..well it is now 2 days later after install and I am HAPPIER than ever..Just in case you are wondering as I was.. I have a Amazon FIRE stick installed in the back of my tv. My TV is also a SMART tv w lots of apps.. with the OPTICAL cable install directly into the tv.. every thing WORKS>>>>>>>.. and works WELL...... I am more tickled than ever.SO HAPPY with this SOUND BAR !!!.................................................................................................................................I have been wanting to get a sound bar to improve my Samsung TV viewing in the living room. I tried another brand sound bar, Vizio .. and was very disappointed and returned it. So I was pretty certain I knew what I wanted in a sound bar from that bad experience.I was thrilled to have the opportunity to use the NEW to me . Orbitsound M9  SOUND BAR....... ...First thing right out of the Box,  you will NOTICE  that this isn't some wimpy unit just  by the weight of the sub woofer. It has a main unit has a nice sleek looks that will fit nicely to the side or below a tv. It is more the size of a shoebox vs a long skinny sound bar I have in  our family room that takes  up the whole front of the TV Well I found this Obitsound bar is a great unit that does everything I wanted  and MORE.. it even includes a Blue tooth connection so I can stream music from my tablet or phone.SET up right out of the box( which is usually the nightmare process most purchasers dread ) was SOOOOOOOOOO EASY even if you hardly read the direction you would get it right.. It  includes an Optical cable.( the preferred method of connection) and optional cables if you don't' have a optical access to your TV.  So it is one simple connection between the bar and the TV........ plug in subwoofer to the  distant wall plug ... turn on the power.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Viola.. SOUND, sweet sweet SOUND>>>>>>>> and all the volume you could want. and Wonderful BASSThis set up was sooooooo nice as we have satellite TV and I was concerned that it wouldn't access  the unit. Now  I haven't found the way to control the sound using my satellite remote rather I need both the satellite and the Obitsound remote to manage my TV watching but it isn't a big deal.....Oh and the batteries were included in the REMOTE. .......Thank You.Now I tried out the various options adjustments to the treble and Bass using the REMOTE.......... EASY  and will get great ROOM FILLING EFFECTWell the PROOF is always in the performance.. well tuned into reg Network viewing which was nice and we  immediately noticed SOUNDS  that  weren't  evident w just using the TV speakers  i.e. squeaks of the door being opened  and  back grounds sounds...( like you hear in a reg Movie at the theater ).... but it wasn't until I turned on the FIRE TV and started playing some of the Trailers for the coming Movies. that the truly  Beautiful Sound came out of the Orbit......WOW.....  it nearly knocked me out with the quality of the SOUND....... let me tell you Frozen Never Sounded so GOOD.........!!!..Then turned on Les Miserable. Holy COW ! That HOOKED ME...

"I always liked this 1996 action film and I was glad to see recently that it didn't age - at all. It doesn't have any other pretensions than to entertain us but it accomplishes this mission very well indeed. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.An Oceanic Airlines (this is a fictional name) Flight 343, a Boeing 747-200, bound for Washington, D.C, with on board a U.S. Senator, Mavros (J.T. Walsh) and a smoking hot air attendant named Jean (Halle Berry) , is hijacked by islamic terrorists commanded by Nagi Hassan (David Suchet, amazing). Their official purpose is to obtain the liberation of El Sayeed Jaffa (Andreas Katsulas), recently captured leader of their organisation. However some in US intelligence community believe that Hassan has a completely different plan and wants something infinitely more lethal - it is certainly the case of the main expert on Jaffa-Hassan organization, dr Grant (Kurt Russell). On his advice a team of US Special Forces commanded by Colonel Travis (Steven Seagal) will be dispatched to deal with the situation - they will use a top-secret for that... And then the film really begins.This is a really, really good action thriller - and there is not so many of them. The scenario, although containing some rather impossible things, is not half bad - in fact this film, made in 1996, anticipated (in a way) some real terrorist attacks in the future...The main villain is ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING, in a calm, calculating, brilliant, eloquent, charmingly satanic way. In this film David Suchet proved once again that he is an amazing actor, who can play anything and everything - if he was asked to play a broccoli, I am certain other broccolis would welcome him as a long lost cousin...There is not so much action actually - don't expect dead bodies piling in the middle of ocean of blood and a cornucopia of shells - but there is definitely suspense. TONS OF IT! The suspense is well managed with the use of twists, most of them unexpected. That actually is not something easily done nowadays, considering the humungous number of action movies on the market - but in this film prepare to be surprised. A darn lot!Another good thing is that secondary characters received a lot of screen time and are actually very, very important to the plot. Four commandos who follow Colonel Travis have a lot to say and a lot to do in this film: Master Sergeant Carlos ""Rat"" Lopez (John Leguizamo), Sergeant First Class Campbell ""Cappy"" Matheny (Joe Morton), Sergeant First Class Louie Jung (B.D. Wong - surprisingly effective in an atypical role!) and Sergeant First Class Michael Baker (Whip Hubley). Another important character is Cahill (Oliver Platt), the engineer who designed the secret weapon commandos will use - this is one of this actor's finest hours.I appreciated also a lot that this time the president of USA is not involved - in his absence, the Secretary of State manages the crisis. Points for originality to ""Executive Decision"".Now this film has of course some quite amusing weaker points, like the fact that all the time everybody insists that USA don't negotiate with terrorists - when in the same time doing exactly that...))) Possibly the funniest thing is when one of peaople who manage the crisis, tells to a high ranking officer: ""You are an expert on attacking hijacked planes - you wrote a book on it""...))) I almost died laughing at that moment - because come on, what active service officer would be allowed to publish a book in which he gives away his trade secrets and instructs terrorists what mistakes they must not commit... There are other points which could be criticised, but I don't want to give away too much.That being said, because of all the good points which I mentioned above, ""Executive decision"" is much better than most of action films on the market - and for that reason I simply have to rate it five stars. It is a recommended viewing, still very entertaining even on the second viewing. I will totally keep the DVD.

"I liked this 2014 film about, telling a true war time story. The film is not perfect and maybe a little bit slow, but still it is a rather rare treat in modern cinema - a well told, uplifting tale fo true heroism and endurance. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This is the story of first part of life of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (1917-2014) beginning with his childhood as a young Italian-American boy in Torrance, California, continuing with his career of distance runner (he went to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin) and then going into the toughest part - the participation in Pacific War, which will be an ordeal...This is only the third film directed by Angelina Jolie and this lack of experience can be seen by moments as ""Unbroken"" is indeed a little bit slow and long. The scenario was written by Coen brothers but albeit good, it is less stellar than most of their works. That being said, I liked it. This is an interesting, uplifting story about a quite likeable fellow, who overcame all kind of problems, troubles and ordeals to make something out of himself - and that is a very welcome thing. I cannot however go too much into details, in order to avoid spoilers.The one thing that I really didn't like at all is that the film avoids to tell much about the crucial event in Zamperini's post-war life - his 1949 Christian conversion. From that moment to his death he was a devout born-again Christian and 65 years is a lot of time - the film however avoids going much into it... Well, knowing Hollywood's prevalent anti-Christian hatred it was only to be expected - but still, it is a disappointment...All this being said, this is a good, solid, thing - it could have been a better film, but I still liked it a lot. A recommended viewing.

"I liked this Osprey Campaign describing Marlborough's second major victory in Seven Years War. I was not familiar with this battle before and therefore I learned a lot from this book - even if of course I willingly admit that because of lack of space, it had to treat many elements superficially.The writing is clear and the events are described in good chronological order. The style makes the reading pleasant - even if in some moments it is easy to get lost in the number of names of unit commanders. The battle itself is well linked to the events which happened in earlier stages of the war and to those which followed - those latter being very serious and making 1706 indeed an 'annus mirabilis"" for the allies and a particularly bad moment for France.Maps are clear and illustrations are good. There are three quite good colour plates by Sean O'Brogain: first fight on allies left wing, the fight for the village of Ramillies and the final fight near Autre-Eglise. There are also four smaller two-colours plates, showing some dramatic episodes - including one which teaches us that even the greatest warlords must sometimes abandon dignity and just run like heck...)))The one little thing that annoyed me just a little bit was the extravagant praise of Marlborough every two pages or so. There is no doubt that he commanded splendidly during all 1706 campaign, that his plan of battle at Ramillies was a brilliant thing and that he won as result a splendid victory. But still that doesn't justify such an exaggerated, almost religious adoration, as author shows - especially considering that part of French army was made of second rate garrison troops...This is however a very minor point, which doesn't change one little bit my five stars rating. For a short and therefore necessarily superficial study of this battle, this book is simply as good as it can get. I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it with enthusiasm.

"I was pleased to see that this film didn't age at all, as I always liked a lot this ""haunted"" romantic comedy...))) I am very glad that I bought and watched it even if I already was familiar with the story, having seen this film long, long time ago... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERSIn the early 1900s, young widow Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney) moves to the seaside English village of Whitecliff. Having only limited funds she rents a splendid, but surprisingly cheap house, named Gull Cottage. The reason for the low rent is the reputation of this place - locals are convinced that it is being haunted by the ghost of the previous owner, a roguish sea captain named Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison), who supposedly committed suicide. Albeit slightly apprehensive, Mrs Muir moves in with her young daughter Anna (Natalie Wood) and her maid Martha (Edna Best) - and once she turns off the lights on the first night in the new place the film really begins and I will say nothing more about the story...Made in 1947, in the middle of Hollywood golden age, this is a very, very charming and entertaining romatic comedy, with a good scenario containing lots of wit, good dialogs, emotion, some drama (not much) and a little bit of sadness (not much). The film is absolutely NOT scary as the ghost, although somehow rude in its manners, is really a brave fellow... Rex Harrison is as great as always and Gene Tierney simply SHINES both by her beauty and her talent. Young Natalie Wood (she was nine at the time) in one of her first screen appearances adds a lot of charm to this film. Later in the film adult Anna is played by Vanessa Brown, a very charming young lady, for whom it was the first role ever. Edna Best, an actress who began her career in the 1920s in silent movies is excellent in the secondary but important role of Martha, the housekeeper.I like this film a lot. It is not any kind of immortal masterpiece, but a very nice, charming, heart warming, wity and pleasant thing to watch. I am absolutely keeping my DVD for another viewing.

"I liked this silent German 1926 film with young Leni Riefenstahl. Watching it was certainly an experience. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Karl (Luis Trenker) and Vigo (Ernst Petersen) are friends. Even if Karl,a respected engineer, is an adult man in his 30s and Vigo is young, barely out of his teens, their friendship is solid. They share a common passion of skiing and climbing and they are good at it. Then one day Karl, a very handsome man, meets the famous dancer Diotima (Leni Riefenstahl) and very quickly they fall in love. Vigo is unaware of it, therefore when one day he meets Diotima himself, he doesn't know that she is his friends lover... And then the film really begins.This movie is reputed to be one of the finest examples of ""bergfilme"" (mountain films), a genre of German cinema which was very popular in the 1920s. I admit that it is the only one I saw until now, so I cannot compare it with others, but it is a good, solid, well done thing. There is a good mixture of romance, friendship, dancing, mountain images (sometimes half-mystical) - and tragedy... All three main actors are very good - and Leni Riefenstahl, aged 24 at that time, for whom it was only the second role ever, simply SHINES...The film was, very deservedly, a great succes. As consequence Leni Riefenstahl appeared in at least four more ""bergfilme"" before becoming a director in 1932 and continuing her brilliant but controversial career as director and producer of Nazi propaganda films... She lived a long life and died in 2003, aged 101.WWI veteran Luis Trenker also continued a long and succesful career as actor and later also director until the 70s - he died in 1990, aged 97. On another hand young Ernst Petersen, for whom it was the first role ever, appeared only in three more films - he died in 1959.I liked this film. It has a lot of charm proper to those old silent black and white movies and the mastery of German post WWI school of acting and directing is visible in it in full. I am very glad that I bought and watched it and this DVD is DEFINITELY a keeper.

"I had high hopes for this book, but I was only partly satisfied. I was especially defavorably surprised by the less-than-stellar quality of writing, a certain lack of focus and quite poor colour plates. Below, more of my impressions.Let's begin with the strong points. Making an Osprey Campaign book about land battle for Leyte (20 October - 25 December 1944) was a GREAT idea, as it was an important fight, but which is relatively little known. This book describes the main points of the whole campaign comprehensively and in a rather clear way. Also, maps are good and pictures are honest.Amongst the things which I liked less the most important is the writing. This book gives the impression of having been written with utmost haste, at the double, without a second reading by the author and without any real editing later. Author keeps repeating things sentence after sentence and the whole writing style is clumsy. That makes the reading of this work much less pleasant that it should be.Author wasted some valuable space on the first 30 pages, describing things which had very little to do with the land campaign on Leyte in 1944, like the naval battle of Leyte or some events which took place in 1942. It was probably possible to save at least two pages there, which could be put to good use when describing the most dramatic battles, like those on Breakneck Ridge and Shoestring Ridge - those fights deserved to get a little bit more space than they were allotted.But possibly the worst thing are the three colour plates. It is a pity, because their subjects were well selected: attack of Japanese entrenched positions by Us infantry supported by a M7 Priest self-propelled howitzer, American amphibious attack against Balugo and Japanese paratroopers raid against San Pablo airfield. Sadly, the ""childish/impressionist"" style of Giuseppe Rava is a poor choice for battle scenes illustrations - it removes part of seriousness from the scene. Also, there is the problem of ""details be damned"" manner in those colour plates... I didn't like them at all and I hope I will not see any more Giuseppe Rava colour plates in Campaign series.Bottom line, this is a honest thing, useful and from which it is possible to learn a lot, but definitely not as good as it could (and should) be. I believe that there is a better alternative book: ""Leyte, 1944. The Soldiers' battle"" by Nathen Prefer. Much larger and costing more, it seems to be a much more complete and better written thing. Clayton Chun book is probably mostly recommened only to those who make a collection of Osprey books or those who want a shorter, less detailed history of this campaign.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKZW7ZVPBB57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472806905#wasThisHelpful","R1LKZW7ZVPBB57","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this highly original 2006 Chinese adaptation of ""Hamlet"", even if it has some flaws. I spend a rather pleasant moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.China, X century, the end of the Tang Dynasty. The Crown Prince, Wu Luan (Daniel Wu) and one of ladies of the imperial court, Little Wan (Zhang Ziyi) are in love - but the Emperor, after seeing Little Wan, takes her as his Empress and orders Wu Luan to marry another woman, lady Qing Nu (Zhou Xun). Wu Luan, deeply hurt, refuses and goes in voluntary exile in the province to devote himself to study music and dance - his extravagant behaviour makes that some people believe that he went insane with grief. Soon after, the Emperor is murdered - many believe that the killer was his brother Li (Ge You), who became the new Emperor. The new Emperor retains Little Wan as his Empress and recalls the Crown Prince from the exile. Soon factions form in the court, one supporting the new Emperor, the other the Crown Prince who is expected to seek revenge for the murder of his father. His return is especially expected by Lady Qing Nu, who, albeit not wanted by Wu Luan, is very much in love with him... And then the film really begins...From the first minutes of the film it is obvious, that this is NOT exactly the story of ""Hamlet"", as there are important modifications. Hamlet's mother was replaced by a younger woman, whom he was in love with. The stealing of the bride of the Crown Prince by his older father is in fact an echo of one such very famous incident in Chinese history, when in 738 emperor Xuanzong took from one of his sons his young wife, the archi-famous Yang Guifei. The relationship between Wu Luan and Qing Nu is somehow different than the one between Hamlet and Ophelia. Wu Luan is somehow more assertive and less hesitating than Hamlet. Many elements are added, like court intrigues, fights, escapes and elaborate assassination attempts. Last but not least, the final fate of Wu Luan's evil uncle, Emperor Li, is very different from the one in ""Hamlet"" - and honestly, that was actually for me the weakest thing in the whole film. On another hand, the ending is in its general lines very Shakespearian...It seems unavoidable that idiotic kung fu and other surrealistic fights must be introduced in almost every Chinese production - in this film martial arts are present, but thanks God not as much as I feared... Visually this film is splendid, actors play very well and Zhang Ziyi is incredibly beautiful.In Europe this film was released under the much more appropriate title ""The banquet"" - the title adopted for USA is really not very good, as it suggests some kind of martial arts B movie. Which is definitely not the case...Although not really a masterpiece, this is a good, original, very entertaining film. I am very glad that I bought and watched it and I think I will keep the DVD for another viewing.

"I finally discovered this old classic, and I liked it much more than I expected. It aged a little, but it still remains a darn good film! Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.The film begins somewhere around 1910, with a company of French Foreign Legion approaching an isolated fort in the middle of Sahara desert. They come to assist the garrison, besieged by bellicose nomads - but the siege appears to have ended, as there is no more fighting. But once the fort is reached the commanding officer discovers a puzzling mystery... Then, we move 15 years back, to England, in the end of XIX century, where we meet three young boys, orphaned brothers Geste: Michael, John and Digby. Michael is the oldest, the most clever, the fiercest and even at this tender age already stunningly handsome - everybody calls him ""Beau"". They are raised by Lady Brandon, a kind hearted woman whose husband is absent and very busy spending whatever is left of the family fortune. One of the few things left, other than the heavily mortgaged lands and mansion, is a legendary jewel, ""Blue Water"" sapphire, greatly desired by many... And then the film really begins.Adapted from a very popular novel written in 1924, this is the story of mystery, great hardships, great tragedies, brotherly love - but above everything else one very, very noble sacrifce, a beautiful gesture indeed - ""beau geste"" means precisely that in French. I liked the story a lot.Michael, played by Gary Cooper, is of course the main character and the main positive hero, but this film wouldn't be half as good without two other characters. The mightiest and the most fascinating is Sergeant Markoff, played incredibly by Brian Donlevy, who was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Markoff is one of the most incredible soldiers I ever saw on screen. He is portrayed as a villain but in fact we must wait a very, very long time in the film before we see him committing something really villainous - on another hand he is an AMAZING war time leader! He is assisted by a clearly despicable villainous sidekick, Rasinoff - played incredibly by J. Carrol Naish. Markoff calls Rasinoff ""human jackal"" and it is the best description of this man, but still, he has his own story to tell. The complexity of those two ""bad guys"" makes this film much more interesting than one could expect.I am absolutely certain that this film inspired parts of Paul Verhoeven ""Starship Troopers"". The siege of the desert fort on planet ""P"" and the character of Lt. Jean Raschak are so much similar in general lines to the siege of the fort by desert nomads and to some extent to that of Markoff that it simply cannot be a coincidence. There even is a tower in the desert fort which is a place for the ""forlorn hope"" soldiers, exactly like those two guys manning the heavy machine guns on the tower during the siege of the outpost on the planet ""P"". This feeling of familiarity certainly helped me enjoy this film.The scenario is solid, good guys are good, villains are FASCINATING, the main battle is amazing and the final revelation of the sense of the whole mystery is very moving. Also, once you watched this film, you will be able to appreciate much better the ""Last remake of Beau Geste"" a comedy made in the 70s with Michael York and Marty Feldman, which is in itself a good watch, but once you know the real ""Beau Geste"", well, it becomes irresistible.I am very glad that I watched this film and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing.

"I liked this 1960 war film describing one of most dramatic WWII naval battles, even if it has some flaws. I spend a good moment watching it and I am very glad I bought it. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.The film begins when in 1941 the newly arrived chief of naval operations of Admiralty, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), receives the task of coordination of operations against German battleship ""Bismarck"", which is expected to make a sortie against allied shipping in the Atlantic. It is expected that German raid will be commanded by admiral Lutjens (Karel Å tÄ›pÃ¡nek), with whom Shepard has some previous history. Shepard will be assisted by a Wren (woman auxilliary), 2nd Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). The battle will take a particular significance for him as his only son will quite certainly fly in operations against ""Bismarck""...The film is well done and shows quite well the whole campaign. There is a lot of tension and drama, but also some occasionally some humour. The main characters are quite likeable. Dana Wynter is at her most beautiful - she very literally SHINES! There is also a killer punch line!Fighting scenes are quite well show, even if the ships are actually maquettes. On another hand a lot of scenes which occur on ""Bismarck"", ""Hood"", ""Prince of Wales"", ""Rodney"" and ""King George V"" were filmed on HMS ""Vanguard"", the last British battleship which still existed in 1960 - that actually gives this film a feeling of realism.The film has however some flaws. The worse is in the portrayal of Lutjhens. German admiral is portrayed not only as a fanatical Nazi but also as a kind of rather incompetent madman - which is wrong on both counts. That in itself hurts this film enough to take away one star. Also SPOILER HERE in the film ""Bismarck"" destroys not only HMS ""Hood"" but also another allied ship trailing him, which of course didn't take place...Still, even with those flaws, this is a good, solid, honest war film, which I enjoyed a lot.

"This is a very well written, clear and comprehensive account of this famous fight and infamous atrocity. Some minor remarks notwithstanding, I really liked this book, I learned a lot from it and I am glad that I bought it.This book describes the chain of events which led to TWO sieges by French army and its numerous Indian allies of Fort William Henry, on the shore of Lake George. Both sieges took place in 1757, but the book goes deeper in the past, all the way to 1755, when the events were set in motion.The description of events is very clear, with each next step linked to the previous and the following ones. Author clearly knows the topic, but, even if this book is quite comprehensive, details were kept under strict control. There is no blurring of general picture by trivia, like for example in ""Point Pleasant 1774"". Ian Castle definitely knows how to write.Maps are very good and illustrations are lovely. There are FOUR colour plates (thank you Osprey!) by Graham Turner and three of them are very good - they show the battle of Lake George in 1755, a scene of night fight from the first siege of Fort William Henry and a scene of artillery duel from the second siege of the fort. The last plate shows the atrocities committed by Indians against the British soldiers evacuating the fort - this plate, which incidentally figures also on the cover of the book, is a little bit less good. I am not saying here that I would like to see the details of the whole thing (I wouldn't want that!) but this scene definitely lacks dynamics and sense of terror which prevailed during the massacre...The one thing which I liked a little bit less, was the tinkering around the question of the massacre, on the page 90. Author certainly was right trying to get to the bottom of things, as this event was so heavily ""interpreted"" by James Fenimore Cooper and Hollywood, but by just quoting various estimates, as well as putting the word ""massacre"" between quotation marks, he managed just to muddle things. For my personal understanding of things, Indians DID commit a horrible atrocity on 10 August 1757 against British soldiers and civilians - trying to relativise it was really uncalled for...That being said, this is a minor point. This book is excellent, I enjoyed reading it mightily and I recommend it with enthusiasm.

"I liked this old classic about nuclear war and its aftermath. Written in 1959 it aged a little, but still is a GREAT read. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Randy Bragg lives in the small Central Florida town of Fort Repose. He is not a very successful guy, in fact he is mostly content with eating his inheritance... One day however his much more formidable brother, Colonel Mark Bragg, USAF, sends him a telegraph ending in the words, ""Alas, Babylon"", a pre-established code between the brothers warning of impending disaster. It appears quickly, that this disaster is a HUGE one...This was one of the very first novels to describe the occurence and the consequences of an all-out nuclear war. The much darker and much more pesimist ""On the beach"" was published two years earlier and the equally dark and pesimistic ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" was published in 1960. ""Alas Babylone"", a much more realistic thing than those other two classics, made quite a splash when it was published. Unlike so many others, the author, whose real name was Harry Hart Frank, knew what he was writing about. He served in military during WWII and watched Korean War as journalist, he studied a lot about the nuclear weapons and it shows in this book.The novel deals less with the nuclear war itself, than with what happens next. There are, quite obviously, survivors, in fact quite a lot of them, but the organised society as we know it initially collapses - the description of this process is quite fascinating. Then, as always, people regroup and re-organise themselves, facing challenges and solving problems. This is an uphill battle, but life always ultimately triumphs over death...Author very wisely states in this book, that it is not the strength of American nuclear arsenal that is the problem - it is the weakness of USA that causes Soviet union to attack, as Moscow believes it can win a nuclear war. It is a very important point showed in this book: in some circumstances a nuclear war CAN be won - it becomes only imposible if BOTH sides have enough primary and back-up fire power to always fully incinerate the enemy, no matter how total the initial surprise and how big the first-strike damage. On another hand, one thing totally absent here is the ""nuclear winter"", and a mighty good thing too, as it is a total nonsense...This book can be also read as a kinf of post-apocalyptic SF, albeit slightly more optimistic than most of such works. Left-winged people and peaceniks will almost certainly hate this book - which is another point in its favour...I don't want to provide spoilers here so I will keep this review short. This is an important book, still a good read and a thing that makes one think, in fact think a lot. I am glad that I bought and read it.

"I rather liked this 1971 adaptation of one of the best books by Alistair MacLean, even if it is DEFINITELY inferior to the novel. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.WARNING: this is a Region 2 PAL DVD. It will not play on standard US Region 1 NTSC equipment.The film begins mostly like the novel. In a dark night an unknown man in diving suit climbs onboard an unknown ship and clearly looks for something - he will find dead bodies and trouble. We will later learn that his name is Philip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) and he works for British government. He and his colleague Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) are on a mission in a remote, quite poor and rough part of Scotland. Posing as marine biologists and operating from a small but fast yacht they are after a gang of particularly nasty, extremely well organised and terminally ruthless characters, who are stealing government money - a LOT of it. The bad guys play for keeps, they play hard, they play dirty, they kill easily, they make few mistakes and especially they HIDE REALLY, REALLY WELL. I will not go here in details to avoid spoilers, but the bad guys in this film are a real piece of work and for once in action thrillers they are actually not totally stupid. I will say no more about the story.I always liked Alistair MacLean books a lot. For my personal taste ""Fear is the key"" is his absolute masterpiece and I count it as one of my most favourite thriller books. ""Night without end"", an absolutely amazing book, is almost as good. Of course everybody knows his WWII bestsellers ""Guns of Navarone"" and ""Where eagles dare"", if only by cinema adaptations. I also always liked ""Puppet on the chain"", possibly the most brutal and cruel of his books.""When eight bells toll"" is also an excellent read - in fact I rate it as number 3 of MacLean's books, immediately after ""Fear is the key"" and ""Night without end"". I would actually advise to read the book BEFORE watching the film because the novel is better and also, because without reading the book you might be a little bit confused by the plot...In the film changes were made, which were not entirely successful. The main female character, Charlotte Skouras (Natalie Delon) is quite different here, definitely younger and more sexy and playing a very different game than in the book. The ending is also quite different and frankly, the last five minutes don't make much sense. One of the main villains, the infamous sadistic ""like to kill in most personal way"" Quinn (Oliver Mac Greevy), albeit still very menacing on the screen, is nevertheless only a shadow of the bone-freezing terror he was in the book (in the novel Calvert was actually TERRIFIED even when looking at this man). Unlike in the book, Hunslett is a kind of light-weight. Finally, the secondary female character Sue Kirkside was made much too tame - in the book she was much more assertive and nastier (albeit cute).On another hand anthony Hopkins played Calvert exactly as I always imagined him. Calvert's boss, ""Uncle"" Arthur (Robert Morley), is a delight, exactly as in the novel. Severe beauty of Scottish seashore is a major asset. Finally, we can see here Ferdy Mayne, who for me will be forever Count von Krolock from ""Fearless Vampire Killers"", playing Lavorski, a seriously dangerous villain (it is hardly a spoiler - one look at Lavorski and you will immediately realise that this is ZE BAD GUY). Finally, action scenes are so delightfully late 60s, reminding of early 007 movies.If it remained closer to the book this could have been a better film but it is still a quite watchable thing. A recommended viewing for all Alistair Maclean's afficionados, but probably mostly for them - or, should I rather say, us...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QCEKSB5IE70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001P1B3O#wasThisHelpful","R36QCEKSB5IE70","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked a lot this film, I spend a good moment watching it and I might buy it on Blu-ray when it is available. My teen age daughter liked it too. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This film tells the true story. In 1996 a violent storm surprised numerous climbers who were returning from the summit of Everest. Some of the the climbers like Rob Hall and Yasuko Namba (the only woman) were veterans (Hall was already on the summit of Everest five times!) and some others were less experienced. Ultimately some people didn't make it...I never climbed in high mountains and I was only vaguely familiar with the true story before seeing this film. It might have helped me enjoy it, as I couldn't find any major flaws in the plot and was oblivious to discrepancies with reality. Still, even taking this into account, I think that the director did a great job with ""Everest"". The mountains are amazing. Actors did a great job. The storm is IMPRESSIVE! There is a great lot of very intense, dramatic and touching moments. There was some good humor. There are twists and surprises (as I said, I wasn't very familiar with the true story). There is a sequence involving a helicopter which simply swiped me off my feet - and it was actually showing a TRUE thing! To say long things short, this film, albeit very tragic, really delighted me.I will keep this review deliberately short to avoid spoilers. I recommend to see this film in theaters as long as it still plays - it is certainly a good, strong cinema moment. I liked it a lot and I will quite probably buy it when it is available on Blu-ray, to have the best available quality of image.

"This film mostly didn't work for me. When I watch a superhero movie I expect action, humour, babes (OK, at least one) and of course a colourful, cool evil villain as well as some despicable evil sidekicks, disposable evil henchmen and extravagant evil weapons, vehicles or lairs. The superhero himself is finally not all that important. Here, most of those necessary elements were MIA.1. Action. There is some, but it is totally forgettable.2. Humour. There is some, but not nearly enough. This movie actually tries even to take itself seriously - which is a major mistake3. Babes. Two, but one just makes a cameo. The other one is acceptable - but wears too much clothes.4. Villain. The biggest disappointment of the film. Red Skull is amongst the collest comic books villains EVER - here, he appears late, does little and is disposed off quickly and easily. Poor Red Skull...5. Despicable evil sidekick. Actually, not bad. Despicable dr Arnim Zola is one of the few strong points of this film.6. Disposable henchmen. They are indeed disposable - a little bit too much disposable...7. Extravagant weapons, vehicles and/or lairs. Meh... Not terrific.Ultimately, for my personal taste, it is mostly a failed film, the weakest of Marvel movies. I enjoyed ""Avengers"" (the first one), ""The winter soldier"", ""The guardians of the Galaxy"", both ""Thors"" (or should I rather say ""both Loki's"") and ""Ant Man"" much more. To be watched for a better understanding of what happens in ""Avengers"" and ""The winter soldier"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EV88ITP8BGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5I2MEK#wasThisHelpful","R32EV88ITP8BGM","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen a lot of sh**ty films in my life - but few can match this one! I very litterally suffered viewing it and I HATE myself for having watched this... this... thingy until the last minute. Below, more of my impressions (but not much, because I just want to forget it), with very limited SPOILERS.Evelyn Salt is a CIA operative, once active in operations abroad but nowadays mostly working in the office. She is very appreciated by her superior Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and happily married to a German enthomologist Mike Krause (August Diehl), who is well aware of the nature of her work. One day, Salt is given the task to debrief a Russian defector, Oleg Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) - then all hell breaks lose and the film really begins.For me this thing died after less than 10 minutes, during the interview of Oleg Orlov, as the story becomes at that moment so immensely ludicrous that it cannot even be considered a comedy. From that moment on, things get just more and more nonsensical until the mind blowing absurdity of the ""great"" finale. In the first half I was wondering why this film removed the top of my skull and keeps taking a dump inside - in the second half I understood that it was a safety procedure, because it was the only thing that kept my brain from exploding... I honestly think I have NEVER seen such nonsense in my life!The nonsensical plot could be forgiven if at least there was anything else in this film - but there isn't. This is basically 100 minutes of stunts and action scenes, each one more over the top than the previous one, which in principle should be impressive - but as the main hero is invulnerable, indestructible, unstoppable, fire-proof, bullet -proof, water-proof (yes, that too), faster than light, stronger than Hulk, knows everything, speaks all the languages, read minds, etc. etc. it gets quickly boring. It is made even worse by main hero opponents - they are all completely incompetent slow targets, never offering any credible threat, making stupid things, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, understanding nothing, unable to shoot, unable to fight, unable to drive, etc... Picture a ""shooting fishes in the barrel"" Chuck Norris movie, just without the tongue-in-cheek parodic undertone of those MIA films - and you will get the picture.There is almost no dialogs in this film, just shooting, running, jumping and explosions. There is no humour or second degree - this MOUNTAIN OF NONSENSE actually tries to pretend to be a serious film... The ending is... well, here I have a problem. I run out of negative adjectives and out of capital characters and out of insults... So I will just stop here and will not even mention the ending, for fear of throwing up.I hated every second of this film and I just praise the Lord that I rented it instead of buying.

"I liked a lot this 1944 drama, which I never even heard of until recently. It is a long film, but I enjoyed every single minute of it. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.It begins in 1914. Fanny Trellis (Bette Davis) is a popular girl, considered a beauty, with many suitors. She and her brother Trippy (Richard Waring) went through most of their inheritance and albeit not poor, are not exactly rich any more. Things are made worse by Trippy's immaturity, lack of responsibility and sense of entitlement and quite early in the film Fanny decides to seduce a rich Jewish stockbroker, Job Skeffington (Claude Rains), to be able to sustain her lifestyle - and also pay off various (and numerous) Trippy's debts. This film is the story of this long and troubled relationship.This is a serious drama, with quite a lot of heartbreak and tragedy, but it also contains considerable humour and a lot of witty dialogs. Human beings are studied in detail and they are shown with frank honesty, but also with understanding. Tough businessman Skeffington is also largely helpless in the hands of a vixeny, unscrupulous and even a little sadistic woman. Trippy is mostly a waste of oxygene - but in most charming, seductive way... There are also other, secondary characters, quite well shown, but I will not say much about them - you deserve to discover them by youself.The most important character in the film is, against what we could expect from the title, Fanny herself. She is a mixture of brilliant intelligence and mind-numbing stupidity, she is superficial, selfish, spoiled, immature and as vain as Satan himself. Still, because of her personality and (according to the scenario) also her looks she is irresistible - and she will remain such for a long, long time. This is not a pleasant character - but definitely a fascinating one.As I said, I liked this film a lot and I am very glad that I discovered it. One thing however bothered me - according to the story, Fanny is a great beauty, in fact a fascinating, irresistible one. Well, in my personal, purely objective perception, Bette Davis was not beautiful. She was a great actress, she was a very intelligent woman, she had megatons of personality, there was not even one ounce of common or plain in her, she was not ugly (far from it) and there was something rather fascinating about her (the French would say ""elle avait du chien"") - but beautiful she was NOT. She was not the first choice for the role of Fanny - but Merle Oberon and Hedy Lamarr, both amazingly beautiful wome, turned it down, scared probably by the villainous undertones of the character. Only then Bette Davis was selected, as it was known since ""Jezebel"" that she was not afraid of any role. Still, she was probably not the best choice and that for me is the one and only one false note in an otherwise amazingly good film.This one thing notwithstanding, this is a very, very good, profound and tense drama. I liked it a lot, I am very happy that I bought the DVD and it is definitely a keeper.

"I was mostly disappointed by this 2003 collection, definitely less satisfying than the previous ones. Reading it was mostly not fun at all. It is inferior to Gardner Dozois anthology from the same year. Most stories are very predictable, poorly written or without ending. Most writers seem to chase actuality (9/11, Iraq war) rather than looking into the future. Only four stories are really worth to be read â€“ the rest, if you skip it, will not be missed. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.-----------------------------------""Amnesty"" by Octavia E. Butler â€“ Earth was invaded by nearly indestructible and extremely alien Communities; a woman who has a long (and very tragic) history of living amongst aliens meets some people willing to work for them. Even if I didn't like the immensely stupid (and false) clichÃ© about US government routinely abducting, detaining and torturing its own citizens, but other than that this is a GOOD, solid, honest thing. One precision here: in the introduction it is signalled that this is a sequel of the very classical ""Blood child"" â€“ that is absolutely NOT true, this story is definitely not related in any way to this shocking and ground breaking masterpiece!""Birth days"" by Geoff Ryman â€“ a story about pregnant homosexual men carrying foetuses in the overstretched colons and oversized anusesâ€¦ It totally GROSSED ME OUT! AVOID! (GD)""The waters of Meribah"" by Tony Ballantyne â€“ Universe collapsed and people are living in a tight place, where incredibly weird laws are in force and grotesque experiments on humans are routine, like transforming a man in an alien creature â€“ invented by the scientists. Many modern SF writers believe that if the pile one nonsense on another, they will get some kind of masterpiece â€“ well, no, the result is just a pile of nonsenseâ€¦ AVOID!""Ej-Es"" by Nancy Kress â€“ for once Nancy Kress couldn't write a story explaining why all the evil in the world is the fault of US government and Republican party, because here we go on a distant planet in a distant future to try to solve a case mixing medicine, ethics and philosophy. Nancy Kress knows how to write but I totally hate her politics (she is a very left winged gal). Therefore it is a high praise coming from me when I state that this is a VERY GOOD STORY, THE BEST IN THIS COLLECTION, even if I didn't like the author taking a big stinking dump on the religion (all of them in fact). (GD)""Four short novels"" by Joe Haldeman â€“ a mostly humorous attempt to analyse four various ways in which humanity achieves immortality; a READABLE, witty thing""Rogue farm"" by Charles Stross â€“ in rural England completely ravaged by scientific progress a couple of farmers face unexpected trouble; a well written GOOD story, but quite depressing... (GD)""The violet's embryos"" by AngÃ©lica Gorodischer â€“ a rescue mission comes to find the survivors of the crash of a starship on a very hostile planet; it turns out the survivors live more comfortably than anyone could expect, thanks to a local entity, which grants wishesâ€¦ As there is no women on the planet, the whole survivor society is homosexualâ€¦ This story could be much better if only the writing style was not so darn pretentious and freakishly weird â€“ still a READABLE thing, if only barely.""Coyote at the end of history"" by Michael Swanwick â€“ a collection of mostly humoristic short stories about Coyote, the Trickster from American Indian lore, who must deal with visitors from outer spaceâ€¦ A READABLE, thing.""In fading suns and dying moons"" by John Varley â€“ aliens who created Earth and seeded it with life, come back to harvest what their leader desiresâ€¦ This is an amusing end of the world story and a GOOD read. Just one small remark â€“ even during an alien invasion I really don't see US Army tolerating officers taking service when drunk or soldiers routinely disobeying orders by opening all the time fire without any consideration for engagement rules and even worse, goofing around dangerous aliens and teasing them without any reason. And of course, if there is a crucially important mission in time of an alien invasion and you have all the resources of USA at your disposition, you just send in a National Guard lieutenant without experience and with a drinking problem. Come on Mr Varley, that is just plain sillyâ€¦""Castaway"" by Gene Wolfe â€“ a man stranded on a hostile planet is rescued after twenty seven years â€“ he keeps talking about a strange entity he met during this timeâ€¦ Weird, pretentious and boring, this story is an absolute fail â€“ thanks God, it is a short one. AVOID.""The hydrogen wall"" by Gregory Benford â€“ in the future, messages from numerous alien civilizations, in form of downloadable AIs, were received. A young woman gets assigned to have conversations with one of the most mysterious of those AIs, the Sagittarius Architecture. Many things in this story were extremely weird, others were quite ridiculous, but still, it is a READABLE thing.""The day we went through the Transition"" by Ricard de la Casa and Pedro Jorge Romero â€“ translated from Spanish this is the story about a temporal police, fighting against the abuse of time travel; the idea is not new (Poul Anderson was there already in 1955) but its treatment is original; if you are not familiar with recent history of Spain, read a little bit about Santiago Carrillo, admiral Carrero Blanco and king Juan Carlos â€“ it will help to understand this quite GOOD story.""Nimby and the dimension hoppers"" by Cory Doctorow â€“ in the future, in a community of people living in accordance of ""developed biological technology/no machinery"" rules, start to appear intruders from very high technology future. It leads to a conflict, which could be interesting â€“ but quickly becomes messy and rather idiotic. It bored me down finally. I rate it READABLE â€“ but barely.""Night of time"" by Robert Reed â€“ another of Reed's stories about the Jupiter-sized space-ship travelling through the Galaxy; this time a human specialist in memory recovery is contacted by an alien customer who forgot something, but he cannot remember what...))) A READABLE thing. (GD)""A night on the Barbary Coast"" by Kage Baker â€“ one of the Company cycle stories about immortal time travelling agents; two such agents, who have a strained relationship, look for a gold miner in California in 1850; it will prove to be a really tough assignmentâ€¦ Very well written, full of humour and wit, this is a solid, honest GOOD story.""Annuity Clinic"" by Nigel Brown â€“ in a near future old people living in low-grade nursing homes are forced to sell their high tech artificial body parts to pay their rent and foodâ€¦ This is the story of an old woman who is waiting for the removal of her artificial eyeâ€¦ Quite depressing but still, a READABLE thing.""The madwoman of Shuttlefield"" by Allen M. Steele â€“ in a distant future a woman, who used to be a successful composer, emigrates to another planet, where life is very, very hard for the beginners. There she meets a reclusive, not entirely stable woman. This story follows on a novel and is in itself the introduction of further works â€“ therefore it doesn't have a real beginning and neither does it have a real ending. That makes it into a READABLE but rather pointless thing, if you don't intend to read the rest of the cycle.""Bread and bombs"" by M. Rickert â€“ once there was a war and now refugees from one country come live on the territory of their former enemies. It creates tensions. This is a very boring, pretentious, predictable and ultimately stupid thing, just another one in a seemingly unending flow of stories on the topic ""immigration is good, those who oppose it are racists â€“ except if they are not white, then they are right to defend their land"". AVOID!""The great game"" by Stephen Baxter â€“ this one is part of Xelee cycle and was clearly inspired by Iraq war; a bunch of warmongering admirals try to find a pretext to start a galactic scale war for the sake of war, without any other reasonâ€¦ Predictable and as stupid as humanly possible. AVOID!""The Albertine Notes"" by Rick Moody â€“ after a terrorist attack destroyed Manhattan, people started to use massively a ned drug, the Albertine, which allows to relive past experiences and also live thing which will only happen in the futureâ€¦ Later, it turns out this drug is even more powerfulâ€¦ This is a long novella, very densely written (few dialogs, very long paragraphs), narrated in first person. There was a good story somewhere in it, but it was mercilessly drowned under a pretentious logorrhoea and crushed under a nonsensical plot. Also, author clearly has no idea what a ""dirty bomb"" is â€“ ten seconds of research on internet would help here. This thing tired me and ten pages before the end I gave up. For me this is FAILED STORY. Try it at your own risk.-------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION: This anthology is a disappointment. If you can find ""Ej-Es"", ""Amnesty"", ""In fading suns and dying moons"" and ""A night on the Barbary Coast"" somewhere else, you can easily skip this collection without losing much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWSRHACN0FAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006057559X#wasThisHelpful","R3TWSRHACN0FAW","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a horible, nonsensical, boring mess! I couldn't believe my eyes! I didn't even manage to finish this film - after 90 minutes, with 20 more minutes to go, I gave up, because I didn't care anymore how it will end, I just wanted this ordeal to be over. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Erik Heller (Eric Bana) lives somewhere in the wilderness in a log cabin in northern Finland with his 15-year old daughter Hanna (Saoirse Ronan). They live a tough life, surviving in large part on the hunted game, never seeing anyone else. Erik trained his daughter in survival, hunting, shooting, martial arts and taught her also numerous languages, in order to prepare her for an unavoidable confrontation with Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a woman who has some mysterious link with Hanna and Erik. One day Hanna declares that she is ready... And then the film really begins.The beginning and the general idea seemed very promising - but ten minutes into the film, things TOTALLY unravel and the story never recovers. nothing in this film makes the SLIGHTEST SENSE! That in itself wouldn't be too serious, as after all most action movies have nonsensical scenarios - but here things are made worse by the pervasive sense of boredom instilled by:- total predictability,- going-through-the-motions we-saw-it-all-a-thousand-times-before action scenes- lame, morbidly incompetent and incredibly weird villains (SPOILER: the main villain's sidekick is a homosexual owner of a transvestite strip club, who makes his evil work in underwear...)- main character not being allowed to act, as Hanna is half-autistic- dialogs in form of irrelevant, out-of-line, illogical non-sequiturs- secondary characters so freakishly insane that they all seem to suffer from Asperger syndrom- etc., etc.I should have known what to expect. The director of ""Hanna"" began his career by butchering the one story that I always thought couldn't be messed up - ""Pride and Prejudice"", the horrible, horrible, horrible 2005 version with Keira Knghtley. I also saw ""Pan"" trailer before watching ""Hanna"" and I immediately decided to NOT see this film. But I took a chance with this film, because of my admiration for Sairse Ronan, who is amongst the most impressive young actresses actually in the business. She impressed me in ""City of Ember"", ""The way back"" and ""The host"" and she even performed very well in the rather less successful ""Byzantium"". Here, even her unconventional beauty and great talent can't save this failed film - but still, her presence in itself is reason enough to give ""Hanna"" a second star.This is a very, very bad film, wasting horribly the talent of three good actors. I regret that I watched the 90 minutes of it - it was still 90 minutes too much. Thanks God I only rented it instead of buying.

"I was very impressed by this South Korean 2006 monster film. It is a refreshingly original, clever and well done thing. I spend a really good moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In year 2000 an American military pathologist orders his less than enthusiastic Korean subaltern to dump a large stock of toxic chemicals into the river Han, which flows through Seoul. Six years later the consequence of this act emerges from water and starts eating people... A not very successful family, the Parks, is terribly affected by the first attack - and they decide to react, in their own, not very brilliant way... And then the film really begins.After so many monster films, making something original and interesting is a real challenge - South Korean director Bong Joon-ho met this challenge head on and won a BRILLIANT victory! The monster in this film is unlike anything we saw before on the screen - it is part grotesque, part terrifying, it is bothy animal and not-fully-animal, it is lethal (definitely!) but not invulnerable, it can surprise but can also be bluntly direct, in short this is a complex, fascinating creature, completely unlike most standard-issue Hollywood created monsters.But the really brilliant move by Bong Joon-ho was to realize that the key to the success of a monster movie is not only the monster - it's also the people and their story. This film is so good becasuse from the beginning we start to care for the Park family and that keeps us interested and creates real tension. I will not say much about the Parks, to avoid spoilers, but they are definitely not the most brilliant of people and they had it rather hard in life - and that helps a lot because it is always natural to root for the underdog.This is a real monster film and a lot of people die, most of them eaten. Some moments are really heart-breaking. But other than tragedy there is also a lot of humor in ""The host"" and acidic irony, with blows being delivered all around - Americans, South Korean government, radical marxist students, everybody gets served...)))In recent years South Koreans went into the world with their movies and they offered a lot of innovation and brilliance in some genres. They were very successful with war movies, like ""Frontline"", which IMPRESSED me and ""My way"" (the famous ""Brotherhood"" I liked less). They did some honest, watchable spy/action films, like ""Shiri"". The foray into the SF (like ""Natural City"") was, for my taste, less successful. On another hand ""The host"" is a brilliant success and a very welcome renewal of monster movies, which Hollywood should examine carefully for inspiration.Let us dream a little here - imagine what it would give, a REAL ""Godzilla"" movie made by Bong Joon-ho... (sigh!)The effects are good, characters are well conceived, the creature is formidable, the scenario is good and the ending is strong. This is a really, very, very good film, worth buying, watching and re-watching.

"EXCELLENT!! I absolutely loved this terrible but beautiful 1949 drama. Combined efforts of William Wyler and Olivia de Havilland made it into a master piece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.New York, late XIX century (probably around 1880). Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland) is a plain, painfully shy woman whose emotionally detached father (Ralph Richardson) makes no secret of his disappointment in her. She is however certain to inherit a fortune when her father dies. When she meets the charming Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), she immediately is taken by the attention that he lavishes upon her. Her aunt Lavinia (Miriam hopkins) is delighted, but her father on another hand is not pleased at all... And then the film really begins and I will say no more.This is an adaptation of a play, which itself was an adaptation of novel ""Washington Square"" by Henry James. The whole story occurs mostly in the same couple of rooms, with just limited forays in other appartments and one ball room - and an occasional glimpse of the street in front of the house. There is only a limited number of characters, as other than the four already named all others appear only in short glimpses. And yet, this story is more tense, more dramatic, more nerve wreaking and more heart-breaking than many great-budget super-productions. Indeed, this film shows, that the unlimited ocean of human soul is traversed by storms of unparalleled power and inhabited by monsters which would scare the tentacles out of Kraken itself...Olivia de Havilland is AMAZING! She was a helluva of an actress. Montgomery Clift, for whom it was only the third role, barely one year after his debut in ""The Search"", shines too - albeit his role is actually easier... The wise but terrible Father is played incredibly by Sir Ralph Richardson (OK, yes, he wasn't technically a Sir yet). Finally Aunt Lavinia, an absolutely remarkable person 50% foolish/50% clever is played wonderfully by Miriam Hopkins, who used to be a major star in the 30s, but was at that time on her way out - still, in this film he managed a swan song of epic proportions...This was the seventh film directed by William Wyler which I saw (including ""The dead end"", ""The letter"", ""The big country"", ""Roman Holidays"") and that only confirmed what I knew already since ""Ben Hur"" and ""Jezebel"" - he was one of the greatest Hollywood directors EVER! What a perfect mastery of scenario and actors! Chapeau bas maestro!This is an absolutely splendid, albeit heart-breaking film. I loved every single moment of it and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing.

"I was very impressed by this 2013 fact-based war US film. It is a very tense, very realistic, well filmed and well-interpeted war drama. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.War in Afghanistan, 2005. A local Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah is trageted by US Army, after he carried succesful attacks against Americans as well as against villagers who were aiding US forces. A Navy SEALs unit is ordered to capture or kill Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is send forward to locate the target. These four SEALs are: team leader Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy (Taylor Kitsch); sniper Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), sniper Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they must make a trek through the mountains - and then the film really begins.This is a very good war film, one of the best I saw in recent years. It is based on real events and the heroism of Navy Seals is in no way exaggerated - the real life Lt. Murphy received Medal of Honor for his actions that fateful day and a US Navy destroyer was named after him. The film follows the real story, very, very closely and we can actually feel it. This is definitely not a propaganda film or a recruitement tool, but even if the events described are tragic, the general mood of the film is uplifting - this is probably why all the ""progressive "" medias hated it so much... Characters feel real and they are quite likeable, even if their language is strong and their manners sometimes questionnable - still, in those times of great danger, I am very, very glad that West still has soldiers like that...Action scenes are realistic, but still unbelievable, much, much better in any SF or super hero movies. Images of Afghan mountains add an majestic element to the whole drama. All actors did very well - that includes also Eric Bana, who plays Lt. Commander Kristensen, one of the Navy Seals who will join in the action only later. For my personal taste the best performance was that of Taylor Kitsch.Even if we more or less know how it all will end, this film still keeps us very much guessing until the end as for the details. It is a very tense and powerful thing - it is almost impossible to stop watching and I advise you not to do it, in order to not lose the rhytm...I was very impressed by this film, I am glad that I bought and watched it and I will definitely keep my DVD for another viewing in the future.

"An absurd mess. There is simply not other way to describe this.. this... this... thingy. I saw a lot of sh**ty films in my life and as a connaisseur I put this one one the highest floor of the pantheon of worse movies EVER!What is the story? That is A REALLY GOOD question! I watched every freaking second of it - and once the credits started to roll I still had not a clue what it was all about! There is a sick girl (Rachel Weisz), that much I got. And there is a guy (Hugh Jackman).. or maybe two guys... one is bald and flying through the universe... in a bubble... or maybe not... Oh flip, I give up. I don' have a clue what this... this... this... thingy is about!I will just paste here a fragment I got from wikipedia: ""The film consists of three story lines, in which Jackman and Weisz play different sets of characters who may or may not be the same two people: a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, a conquistador and his queen, and a space traveler in the future who hallucinates his lost love. The story lines, interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs, reflect the themes of love and mortality."" I think the operative words in the description above are ""hallucination"" and ""recurring visual motifs"" - which it is possible to shorten into ""absurd mess""...Buying this film was a loss of money, watching it was a loss of time and the only pleasure I got from my purchase was when I dumped this thing into the garbage, recovering just the innocent and still serviceable plastic box. This film is AN ABSOLUTE PIECE OF £%*&+%%!

"I liked this film a lot, I spend a nice moment watching it and I will keep my DVD for another viewing. Combined efforts of Billy Wilder and James Stewart made into something really worth seeing. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.This film is a faithful adaptation of Charles Lindbergh's 1953 autobiographical account of his historic flight in 1927, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1954. It begins with his early days in aviation and culminates in his 33-hour transatlantic flight in the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" monoplane from his take off at Roosevelt Field to his landing at Le Bourget Field in Paris on May 21, 1927. In the between are some juicy and very amusing anecdotes, some quasi surrealistic conversations with various students Lindberg was trying to teach how to fly and all his efforts to build an airplane with which cross the Atlantic.The narration is very much to the point, without many digressions, but nevertheless never boring, not even for one moment. The flight itself is a surprisingly tense, dramatic and very moving human adventure - even if quite obviously I knew how it was going to end, there were moments I was biting my nails all the same... There is drama, there is tension, there is humour, but no romance, not even one little bit - and in this film it is actually a very precious thing. At 135 minutes this is a long film, but I swear I didn't see the time fly by.James Stewart aced this role as virtually every other he ever accepted. He was probably the best actor to play Lindbergh because he was also the best pilot in history of Hollywood - he served in USAAF with great distinction during WWII, reached the rank of Brigadier General in US Air Force and even flew as observer on a bombing mission in Vietnam in 1966. This film proved also once more that Billy Wilder was a great director - one of the greatest ever.This is a classic and a really great film. To buy, watch, keep and re-watch.

"I liked this 1941 drama/comedy a lot. It is deservedly considered a classic and it didn't age one bit. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a director, known for light comedies. His films made him very rich, but he aspires to do something more serious. He ultimately comes with an idea for a drama about people living on the margins and in order to ""learn trouble first-hand"", disguises himself as a tramp and gets on the road, without a penny in his pocket, to the greatest despair and concern of his producer, his agent - and also his butler. In one of his first forays he meets a failed actress (Veronica Lake), who left Hollywood after some bad experience, pennyless and bitter.

And then the film really begins.The most important precision to give about this film is that it is definitely NOT a comedy or at least it is not only a comedy. It certainly has comic moments and there is romance and romantic comedy in it too - but there is also A LOT of drama in it, sometimes very, very tough. There is also social criticism in it, quite obviously, but also quite a lot of reflection, on poor people, rich people, on the (mis)understanding of poor people by the rich people, about the nature of poverty and also, last but not least, about arrogant pretention of highly educated intellectual progressive people who think that they understand the world better than anybody else - when in fact frequently they have not the slightest clue... In fact this film will probably enrage most of ""progressive"" left wingers...)))Veronica Lake, one of the most beautiful women who ever lived, is at her most gorgeous in this film and she plays very well.

"This 1968 western is a good, solid, honest thing about a particularly difficult and controversial topic - white women captured and kept as slaves by American Indians. I watched it three times at different moments of life and I always liked it a lot. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.PRECISION: this is the review of Region 1 NTSC version â€“ it will not play on standard Region 2 PAL equipment. For the Region 2 version, you will have to buy the Spanish released ""La nocha de los gigantes"", which contains an English version.Somewhere around 1880 in Arizona, during the last stage of Apache Wars, U.S. Army soldiers surprise and round up a group of Indians. They find among them a white woman, Sarah Carver (Eva Marie Saint) and her half-Indian child. Abducted as young teenager Sarah was taken as slave by a particularly fierce warrior known as Salvaje (""Ghost"") - a man so dangerous that even his own tribe is scared of him.As most white slaves in such cases Sarah was treated harshly, even when she gave birth to Salvaje's son. She is in poor shape and after so many years of captivity finds it difficult to even speak English - and she has no family, as all her folks were murdered in the same raid in which she was taken. Army scout Sam Varner (Gregory Peck), who just finished his service, ends by proposing her to live for a time at his ranch in New Mexico, the time for her to recover and make some plans for the future. They leave for Sam's ranch - but somebody will follow their trail... And then the film really begins.This is a really good, solid film, mixing drama, action and tension and even a little bit of thriller/horror by moments, as Salvaje seems to be really more a supernatural creature than a man... However, the action scenes and other adventures are not the most important thing here. Much more intense, sometimes even heart-breaking, are the drama elements about Sarah and her son.Sarah is a victim who tries to recover after a long, long ordeal of being forced to have sex for years with a man who murdered her family, enslaved her and stole her childhood and young years. Eva Marie Saint was 44 when she played in this film and it actually helped to make this film look more realistic â€“ because slavery and abuse definitely make people age quickerâ€¦ Her son, whom we know only as Boy (he is about eight years old), is even more traumatised, as he was abruptly taken from the world he knew into an alien place he doesn't care for. Also, even if Salvaje treated his mother badly, he is still his father and Boy misses him â€“ in fact wants to escape to go to himâ€¦ Those elements make this film into something much deeper and sombre than most of westerns.This film also quite usefully deals with the politically correct bull**** about white captives living with Indian tribes, like the one served in ""Dancing with wolves"". All slavery is a horrible violation of human rights, but the one practiced by American Indians as late as 1880s and was a particularly cruel kind, as slaves mostly had no place in the society and no chance of recovering freedom, but to the contrary, were just exploited in the most extreme way until they died, before being replaced. With time Indian captives from other tribes could occasionally (not often) be accepted into the tribe as free people, but it was almost never the case of whites â€“ they were put to hard work, fed the least possible and were ultimately killed once useless. Indian men treated all women harshly, but the enslaved ones faired the worse â€“ even if they bore children the their owners.If you would like to read more about this topic, I recommend ""A fate worse than death"" by Gregory Michno. For years this author patiently collected as much TRUE memories of white captives freed from Indian captivity in the period between 1830 and 1885 as he could find and then published them in one volume. I must warn you that this is a nightmarish read but also a very useful one, as it immediately puts to grave most of politically correct nonsense about American Indians, by showing that those Palaeolithic hunters-gatherers were definitely not peace loving hippies, but as warlike and predatory as it is humanly possibleâ€¦I like this film, I am glad that I bought it and I will definitely keep my DVD. A recommended viewing.

"Long time ago I watched and liked this 1968 western mixed with a whodunnit mystery and recently I was glad to see it didn't age much. It is still a very entertaining viewing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 1880, a gambler in the small town of Rincon, just outside of Denver, Colorado, is caught cheating at a five-card stud poker game. Usually this kind of incident would end with the cheater being disarmed, beaten senseless by every person in attendance and then chased out of town with a strong warning to never return again. But this time one of the players, a sadistic vicious little thug named Nick Evers (Roddy MacDowall), leads his drunken companions into lynching the cheater - of whom they don't even know the name. Only one player, Van Morgan (Dean Martin) and Little George, black barman who watched the game, realising that things are going too far, try to stop the murder - but in vain... Soon after that, one after another, two of the men who played that fateful night and participated in the lynching are found dead and the city of Ricon is grasped by fear... Local preacher, Reverend Rudd (Robert Mitchum), a very tough man who - according to the rumors - is himself a reformed gunfighter, tries to comfort local people and assist to the best of his abilities in finding the culprit (or culprits)... And then the film really begins.This is a very honest, very entertaining film, with a strong performance by all the main four actors. The solution of the mystery appears quickly evident - there are however some details which are revealed only late and they come as a surprise. Characters are very much alive, each of them with its own story to tell - formidable preacher, borderline insane Nick, surprisingly tough Little George and of course Van Morgan, played by Dean Martin in the ""scoundrel, ma non troppo"" register...))) Ladies are less important, but they add some charm and wit to the film, especially Inger Stevens who plays here Lily Langford, a surprisingly sophisticated owner and manager of a particularly charming house of perdition...)))Ultimately it is however Robert Mitchum who is the greatest treasure of this film, with his Colt, black religious garb and his Bible - which, as fits the Holy Book, contains many a treasure...))) I will say no more here.Made in 1968, this film was part of the 'last hurrah"" of westerns, which were being pushed towards the exit this time - but still managed to make a splash on their way out... I like this film a lot and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing.

"Even though it is only an action B movie, I always liked it and I was glad to see it one more time. Rating it four stars may be a little bit generous, but still, I had such a good time watching it, that I simply had no choice. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A precision here - I know absolutely NOTHING about climbing and the highest place where I ever have been is Klein Matterhorn (3883 metres), followed by Teide (3718 metres), both valiantly ascended by cable-car... This might explain why I liked this film so much...Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) and his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) were climbing mountains since they were very young, but now have a difficult relationship, following a very bad accident three years earlier. Peter is now a photographer but Annie continues a very succesful climbing career - she was in fact selected to be part of an expedition ascending K2, together with an exuberant billionnaire Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) and a renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea, of X-Files fame).The expedition meets with problems and a rescue party, encouraged by a financial reward, is formed to attempt a rescue. This group will be led by an eccentric but extremely competent hermit/climber Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn, amazing!) - other members will be Peter Garrett, two somehow psychedelic Australians, a Pakistani soldier and last but not least Monique Aubertine (Isabella Scorupco), a woman climber so deep in debt, that she doesn't even dare to descend into the valleys...This is a surprisingly well done little film, mixing the climber/mountain drama with some additional elements. There is an old and terrible score to settle between two of the characters (I will say no more here). There is a dangerous cargo some people have to carry. There is war raging nearby - the merciless high-altitude confrontation between India and Pakistan, mostly in form of artillery duels, called the Siachen War, still not finished albeit a cease-fire is in effect since 2003. And then of course there is the mountain itself...Even if Mount Everest killed much more people, K2 is considered an even more difficult and dangerous mountain - and the only reason why it killed less climbers is that much, much less people try to ascend it, because of all the perils. The horrible weather, extremely deadly avalanches and even the name itself, all created a threatening aura around this mountain - and it adds to the climate of tension in this film.Even if the scenario may seem by moments a little bit extravagant and the main villain slightly too one-dimensional, this is still a darn good action/adventure movie. Lots of imagination and creativity went into creating some of the scenes - I almost would like to say more here, but I will not, to preserve the surprises. High mountain scenes are very good, characters are rather well done, the scenario is honest and the ending is quite strong, at least for my personal taste.I liked this film in 2000 when it was in the cinemas and I liked it again 15 years later, therefore I simply have no choice than rating it four stars. I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing in the future.

"I spend a nice moment watching this 1966 romantic comedy set in the Wild West. It is a light-hearted and mostly not serious thing, which can be watched in family, with some good humour, very limited violence and just one really sad (but very carefully showed) moment. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Martha Price (Maureen O'Hara), an English lady, middle aged but still hot like hell and her daughter Hilary (Juliet Mills), a bright young damsel very easy on eyes, find themselves stranded in Saint Louis, with for all possessions the clothes on their back and a Hereford bull, a very precious reproductor. Selling the bull on auction they recolt enough money to be able to return to England, but first they want to be certain that the animal, which they both raised from calf, arrives safe to the Texan ranch of his new owner, Alexander Bowen (Brain Keith). A local wrangler, Sam Burnett (James Stewart), is hired to accompany them and then the whole company of two women, one man, four horses and one bull leaves for Texas... It will be one helluva journey and once in Texas, things will get even more interesting, but I will say no more here...This is not your typical western - in fact it is mostly a romantic comedy set in the Wild West. Violence and action are very limited and anyway toned down, even if there is one vile murder, one fight to death, one pretty realistic stampede scene, some (non letal) fistfights and one terrific face slap (delivered by Maureen O'Hara character)... On another hand there is a lot dialogs, romance, surprises, twists, emotions, gentlemen courting bonnie lassies - and one really sad scene. All of this makes for a very pleasant, relaxing, amusing and cheerful viewing.It is true that the low content of scum and villainy may be an issue as there is only one desperado in the film - but after adding three bottles of my own I stopped noticing...))) A somehow bigger problem was for me one rather assinine decision concerning practical details of cattle reproduction, - but on another hand without this decision there would be no second half of the film...Actors did very well in ""The rare breed"". James Stewart and Maureen O'hara are of course perfect as always, but in fact a large part of charm of this film resides in Juliet Mills and Brian Keith characters, of which I will say nothing more, to not spoil the surprise. Jack Elam also appears in this film and as you probably immediately guessed, yes, he plays the main villain.However the GREATEST star in this film is the bull reproductor. Unlike most of specimens of taurine tribe, this is a tame, gentle creature, astonishingly zen and greatly charismatic. Now, you take such an animal, with all the formidable appearance and fierce temper of a caramel coated marshmallow, you make it obey to the whistling of ""God save the Queen"" and you name it Vindicator and you have immediately material for a lot of comedy and cheerful laughter - and this film definitely used all this potential... This adorable creature presents an especially great challenge for the hard as rock wrangler, always ready to take the bull by the horns but somehow defenceless when facing a creature which don't have any of them...)))This is not any kind of masterpiece, but I liked this vaguely westernish feel-good romantic comedy and it cheered me no end (that and the three bottles of ""Desperados""). I will absolutely keep the DVD for another viewing.

"This is one of the greatest novels ever written, a book which you read a hundred times without ever tiring. Ever since I read it in my early teen years I was deeply in love with it - and I still am. There is not one page, not even one line, which would not be a pure perfection. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.This book describes a visit by Satan to Moscow in late 1920s. Satan was quite busy in previous years and he neglected a little bit his Russian domains, but now he comes for an inspection (in fact an audit) - he is especially curious about this whole communism thing, which is a kind of novelty for him. For the purpose of this visit he takes form of a distinguished albeit slightly eccentric gentleman named Woland. He also brings with him an entourage of four lesser devils: Azazello, a strangely likeable demon murderer, who serves as messenger and enforcer, Hella, a somehow vampiric succubus, who is a maid, Koroviev, a fallen choir angel with a particularly nasty sense of humour, who is a page and last but definitely not least, Behemoth, a huge demonic cat-from-hell, who is Woland's jester (and also a world class @hole! - but that is only to be expected from a cat...). Together they will wreck absolute havoc in Moscow in a thunderstorm of irresistibly hilarious but also sometimes pretty nasty episodes, which will culminate during the Satan's Midnight Ball - for which the Devil, an eternal bachelor, needs to find a suitable Lady to assist him in welcoming the guests...I will not go here in more details to not provide spoilers, but it must be said that this is one of those books which simply reached PERFECTION. There is nothing here that could be criticized. Every single page, every single line is simply PERFECT. This is an incredibly entertaining book - but which is also very touching, very profound and also contains lots of sadness. Which is understandable, considering that it was written in horrible times and in a horrible place - USSR in Stalin times...Extremely subversive, ""The Master and Margarita"" was never published during Bulgakov's life and in fact, in desperation of ever seeing it published, he even burned the first version of the book - but as Satan said: ""Manuscripts don't burn"". After his death in 1940 copies of final version of the book survived and it was finally published in a censored edition in the 60s, before being finally released in its integrality in 1989. Being openly sceptical towards communism and having relatives who emigrated in 1919, Bulgakov was considered a ""hostile element"" and was closely watched and also frequently fired from various jobs - but unlike so many others he was never send to Gulag concentration camps. He had indeed one great admirer and protector - Stalin himself, who actually kept from 1940 to his death in his personal safe a copy of full text of ""The Master and Margarita"" and read it many times (although he never allowed it to be published). Stalin's protection assured also that when Bulgakov gave the final text to the publisher in 1939, against the expectations of his friends and family he wasn't arrested or killed - the manuscript was only rejected (after one copy was delivered to Stalin in person), but the political police didn't show. That still probably hastened Bulgakov's death - he was already very ill at that time and heart-broken he stopped fighting...For me, ""The Master and Margarita"" is amongst the greatest, the most important, most profound and most touching things that were ever written.

"In this book Gardner Dozois gathered what he considered as best SF works published in 2014. It was roughly on the same level as the one from 2013 â€“ with some more very good stories, but also much more stinkers.Having read all the thirty two Gardner Dozois yearly collections I couldn't help but notice a steady but regular decline in quality of SF writing, from the 80s to the modern times. OK, granted, this is just one of yearly anthologies amongst many, and yes, it reflects the very personal, subjective taste of the editor, but still, there is a clear trend towards a lesser quality. The main reasons of that, at least in my personal opinion and for my subjective taste, are the following:- a tendency to run after the developments in the world, rather than trying to anticipate them. Global warming hysteria, fear of nanotechnologies and GMOs and consequences of recent progress in informatics are the best examples of it. Few writers even try to think about something really new - and it seems that even fewer have intellectual capacity of doing it...- nihilism, pessimism and fear-mongering seem to be the leading motive in recent SF, as there is hardly any joy and exaltation linked usually with new discoveries and opening of new horizons. To the contrary, everything and anything seems to be a threat.- lack of humour. In this anthology there is at best one story which contains at least some humour and wit. Everything is mostly gloom and doom taken DEADLY seriously...- left winged politics. That is probably due to Gardner Dozois personal choice, but at least in his anthologies anything conservative, religious and especially military is mostly the source of all evil in the world. Christianity seems to be particularly hated.- poorly developed characters, with whom we cannot really connect.- poor endings - or no endings at all. It seems that nowadays there are few writers able to find a good closure or a punch line.For all that reasons, reading those huge collections was frequently much less fun than expected - and I distinctly remember that when I discovered SF with classic short stories from the 50s and 60s, well, this was a much more enjoyable experience...This collection includes also two very precious things. In the introduction we have an overview of what happened in SF (largely understood) in 2014 - in all Gardner Dozois yearly collections that thing is invariably always very precious. At the end there is also the very useful section of ""honourable mentions"" - stories which couldn't be selected for this collection because of lack of space (and this is already a HUGE book!), but which were also of good quality.There were six very good stories: ""The rider"", ""The burial of Sir John Mawe at Cassini"", ""The regular"", ""Passage of Earth"", ""Thing and sick"" (THE BEST IN THIS COLLECTION) and ""Yesterday""s kin"". There were also four good stories: ""Amicae eternum"", ""In Babelsberg"", ""Grand jetÃ© (the great leap)"", ""Jubilee"". All those definitely deserve to be discovered.The category readable (sometimes barely) includes fourteen stories â€“ if you skip them, you will not miss much.For my personal taste there were eleven stinkers: ""The fifth dragon"", ""The days of the war, as red as blood, as dark as bile"", ""Shooting the Apocalypse"", ""The colonel"", ""Entanglement"", ""Slipping"", ""Covenant"", ""Los piratas del mar de plastic (Pirates of the plastic ocean)"", ""God decay"", ""Communion"", ""Someday"". Those ones I advise to simply avoid.One story, ""The man who sold the moon"", I am unable to rate because it bore me so badly that I stopped reading it after 15 pages. You will have to make your own mind about it.Below, more of my impressions about the stories, with some limited SPOILERS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The fifth dragon"" by Ian McDonald â€“ near future, colonized Moon; a bisexual woman remembers how she emigrated from Earth, joined a kind of swinger sex-cluster and met the love of her life; under the pretence of SF it's mostly LGBT soft porn story. I didn't like it much.""The rider"" by Jerome Cigut â€“ in the near future rogue AI's wage a mysterious war, via human allies/carriers called ""riders"". In this story we follow a ""rider"" and his artificial master/partner/friend David. Cyberpunk is not my usual poison, but stories like that, I am always ready for more. A VERY GOOD, solid, honest thing.""The days of the war, as red as blood, as dark as bile"" by Aliette de Bodard â€“ and like every year, another story about a future dominated by rival Chinese and Aztec empires in which intelligent ships travel through stars. There is a war, some people wonder if they should run away from their homes or not, then blah blah blah all the way until a very stupid ending. AVOID!""The burial of Sir John Mawe at Cassini"" by Chaz Brenchley â€“ now that is SF! In a parallel world Mars was colonized by British Empire - which still remains very Victorian. This is the tale of the funeral of a colonial dignitary, a burial like no one saw since ages, with almost all human Mars population attending â€“ and you will fully understand why only at the end. A BRILLIANT, VERY GOOD STORY! TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""The regular"" by Ken Liu â€“ IMPRESSIVE! This story, occurring in near future, about an Eurasian woman who after a career in police works as a private eye and one day is asked to investigate the murder of a call girl, rather than her usual cases of insurance frauds, is one of the best written and most interesting things I read recently. A BRILLIANT, VERY GOOD STORY. TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""The woman from the ocean"" by Karl Bunker â€“ a woman, sole survivor of an ill-fated expedition to another star system, comes back to Earth after many, many years of absence â€“ and finds that humanity was changed, in fact terribly mutilatedâ€¦ A READABLE story, with a rather clever conclusion (war can be totally eradicated only if humans stop being humans), but also horribly depressing and with an ending which is wrong - simply wrong.""Shooting the Apocalypse"" by Paolo Bacigalupi â€“ in United States devastated by â€“ what else? (sigh) â€“ global warming and Republicans, two paparazzi in need of money are chasing a scoop on the border between struggling Arizona and devastated Texasâ€¦ Story without a real conclusion and ultimately without much of plot, lazily mining once again global warming hysteria. I didn't like it.""Weather"" by Susan Palwick â€“ a man tries desperately to get to the hospital where his daughter is dying â€“ before she is ""translated"" (downloaded) â€“ all of this with global warming in the background. A very banal story â€“ READABLE, but barely.""The hand is quicker"" by Elizabeth Bear â€“ a lesbian woman is downgraded from first to second class citizen in a rather nightmarish future society. The story begins with a shock and seemed promising, but very quickly author got scared by her own courage and followed with one banality after another, until a supremely lame ending. READABLE â€“ but also disappointing.""The man who sold the moon"" by Cory Doctorow â€“ this 59 pages long novella I cannot rate, as I couldn't finish it; it seems to be about a group of highly educated people living in a kind of counter-culture in California who make an invention â€“ but as I found the characters unlikeable this story wore me down and I gave up. You will have to read it and make up your own mind.""Vladimir Chong chooses to die"" by Lavie Tidhar â€“ another story in the Central Station series, happening in a very, very weird future Israel; as the title indicates, it is about Vladimir Chong who just decided to die; I don't like the freakishly weird, even creepy world described in those stories, but the story is READABLE.""Beside the damned river"" by D.J. Cockburn â€“ in a near future northern Thailand, devastated by drought, an old man helps repair a broken truck, which carries a mysterious cargo; a quite READABLE, if banal story""The colonel"" by Peter Watts â€“ in a near future there is a war between humans and a sort of enemies, but who are those enemies, I don't know, because this story is so confusing, so poorly written and so drowned in informatics lingo, that I couldn't understand one simple thing. I HATED IT!""Entanglement"" by Vandana Singh â€“ scientists fight global warming; one of them is an Inuit â€“ and there are also so beluga whales in it and some kind of monks; this is more or less everything I could understand from this boring mess. I couldn't even finish it after going through two-thirds of the story. AVOID!""White Curtain"" by Pavel Amnuel â€“ a guy who can affect reality finds that he cannot affect the reality when it really matters â€“ but is it really true? A quite banal story reminding a little bit of Russian fantastic tales of late XIX century (author is actually Russian), but still READABLE.""Slipping"" by Lauren Beukes â€“ a girl who was mutilated in a weird accident struggles to adapt to life again after some kind of weird therapy. Poorly written and boring â€“ I HATED IT!""Passage of Earth"" by Michael Swanwick â€“ a man with a past is asked to perform an autopsy of an alien creature â€“ and I will say nothing more about the plot. It is a surprising, shocking, original, VERY GOOD STORY, very much unlike anything else I ever read â€“ and nowadays it is a hard thing to invent something new in SF. Kudos for the wicked title tooâ€¦))) Bravo Michael Swanwick!""Amicae aeternum"" by Ellen Klages â€“ a short, but very powerful story about two eleven year old girls, BFFs, who spend a last moment together, before a separation which is as definite as humanly possible, as one of them is leaving on a generation starship which will travel to another solar system â€“ for two hundred yearsâ€¦ A GOOD, solid thing. Darn sad thoughâ€¦""In Babelsberg"" by Alastair Reynolds â€“ a self-aware AI robot came back from an exploration travel through Solar System and appears on various talk shows to share his experiences â€“ but is he telling all the truth? An intelligent, solid, GOOD story, which reminded me a little of an even better old archi-classic, ""The Inquest"" by Stanislaw Lem (part of ""Tales of Pirx the Pilot"" collection). If you liked this story, try to find and read ""The inquest"" â€“ you will not regret it.""Sadness"" by Timons Esaias â€“ Earth was invaded and humans live in the most abject slavery â€“ and somehow they are now so sheepish, that don't even try to resist, no matter what indignity is inflicted to them! It is not half bad written, I admit, therefore I rate it as READABLE but I could only feel total contempt for the main character â€“ and all other humans who appearâ€¦""West to East"" by Jay Lake â€“ two people crash-landed on a terminally hostile planet and it seems that they cannot be rescued. They accepted the idea that they will die â€“ and awaiting the seemingly unavoidable death, they try to find a way to do anything meaningful. The story is READABLE, but I found the whole idea morbidly depressing - and the whole thing about two highly trained space pilots giving up, rather than fighting for their lives to the last breath, simply WRONG.""Grand jetÃ© (the great leap)"" by Rachel Swirsky â€“ a young girl is dying from a horrible cancer â€“ her grandfather tries to build a cyborg into which he could download her conscience; all this mixed with Old Testament lore (the heroes are Jewish); objectively speaking this is a GOOD, solid, very poignant story â€“ but the description of a long agony of a child dying of cancer was really too much for me, so I ""fast forwarded"" most of it.""Covenant"" by Elizabeth Bear â€“ a serial killer who murdered thirteen little girls was sentenced to ""right-minding"" (in this future world it replaces imprisonment) and now tries to adjust to his new life. Reading the memories of a serial killer who preyed on children and who basically got away with it (nothing short of death penalty is adapted to such crimes in my perception of reality) was too much for me. I HATED THAT ONE!""Jubilee"" by Karl Schroeder â€“ a Romeo and Juliette story; a boy and a girl fall in love â€“ trouble is, they belong to two mutually hostile communities of people who, albeit not different of the rest of mankind, live their lives in a cycle of one day of activity/years of suspended animation â€“ and as their cycles are different, both groups wake up on the same day only once in a thousand years or soâ€¦ It has interesting consequences, to say the least. I liked this story â€“ this is a GOOD, solid, honest thing.""Los piratas del mar de plastic (Pirates of the plastic ocean)"" by Paul Graham Raven â€“ in near future Spain an economist/journalist is hired to make some kind of market situation analysis; at least that is what is said at the beginning because immediately after this whole thing dissolves into completely incomprehensible mess. I have no idea what this story was about â€“ AVOID!""Red lights and rain"" by Gareth L. Powell â€“ two former soldiers, veterans of a war which will be fought in a distant future, fight one last time â€“ in our times. One of them is a woman, the other a kind of cybernetic vampire. Interesting idea but the plot is very banal, flat and ultimately disappointing â€“ a READABLE thing at best.""Coma kings"" by Jessica Barber â€“ in a near future two girls are addicted to high tech video games â€“ one of them terminally soâ€¦ A READABLE thing.""The prodigal son"" by Allen M. Steele â€“ a private foundation tries to send the first starship to another solar system â€“ some Christian fundamentalists try to stop them; this story seemed very promising in the beginning, but for me it became clear very quickly that, for reasons which I will not reveal to avoid spoilers, this mission is really an abomination and the protesters are actually darn right! From that moment I really couldn't sympathize with the main protagonists. Also, in a world where Islamic terrorists kill people every day, when needing a suicide bomber author had to make him, of course, a Christianâ€¦ Because of hateful Christian bashing and abject character of the whole endeavour described here I hated this story â€“ but to be absolutely objective I must admit it is READABLE.""God decay"" by Rich Larson â€“ in a near future, an augmented athlete, a Polish guy named Ostap Kerensky (which is by the way as much a Polish name as Isoroku Yamamoto), worried by his health, comes to check with his doctor, an older woman who also used to be his squeezeâ€¦ I found this story banal, quite boring and didn't like it much.""Blood wedding"" by Robert Reed â€“ in the future the perfect woman (and also heiress to a financial empire) marries a rich, handsome suitor â€“ then somebody with access to ultra-high technology attacks the ceremony, all hell breaks loose and it is up to unexpected heroes to save the dayâ€¦ It could have been a good story, but it became more and more weird and finally crashed and burned at the last pages. This story had potential but because of the poor ending I rate it only as READABLE""The long haul, from the annals of transportation, the Pacfic Monthly, may 2009"" by Ken Liu â€“ in a near future exists a society based on low-carbon emissions principle, where giant airships carry most of goods; this is the story of an airship captain and his Chinese mail-bride wife. Nothing special, but a READABLE story.""Shadow flock"" by Greg Egan â€“ a woman recognised as a top-level drone programmer is contacted for a very, very special job - which she cannot possibly likeâ€¦ It is actually a quite honest high-tech ""film noir"" scenario â€“ just with a very disappointing ending. A READABLE thing.""Thing and sick"" by Adam Roberts â€“ on an isolated SETI outpost in Antarctica an unpleasant and unstable nerd solves Fermi's Paradox â€“ the story is told much later by his less extravagant and more likeable companion. I will say nothing more, because this thing deserves to be discovered and appreciated on your own. For my personal taste this is THE BEST STORY IN THE COLLECTION and one of the most intelligent and especially original SF works I read in years. TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Communion"" by Mary Anne Mohanraj â€“ two lesbian women have a dispute about the future of their relationship â€“ an alien somehow unwillingly mediatesâ€¦ Contains some gross elements. Only for LGBT fans â€“ I didn't like it.""Someday"" by James Patrick Kelly â€“ a soft porn about a lesbian woman who wants to conceive and looks for ideal father(s) for the child. Mostly for LGBT fans â€“ I didn't like it.""Yesterday's kin"" by Nancy Kress â€“ Marianne, a geneticist who just published her first really outstanding discovery (and also mother of three fully grown up children â€“ who barely can stand one another), is summoned by alien ambassador on Earth â€“ together with the Secretary General of UN and couple of other people. They will not like what they will hearâ€¦ I will say nothing more about the plot, because this 70+ pages long novella contains many twists and surprises. After some hesitation I rate this story as VERY GOOD, even if I didn't like some elements in it, mostly the religion bashing, the hatred Nancy Kress seems to feel for her country, really old clichÃ©s and some really stupid ideas (like the possibility of extremely high tech civilization having underdeveloped biological science). Still, this was a good read, which kept me interested until the end. A RECOMMENDED READING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION: an OK, more or less honest anthology, but only the top ten stories out of thirty six are really worth reading (and eleven are pure waste of time). Still, this collection indeed offers a nice overview of latest trends in SF â€“ it's not really Gardner Dozois fault that SF writers nowadays seem frequently to struggle with inspiration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BONX1MAB1J4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S4B8EK#wasThisHelpful","R3BONX1MAB1J4H","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A READABLE thing.""Thing and sick"" by Adam Roberts â€“ on an isolated SETI outpost in Antarctica an unpleasant and unstable nerd solves Fermi's Paradox â€“ the story is told much later by his less extravagant and more likeable companion. I will say nothing more, because this thing deserves to be discovered and appreciated on your own. For my personal taste this is THE BEST STORY IN THE COLLECTION and one of the most intelligent and especially original SF works I read in years. TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Communion"" by Mary Anne Mohanraj â€“ two lesbian women have a dispute about the future of their relationship â€“ an alien somehow unwillingly mediatesâ€¦ Contains some gross elements. Only for LGBT fans â€“ I didn't like it.""Someday"" by James Patrick Kelly â€“ a soft porn about a lesbian woman who wants to conceive and looks for ideal father(s) for the child. Mostly for LGBT fans â€“ I didn't like it.""Yesterday's kin"" by Nancy Kress â€“ Marianne, a geneticist who just published her first really outstanding discovery (and also mother of three fully grown up children â€“ who barely can stand one another), is summoned by alien ambassador on Earth â€“ together with the Secretary General of UN and couple of other people. They will not like what they will hearâ€¦ I will say nothing more about the plot, because this 70+ pages long novella contains many twists and surprises. After some hesitation I rate this story as VERY GOOD, even if I didn't like some elements in it, mostly the religion bashing, the hatred Nancy Kress seems to feel for her country, really old clichÃ©s and some really stupid ideas (like the possibility of extremely high tech civilization having underdeveloped biological science). Still, this was a good read, which kept me interested until the end. A RECOMMENDED READING.-------------------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION: an OK, more or less honest anthology, but only the top ten stories out of thirty six are really worth reading (and eleven are pure waste of time). Still, this collection indeed offers a nice overview of latest trends in SF â€“ it's not really Gardner Dozois fault that SF writers nowadays seem frequently to struggle with inspiration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0J7ZEKD9AIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250064422#wasThisHelpful","R2T0J7ZEKD9AIH","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will never find anything better in hard SF than short stories about Pirx the Pilot, masterfully written by Stanislaw Lem. This book is the second and sadly also the last collection of those stories, following and completing the earlier anthology ""Tales of Pirx the Pilot"".Albeit much less known in the West than he should be, Stanislaw Lem (1921-2006) was a titan of SF. His classical works, written in the 50s and 60s, didn't age one bit and remain amongst the greatest SF writings ever. For my personal taste, the ""Invincible"", a short novel he wrote in 1964, is simply THE BEST SF thing ever published. The hilarious but also deeply philosophical compilations ""Star Diaries"" and ""The Cyberiad"" can be read and re-read infinitely and you will always find another layer of wisdom in them at every lecture!The stories about Pirx the Pilot are another of Lem's masterpieces. They are set somewhere in the 22nd century, in a reality in which Mankind started to colonize the Solar System. There are already settlements on the Moon and Mars, and manned expeditions begun the exploration of the other solar systems. In this world lives Pirx, a rather likeable but quite average, hard-working, no-nonsense guy. In this second collection Pirx is in fact no more a mere pilot, but already a respected captain of spaceships.Those stories are hard SF, or rather ""nuts and bolts"" and their tonality is rather low-key - but still they deliver an amazing punch. They are all very good and I always took a great pleasure in reading every single one of them. ""The Inquest"" is absolutely the best - it might be in fact one of the most profound and thought-provoking things you will ever read. ""Accident"" is a particularly beautiful thing, when ""The hunt"" is the most tense and the most poignant. ""Pirx's tale"" is the only one somehow lighter and actually pretty funny. Finally, ""Ananke"", as it's very name suggests, is the darkest - and the saddest.I read those stories many, many times and I never got bored - not even for one moment. I don't have words strong enough to praise this book. Buy it, read it, keep it and leave it to your children.

"IMPRESSIVE! I loved every single scene of this film! It is even more impressive if we take in account that it was the first film Mel Gibson directed - and he immediately made a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1968, a little town somewhere near Boston. Chuck Nordstadt (Nick Stahl), a boy about 12-years old, lives with his dysfunctional mother and his two half-sisters, an older one, Gloria, a gorgeous redhead who hates him and a younger one, Meg, who is friendly, precociously intelligent but also a little pesky. Chuck misses his father, who died in somehow mysterious circumstances and totally hates his life - he dreams of entering the military boarding school to later become a pilot but also to get away from his family. He is however a slow learner and needs desperately a tutor - and then one day he learns that the reclusive, unfriendly disfigured man living nearby, a certain Justin McLeod (Mel Gibson) is actually a former university teacher. And then the film begins. This is one of the BEST FILMS I saw in many years. Mel Gibson did an amazing job as director and also as actor. He very carefully adapted the original novel, changing it in some crucial aspects and I believe that he did the right thing - I am quite certain that I would hate this film if it followed closely the book. Casting was simply perfect, with young Nick Stahl giving an incredible performance, Margaret Witton being perfect as the unstable mom, Fay Masterson portraying marvellously a spiteful viper and little Gaby Hoffmann doing great as brilliant pixish Meg. The life of a little town is described with care, amusement, criticism but also some tenderness. Views are marvellous and dialogs are frequently irresistible.I will keep this review deliberately short to avoid spoilers, because this is a film with surprises and it keeps us guessing and wondering how will it end until the very final scene. I have no words strong enough to praise it. This is a film to buy, watch, keep and re-watch. ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDFC1G3EBPWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00019073K#wasThisHelpful","R2SDFC1G3EBPWR","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was only partially satisfied with this film, even if I rather enjoyed watching it. It could have been a much better thing, if the director made into an original thing, rather than trying hard to make another ""Dirty Dozen"" - which obviously was an impossible task. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.This film is based on the true story of First Special Service Force, indeed sometimes nicknamed ""Devil's Brigade"", a mixed American-Canadian commando created in 1942 and which, after participating in the Aleutian Islands campaign (landing on Kiska in 1943), fought with distinction in 1943 and 1944 in Italy and southern France. It was disbanded on 5 December 1944 near Menton (France). This unit is being considered as the direct ancestor of modern US and Canadian Special Forces, which both celebrate Menton Day every 5 December, by a combined parachute jump and a ball.This film describes only the first part of this history, beginning with the recruitement and ending at the Monte La Difensa fight on 2 December 1943, which was indeed the greatest exploit of ""Devil's Brigade"" (the unopposed Kiska landing during Aleutian Campaign was however completely skipped, to streamline the narration).The film has many merits, beginning with good actors (William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Richard Jaeckel and a cameo by Dana Andrews), a quite honest final battle sequence, some good humour and some not half bad dialogs. It has however also one HUGE weakness - it tries to be a remake of ""Dirty Dozen"", which not only is impossible (there will never be another ""Dirty Dozen"", not even in a thousand years) but it also falsifies real history. In this film the American component of the unit is made of the scum of the earth, the worse elements everybody was happy to get rid off once the commando starts recruiting - in fact they are even brought to the training camp under the guard of MPs, in cattle wagons! That is absolutely NOT how it was in reality - all American members of the commando without exception were volunteers and a great number of applicants were rejected, because they didn't fit the very demanding profile necessary to serve in the unit.Also, the film really follows the general line of events in ""Dirty Dozen"": difficult and forced recruitement, efforts to unify the initially very divided group by offering them a common enemy, hostility of some high ranking @holes, a first mission which is in fact a repetition of the already legendary maneuvres scenes from ""Dirty Dozen"" and finally the real battle. It is really like watching a remake of a much better film, which was incidentally made only one year earlier...Let's stress it again - I am not saying that this is a bad film, no, in fact I rather enjoyed watching it. But this is not really a faithful description of real ""Devil's Brigade"" and it could have been a much better thing, if Andrew V. McLaglen didn't try so hard to step in Robert Aldrich's much wider and deeper tracks. Still, a rather honest thing, for which the ideal rating would probably be 3,5 stars. ENJOY!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJ4YZSZ2HBK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000062XEX#wasThisHelpful","R3NJ4YZSZ2HBK0","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed by this action ""comedy"", which had such a potential - and managed to waste almost al of it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The film opens with John (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) answering questions during marriage counselling. They talk about their troubles, how they met, how they fell in love and married, etc. However, very quickly we learn that their official jobs are a cover and that they are both professional hitmen (or rather a hitman and a hitwoman) - and neither of them have a clue about the real profession of another. Quite unavoidably, this will lead to a lot of complications...Mixing ""True Lies"" with ""War of the Roses"" and casting two such gifted and beautiful people in main roles was a great idea. It was however mostly wasted. Rather than insisting fully on the humour, either black one like in ""War of the Roses"" or more relaxed like in ""True Lies"", this film relies more on repetitive action scenes and wild stunts - which start to get boring quite soon. Dialogs are a huge disappointment - with the exception of a couple of good moments in the marriage counselor office and some occasional snappy one liners, they are for their majority humourless, banal and pale. The ""war of sexes"" waged mercilessly in a luxurious residence could have been a great comic moment, but the insistence on fire power and martial completely eliminated this possibility. If you think you will see another Michael Douglas vs. Kathleen Turner moment from ""War of the Roses"" you will be very, very disappointed.Sadly, this is a mostly failed film. It is not funny and therefore it doesn't work as a comedy, and it is not serious enough to be an interesting action movie. The only interest resides in the two main actors, who are indeed a vision of splendor - quite obviously, being a man, I liked Ms Jolie more, but I must admit that Brad Pitt is in this film at his most handsome. Small wonder that they started an affair when filming this... And then of course we have also Stephanie March, Kerry Washington, Michelle Monaghan and jennifer Morrison in second roles.I give to this film 2,5 stars only for the sheer accumulation of (mostly) feminine beauty. Otherwise, this is really a thing you can skip without losing much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCTCECETPMJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AP04FG#wasThisHelpful","R2DCTCECETPMJH","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""Terminus"" is the crowning point of this collection and I guarantee that you will have tears in your eyes at the last word and you will be lost deeply in your thoughts when closing this book.If you like it, don't hesitate to get ""More tales of Pirx the Pilot"", with five more stories, which are EVEN BETTER, with especially ""The Inquest"" being one of the most profound and thought-provoking things you will ever read.I don't have words strong enough to praise this book.

"I liked this 1953 quasi-document about the siege of Malta during WWII. It is very well done and moving - the only thing which I found weaker was the romance. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Malta, 1942. The hardest moments of the terrifying siege, which lasts now since more than two years. Bringing in the supplies by sea is now harder than ever and Italians and Germans bomb with unprecedented vigor airfields, ports and towns. Flight Lieutenant Peter Ross (Alec Guinness), an experienced photo reconnaissance pilot, stranded in Malta on his way to Egypt, ends by being assigned to one of RAF squadrons there. He soon meets Maria (Muriel Pavlow), a young Maltese woman working in the RAF operations room and they become close... And then the film really begins.As already said, this is a quasi document, with fictitious characters being more a pretext to show the reality of life (and death) during the siege, than real heroes of the film. The hardships endured valiantly by the defenders and the sacrifice of those who brought supplies through blocade lines are the real subject ""Malta story"". The most dramatic and tense moment of the fillm is of course the convoy battle which raged in the western Mediterranean from 3 to 15 August 1942, better known as operation ""Pedestal"" (Italians call it Battaglia di Mezzo Agosto and to the Maltese it is known as ""The Convoy of Santa Mariya"", as it arrived on Assumption Day). The scenes with the tanker ""Ohio"" (the most crucial element of the convoy), a ship which was really martyred (there is simply no other word) are purely incredible in their intensity. The fighting spirit of the defenders, shown in many, many ways, including some defiant graffitis, is also perfectly shown here. This is a very moving, tragic but finally very uplifting and optimistic film.The only thing which I liked less is the character played by Alec Guinness. The director ordered him to play a man who is more than calm and stoical - he is introverted and indifferent to the point of being completely cold and ultimately unlikeable. It hurst the romance aspect of the film because it is impossible to detect any kind of interest (let's not even talk about passion) in this guy. It probably makes him a good oficer and a great pilot (and before war a good scientist) but also a singularly uninteresting cinema character. Sir Alec Guinness was a great actor - it is a real pity, that here he was hardly allowed to act.This film has considerable value as a quasi document, as it allows us to really feel what it was to be one of Malta defenders in thyose terrible years 1940-43. As a fiction on another hand it doesn't work that well. still, I am glad that I bought and watched this film and I will keep the DVD for a future viewing.

"I was disappointed by this 1968 adaptation of Alistair MacLean's spy novel. There were many changes made to the original material and most of them were, for my personal taste, completely useless and very, very stupid which resulted in serious damage caused to the cohesion and logics of the story. Below, more of my personal impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.A satellite re-enters the atmosphere and ejects a capsule which parachutes to the Arctic. Very soon after Commander James Ferraday (Rock Hudson), captain of the U.S. nuclear attack submarine USS ""Tigerfish"" (SSN-509), stationed at Holy Loch, Scotland, is ordered to make sail to the Arctic (small precision here â€“ in real life there never was a US submarine named ""Tigerfish""). His mission is to rescue the personnel of Drift Ice Station Zebra, a British civilian scientific weather station moving with the ice pack. However, as he welcomes on board a British intelligence agent ""Mr. Jones"" (Patrick McGoohan), a whole platoon of heavily armed US Marines under Captain Anders (Jim Brown) and Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine), a Russian defector who is a colleague of ""Mr. Jones"", it becomes quickly obvious that the mission is actually a cover for a more dangerous, highly classified assignment. And then the film begins.This could have been a very good spy/action thriller. I mean, you take a good novel by Alistair MacLean (""Guns of Navarone"", ""Where eagles dare"") with action taking place in Arctica, a place which always inspired this author (""Night without end"" is a masterpiece), you take for directing no lesser a person than John Sturges (""The magnificent seven""), you get a huge budget (8 million USD â€“ 1968 dollars) and actors like Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine. How can you possibly mess it up? Well, this film clearly proves that nothing is impossibleâ€¦The poor, absurd scenario is the main problem. For the needs of the film the story was so much changed that ultimately there is not much left from the book and also many mistakes were made. One of the worse ideas was to change the identity of the main villain, who in the film is possibly the most obvious person possible and therefore most of the suspense is gone. Everything that happens once the submarine surfaces in the Arctic was changed and as result became un incomprehensible mess. But the worst thing is the last 15 minutes, which have nothing more to do with what happens in the book and in which Western soldiers and Soviet soldiers are shown as just two equally honourable and respectable sides in what turns out to be a kind of misunderstanding â€“ when in the book the mission is clearly for Western agents to recover crucial intelligence, which Soviets covet immensely too. The absurdity of the scenario makes the watching of this very long film (150 minutes) a quite difficult thing.The good things in this film are the character of ""Mr. Jones"" and the way Patrick McGoohan played him. Some scenes on board of USS ""Tigerfish"" are also very honest and Rock Hudson gives a good show as the captain. This is why I give to this film two stars â€“ but other than that there is only disappointment. I gave this film away as soon as I finished watching it and I just really want to forget it. AVOID!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JODSWMFVWA4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006B2A42#wasThisHelpful","R3JODSWMFVWA4T","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2006 film is a good, powerful, shocking and extremely upsetting social drama. It certainly is something that you don't forget easily. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The film begins when a young woman named Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is released from prison, meets her parole officer and starts looking for a job - and also tries to repair her relationship with her little daughter Alexis, who in her absence was raised by her brother and his wife. It is going to be a very bumpy ride, as Sherry is a former heroine addict - and the hardships she faces make her crave a moment of articificial bliss... She will get however some help from another former convict/addict, Dean Walker (Danny Trejo).This is a very tough film, so tough that by moments I found it almost impossible to watch - especially in the most heartbreaking moments between Sherry and Alexis. I found this film more disturbing than most of the horrors I saw, even if finally not so much happens, other that day to day struggle of a broken, suffering human being.There are some hints about Sherry's past and they make this film even tougher to watch... but I will say no more here.The performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal is incredible and I am very surprised that she wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar. She very much carries this film on her shoulders - and other parts of her body, which she displays here a lot... After watching her in this film and in ""Secretary"" I am in awe of her talent and also of her courage, because she sure as hell doesn't pick easy roles... Danny Trejo gives also a great show in a rather atypical role. Giancarlo Esposito (of ""Breaking Bad"" fame) is also very good as a tough, no-nonsense parole officer.I would probably rate this film five stars if it was not for the very ending, which I found weak - almost as if the director didn't know how to wrap the film and decided to just rush it and get it over with.That being said, it is still a good, powerful drama and even if it shook me badly, I am glad that I discovered it.

"Well, I finally discovered this 1958 great classic and I LOVED it! After reading so many good feedback, I was wondering if it will be as good as expected - but I had no reasons to worry. IT IS THAT GOOD! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.IMPORTANT PRECISION: this is a Region 2 Europe PAL DVD - it will NOT work on standard US/Canada Region 1 NTSC equipment.Battle of Gazala, 1942. A British ambulance leaves Tobruk just before Afrika Korps cuts the city off. Five people are on board: Captain Anson (John Mills), a seriously shaken in battle officer from transport pool, his tough as nails chief NCO, mechanist sergeant major Tom Pugh (Harry Andrews), nurses Diana Murdoch (Sylvia Syms) and Denise Norton (Diane Clare) and an Afrikaner South African officer, Captain van der Poel (Anthony Quayle), who got separated from his unit and catches the ride with them to go to Alexandria. As Axis troops progress quickly, they have soon to leave the main road and cut through the most hostile regions of desert. This is how the film begins and the rest is the struggle of those five ill assorted people against the deadly dangeorus wilderness - and their own demons...The film begins slowly and in fact during the first ten minutes I was actually wondering what everybody saw in this film, but then it started catching momentum and I finally understood that everybody was right. It is a great film and a great story, with tragedy included but ultimately very uplifting.The scenario is strong. The ending, always the most vulnerable point, is VERY good. There is a lot of tension and drama. Characters are well shown, with their strengths and vulnerabilities. The one point slightly less good was the romance element - I somehow found it a little bit artificial, but it ultimately is not all so important to the plot. Finally, it is worth mentioning, that as in case of quite a lot of very good war films, in this one there is virtually no fighting...Actors were perfectly used. John Mills plays very well a tired, damaged man. Harry Andrews is excellent as the undestructible NCO. Sylvia Syms is impossibly cute and sexy - so is Diane Clare, who added to it the element of vulnerability. As for Anthony Quayle, well, he gives here his usual perfect performance - and it is also in this film that I finally realised how physically powerful this actor was!I will keep this review short on purpose, to avoid giving away any clues about the twists and turns, which add a lot to this film and which I never saw coming. I like to watch war films and I saw many, many hundreds of them - and this one is amongst the best. I recommend it with all my heart. ENJOY!Once you watched ""Ice cold in Alex"", if you are up for another terrible, heartbreaking trek through the desert roughly at the same moment, you should try ""A taxi for Tobruk"", a French 1960 film, with Lino Ventura, Charles Aznavour and Hardy Kruger. This is also a little jewel - albeit more brutal... Enjoy that one too - if you dare...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUOMEQD31DO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KRMZOW#wasThisHelpful","R2IUOMEQD31DO2","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this surprisingly deep and serious psychological and social drama disguised as a western. It certainly deserves to be better known than it is. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Steve Sinclair (Robert Taylor) is nowadays a farmer in a mountainous valley, but once he was a valiant soldier and a dangerous gunslinger. During the War Between States he fought for the Confederation and not just in any unit - he was one of the Quantrill Raiders, brave but quite pitiless secessionist guerrillas. The fact that he once rode with Quantrill tells us, that the action of the film takes place probably either in Missouri or in Kentucky (Arkansas is also a possibility). He rents his ranch from the main landowner and real power figure in the area, a certain Dennis Deneen (Donald Crisp), a man already aged but who still wears that crown...His peaceful life is however frequently disrupted by various incidents caused by his emotionally unstable and gun loving younger brother Tony (John Cassavetes). Tony can do his job when he wants and the film begins when he comes back from the expedition to sell the cattle, bringing a lot of money, as he didn't lose many animals on the way and got for the herd a better price than expected. But he also brings an unexpected guest into the house - Joan Blake (Julie London), a stunningly beautiful saloon girl, who looks for a new start in life and is ready to try her chance even with an immature, (and by the way younger than her), unstable and ultimately not very bright guy like Tony. The same day arrive also to the valley a gunman from Steve's past and a group of farmers, former Union soldiers, who have a claim on part of Steve's land. And then the film really begins.This is a surprisingly serious and dark movie, in which an almost oppressive feeling of approaching tragedy appears immediately in the first seconds. More than a western this is actually a psychological drama about a community which has to cope with the presence of a dangerous, irresponsible, childish, sociopath â€“ who still is nevertheless precious to many of themâ€¦ Then there is also social drama, about a terrible conflict of interests between farmers and cattle herders, magnified by the fact that both groups fought earlier on opposite sides in War Between Statesâ€¦ And then thrown in the middle there is also a former saloon girl, who is ready to do almost anything to just feel clean again when she wakes up in the morningâ€¦Actors offered a great show here, beginning with Robert Taylor who is very convincing as a reformed killer, a very dangerous man who doesn't have anything to prove anymore and who was very much pacified by a life of hardships... John Cassavetes is AMAZING as immature, unpredictable, gun crazy Tony, who just was born too late to go to war and somehow is unable to live peacefully. Julie London has a smaller part, but she adds a lot to this film, especially in the wonderful scene when she sings to Tony the beautiful ""Saddle the wind"" songâ€¦The scenario is strong and the result of the unavoidable final confrontation is both immensely tragic and quite logical. All the tragedies shown in this film are somehow underlined by the incredible beauty of the mountains, with its fields of wild flowers covering the slopes and old trees keeping watch over deep valleys.I liked this film a lot and I am glad that I bought and watched it.

"I LOVED this 1943 drama/romance/war film! It impressed and enchanted me. I don't have words strong enough to praise it. Below more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.The film begins somewhere around 1942 I think, with an old gentleman, Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey), a senior commander in Home Guard, taking some rest in Turkish bath before an important military exercise, which is supposed to start the next day. However, even if ""War starts at midnight"", a young hot shot lieutenant decides to break the rules and strike pre-emptively, capturing the old general when he wears nothing except his birthsuit. Terribly humiliated, general Wynne-Candy gets into a fight with the young officer - as they fall into water, we go back 40 years, to a time when a young hot shot lieutenant named Clive Candy, who distinguished himself in Boer War, just returned to England... And then the film really begins and takes us on a wonderful, albeit also frequently tragic, voyage through 40 years of life and service of an officer and gentleman, until it brings us finally back to the ""Turkish Bath Pre-emptive Strike of 1942""...)))This film is such a wonderful masterpiece that it is even hard to decide where to begin the praise, however, after some reflexion I believe that the greatest treasure is the scenario. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger based their film on a cartoon, which mocked mercilessly conservative British old-timers, symbolised by a certain Colonel Blimp, an overweight fellow commenting and lecturing (with utmost stupidity) on political and social events, always wearing for all clothes a towel wrapped around his prominent belly, as all conversations invariably took place in a Turkish bathâ€¦ Their great idea was however to take such a character and go back in time, to show him in his youth and then follow him all the way until the time when he achieved full Blimp-ness. The result is one of the most wonderful and touching life stories everâ€¦Casting was perfect, simply perfect. Roger Livesey did an amazing job, as well as Anton Walbrook, who plays Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, German alter ego of Clive Candy, who for most of this film is simultaneously his enemy, rival, opponent â€“ and best friendâ€¦ But it is Deborah Kerr who completes this film and makes it into such a masterpiece. She plays here three different women, but I cannot say anything more, because it would be revealing too much. I made some calculations and I realised that this was the 9th film with her that I saw â€“ and she always was perfect in all of themâ€¦This is a long film (163 minutes), because Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy lived a long and well filled life. I guarantee however that you will not see the time passing, as there is not even one scene too much.Churchill hated this film for some reason and even tried to stop its distribution, but I honestly would be at a loss to explain why, because this is not only a tribute but in fact a LOVE SONG for Merry Old England, conservatives, soldiers, patriotism, aged gentlemen, fair-play, hunting, love and marriage, honour, good liquor, stiff upper lip, Empire and general Britishness - and also Turkish bathsâ€¦))) All of it bathing (sorry, I couldn't resist) in clever, intelligent, wonderful, kind and very gentle but nevertheless absolutely omnipresent humour. The main character himself is incredibly attaching, even more so if you pay attention to one detail which is never explicitly explained â€“ when he was a young lieutenant, his name was Clive Candy, but later at one moment he changes his name into Clive Wynne-Candy. When I noticed that and realised WHY EXACTLY he did it, well, I had tears in my eyesâ€¦There is one and only one thing in this film which I didn't like and it was the treatment of Boer War. In 1902 Lieutenant Clive Candy goes to Germany to defend the honour of England after German Press started a campaign of denunciation of alleged British war crimes. Well, the problem is that Germans, this one time, were right on money! British troops indeed committed horrible atrocities against Boer civilians and prisoners of war and those crimes included the creation of first concentration camps in history! Now, I understand that it wasn't something one could say on the screen when the nation was fighting a merciless, total war â€“ but still, it is a very dark spot on an otherwise PERFECT thing!Bottom line, this is a wonderful film, a real treasure of world cinema and an incredibly beautiful, touching, moving, amusing and occasionally heart-breaking thing. I am definitely not a young girl (and not even a girl â€“ and not exactly even young anymore for that matter) but still, there were moments during this film when I had tears in my eyes. This is a thing to BUY, SEE, LOVE and KEEP for your children.

"I was quite favourably surprised by this 2013 Spanish-Canadian film, officially presented as horror. It is an original, clever and quite atmospheric thing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The film begins in 2008, at the worst moment of financial crisis, with a distraught stockbroker Jeffrey D'Asange (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) driving on a snowy road, with his children, three-year-old Victoria and one-year-old Lilly, in the backseat. They will ultimately arrive to an isolated, abandoned cabin in the woods - where very quickly it will become apparent, that SOMETHING already made this place it's den earlier... I will say nothing more about the story.This is a highly original film with some ideas which I never saw adapted to the screen. Guillermo del Toro produced with film and his influence is visible here, as you will probably recognise some elements from ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (which he directed) and ""Orphanage"" (which he produced). I would say that this film is more or less on the same level as ""Orphanage"" but somehow inferior to ""Pan' Labyrinth"". Also, as both those previous films, this is definitely a quite dark opus.Although officially a horror, this film quickly stops being scary (albeit it is definitely creepy until the end) and evolves into a psychological thriller with supernatural elements. As you will discover in the first minutes, there is without question a supernatural, dangerous entity in this film - but it is definitely NOT your standard issue monster from American straight to DVD Bminus movies. There is a deep conflict of interests here between human and not-really-human protagonists in ""Mama"" - and there is also the question of terrible, heart-breaking choices. This film didn't really scare me, but it kept me interested, tense and guessing how-the-heck-will-all-it-end until the very last seconds. The fact that fate of two little girls is the main object of the whole conflict makes the whole thing even more dramatic.Grown up actors (Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) did a honest job, but the film reposes in great part on the amazing performance of child actresses, Megan Charpentier (Victoria), who was 12 at that time and Isabelle Nelisse, who I think was not older than 7. The director managed to guide those two kids in an absolutely incredible way! Those two kids really will blow your mind!Bottom line, this is very honest, very watchable film, more psychological thriller with supernatural elements, than a real horror, but most certainly a very original thing. A recommended viewing!

"This is an impressive masterpiece of cinema and possibly the best vampire movie ever. Albeit very old, it is still not aged - and I think it never will. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.""Nosferatu"" is the first cinema adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", but as the producers were unable to acquire the rights to the title, it was decided to change the name of the main character to Graf (or Count) Orlok. Similarly the word ""vampire"" was replaced with ""nosferatu"", a term used in Romanian folk tales to design many kind of sinister forces of the night, which Bram Stoker considered in his book as a synonym of ""vampire"". Some other changes were also introduced, but the main story nevertheless follows the lines of Bram Stoker's book - with the exception of the ending...The film begins therefore with a certain Thomas Hutter, who lives in the fictitious German city of Wisborg and is a quite happy fellow, married to beautiful Ellen. Then one day his employer, a somehow shady real estate dealer named Knock, sends Hutter to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok, who desires to acquire a residence in Wisborg. And then the film REALLY begins...This being a black and white silent movie, it is of course very different from most of other vampire films - but this is precisely what gives it an unique flavour. F.W. Murnau used all the tricks available in his trade at this time to make this film really scary and especially incredibly atmospheric and he succeeded - BIG TIME! The vampire is in no way a dangerously charming aristocrat as in later films with Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee - here he is a freakishly creepishly grotesque creature, which makes the viewer feel uncomfortable from the first moment we see him. Actor Max Schreck who plays the vampire (and who by the way was a handsome man) was completely transformed by make up and other characterisation but he especially did an incredible job by using the body language in such a way that we really have an impression that Count Orlok is NOT human! This is an incredible performance!The performance of actors, the atmospheric music, the tricks of lights and shadows and impressive cinematography, all this contributed to make this film into something exceptionnal. Released in 1922 ""Nosferatu"" is a very old, even ancient thing, but it didn't really age and probably never will anymore, but to the contrary, it will keep haunting generation after generation of humans - exactly like a vampire...)))I am very glad that I bought and watched it and I intend to keep this DVD as long as DVD players exist. I don't have words strong enough to recommend it so I will just say, BUY IT, SEE IT and KEEP IT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXWQU9AOUVG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO2I6RO#wasThisHelpful","R3TXWQU9AOUVG1","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this 1941 film much more than I expected and I spend a really nice moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In 1940 a cocky, arrogant and rather immature American pilot Tim Baker (Tyrone Power) accepts to ferry Lockheed Hudson bombers to Britain, for the very generous fee of $1,000 per flight. In London, he meets his former British girlfriend Carol Brown (Betty Grable), who works in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force by day and stars in a nightclub by night. He tries to rekindle the relation, but she rebukes him strongly, as he treated her badly in the past. Treating all this as a challenge and a game, Baker decides to reconquer Carol, no matter what... And then the film really begins.As stated in the title, this is more a war-time romantic comedy than a war film, even if there is some fighting. The real topic of the film is not really war time adventures of Tim Baker but his attempts to get his girl back. It is an uphill battle, because he is kind of an @hole and Carol, who knows this side of him perfectly well, already found a more suitable replacement. But on another hand Tim is a dashing, attractive, dangerously charming @hole - and Carol still has feelings for him. This dance of seduction, attraction and repulsion is very nicely shown and gives the occasion for many excellent dialogs. There is also a lot of polite but nevertheless frequently very corrosive humour.The only film with Betty Grable I saw before that one was ""How to marry a millionnaire"", in which she was of course very charming but also somehow outstaged by Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall. It was therefore a very, VERY pleasant surprise for me to discover how great was this actress and with how much skill and charm she could deliver killer dialog lines. Skill, wit and charm, all inside a very pleasant frame, walking on never ending legs - well, small wonder that she was the number one pin-up girl during WWII, surpassing even Rita Hayworth... She is GREAT in this film - I will look for more of her movies.Albeit USA were not yet at war at the time of the release, the film contains also some strongly anti-German and pro-British propaganda, but also gives some insight in the early stages of WWII (1940-1941), showing how USA cheated in order to support Great Britain when preserving the appearances of neutrality, but also how ridiculous were the first RAF air raids against Germany. There is an almost unbelievable but nevertheless strictly true scene with British bombers crews throwing leaflets on Germany and taking great care to unpack them well, so nobody gets hurt on the ground... Well, it all changed quickly after the beginning of the Blitz...Bottom line, this is a very honest, surprisingly pleasant war-time romantic comedy - not any kind of masterpiece, but a good, solid, honest film and a nice watch. I will keep my DVD for another viewing in the future.

"I had some hopes for this 2003 American-Australian horror, but I found it disappointing and even boring. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The story takes place in the town of Darkness Falls, in Massachusetts (I think). A local legend tells about a disfigured woman, a lonesome widow, who liked to give town's children gifts and gold coins when they lost a tooth, thus earning her the name ""Tooth Fairy"". One day however she was wrongly accused of murder and lynched - but not before swearing vengeance and putting a curse upon the town. Legend has it that her dark spirit visits children on the night they lose their last baby tooth. However, should any person see her when she visits, they put themselves in great danger - and one day Kyle Walsh (Chaney Clay), a local teenager, realizes VERY clearly that the legend is not just a fable... The film really begins when Kyle, after many years spend out of town, returns (very reluctantly) to Darkness Fallss, summoned by Caitlin Greene (Emma Caulfield), on whom he used to have a major crush as a teenager. He is not happy about coming back and the town folks are not happy to see him either... I will not say more about the plot.I don't watch too many horrors, but I don't detest to see one from time to time and I like to pick those less known, as it is possible to find amongst them very watchable things, like ""Dead Birds"" or ""Vanishing on 7th street"" and occasionally even a real pearl, like ""The Dyatlov Pass Incident"". Here however this was not the case. The general idea was good and there is a couple of good scenes, but otherwise scenario is weak, the ""monster"" is revealed way too early, there is way to much predictable and clichÃ©d action scenes and definitely not enough atmospheric moments. I also found that the light and darkness game (it is crucial to have light to survive) was rather poorly used, much less skillfully than in ""Pitch Black"" or ""Vanishing on 7th street"". Also, dialogs are really, really lame - I cannot think of even one single one-liner worth quoting.The only possible reason to watch this film is if you want to see Emma Caulfield and remind yourself of all the happy Anya/Anyanka moments from ""Buffy the Vampire slayer"". She is a very beautiful and very gifted actress, but sadly she plays very little. Watching her, even in a bad movie, was still a pleasure - but if you want to see her really perform, you should try ""TiMER"", a very, very good albeit very, very little known clever and surprisingly profound 2009 SF romantic comedy.Bottom line, this is a failed movie, recommended only to the most rapid Emma Caulfield fans. I gave away my DVD immediately after watching it. AVOID!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFS2Y6BMHFA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008LUNW#wasThisHelpful","R2KFS2Y6BMHFA2","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked A LOT this 1967 half-serious neo-noir with Frank Sinatra. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) is a not very good and not entirely serious private detective operating in Miami. He is a former police officer with a major chip on his shoulder - albeit, rather than being really angry at the world he is instead slightly (or maybe not so slightly?) depressed, which causes him to engage in self-destructiuve behaviour, namely a gambling addiction large like from here to Mars... He still however keeps in touch with his old partner, Santini (Richard Conte), who stayed on the force and became a lieutenant. Eternal bachelor, Tony Rome lives alone on a boat named ""Straight Pass"" (I admit I don't understand what that name means...) One day, he catches a short, but well paid gig - bring discreetly home a young girl from good family, who was found morbidly drunk in a hotel. The money, he gets it for NOT saying to anybody the name of the hotel... This deceptively simple job will of course land him in an ocean of trouble... And I will say nothing more about the story.This film uses all the characters, techniques and tricks from old ""film noirs"" from 40s and 50s, but adds to it some flavours from 60s, like young junkies and heroine dealers. Strippers are shown openly in night clubs and there are some characters more or less openly homosexual (including an unpleasant drug dealer but also a surprisingly interesting stripper), there are references to racial problems in the South, etc.Sinatra was already 52 in this film and other than age, alcohol and more generally night life left already a mark on his face - but all of this actually helps him portray a badly-burnt-by-life, slowly aging private eye. The character he plays is actually, although flawed, is actually a rather likeable half-loser. Tony Rome is not against squeezing some extra money from rich client with some creative description of his activities, but on another hand he doesn't con his clients and refuses to engage in anything openly unethical (albeit sometimes reluctantly...). He leads his investigations using considerable wit and some deceptions and when he runs in trouble he gets away by ruse rather than by sheer force, as he is definitely not a very scary guy (Sinatra was barely 170 cm tall and of rather light build). If facing long odds, he will retreat or even surrender - but if forced to fight for his dear life, he still can use this small 0.38 rather well... But his greatest talent, is his tongue - he can talk most people into almost anything and himself out of almost anything.There is a lot of humour in this film, which, under the veneer of seriousness doesn't take itself very seriously and by moments goes even a little bit into a kind of self-parody. Dialogs are the greatest treasure of this film, together with the amazing shapes of the main female character, Ann Archer, played by Jill St. John, the sculpturally beautiful redhead who was going four years later to be one of the most interesting James Bond girls, in ""Diamonds are forever"". The presence of Gena Rowlands and Sue Lyon (of ""Lolita"" fame) add also a lot to this movie. And don't miss the opening song by none else than Sinatra's own daughter, Nancy.Last but not least, any feminist exposed to this film will scream in pain and die instantly...)))I found this film a mightily entertaining, clever and well done thing and I am very glad that I bought and watched it. The sequel, ""Lady in cement"", is on the same excellent level by the way and it is a good idea to watch this film first, as some characters return in the second film. I am so keeping this DVD.

"I am glad that I bought and read this book as it made me think and I also learned a lot. I count it as one of my most important recent readings in non-fiction. Below, more of my impressions.This is a detailed story of last months of World War II and first years of allied occupation in the region of Franconia, which nowadays is situated mostly in Bavaria, with some smaller parts belonging to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Thuringia and Hesse lÃ¤nders. The most important city of this region is Nuremberg.The book begins by the description of Alpenfestung hysteria which seized many allied commanders, beginning with Eisenhower, in the last months of war. It is a very useful introduction to the Franconian campaign, as it explains why Americans attached so much importance to advance as rapidly as possible towards the Alps. I also learned quite a lot from it.The real story starts however at the page 31, with chapter 2, aptly titled ""Fearful are the convulsions of defeat"". From that moment on, until the page 195, follows a very well written, dramatic and tense description of the last three months of war in Franconia, with American juggernaut advancing and German defenders trying to slow it down, by a desperate but very tenacious resistance â€“ quite frequently to the last bulletâ€¦ It may come as a surprise to many, that even at that last stage of WWII, German armed forces still could bite back in a very, very nasty way and not only with infantry weapons, but also with artillery, tanks and planes â€“ including jetsâ€¦ The resistance was reinforced both by the cruel repression by dying Nazi regime but also by the fear of unpredictable behaviour of Americans, who occasionally killed German prisoners as soon as they surrendered.The last two chapters are particularly interesting as they describe little known and poorly explored topics. German resistance against American occupation in Franconia is the subject of chapter ""Struggle until five after twelve"" â€“ it deals with the Werwolf groups and local saboteurs but also with the much more important unarmed and non-violent reactions against occupiers. The issue of difficult relations between Germans and former Nazi slaves from occupied countries (including Jews who survived the Holocaust) is the subject of the last chapter ""There can be no return to normality"" â€“ and it is a particularly tough subject.The subject treated in ""Endkampf 1945"" is of course quite nightmarish, with heart-breaking human suffering present on every single page, but still it is a very readable book, not only comprehensively researched but also very well written. I learned a lot from it. It also clearly inspired more research on the issue. The famous study ""The End. The defiance and destruction of Hitler's Germany 1944-45"" by Ian Kershaw clearly owns A LOT to this book and I would advise to read ""Endkampf 1945"" before ""The End"".I am very glad that I bought and read this book and I am definitely going to keep it. A precious, recommended reading to anybody interested in WWII.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7VQC8DG1FAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813123259#wasThisHelpful","R2R7VQC8DG1FAD","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good and well written but quite dark novel. I am glad that I bought and read it. I cannot however say that I enjoyed it, because this is a rather grim opus - a little bit as if ""A town like Alice"" went to the dark side... Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Australia, somewhere around 1955. Alan Duncan, an Australian in his early 40s is a lawyer by education and also a decorated veteran of WWII - he fought as pilot in RAF and lost both his feet when his plane was downed during the famous battle which took place on 1 January 1945 (Operation ""Bodenplatte""). After studying in England and travelling through the world he is now returning home to his wealthy parents' prosperous sheep station (ranch) Coombargana in Australia. However, as soon as he arrives, he learns that an unexpected tragedy happened - his parents housekeeper, an English young woman named Jessie Proctor, was discovered dead the same morning. It seems that she killed herself but nobody can understand why and gradually it becomes obvious that nobody really knew anything about Jessie Proctor's past... That takes care of like first five pages - and then the book really begins.When writing this book Neville Shute was already a successful and quite well known writer - if I am not mistaken it was his 21st published novel. This is definitely the work by a fully matured writer, experienced, confident and not afraid of hurting reader's feelings.After finishing it, I really had the impression that I just read a dark twin of ""A town like Alice"" (which was published five years earlier) as there are many similarities. I really cannot go more into details about those similarities, because I would then reveal too much and this book is essentially a long travel in the search of truth - which is not fully revealed before the last chapter. You must therefore make this voyage of discovery yourself...As suggested by the title of my review, which is also a quote from the book, one of the main themes of this novel is how war keeps killing people long after it ended. Another one, even more shocking, is how much some people miss the war, once it is ended - in fact large fragments of this book could have for title this archi-famous piece of German black humour from years 1944-45 ""Let's enjoy the war, the peace will be terrible""... But I will not say anything more here - all this you will have to discover too...One precision here, for those who are not very familiar with history - a wren is of course a bird, but during WWII the nickname of ""wrens"" was given to members of Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). WRNS soldiers didn't go to combat, but performed a lot of difficult, dangerous and highly important tasks for Royal Navy, like handling munitions and repairing guns (Ordnance Wrens). Quite unavoidably their barracks were generally known as ""wrenneries""...))) At one moment you will also see appearing in the text the ""priests"" - this was the British nickname of 105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M7, the main self-propelled gun of allied artillery during WWII.Being a military history maniac I must stress that there is a couple of impossibilities in the text. There never were German female soldiers fighting on the front during WWII and there never were any German infiltrators in civilian clothes, male or female, used during the battle of Normandy. Also at one moment, just before suffering his crippling wounds during operation ""Bodenplatte"" (1 January 1945), the narrator tells us that German fighters Focke-Wulf Ta-152 were better than anything that allies could put in the air - not only that statement is highly disputable, but especially no such plane was ever used in combat or even seen by the allies before 14 April 1945... That being said, even those mistakes don't affect in any way my five star rating and I stop here my military history maniac ravings...Bottom line, I am glad that I bought and read this book, even if it is ultimately a rather sad thing. I will keep it preciously on the shelf for my children, once they are old enough. I also think that it could make a really great film in the hands of a good director.

"I was somehow disappointed by this film, even if it was watchable. Considering all the names in the credits (director, producers, screenwriters, actors) I expected a lot - and I got ultimately not so much. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), a rather unpleasant fellow, is a British intelligence operative assigned to Panama, soon after USA handled the control of the Canal to Panama government. Looking for potential sources of information, he finds a British expatriate named Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), who is a quite successful tailor and has for clients many of Panama's elite, including the President. Pendel is also married to Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), who works as the assistant to the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority. Sensing a perfect source, Osnard decides to either induce or coerce Pendel into working for him - it will be the beginning of a very interesting relationship... And then the film really begins...The scenario is based on a book written by John Le Carre (he also co-wrote the scenario and co-produced the film), a renowned and successful author of spy novels - even if I personally never really liked any of his books which I tried to read. However, for ""Tailor of Panama"" (which I didn't read), Le Carre found inspiration in an older novel, ""Our man in Havana"" written in 1963 by Graham Greene - a book which I actually read and rather enjoyed. The similarities between those two books are so great, that I really think that if LeCarre didn't have the rights for ""Our man in Havana"", well, he simply committed a blatant plagiarism - and somehow got away with it...Not only was the scenario written by a renowned author, but the film was directed and produced by John Boorman in person, the man who made three of my most favorite movies (""Excalibur"", ""Hell in the Pacific"" and ""Emerald Forest"") as well as the extremely famous ""Point Blank"" and ""Deliverance"" (both of which I personally didn't like that much) - and yes, also the incredibly bad ""Exorcist II"". To my regret however John Boorman didn't make a good film since 1985 - and that one is, sadly, just a confirmation that he mostly ended his glorious period of creation with ""Emerald Forest"".Actors of course are great and they all do very well, including Brendan Gleeson, Catherine McCormack (remember her from ""Braveheart""?) and Leonor Varela cast in secondary roles. Fans of Harry Potter will be able to catch a glimpse of young Daniel Radcliffe, who just a couple of months later was going to start his schooling at Hogwarts - me, I must admit, I completely missed him and realized that he was in this film only when the credits started to roll...But all this combined talent failed to produce a really good film. I believe that the biggest mistake made by the producers (who were also in charge of scenario and directing) was the inability to decide what this film should be. It is definitely too dark and not funny enough for a comedy and it is definitely NOT serious enough for a real espionage thriller. Trying to stretch itself between those two extremities this film simply felled apart. This is especially visible in the second half, when the whole plot descends into humungous idiocy. At the end I was actually quite relieved that it is finally over.One of the things which I really didn't like, was the usual bashing of USA. The film acknowledges that Americans toppled the Noriega regime and reestablished democracy in Panama - at the expense of some their soldiers dying in the process. It also states loud and clear that just a year earlier USA, without being forced into it in any way, gave away the Canal to Panama government. And yet somehow they are shown as the source of all evil in the world... Sure, whaling on Americans is fun and also safe (unlike so many others they usually don't shoot people who merely mock them) - but it ultimately gets boring, especially when it is so unfair...Still, most of this film is watchable, if only for the actors. Casting Pierce Brosnan as a mean, nasty and rotten alter ego of James Bon was of course a good joke. Geoffrey Rush is always a pleasure to watch in anything. Jamie Lee Curtis is still very good looking in this film and shows even some skin from time to time. Brendan Gleeson plays an obscene drunk with a great commitment and Catherine McCormack earns definitely her paycheck with some bed action... There are also a couple of good lines - although ultimately not so many.So bottom line this is a film watchable once, if you don't expect too much from it, mostly for the performance of the three main actors. Watch at your own risk - who knows, maybe you will like it more. Me, I don't think I will keep the DVD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I40NJWY3XF7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPTUO14#wasThisHelpful","R2I40NJWY3XF7S","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spend a nice, relaxing moment watching this very honest comedy, even if it is not any kind of masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.British art curator Harry Deane (Colin Firth) works for a morbidly rich and horribly abusive man, media mogul Lord Lionel Shabandar (Alan Rickman). After years of suffering he decides to take revenge on his boss, by using his one Achilles heel - Monet. Indeed Shabandar is obsessed with Monet's paintings and especially he was hunting for years and years for a little known piece known as ""Haystacks at Dusk"", which was plundered by Goering in 1940, but vanished since 1945. To succeed Deane teams up with a master art forger known as the Major (Tom Courtenay) and a rodeo girl from Texas, a certain PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), the granddaughter of American sergeant who supposedly was the last man to see the painting in 1945... The plan is to sell a supposedly miraculously found painting to Shabandar for a ridiculous amount of money... Of course, no plan survives intact the first moments of battle and therefore from the beginning virtually everything will go wrong...))) That covers the first two minutes of the film and then the story really begins.This is the remake of a 1966 comedy under the same title with Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine. I admit with some shame that I didn't see this film and therefore I cannot compare them - but this 2012 remake was quite entertaining and well done.All the four main actors did really very well and once Stanley Tucci appears, in a couple of short but significant cameos, he is absolutely irresistible too...))) The scenario for this 2012 version was written by Coen brothers and you can instantly feel it, as characters are well worked out, dialogs are quite good and jokes are funny. There is only one scene in which the humour flies a little bit lower (it involves an embarassing wet spot on the pants of one of the characters) but it is not a very long one. There is no obscenities and nothing gross - in fact the film is so dignified, that one lonely f@rt joke sounds with nobility of a national anthem...))) There are also some rather surprising twists and the ending is not bad at all.Summa summarum I liked this film, I laughed a lot and I spend a nice relaxing moment watching it. I may even keep the DVD for another viewing in the future.

"I found this film excellent on all levels and even more - it impressed me. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) are a middle-aged couple who live in suburban New York City with their young son. One day, when shopping in New York, Connie is surprised by a windstorm and very literally bumps into a certain Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a young Frenchman carrying a great pile of books... This is as much as I am going to say about the story, because you deserve to discover all the rest by yourself.This is the remake of 1968 French film ""La femme infidele"", which I didn't see and therefore cannot compare them. However, considering that ""Unfaithful"" really impressed me, I am quite certain that it didn't dishonour the original movie. From the synopsis of ""Le femme infidele"" which I read, it is clear that Adrian Lyne followed the original plot quite closely, albeit some details were of course changed.This film impressed me in many ways. First, the choice of three main actors was dead on target and the way they were used was nearly perfect. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez (a genuine French actor by the way) are excellent but to describe the performance of Diane Lane, well, there is simply no words (great legs too)! Rarely was an Oscar nomination as much deserved as the one she got for her role in this film - it is just pity she didn't get the prize...The scenario is strong, very strong indeed, without any weakness I could notice. The pace of events is initially deceptively slow, before picking up and accelerating - and then slowing again. This is actually exactly how it should be, because this affair is shown as a kind of ""highway to hell"" - and once the infernal flames are reached and make their job, picking up the pieces is quite obviously slower than the disaster itself... Mentioning here hell is very appropriate, as the seductor and tempter in this film has to him a very Mephistophelian charm - and certainly a terrific, highly efficient, obviously well-rehearsed predatory seduction technique... And, quite appropriately, he is a (charming) bringer of mayhem and a tool of destruction...The filming technique is impressively good, like the incredible use of the windstorm and the train trips opening and closing chapters of the tale, but also all other tricks known to experienced and gifted directors. Intimacy is shown in a tasty, erotic and yet dignified way - even when really rough, primal, quasi animal sex is involved. There is not even one scene vulgar, gross or obscene - even if the abject immorality of the behaviour of two lovers is made quite obvious.All the eroticism and some occasional discreet humour notwithstanding, this is nevertheless an absolutely heart-breaking tragedy - as it should be. Infidelity is first and before anything else a betrayal - and those make always for painful tales... The film is not highly judgmental, even if it shows clearly the infidelity as a destructive and ultimately repugnant thing. But it also shows, with sadness, that once you got the trifecta of normal life made of family, job and mortgage, well, this fife itself unavoidably steals something from even the most loving couples - and no matter how much you love your family, the urge, the want, the thirst for what was lost, can be virtually irresistible...LITTLE SPOILER HERE! The ending is deliberately vague, even slightly more so than in the original. Ending a film without a clearly cut solution is always a risky thing (quite frequently it misfires) - but here, I believe it fits just perfectly! The ending is a kind of Rorschach test - once you watched it, you will end the story according to whatever you find in your heart.At the risk of repeating myself, let's say it again - this film IMPRESSED ME! It will break your heart and it may not be exactly a thing to enjoy, but this is one of those movies TO SEE ABSOLUTELY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WI4DDQ46GHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006RCNY#wasThisHelpful","R22WI4DDQ46GHG","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for this film, but I was left very unsatisfied at the end - and this is a pity because a lot of good work was done there and all actors did a good job and I have nothing to say against their performance. I was a little surprised that the main character is a rather obscure advisor, Kenneth O'Donnell, who played very little role in the crisis - but it was a very minor point.However the typically Hollywoodian visceral anti-militarism (targeting almost exclusively US Army) really damaged this movie beyond repair. ""Thirteen days"" looks more like a remake of Dr Strangelove than a tale about real history. All American generals and admirals are presented as warmongers who just dream about a full scale nuclear confrontation with USSR and try their best to push Kennedy to war, even by using provocations to sabotage the actions of their own President - who is their Commander-in-Chief! Somewhere in the middle of the movie the viewer is invited to see the US military as the real villains of the story - and for anybody who has some knowledge of real history it is obvious that this view of the Cuban crisis is simply ludicrous! And the worst and the most biased treatment is reserved to two very eminent and highly efficient generals.General Maxwell Davenport Taylor (played in this movie by Bill Smitrovich) commanded very brilliantly the 101st Airborne Division during the Second World War (he jumped on Normandy with his men), then he was the commander of West Point academy, before becoming the Army Chief of Staff. In this quality he carried Eisenhower's orders sending troops to escort black students to just desegregated schools in Arkansas. Taylor was however opposed to Eisenhower's over-reliance on nuclear weapons, considering that increased the risk of a nuclear confrontation, and it cost him ultimately his job. His career took off again with the arrival of Kennedy's. General Taylor became a close personal friend with both Kennedy brothers, to the point that Robert Kennedy named his son Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy. His loyalty to the Kennedy clan was total and never questioned and was ultimately rewarded by the nomination to the post of Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, position which he held during the Cuban crisis. Or, in the movie, general Taylor is portrayed like a scheming rascally warmonger, all to his joy at the idea of a possible nuclear war - and both Kennedy's distrust him totally! Which is simply false - you do not name your children after people who are plotting against you!An even worse treatment is reserved to general Curtis Emerson Le May (played by Kevin Conway), who during the Cuban Crisis was the Chief of Staff of US Air Force. General Le May was a great hero of World War II, directing first the strategic bombings against III Reich (1942-1944) and then the similar operations against Japan (1944-45). After the war he organized the air bridge to Berlin in 1948, giving the Free World victory in its first confrontation with Soviet Union. Then he was charged with organization of Strategic Air Command (SAC), which he created virtually from nothing starting in 1948, until it became the most efficient deterrent against Soviet threat for the rest of the Cold War. General Le May was a man of very strong opinions and he clashed verbally many times with all the presidents under which he served, from Roosevelt to Johnson - and he certainly was a difficult subordinate, frequently arguing with general Taylor (his boss) during the Cuban Crisis. But although he spend all his career bitching, complaining and yelling against the orders he received, he was never insubordinate and once definite orders were issued, he would follow them to the letter and do the job to the end. And this is what he did during the Cuban Crisis! Although a difficult subbordinate, he was also a very charismatic man and he was not devoid of a specific harsh humor - once when a guard asked him to extinguish his cigar when coming close to a bomber which just refueled, because the plane could explode, gen. Le May just growled: ""It would not dare!"". Or in this movie he is portrayed as a stupid, mindless, moronic warmonger, who together with general Taylor is plotting to start the war against USSR!The movie is not entirely bad, but the excessive anti-militarism and especially the horrible and unjust treatment reserved to those two great soldiers made that I was disgusted when it finally ended. I believe the real fair and balanced movie about Cuban Crisis still remains to be made.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWI9KHNHFUHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005U1XK#wasThisHelpful","RFWI9KHNHFUHQ","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was favourably surprised by this 2000 SF/action movie as against my expectations it was fun to watch it. Of course it is not any kind of masterpiece, but a quite honest, solid thing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Earth, in the near future. The cloning of animals and human organs is now a routine thing and it certainly helped solve the problem of world hunger and also saved lives of countless millions of humans. However cloning entire humans is strictly prohibited by ""Sixth Day"" laws (because on the 6th day God created Man â€“ and most voting citizens are still reluctant to play God). In this finally rather pleasant future world lives a certain Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a pilot and owner of a small flying company (two very futuristic helicopters). The company does rather well, but still it is a small business and therefore Gibson and his business partner and fellow pilot Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) take any (legal) contract they can get. When the film begins, the skiing season just started and for the last couple of days Gibson and Morgan were flying experienced, wealthy skiers to the top of some harsh mountains, from where a demanding but rewarding descent can be enjoyed.Then a special customer hires them for such a skiing trip, Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn), a prominent billionaire who made fortune in biotechnologies and especially organ cloning. Drucker seems to be a rather likeable fellow, albeit he is renowned for being as tough businessman as he is a great skier. He was in the past the target of numerous assassination attempts by Christian fundamentalist extremists and therefore he is a little bit paranoid when his security is concerned â€“ for that reason both Gibson and Morgan must first undergo blood and eye tests, before they get this very generously paid contract. Drucker requests also specifically that Gibson, a very experienced and renowned pilot (it is hinted at one moment that he is ex-military) is the one who flies him, his skis and his heavily armed bodyguard to the mountains â€“ where, unknown to both Drucker and Gibson, a great danger awaits them... And this is at that moment that the introduction ends and the film really beginsâ€¦When this film was produced, Schwarzenegger was at a rather difficult moment in his career, because he didn't make a really good film since ""True Lies"" (1994), even if the rather weak ""Eraser"" (1996) and mostly disappointing ""End of days"" (1999) made some money. Being one of co-producers of ""6th day"", he certainly made an effort to reverse this downslide movement in quality by using some elements of his past great successes â€“ for that reason this film looks by moments like a little brother of ""Total Recall"" (of course the original one, not this Colin Farrell abomination). There are also some elements concerning Gibson's family life which seem to be taken straight from ""True Lies"". In some scenes (and not only action scenes) there are moments in which Schwarzenegger clearly winks to the public with discreet and amusing references to ""Terminator"" and there are also some elements taken from an even greater (and totally Schwarzenegger-free) SF film, ""Blade Runner"".There is quite a lot of lighter moments in this film and humour is mostly good, never gross or really vulgar, albeit some scenes with Hank Morgan's last model Virtual Girlfriend are a little bitâ€¦ let's say ""osÃ©"" (or steamy, if you are allergic to French). This film coming after the Monika Lewinsky scandal, there is a SORRY SPOILER HERE discreet suggestion that Hillary Clinton is the current president of United States â€“ and that her first decision was to make cigar smoking into a federal offenseâ€¦))) â€¦))) â€¦)))This film being about human replication (because what is done in this film is definitely MORE than simple cloning), there was also the potential for more humour and the director didn't miss it. I will not go into details, but when there are two identical copies of the same guy and they have to share just one (completely unaware of the situation) wife (Wendy Crewson), that creates some hilarious scenes. Also, together with ""Last Action Hero"", this is the only film which gives us two Schwarzeneggers for the price of one â€“ and that means great savings per kilo of meatâ€¦))) â€¦))) â€¦)))The villains contribute a lot to this film. Other than the main master puppeteer (whose identity is classified) the bad guys are essentially the four mysterious assassins who at one moment will enter Gibson's life. Their leader is a butt ugly but well-spoken and smart thug named Robert Marshall (Michael Rooker, of ""Guardian of Galaxy"" fame). He is efficiently assisted by a handsome colossal blackguard (in all possible meanings of this word), fridge raider and beer aficionado Vincent Bansworth (Terry Crews, of ""Expendables "" fame, for whom it was the first role ever). He is also very INEFFICIENTLY assisted by P. Wiley (Rodney Rowland, of no fame at all), a skinny white jerk and blundering wannabe killer with stupid hairdo.But the best villain is the fourth assassin, Talia Elsworth (Sarah Wynter). I always had a thing for mean girls and as a connoisseur I can honestly say that Talia is one of the most appealing specimens of physically fit total bitch I saw in years. Hot, lean, mean, expensively dressed, wearing the purple wig straight from ""UFO"" series, moving with the grace of a wildcat and spitting venom like a ""Naja ashei"", unafraid of exposing her assets on the screen, tenacious as drug-resistant syphilis and vicious like a flesh eating virus, well, Jesus Jehovovich Christ, this character is a treasure and I LOVED HER from the first moment!Albeit they certainly mean business, those four assassins, who have secrets of their own, also provide some precious humoristic moments.There are also some other treasures in this film, beginning with a rather good role of Robert Duvall, who was of course in it just for a paycheck, but still brought a lot into the whole endeavour. There are also some more serious moments in this SF/action B movie, including a surprisingly grave reflection on mortality vs. immortality dilemma, the immense power that some future technology could give to a totalitarian regime and a much more complicated than usual character of the lone Christian fundamentalist terrorist who at one moment appears in the film (his identity is well concealed, so I will not say anything more about him). Even the villains have their tale to tell and murderous and evil though they may be, they can also inspire some pity once we know the whole story (but ultimately not enough to deserve mercy). Now, of course, let's say it again, this is just a SF/action B movie â€“ but there are also some little elements in it that could come straight from a Philip K. Dick novel.Finally, there are some twists in the film, which are rather well done, even if of course we should not expect the kind of surprises like in ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Usual Suspects"". Those twists actually explain towards the end of the film some of the things which seem to be plot holes in the beginning â€“ so be patient with ""6th day"", it is much less silly than it seems in the first half an hour. And the ending is actually not so bad at all â€“ much better than it could be expected.I am little bit surprised that this film bombed at the box office. Granted, as of today, in the Year of Grace 2015, Schwarzenegger STILL didn't make a really good movie since ""True Lies"" â€“ but ""6th day"", with its humour, twists, fast action, some more serious reflection, quite good villains and rather satisfying ending is still the best of his efforts in all those years. I liked it and I will keep the DVD for another viewing in the future.

"I was very disappointed by this film and I regret that I watched it, as it was a waste of time and money. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Adapted from a succesful Broadway musical this film combines and re-tells in a very different way classical fairy tales ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", and ""Rapunzel"". The heroes from all the four stories meet and interact with considerable help from a witch (Meryl Streep), a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt), who are the central characters in the whole story.The initial idea was of course great, but the execution was very, very poor indeed. Most of the story is really boring and the second half of it is simply nonsensical. Almost all characters are more or less unpleasant and the one more or less honest guy is pale and hapless. Acting is wooden and uninspired, with even Meryl Streep going mostly through the motions, without real commitment. Only Johnny Depp (who plays the slightly paedophiliac Big Bad Wolf) put some effort in his acting, but his screentime is very, very limited, hardly more than a cameo. There are some unpleasant moments, with the worst of them SPOILER ALERT HERE! being the scene in which baker's wife becomes pregnant with child. Last but not least, most of the film is joyless, humourless (there is ONE and ONLY ONE good joke, delivered by the Prince Charming played by Chris Pine) and towards the end simply depressing.This is supposedly a musical film but the songs are very, very poor and even worse, most of the actors cannot really sing and perform them badly. The WORST of them is the song executed (because definitely not performed) by two Princes Charming (the one from Cinderella played by Chris Pine and the one from Rapunzel played by Billy Magnussen) - in the cinema in which me and my wife watched this film, there was a lot of loud comments, surprised whispering and many bursts of unbelieving laughter at that moment, so awfully embarassing was this thing.Even to stay until the end of this thing was an ordeal - at 124 minutes it is already a long thing, but it seemed much, much longer. For me and my wife this film really spoiled a large part of our date (and with our kids being still little we don't have so many of those). The only good thing about this film is that it is easy to forget...

"Ever since I saw it for the first time in my childhood in communist Poland l always liked this 1964 surrealistic Czechoslovak comedy, parodying mercilessly but so skilfully the old westerns from the 20s and 30s. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In a lawless town, filled with scum and villainy, the most successful business is Trigger Whiskey Saloon, owned by a certain Doug Badman (Rudolf Deyl), an ignoble scoundrel who happens to be also the producer and distributor of Trigger Whiskey, a horribly potent (and certainly toxic) but cheap liquor, more or less an imitation of real whiskey... He is seconded by an obscenely ugly, repugnant and not very bright desperado, Gunslinger Grimpo, a.k.a. Old Pistol (Josef Hlinomaz). Another attraction of the Trigger Whiskey Saloon is a gorgeously voluptuous raven haired singer, Tornado Lou (Kveta Fialova), who probably committed every sin in the book - but still refuses to sleep with her boss...The population of the town spends all the money in Trigger Whiskey Saloon and refuses to even hear the calls for temperance and other virtues preached by the hapless Reverend Ezra Goodman (Bohus Zahorsky) and his immaculately virginal blond daughter Winnifred (Olga Schoberova). But all this changes when a stranger clad in shining white clothes arrives to town - his name is Lemonade Joe (Karel Fiala), he is an invincible gunfighter and the secret of his invincibility resides in his total abstinence. He drinks only a healthy lemonade known as Kolaloka and with the support of Goodman family he opens in the town a new, totally alcohol free joint.Doug Badman's business quickly declines - however, when he is already preparing to leave town, a new stranger arrives, a well (and darkly) dressed, perfectly groomed and gentlemanly mannered prestidigitator/gunman/poker player known as Hogofogo (Milos Kopecky), a villain infinitely more villainous than anything previously known in the Wild West... For reasons of his own he is willing to help Doug Badman in his confrontation with Lemonade Joe. And then the film really begins...Czech cinema is known in the West mostly for the serious dramas, like ""Loves of a blonde"" and ""Closely watched trains"". Czech comedies on another hand are virtually terra incognita for the Western public and it is a pity, because many of them are absolute treasures: ""Four Murders Are Enough, Darling"" (1970), ""I Killed Einstein, Gentlemen"" (1970), ""How to Drown Dr. Mracek, the Lawyer"" (1975), ""Marecek, Pass Me the Pen!"" (1976), ""Dinner for Adele"" (1977) and ""Waiter, scarper!"" (1980). To that list must be added also the absolutely classical adaptations of Jaroslav Hasek novels, ""The Good Soldier Schweik"" (1956) and ""I dutifully report"" (1957). ""Lemonade Joe or the Horse Opera"" is therefore in good company, as one of the best comedies in a cinema which really, REALLY knew how to make them!This is a comedy and even if some critics tried to find in it some hidden depths and messages, in fact there is hardly any - this is almost pure entertainment, of the most irreverent and anarchic kind, with burlesque and grotesque struggling for dominancy in every single scene. Already the very idea of trying to sell abstinence to Czech viewers, whose birthplace build its identity mostly on those twin pillars that are Pilsner and Budweiser, is a highly hilarious endeavour. ALMOST nothing is serious in this film and the one and only serious thing is itself a joke - I will come to it in a moment...Technically the film looks quite a lot like the earliest westerns - it is a black and white thing, with accelerated fights and horse riding and the frequently exaggerated acting, seeming to come from mute films. Also as in many mute comedies the main character accomplishes some obviously impossible stunts and like in musicals, when he sings occasionally all his enemies wait patiently for him to finish...The irreverent and anarchic character of this film comes mostly from the fact that if the villains are quite naturally ridiculed, the ""good guys"" are not spared either, maybe with the exception of Reverend Goodman, whose screen time is however quite limited. Lemonade Joe himself hides a secret and even if he is 97,5% of disinterested goodness, he still wants his reasonable and probably well deserved cut of benefits. As for the angelic Winnifred, her eagerness to be freed from the burden of her virginity is absolutely hilarious...))) The villains themselves are full of surprises, not the least of which are the spiritual (and also a little bit carnal) torments of Tornado Lou, the ""fallen woman"" who falls for the pure hero... The final revelations and the final fate of almost everybody in this film achieves to put to grave any pretention to seriousness - even more easily so, as that part of the film happens in a cemetery...)))The accumulation of revelations and twists in the great finale, with every next one being more outrageous than the precedent, is completely over the top and hilarious but paradoxically this is also the one (short) moment in which this film becomes a little more serious. It must be kept in mind, that even if communist Czechoslovakia was economically rather more successful than most of Eastern Bloc, it was nevertheless an oppressive dictatorship, in which every single film, book, song etc. had to be approved by official censorship office. Also, in order to get funds to make films, directors and screenwriters had frequently to include official propaganda, part of which was the condemnation of capitalism and criticism of American life style and values. Seemingly, the makers of this film obliged the communist authorities, even obliged them very much - but in reality the sheer accumulation of such a number of ""anti-capitalist"" elements, showed in such a cheesy way and in such a rapid succession completely reversed the effect...)))The final result is that the makers of this film pulled a fast one on communist censorship, turning in ridicule the ""official line"" of propaganda, with the authorities being the only ones to not notice that - unlike everybody else...))) I do not blame the communist authorities too much however for missing that point, because, to my enormous surprise, after reading some reviews and articles concerning ""Lemonade Joe"", some left-oriented Western viewers also took all this to the face value and actually sincerely believe that this merry anarchic comedy is a ""denunciation of capitalism, consumerism and American way of life, religion included"" ...))) ...))) ...)))Bottom line, this is a very amusing, very unusual, hilarious, surrealistic, over the top and (almost) completely not serious and extremely well made horse opera..., err, I mean western comedy...))) I recommend it with all my heart and I am totally keeping my DVD for another viewing.

"I enjoyed this book a lot and I learned a lot from it, both about the internal workings of FDR administration from 1939 to 1941, but also about many details of war time relations between USA and other powers, especially United Kingdom and Soviet Union.In this book we follow the travels and works of five most eminent amongst war time FDR's ""missi dominici"". Following missions are covered:1) Sumner Welles voyage to Italy, Germany, France and United Kingdom, February-March 1940.2) Colonel William â€œWild Billâ€ Donovan's visit in United Kingdom in July-August 1940.3) Harry Hopkins mission to United Kingdom in January-February 19414) Wendell Wilkie voyage to United Kingdom and Ireland in January-February 19415) Averell Harriman's mission to United Kingdom, Africa and Middle East in March-July 1941.6) Harry Hopkins mission to United Kingdom in July 1941, followed immediately by the dramatic and extremely dangerous voyage to Soviet Union and then the preparation of the Churchill-Roosevelt meeting in Placentia Bay in August 1941.This is a very interesting, very well written book, containing mostly facts and just as much analysis as it is necessary - there is virtually no filler at all. There is a lot of anecdotes and lighter moments and also quite a lot of information about practical details, all of which allows us to almost feel history being made in front of us. This is one of those books from which it is possible to learn a lot and still enjoy the reading.I couldn't find much to disagree with in this book, maybe just with the exception of the importance author seems to attach to Atlantic Chart - it is presented as the main result of the meeting in Placentia Bay, but in fact it was just a side business and more of a propaganda operation. The pages about the Placentia Bay meeting are actually the only part of this book which is a little bit weaker - for all those who are interested in this event, I warmly recommend to read ""The First Summit"" by Theodore A. Wilson published in 1969.I came out of the reading of this book with even more respect for FDR, who clearly was a very, very shrewd politician and a master manipulator of men. It is just pity that in 1945 at Yalta he was a dying man and he had no strength to stand up to Kremlin more than he did - he couldn't save the Central Europe, already occupied by Soviets, but at least maybe he wouldn't accept delivering to Stalin those hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens who found themselves in Western Europe at the end of the war...I also learned quite a lot about Churchill, some of those things very surprising - playing from a position of weakness he didn't hesitate to use EVERY single tool in his box to tie himself stronger to Americans and gain a more favourable approach from Rossevelt's envoys... You will have to read this book to learn more (juicy) details...This is a really good book, I am glad that I bought and read it and I will keep it preciously on the shelf, next to ""The First Summit"" and ""The Conquerors"" by Michael R. Beschloss.

"I always liked this 1965 western comedy and recently I was pleased to see that it didn't age - at all! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Catherine Ballou (Jane Fonda) is a very respectable young lady who studied hard to become a schoolteacher and is returning now by train to Wolf City, Wyoming, near which her father, Frankie Ballou (John Marley), owns a ranch. After the voyage which is a little bit more eventful than she expected, she arrives home, just to find that her father is in serious trouble. Somebody wants to chase Frankie Ballou from his ranch and a terrifying professional killer, Tim Strawn (Lee Marvin), known for his legendary skills with gun â€“ and also for his fake noseâ€¦ In order to protect her father, she hires another legendary gunfighter, Kid Shelleen (also Lee Marvin) â€“ but once the latter arrives, she starts to have doubts if it was really wiseâ€¦ And then the film really beginsâ€¦The treasures of this film are many, beginning with Jane Fonda, who is at her most beautiful here. The narration is made in songs and the narrators, very much present on the screen, are two â€“ Professor Sam the Shade, played by comic Stubby Kaye and especially Sunrise Kid, played by Nat King Cole in person. A rather clueless cattle rustler and his surprisingly young, insanely happy and extremely ""zen"" uncle add a lot to the show, as does also an assimilated, educated and very well spoken Indian, named Jackson Two Bears.But THE greatest asset is of course Kid Shelleen (""Then there came to town, a gun deadly and frightening / A gun quicker than lightening, fasted gun you've seen. / It was the gun in the hand of Eli 'Kid' Shelleen.""). Lee Marvin got a very deserved Oscar for playing this absolutely U-N-F-O-R-G-E-T-T-A-B-L-E character! I am quite certain that if Nat King Cole didn't register his immortal hit already in 1951, he would do it in 1965 in tribute to Kid Shelleen â€“ although the rhythm would be probably a little bit less pop and a little bit more countryâ€¦)))This is a good, merry, fast paced comedy, skilfully parodying many of the most beloved western clichÃ©s: desperados, sheriffs, train robberies, gunfighters, wanted posters, six shooters, frontier justice, etc. There is nothing serious in this film and that is another of its treasure â€“ if a remake was ever done, it should begin with Robbie Williams singing ""Let me entertain you"" in a country versionâ€¦))) A recommended viewing.

"In this book Gardner Dozois gathered what he considered as twenty six best SF works published in 1984. He used to publish earlier much smaller yearly anthologies of ""Best SF stories of the year"", continuing the work of Lester Del Rey, but he had to interrupt those series after five years, finishing with the best works of 1980. He started in 1983 a new collection, published according to the new formula - this book is the second in the series.This book was the last of Gardner Dozois thirty one yearly collections I read. I began with the third collection (from 1985) and went all the way to the thirty-first (2013) - only then I was able to purchase the first two collections (1983 and 1984). With this book I completed a reading project which took me three years (of course I was also reading other stuff between those collections).Sadly, this collection is weaker than the previous one and also, summa summarum, amongst the weakest in the whole series from 1983 to 2013. Out of twenty six stories only two (""Bloodchild"" and ""Press Enter []"") can be considered as VERY GOOD. On another hand there are also eight total STINKERS: ""Salvador"", ""New Rose Hotel"", ""Trojan horse"", ""Rock on"", ""Sunken gardens"", ""Trinity"", ""Twilight time"" and ""Black coral"". Amongst the remaining stories there are six GOOD ones and eleven are READABLE (albeit one of them, ""Lucky strike"", is amongst the most stupid things I ever read).This collection includes also two very precious things. In the introduction we have an overview of what happened in SF (largely understood) in 1984 - in all Gardner Dozois yearly collections that thing is invariably always very precious. At the end there is also the very useful section of ""honourable mentions"" - stories which couldn't be selected for this collection because of lack of space (and this is already a HUGE book!), but which were also of good quality.Below, more of my impressions about the stories, with some limited SPOILERS.-------------------------""Salvador"" by Lucius Shepard (1943-2014) - in deep disagreement with this talented writer's far left politics, I was nevertheless always in awe of his writing skills and read most of his stories with fascination. Sadly, this is one of the exceptions. ""Salvador"", about a squad of US Special Forces fighting leftist guerrillas in Central America somewhere in the future, is the SECOND WEAKEST Shepard's story of all those I read. It is in fact an enraged pamphlet against Reagan's policy in Central America mixed with some of the most absurd far left fantasies about Vietnam War, like soldiers ""lured"" into service in Special Forces (in reality 9 out of every 10 voluntary applicants are rejected), elite American troops being made of former criminals (in reality it is not possible to join US Army with a criminal record) and even more, the ""Green Berets"" encouraged to use drugs (in reality, one negative drug test and you are out of the Army). Also, incidentally, in real history, pro-American Salvadorians won their war against communists - and later won also in first free elections organised after the end of the conflict... This poorly written thing shows once against that even talented people fail to produce good stories, when they write bitterly hateful political pamphlets. AVOID!""Promises to Keep"" by Jack McDevitt - in a not so distant future a vulnerable spaceship manned by a crew of nine is dispatched to study Jupiter and its moons - then something bad happens (as always). This ""nuts and bolts"" tale may seem a little bit dull in the beginning and even in the middle, but when in the second part the pin is pulled, the whole story-device detonates with just the right amount of bang in all its parts... A GOOD, solid thing.""Bloodchild"" by Octavia E. Butler (1947-2006) - there are many women and African-Americans amongst SF writers, but not so many African-American women - but on another hand, with her talent, Octavia Butler was certainly worth a dozen lesser writers... ""Bloodchild"" describes a terribly complex relation between a race of alien insect like masters and human slaves and the ethnic background of the writer certainly helped her seize many less explored aspects of such a situation... This extremely shocking and highly controversial short story is one of the best and deepest SF tales I ever read - it actually gives us matter for thought for many, many hours. It also definitely stays with you... A VERY GOOD story, THE BEST in this collection and in fact A CLASSIC. TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Blued Moon"" by Connie Willis - this great lady is one of my favourite modern SF writers, but it is also my impression that in the early 80s she was still honing her skills and it was only after 1990 that she really started to shine. This story about a great corporation which just began operating a revolutionary environment protection device was an attempt to imitate the style of Hollywood 40s romantic comedy - but even if somehow entertaining, it is not entirely successful. A very READABLE thing, but nothing more.""A Message to the King of Brobdingnag"" by Richard Cowper (1926-2002) - a group of scientists try to create new varieties of plants to solve the problem of world hunger and to do that they accepted to work for a great corporation, based on the real life Monsanto group. Of course at one moment something goes very wrong... (sigh). This is a well written but ultimately very, very banal albeit READABLE story combining the usual mix of fear-mongering (here it is the GMO's scare) and misanthropy... To be fair, I don't really blame the author here, because this horse has been beaten to death so many times in SF history that writing something original on the ""progress is dangerous, let's not play God"" topic is all but impossible...""The Affair"" by Robert Silverberg - a man, on the surface a very average guy, hides a deep secret - he is a kind of telepath, able to communicate, in a very comprehensive way, with other people like him - the problem is that few of those are respectable... Then one day he establishes contact with a woman, who seem to be THE one for him - the only problem is that he is already married and has two children... Robert Silverberg is of course a great master of SF so this story is GOOD and certainly well written - but is also depressing, because an affair is before anything else a betrayal and treason is always not only dirty but also especially a sad, sad, sad, sad thing...""Press Enter []"" by John Varley - two very, very different people, a Korea War veteran and a much younger Chinese-Japanese-Vietnamese female informatics genius, face the consequences of an extremely strange incident involving a uniquely gifted hacker... I was quite impressed with this novella, as it includes many characteristics which became rare in modern SF: originality (even if as you will see the topic is finally well known and very much described), good character development and total lack of political correctness (but REALLY total lack). The story also gets quite scary at the end. There are some weaknesses, like the amazingly silly description of police investigation - also the main police officer is simply impossibly clueless and hapless. Still, even with all of that, this is a VERY GOOD story, the SECOND BEST in the collection.""New Rose Hotel"" by William Gibson - if I understood correctly this is a story about a plot made by a head hunter to recruit for his client a talented scientist working for a different major corporation. I cannot however be certain that I understood it correctly, because this thing is written in such a weird and pretentious way, that it tired and bored me. This is a short story, but still I gave up couple of pages before the end. TOTAL GARBAGE - AVOID!""The Map"" by Gene Wolfe - this is fantasy, not SF and I don't really see why it figures in this collection. This is a short story situated in the universe from ""The book of the New Sun"", about a trip to forbidden ruins - as you can guess from the title, a treasure map is also involved. READABLE, but nothing more.""Interlocking Pieces"" by Molly Gloss - a woman awaits a transplantation which will save her life - she is however curious about the identity of organ donor and decides to investigate... The topic seemed promising, but ultimately it is just a READABLE but rather banal short story.""Trojan Horse"" by Michael Swanwick - an experience in biology/informatics destined to transform its human subject in God turns badly - people who started this project try to repair the damage caused... This is an absolutely ridiculous thing, pretentious and also immensely stupid. AVOID!""Bad Medicine"" by Jack M. Dann - modern fantastic rather than SF; in our times in USA a white guy, whose best friend is an American Indian medicine man, volunteers to be part of an important religious ritual; the problem is, another medicine man, who has a horrible reputation, also participates in this ceremony... It is really nothing special but still a READABLE story, approaching American Indians traditions with the kind of respect no modern SF writer would ever show for Christian rites...""At the Embassy Club"" by Elizabeth A. Lynn - a story about star-crossed lovers on a planet where an isolated human society developed some strict social rules. Silly and banal, with the ending we can see coming almost from the beginning - but still, a READABLE thing.""Pursuit of Excellence"" by Rena Yount - with the progress of genetics humanity split into two categories: en elite of enhanced, beautiful, very tall, strong and very clever super humans and the great mass of ""norms"". This is the story of the struggle of a mother who will do anything and everything to gather funds necessary to give birth to an enhanced child... Although the economics of this story don't make much sense (with time a new technology ALWAYS costs less - instead of being more expensive...), this is a solid, honest GOOD thing, packing some serious punch on relatively few pages. A recommended reading.""The Kindly Isle"" by Frederik Pohl (1919-2013) - an expert in evaluation of hotels and other touristic attractions, working for an investment fund, arrives on a tropical island which seems to be populated by very kind, friendly people. The man still grieves his wife who died years ago - and on the island he meets the woman who may be just his second chance for happiness... But what exactly is the secret of this ""kindly isle""? Written by one of the Great Masters of the genre, this is a solid, honest GOOD story. The very ending is (for my taste) a little bit weaker - but still, this is a recommended reading.""Rock On"" by Pat Cadigan - a woman (or maybe a robot?) who once played rock and roll is on the run, chased by some kind of bounty hunters. Why? Mystery... Absolutely nothing in this terminally weird and very boring thing makes the slightest sense - the SECOND WORST story in the collection. AVOID!""Sunken Gardens"" by Bruce Sterling - a competition in terraforming on Mars; it seemed almost impossible to me that anybody can mess completely a story on such an interesting topic - and yet the renowned and talented author Bruce Sterling (of all people!) managed to do just that. Boring, disappointing and ludicrous - AVOID!""Trinity"" by Nancy Kress - scientists look for contact with God; according to this otherwise mightily gifted author, it seems that the only way to achieve contact with God is to fill two anorexic siblings with strong psychotropic drugs and make them copulate - because as everyone knows, God, conditioned as one of Pavlov's dogs, immediately appears in presence of anorexia, drug habit and incestuous intercourse...))) As a believing Christian I should be in principle offended, but this thing was soooo incredibly ludicrous that I went all the way beyond anger, towards the amusement - and pity. An absolutely grotesque stinker - AVOID!""The Trouble with the Cotton People"" by Ursula K. LeGuin - a short fantasy story about a future low tech society and a commercial agreement in jeopardy, in which author seems to believe that after spending a grand total of a week on the sea most men are obsessed with the idea of raping women (not dating or going to see working girls - raping)...))) A slightly boring story, READABLE but barely.""Twilight Time"" by Lewis Shiner - a space traveller from a nightmarish future America visits the USA in the 50s - which according to this author were a hell on earth... A banal and rather boring time travelling story in which virtually nothing makes sense. AVOID!""Black Coral"" by Lucius Shepard (1943-2014) - a white American lives on a Caribbean island (if I understood this thing correctly) populated by black and mixed-race people; the guy seems to hate everybody and everything around him and because he is so unpleasant and evil (in fact this character seems to be insane) he will suffer punishment from some kind of dark mystic powers... at least if I understood this thing correctly. Because almost everybody in this story speaks in a kind of broken Creole dialect it is very difficult to read and understand. This is a study in hateful anti-white racism and unimaginable anti-American bigotry written, quite naturally, by one of those white American writers who hate simultaneously their own country and their own race... Absolutely the WORST story by Lucius Shepard and the WORST story in the collection. AVOID!""Friend"" by James Patrick Kelly & John Kessel - Friends are specialised crew members who take care of the passengers on board of star ships. This is a difficult job as the long interstellar travels in confined environments tend to stress people a lot and create all kind of complications, especially when the passengers are famous, influent, powerful or rich - or all the above... This story narrates the adventures of an experienced Friend during just one interstellar travel. Albeit not particularly brilliant, this is nevertheless a very READABLE thing. It must be however said, that authors of the ""Friend"" stole some of its elements from the much older ""Dumarest of Terra"" cycle by E.C. Tubb...""Foreign Skins"" by Tanith Lee - this is definitely not SF, but dark fantasy, with slightly erotic elements (but NO actual sex); in India, in times of Raj, a strange young woman is hired as a nanny for a young English boy - mostly because the father of the boy really wants to get in her pants... As usual with this author some rather disturbing elements are included, but still, this is a honest, solid, GOOD story by the Queen of the Dark Fantasy. A recommended reading.""Company in the Wings"" by R. A. Lafferty (1914-2002) - this is rather mainstream letters than SF; a philosopher makes lectures about fictional characters - he claims that they are all in fact real... A GOOD, albeit very, very strange story - also the writing style of late R.A. Lafferty is rather an acquired taste...""A Cabin on the Coast"" by Gene Wolfe - once again, this is not SF but rather modern fantastic; two young lovers spend time on a cabin on the coast - until the moment when something unexpected happens... Parts of this thing are really solid, but the ending is so weird and nonsensical, that I cannot rate this story higher than READABLE.""The Lucky Strike"" by Kim Stanley Robinson - this alternate history tale is linked to the first nuclear attack against Japan. It is honestly written, no argument there, but it is also - in my modest opinion - the MOST BIASED AND THE MOST ABJECTLY STUPID THING I read in ages! Author looks at the situation in July 1945 in Pacific with the eyes of a far left peacenik from the 70s and as result the whole story horribly and (in my opinion) unfairly insults a great American soldier, general Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (1915-2007) and an even greater American president, Truman. The last two pages are so incredibly ludicrous and naive that I laughed out loud. I will not reveal more, but if after reading this short story you feel like agreeing with the author, I propose you to watch a great Japanese movie ""Japan's longest day"" (1967) and/or read the books ""The battle of Okinawa - the blood and the bomb"" by George Feifer and ""Hell to pay: Operation Downfall and the invasion of Japan 1945-47"" by D.M. Giangreco. They are I think a good rebuttal to Mr Robinson's views. READABLE but as stupid and wrong as it is humanly possible.---------------------------------CONCLUSION: a 2,5 stars collection, rather disappointing, with many poor quality stories. If you can find ""Bloodchild"" and ""Press Enter []"" (and possibly also ""Foreign Skins"") somewhere else, there is no real need to buy this anthology.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q0PH7YXS1XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312944853#wasThisHelpful","R22Q0PH7YXS1XR","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both me and my 14 years old daughter we simply ADORED this film! I must even say more - I was actually IMPRESSED! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Making a really good film about Cinderella, especially in our rather cynical times, is actually much, MUCH harder than it could seem - but Kenneth Branagh absolutely aced it! This film remains quite faithful to the original story AND to the classical animated 1950 version - which by the way I always liked a lot. The story being well known, there is no need to delve on it.The main pillar of 2015 ""Cinderella"" is quite obviously Cinderella. Kenneth Branagh's choice for this role turned out to be simply PERFECT. Young Lily James, whom I never saw in anything before (yes, I still didn't watch ""Downton Abbey""), is of course a very pretty damsel, but not exactly a Victoria's Secret level looker - that trap was avoided. She is also obviously very talented and she was clearly very well directed, because she delivered an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE! This film being from the beginning announced as a lesson in courage and kindness, Cinderella should be courageous and kind - and she absolutely is!I was really charmed by the ""classical"" interpretation of Cinderella character by Kenneth Branagh, unlike the recent horrible, abjectly grotesque ""feminist-revisionist"" visions of Alice and White Snow in respectively Tim Burton's ""Alice in the Wonderland"" and Rupert Sanders ""White Snow and the Huntsman"". Cinderella is a young girl who just wakes up to the adult life and she has all the vulnerability and charm of such a person. She is no shrinking violet though - there is actually tough, noble steel in her, but in a very feminine way it is wrapped in the warmest, softest velvet. And this soft, warm toughness, which we can almost feel on the screen, is absolutely charming.Being a young girl barely out of her teens and having a kind and gentle temper, Cinderella is not very assertive - but she is not completely passive, definitely not silly and in fact less defenceless that it could seem. She is also honest and pure - she will not accept even an advantageous deal which she considers beneath her and the idea that she could very easily renege on her words once in position of force doesn't even cross her mind. This nobility and purity, which she maintains even if the price is suffering, make this character even more appealing. Last but not least, as with many a great jewel, one single small flaw in just the right place underlines even more the perfect beauty of the ensemble - there is a little teensy weensy drop of deadly cruelty in her, which she hides preciously and uses only against the right person at the rightest possible moment in the most efficient way... I will not reveal anything more about it.Sorry to go on about Cinderella character, but I was so impressed that I have to say more. She is not yet 20 and didn't really meet many men in her life, and yet she already mastered instinctively lots of purely feminine wiles, which she deploys in an absolutely disarming, irresistible, innocent and yet terribly efficient ways... Courting and mating rituals are very much like a cat and mouse game - and if men say ""miaow"", curb their backs and sharpen their claws a lot, it hides only very poorly the fact that they ALWAYS hold the role of mice...))) And this film shows it just perfectly...))) EVERY SINGLE SCENE with her and the Prince is a purely delicious, delicate and yet sensual ritual mating dance (and that even when they just stand face to face saying nothing).Come to think of it, the character of Prince in ""Cinderella"" is even more challenging both for the director and the actor - Kenneth Branagh however aced that one too. Richard Madden whom I also never saw in anything before (yes, I still didn't watch ""Game of Thrones"" either) was a good choice for the role - he is slightly older and taller than Lily James and certainly also an attractive guy, but in a quite manly way (handsome, not pretty). The scenario improved also this character significantly and Kenneth Branagh directed him perfectly and the final result is a very, very interesting Prince. He loves and respects deeply his kingly father (excellent Derek Jacobi) but grew up to be a man of his own - and once his decision taken, he will neither bend nor break under pressure. He could quite obviously and without much effort have any woman in his kingdom (and not necessarily for matrimonial purpose) but somehow it didn't make him into a jaded jerk or an arrogant spoiled brat - to the contrary, he is actually a polite, gentle man, mixing skilfully and effortlessly great dignity with a considerable sense of humour. He is also definitely NO FOOL and even if his heart is kind, he can be ruthless if situation really asks for it. Last but not least, the film leaves no doubt that he really falls for Cinderella from the first moment he sets eyes on her - HARD! His devotion being sincere and his commitment total, it is actually quite easy to find him likeable and cheer for him.Helena Bonham Carter plays wonderfully the Fairy Godmother, giving to this character a very thorough helenabonhamcartery treatment. The result is a Fairy Godmother who looks and acts as Glinda from Wizard of Oz - but a Glinda who got no less than three really huuuuge margaritas before leaving for this assignment...))) I really, really liked this Fairy Godmother...)))Cate Blanchett is excellent as Evil Stepmother and this character was also upgraded and improved, for the greatest pleasure of the viewers. We can understand her better than in the cartoon - she drunk a lot of bitterness in her life, she is fighting, valiantly but of course in vain, against merciless time, she is terribly stressed by threat of poverty and even worse, her two daughters are a terrible, terrible disappointment. I believe that Evil Stepmother really loves Anastasia and Drisella, but she is lucid enough to see that they are not only unappealing, but also so stupid, talentless, lazy, noisy, annoying and mean that their prospects of attracting mates without the help of a dowry (presently non-existent) are very poor. In fact every time they say or do anything they make her motherly heart shrink from pain and bleed from concern. That is probably THE reason why she hates so much Cinderella, who is not from her own blood, but who in the same time is everything she would wish her daughters to be... All that being said, even if the film allows us to better understand the Evil Stepmother, that doesn't make her any less evil. She clearly always was a very self-centred and terribly arrogant person. She despises the men, because thanks to her great beauty she found it always easy to manipulate them, but she sees herself also as grievously hurt by both men she married - because even if they adored her, they both died on her, which she considers as a betrayal and a personal insult...))) Even worse, her successive husbands dying prevented her from living high on the hog, to which she considers herself entitled and them leaving this world could even force her to make her own breakfast for want of servants - and that would be a fate to cruel to contemplate...)))The mice play a smaller role in this film than in the animated version, but Kenneth Branagh kept them and they are an asset - but they also were modified. They are intelligent and clearly have a language, but for most time it is not something we can really understand (I was able to understand one short sentence). They can however communicate with their human friend and in a couple of scenes they will intervene - discreetly, but quite decisively. In tribute to the animated version one of them is an over-eating and therefore oversized young buck called Gus Gus - and even if during most of the film he just forages (a lot), in one scene he will definitely pull his weight...)))...)))...)))The ball scene is DELICIOUS with Cinderella's dress being a kind of Weapon of Mass Seduction. Glass slippers are a splendour. The scene in which Cinderella proposes to Prince (he already did it before, very publicly) is absolutely MARVELLOUS and when at the end we see Cinderella in her wedding dress, well, in the theatre where I was the male part of the audience said ""Miaow"" in chorus - and the female part hissed and growled with jealousy and sheer hatred...)))One more priceless treasure of this film is that any feminist watching it will scream in pain, then die and turn to dust, like a vampire exposed to sunlight...)))I absolutely adored every minute of this film, I wouldn't mind see it again in the cinema and I will DEFINITELY buy the DVD (maybe even Blu-Ray) the moment it is available. ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28A2D9F7PP7SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI5CTE2#wasThisHelpful","R28A2D9F7PP7SN","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells the story of the only American general who was made prisoner and held in captivity by a hostile power since 1945. The book has its limitations and is mostly recommended to those who study Korean war or total military history freaks (guilty Your Honour), but I rather liked it and I am glad that I bought and read it.After Kim Il Sung regime launched an all-out offensive against South Korea in June 1950, United States were taken completely by surprise as no US troops were then present on the peninsula and only four understrength divisions were stationed in Japan. Mac Arthur, who commanded on this theatre, decided that, pending the arrival of the reinforcements, whatever was left from South Korean Army and everything that Americans could transfer from Japan will hold a bridgehead around main southern port of Pusan. However some time was needed to prepare this defensive position â€“ in order to gain this time one US division was ordered to fight a delaying action at an advanced position around the city of Taejon.It was quite obvious for all concerned that this division was send on a kind of forlorn hope mission and that its soldiers would fight a lonely fight against an overwhelmingly stronger enemy â€“ but its sacrifice was absolutely necessary. MacArthur selected for this mission the 24th Infantry Division commanded by Major General William F. Dean. The 24th Division fought its desperate fight from 5 July (battle of Osan) to 20 July (retreat from Taejon), delaying the progress of communist troops by two full weeks and thus fulfilling its mission, but the price paid was terrible: 30% of soldiers killed, missing, wounded or taken prisoner. Amongst the latter was the division commander himself.General Dean choose to remain in Taejon to the last moment and retreat with the rear-guard. It turned out to be a difficult thing, as the city was already surrounded and Americans had to cut their way out through enemy lines â€“ with the commander of the division fighting as a rifleman like everybody else. Ultimately the rear-guard successfully broke out â€“ but immediately after, during a night skirmish, general Dean was separated from the rest of his soldiers and then suffered an injury. Limited in his mobility, lost in the hills and unable to join American lines, he wandered in the wilderness avoiding enemy patrols for 36 days (!). Exhausted, sick and half-starved he was finally captured by North Korean troops and spend the rest of war in captivity. As his capture wasn't known in America immediately, for many months he was considered as MIA, presumed KIA.This book doesn't deal with general Dean's career before or after the Korean War and he describes only briefly and superficially the Taejon campaign. The book really begins with his separation from his soldiers and the injury suffered, which led to his long and lonely ordeal in the wilderness and ultimately his capture. Most of the book is devoted to the captivity period and the story ends the day when American prisoners were released at the end of the war.As suggested in the title of this review, the story of almost three years of general Dean captivity can be seen almost as an experience of alien abduction. As other totalitarian ideologies, communism is indeed a kind of an evil alien counter-civilization, full of weird but obligatory liturgies and rituals, of which not the least is the obsessive need to obtain from as many people as possible as much signed statements incriminating self and others as it is possible â€“ to be used as lever and/or propaganda toolâ€¦ Held in captivity deep behind enemy lines, general Dean could also observe the hard and unpleasant life under communist terror â€“ and American bombsâ€¦ For all those who are interested in Korean War, Cold War history or communism in general, this is useful reading.That being said, this I is definitely not the most interesting book in the world and even if it is short, in moments it actually can seem a little longâ€¦ Hunger, sickness, poor hygienic conditions of detention and the torture of isolation and boredom cover a significant part of the story â€“ when general Dean's interactions with his captors are ultimately less frequent and less interesting that one could think.That being said, once we think about this whole story a little, I believe that the main lesson to be learned is that North Koreans and Chinese didn't know very well themselves what to do with the only American general they captured. In fact, crazy as it may sound, by moments I had almost the impression, that even if general Dean was a defenceless and for most time weak, sick and miserable captive entirely at their mercy, they were SCARED of him!

"This book tells the story of the only American general who was made prisoner and held in captivity by a hostile power since 1945. The book has its limitations and is mostly recommended to those who study Korean war or total military history freaks (guilty Your Honour), but I rather liked it and I am glad that I bought and read it.After Kim Il Sung regime launched an all-out offensive against South Korea in June 1950, United States were taken completely by surprise as no US troops were then present on the peninsula and only four understrength divisions were stationed in Japan. Mac Arthur, who commanded on this theatre, decided that, pending the arrival of the reinforcements, whatever was left from South Korean Army and everything that Americans could transfer from Japan will hold a bridgehead around main southern port of Pusan. However some time was needed to prepare this defensive position â€“ in order to gain this time one US division was ordered to fight a delaying action at an advanced position around the city of Taejon.It was quite obvious for all concerned that this division was send on a kind of forlorn hope mission and that its soldiers would fight a lonely fight against an overwhelmingly stronger enemy â€“ but its sacrifice was absolutely necessary. MacArthur selected for this mission the 24th Infantry Division commanded by Major General William F. Dean. The 24th Division fought its desperate fight from 5 July (battle of Osan) to 20 July (retreat from Taejon), delaying the progress of communist troops by two full weeks and thus fulfilling its mission, but the price paid was terrible: 30% of soldiers killed, missing, wounded or taken prisoner. Amongst the latter was the division commander himself.General Dean choose to remain in Taejon to the last moment and retreat with the rear-guard. It turned out to be a difficult thing, as the city was already surrounded and Americans had to cut their way out through enemy lines â€“ with the commander of the division fighting as a rifleman like everybody else. Ultimately the rear-guard successfully broke out â€“ but immediately after, during a night skirmish, general Dean was separated from the rest of his soldiers and then suffered an injury. Limited in his mobility, lost in the hills and unable to join American lines, he wandered in the wilderness avoiding enemy patrols for 36 days (!). Exhausted, sick and half-starved he was finally captured by North Korean troops and spend the rest of war in captivity. As his capture wasn't known in America immediately, for many months he was considered as MIA, presumed KIA.This book doesn't deal with general Dean's career before or after the Korean War and he describes only briefly and superficially the Taejon campaign. The book really begins with his separation from his soldiers and the injury suffered, which led to his long and lonely ordeal in the wilderness and ultimately his capture. Most of the book is devoted to the captivity period and the story ends the day when American prisoners were released at the end of the war.As suggested in the title of this review, the story of almost three years of general Dean captivity can be seen almost as an experience of alien abduction. As other totalitarian ideologies, communism is indeed a kind of an evil alien counter-civilization, full of weird but obligatory liturgies and rituals, of which not the least is the obsessive need to obtain from as many people as possible as much signed statements incriminating self and others as it is possible â€“ to be used as lever and/or propaganda toolâ€¦ Held in captivity deep behind enemy lines, general Dean could also observe the hard and unpleasant life under communist terror â€“ and American bombsâ€¦ For all those who are interested in Korean War, Cold War history or communism in general, this is useful reading.That being said, this I is definitely not the most interesting book in the world and even if it is short, in moments it actually can seem a little longâ€¦ Hunger, sickness, poor hygienic conditions of detention and the torture of isolation and boredom cover a significant part of the story â€“ when general Dean's interactions with his captors are ultimately less frequent and less interesting that one could think.That being said, once we think about this whole story a little, I believe that the main lesson to be learned is that North Koreans and Chinese didn't know very well themselves what to do with the only American general they captured. In fact, crazy as it may sound, by moments I had almost the impression, that even if general Dean was a defenceless and for most time weak, sick and miserable captive entirely at their mercy, they were SCARED of him! They were not certain how to use him for propaganda purposes and their hesitations are well shown in completely counter-productive, chaotic changes in interrogation tactics, which as result failed to produce any significant results.

"I mostly liked this little known ""Southern Gothic"" supernatural thriller. It is not a major film, but a quite watchable thing, with many good actors. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In the small, very provincial town of Brixton, Georgia, lives a widow named Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) and her three young sons. Strapped for cash, she makes some money on the side by fortune-telling. As she seems to have some real unusual abilities in viewing things most people can't see, her business is thriving and although she charges very little, she manages to put food on the table with her card readings.It is a welcome relief, as she and her sons still didn't recover from accidental death of her husband - and the local school principal, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), must call her frequently for trouble her oldest son manages to get himself into. Annie also sometimes uses her readings to comfort people, like mentally ill local mechanic Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi). Not everybody is a fan though - a local thug named Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves) hates her guts and makes her life a misery ever since his wife Valerie (Hilary Swank) started to come for readings.Then one day Wayne Collins announces his future marriage to Jessica King (Katie Holmes), the daughter of one of the wealthiest people in the whole county - and then the film really begins and I will say no more about what follows.This is a very honest effort and I actually enjoyed watching this film. It fits well into the category of ""Southern Gothic"", in which stories situated in the deep, impoverished South, mix social drama with some elements of supernatural or at least great eccentricity (usually not very pleasant). In this film the supernatural is quite present, but the claim on the cover of DVD that this is the scariest supernatural thriller since ""Sixth Sense"" is of course absolutely LUDICROUS. The film has one or two jump scares and a handful of rather well filmed visions and that is all. It is a kind of ghost story, but not a really scary one. Kudos however for the visions of the swamps, especially at night...On another hand, this film contains quite a lot of social drama and some very dark secrets of small town life and all that is shown very nicely - albeit those stories are actually quite sad...The story is ultimately not very complicated and the pace of the film is rather slow - but it somehow fits the general feeling of the life in the bayous of southern Georgia, which doesn't really seem to go very fast. This slow rhythm somehow reminded me of some of Faulkner short stories and their oppressive, heavy atmosphere. Now ""The Gift"" has nothing to do with Faulkner's works (it is an original scenario written by screenwriter Tom Epperson and actor Billy Rob Thornton), but I think that the great master from Mississippi would have looked kindly on that story...The cast is the strongest point of this film, as it allows us to see some of actors who were later to become very famous, but who at that time were still in the relatively early stages of their careers. Cate Blanchett was at that time already a well-recognized actress, however her greatest roles were still to come. Hilary Swank, albeit a surprise Oscar winner in 1999, was also in a somehow similar situation and Katie Holmes was at the very beginning of her career, at the point when she still had to make nude scenes... Even if ""Avatar"" made his face instantly familiar to everybody, Giovanni Ribisi is still not a major star, but he also made a good career since ""The Gift"" - and it is only justice, because in this film he does an AMAZING job, in a very hard, very demanding role... Greg Kinnear's role is somehow easier, but he also did well here and he too went on to have a good run ever since.Albeit aged only 36 in 2000, Keanu Reeves was already a veteran actor and an A-list name in Hollywood when he accepted the role of Donnie Barksdale. This character is really an abomination and I have an impression that for Keanu Reeves it was sheer fun to play for once a really, really, really, really BAD guy... He certainly made a great job here.Character actors J.K. Simmons (""Oz"", ""Law and Order"", ""The Closer"") and Michael Jeter (better known as Elmo's friend, Mr Noodle...) are of course always a pleasure to watch and this film is no exception...The very final scenes were kind of a ""Deus ex machina"" device, mostly used by directors and screen writers when they painted themselves into a corner - but they were also somehow touching and even if many viewers hated them, I ultimately decided that I can live with them. On another hand towards the end I managed to guess both main ""mysteries"" a little bit too easily for my taste...This is a honest film, but not really outstanding. I enjoyed watching it, but I don't think I will keep the DVD. An OK thing, to see once.

"I liked a lot this 2012 family drama and I am really surprised that it bombed at box office. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Let's begin with the TRUE STORY. On October 7, 1988, Roy Ahmaogak, a hunter belonging to Inupiat nation, discovered three gray whales trapped in pack ice in the Beaufort Sea near Point Barrow, Alaska. During following three weeks an unprecedented effort was made to create an escape route through the ice field for the trapped whales. This effort united Inupiat community, biologists, Alaskan state authorities, federal government, Alaskan Air National Guard, at least one oil company, medias, civilian volunteers and last but not least two Soviet(!) icebreakers, ""Vladimir Arseniev"" and ""Admiral Makarov"". On 28 October, Soviet icebreakers managed finally to create a large enough path for the whales to escape. From that moment nobody saw the whales again and it was supposed that the operation was a success - even if there is no definite proof that animals actually survived.The film mostly follows the true story, but unavoidably some things were changed. Some more drama but also humour was added - but I cannot really be more specific to avoid spoilers. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING! The element of real tragedy from the real life was kept in the film, but, unlike in the true story, here there is no doubt left about the ultimate issue - there is a happy end. After all, it is a family movie... Also, the names given to the three whales were changed - here they are known as Fred, Wilma and Bam-Bam, when in real life they were code-named Bonnet, Crossbeak, and Bone.The main character is a fictitious local news reporter named Adam Carlson (John Krasinski). The second most important person is his former girlfriend Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), who is a fanatical, ultra radical, unpleasant and slightly insane environmental activist from Greenpeace. This character was inspired by real Greenpeace activist, Cindy Lowry (a person, I believe, much saner than the one in the movie). Three most important secondary characters, all more or less fictional, are oil tycoon J.W. McGraw (Ted Dawson), Alaskan Air National Guard Colonel Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), news reporter Jill Gerard (Kristen Bell) and an ambitious White House staffer Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw).The scenario is surprisingly good. The story flows very harmoniously at good pace and never gets boring. The feeling of urgency and by moments even of tragedy is always present, but nevertheless this film contains tons of good natured humor - in fact there were at least four very clever comic moments (one of which involved a giant plush whale and another one centered around a piece of cardboard and a rodeo) which totally deserved an Oscar! On another hand, this film doesn't contain even slightest touch of vulgarity (and absolutely no foul language).For my personal taste the strongest point of this film is that there is NO bad guys. There is certainly a confrontation of very, very divergent points of view and ultimately some tough decisions must be taken which end the debate, but the makers of this film decided that everybody has his/her story to tell, which deserves to be heard. The film is not too sugar sweet and is definitely not a fairy tale. Politicians get involved not because they love whales, but to either gather points in polls or at least to avoid losing them. The oil business gets involved mostly to try to reduce the amount of flak it takes from the environmentalist radicals - but ultimately the oil tycoon catches the ""whale fever"" exactly as everybody else. Soldiers are not enthusiastic about risking their lives in a whale rescue, but once they receive orders, they carry them to the letter - with considerable risk of loss of life or limb... Some civilian volunteers have a hidden agenda - albeit not necessarily an evil one... Etc. etc.A very strong point is an almost total absence of political correctness and left-winged propaganda - much to the contrary. The lone radical environmentalist militant is shown as somebody who is so much in favor of the animals, that she tends to forget about the rights (or even existence) of humans - and her fanatic fervor very usefully reminds, that together with some good ideas, there is also an element of intolerant extremism and even sheer lunacy in those movements. Indigenous Alaskans are also shown with some ambiguity, because even if some from the beginning try to help the trapped animals, in the beginning we can see that their traditional way of life is amongst others based on hunting the whales... In fact, many Inupiat nation people see this whole thing as a good occasion to ""harvest"" the whales - which is a polite way to say that they want to butcher them, eat them and throw the leftovers to their dogs...In a lesser film political correctness and left-winged ideology would immediately create the oil business, military and politicians as the villains, with environment militants, indigenous Alaskans, lots of children and some journalists as heroes. In ""Big Miracle"", let's stress it again, such is not the case, because if almost everybody is a hero, there is NO villains. At all!This film is so good that I almost managed to forget that I cannot stand Drew Barrymore (even me I don't know why - this is an irrational thing). She certainly played very well in this film.Now, THE reason why this film didn't perform at box office, is probably that it is too serious for little children. They can of course watch it, as there is no foul language or violence - but they will not understand anything. 11-12 years is probably the minimum age for a child to really get the story. Adults and teenagers will find it entertaining, but not little children - and for a film advertised as a family movie, this is a serious problem..All this being said, I found ""Big Miracle"" a most interesting, very original and by moments even very courageous thing. Both me and my then 13 years old daughter we had great time watching it. A recommended viewing! ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VMVZVIJDCZKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2VMVZVIJDCZKT","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this film watchable, but it was still a disappointment, as I expected much more from such a great director and two of my favourite actors. Honestly, I think that is the only film that John Ford at least partially messed up. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The story takes place on Haleakaloha (a fictitious island), part of French Polynesia. Other than its native Polynesian population and some French immigrants (including the governor, local priest and some nuns) three Americans, veterans of US Navy, stayed there after WWII. The most eminent of them is William Dedham (Jack Warden), scion of a rich family from Boston, a greatly respected doctor in charge of local hospital. During the war ""Doc"" Dedham married Manulani, the queen of Haleakaloha and their marriage produced three children: teenage Leilani, young Sarah and little Luke. Tragically, when giving birth to the third child, Manulani diedâ€¦The other two American immigrants (and ""Doc"" Dedham best pals) are Michael ""Guns"" Donovan (John Wayne) and Thomas ""Boats"" Gilhooley (Lee Marvin). Those two men are a lot in common: they share the ownership of local most infamous watering hole for sailors (""Donovan's Reef""), they are both hardened bachelors and they also have the same birthday (7 December, of all datesâ€¦). Best friends since ever and forever, for some reason they always quarrelled on their common birthday. It lasted so long, that even if everybody, themselves included, forgot what all of that was about, they still have a traditional, highly ritualised and very public bare-fists fight every 7 December â€“ to the greatest delight of local population, the lone constable (""gendarme"") includedâ€¦Even if people still mourn Manulani, life is good on Haleakaloha, but suddenly ""disaster"" strikes, in the shape of Miss Amelia Dedham (Elisabeth Allen) from Boston - ""Doc"" Dedham's daughterâ€¦ She was born after ""Doc"" left for war and as he never returned, she never actually saw himâ€¦ Amelia is now a young lady, attractive albeit tending to hide it. She is also very rich and quite powerful, as the chairman of the board of the Dedham Shipping Company. Following a very serious development in the ownership of stock in the family company, she must â€“ very reluctantly â€“ make the trip to Haleakaloha to meet her estranged, reclusive father about whom she doesn't know much (to the point of ignoring the existence of her three mixed race half-siblings). This quite formidable and not very nice young lady has a secret agenda on this trip and her intentions are definitely not friendlyâ€¦ And then the film begins.It was of course a very good project for a comedy to confront an arrogant, aggressive, authoritarian, prejudiced, repressed, humourless and very rich woman with a society peaceful, kind, informal, tolerant, joyful and in which people mostly don't aspire to great wealth. Including in this mix a lesson in racial tolerance was certainly not a bad idea either. Finally, describing a kind of slightly utopian society, poor but happy, many members of which are likeable slackers and screwballs (and in which even villains are just clueless and mostly harmless small time crooks) was another very promising move. But sadly, all those good ideas were in large part wasted by huge problems with the scenario.WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! The biggest problem of this film is that Miss Amelia Dedham who leaves from Boston is not the same person who arrives on the islandâ€¦ The first one is a nightmarish, prickly, snotty, grim, bullying, ice-freezing cold, total-pain-in-the-@ss shrew (kind of not-nymphomaniac Ilsa She Wolf of the SS). The other one is the coolest gal in the world, gentle, humane, smiling, understanding, kids-loving, completely unprejudiced, brave, caring, champion of sea skiing, totally comfortable with being the butt of jokes and not averse to some flirtation. Such a transformation would be very OK - if it didn't occur in five minutes, at the very beginning of the filmâ€¦ Because of this humungous error in the scenario, Miss Amelia Dedham doesn't deliver. I almost could picture the director stocking a powerful explosive charge in this character and lighting the fuse â€“ and all that went off was a wet firecrackerâ€¦WARNING! MORE SPOILERS! There are also many other weaker points in this film. I absolutely adore John Wayne, but in this film, at 57, he was clearly too old to play the love interest of a young woman. His ""seduction"" of Miss Dedham is a completely artificial and forced thing â€“ it appears that she was destined to fall for Donovan from the first second she saw him, without him doing anything at allâ€¦ I also absolutely adore Lee Marvin, but his character in this film was poorly conceived by the screenwriter and for once he played him even worse. Rather than an endearing alcoholised veteran sea wolf his Gilhooley seems rather to be a developmentally challenged, mentally unbalanced and borderline unpleasant guyâ€¦ The complicated relation between Donovan and Gilhooley, rather than being a funny but touching oddity, is a freakishly weird nonsense, which seems to be forced on the reality by the scenarist who worked on a short deadlineâ€¦ ""Doc"" Dedham gets away really easily with the horrible betrayal he committed in his past â€“ after all he abandoned, as ruthlessly and carelessly as if she was old slippers and never bothered even to enquire about his new-born daughter, who also just lost her motherâ€¦ Somehow, the moral implications of the fact that he is a really horrible deadbeat dad who ABANDONED his baby is completely eliminated from the scenarioâ€¦ Etc. etc.One of previous reviewers said about this movie that making it was a kind of Hawaiian holiday for John Ford and his gang of old pals and I think that he was very right. This film was clearly not taken seriously by the director and the screenwriter - and the actors didn't care a whole lot about it either. As result, this film is a kind of pothole in John Ford's career, coming between two absolute masterpieces, ""The man who killed Liberty Valance"" made one year earlier and ""Cheyenne's autumn"" made one year later.There is nothing wrong in taking a holiday by shooting a light-hearted comedy on a tropical island â€“ but with just a minimum effort, it could have been done much better. If Ford and his team didn't want to make too much of an effort with the scenario, they had a great story ready to be picked up, ""Terrible Solomons"" by Jack London (you can read it online as part of Gutenberg project). This extremely funny story about a highly elaborated practical joke played on a young arrogant tourist Bertie Arkwright by an aged and very malicious tycoon was never turned into a movie â€“ and I would give a lot to see a John Ford film made from this South Seas comedy. I can almost imagine John Ford himself appearing in a cameo as Captain Malu, John Wayne playing Mr Harriwell and Lee Marvin playing Captain Hansenâ€¦ Well, it is not gonna happen and instead we got this thingâ€¦ (sigh)However, even if ""Donovan's Reef"" is disappointing, it is still a movie with John Wayne and Lee Marvin made by John Ford â€“ therefore there is still enough here to made it watchable. There is the excellent character of the French priest, who started to receive generous donations to fix his half-ruined church already in 1945 â€“ and the church is still half-ruined, because every single penny he received he gave away to the needyâ€¦ There is a wonderful midnight mass on Christmas in a half-ruined church, with an absolutely splendid re-creation of the respects paid to Jesus by the Three Kings. There is some good humour, a surrealistic bar brawl, some good moments with secondary characters played by veterans Cesar Romero and Dorothy Lamour, THE bathing suit of Miss Amelia and then THE KISS, which, considering the age of John Wayne in this film, must be considered as the Grandfather of all the Kissesâ€¦))) And of course there are many charming moments with ""Doc"" Dedham's children: Leilani, Sarah and Luke.So bottom line, this is a watchable film, but definitely not as good as it could and should have been. I consider it as a kind of weak spot in John Ford's amazing creation. Even if I managed to watch it until the end, it was the first and ONLY time when I checked at the time counter on the DVD player when watching a John Ford/ John Wayne movie. A watchable thing, but it is definitely not a necessary purchase â€“ renting it is probably preferable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FNK9KV3G690/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFXSVE#wasThisHelpful","R29FNK9KV3G690","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this anthology quite honest, albeit definitely less excellent than I expected after reading all the rave reviews.In this book Gardner Dozois gathered what he considered as twenty five best SF works published in 1983. He used to publish earlier much smaller yearly anthologies of ""Best SF stories of the year"", continuing the work of Lester Del Rey, but he had to interrupt those series after five years, finishing with the best works of 1980. This 1983 collection was the first yearly large anthology published according to the new formula, after a pause of two years.Out of twenty five stories, five are VERY GOOD: ""Beyond the Dead Reef"", ""Manifest destiny"", ""Golden gate"", ""The monkey treatment"" and ""Hearts do not in eyes shine"". On another hand there are also six total STINKERS: ""Cicada Queen"", ""Hardfought"", ""The sidon in the mirror"", ""Blind shemmy"", ""Her furry face"" and ""Knight of shallows"". Amongst the remaining stories there are three GOOD ones and eleven are READABLE.This collection includes also, for the first time, two very precious things. In the introduction we have an overview of what happened in SF (largely understood) in 1983 - ever since it appeared, that thing is invariably always very precious. At the end there is also the very useful section of ""honourable mentions"" - stories which couldn't be selected for this collection because of lack of space (and this is already a HUGE book!), but which were also of good quality.Below, more of my impressions about the stories, with some limited SPOILERS.--------------------------------------------""Cicada Queen"" by Bruce Sterling - in a freakishly weird future world, a guy works on terraforming of Mars, when being watched by ""dogs"" of the almighty Queen, who is a kind of a reptile; that is more or less everything that I was able to understand from this boring mess, which I struggled to even finish. It was a bad surprise as Bruce Sterling stories are usually of high quality - but when writing this he was probably tripping on acid... AVOID!""Beyond the Dead Reef""¨ by James Tiptree, Jr. (a.k.a.Alice Sheldon) - this great author was 68 when writing this story (and had only four more years to live) and it is clear immediately that this is the work of a highly experienced veteran. This short but quite remarkable thing is actually a kind of fishing story and therefore in principle should be bad and ridiculous - but in the hands of a master even the blandest matter can be turned into greatness. A RECOMMENDED READING.""Slow Birds"" by Ian Watson - in a kind of alternative world a low-tech rural civilization is confronted by an unusual challenge - the Slow Birds which slowly (obviously) but relentlessly destroy the world... Two brothers will try to solve the riddle of Slow Birds and they will come to radically different conclusions... The general idea is not bad, but ultimately this thing just goes into clichÃ©s and becomes another occasion to take a huge dump on religion... Still, a READABLE story.""Vulcan's Forge"" by Poul Anderson - now, that is a HUGE disappointment... In this history we meet an emotionally scarred veteran astronaut who works on a high risk project on Mercury - and all the characters are either bland or unlikeable and the story is so tedious that BARELY READABLE! Poul Anderson is a GIANT of SF and fantasy, but here he didn't deliver.""Man-Mountain Gentian"" by Howard Waldrop - in near future (albeit one in which Soviet Union still exists...) sumo is still highly popular - but now some wrestlers don't even touch their opponents... A slightly surrealistic but very well written GOOD, solid story.""Hardfought"" by Greg Bear - this 57 pages long novella begins very well. It is the story of one battle in a monumental war between humans and a race of aliens. Those enemies of humanity are incredibly ancient, as they appeared at a time when Universe was still young and still lacked many features, like an abundance of metals... The couple of pages which describe this incredibly alien civilization are actually interesting - future humanity on another hand is so freakishly weird that it seems as alien as the aliens... Somewhere around page 20 this story took a bad turn and then became so tedious, bizarre and complicated, that at page 40 I simply gave up... For me it is mostly a bad, unreadable pile of nonsense. AVOID.""Manifest Destiny"" by Joe Haldeman - more modern fantasy than SF, but of TOP QUALITY. The story begins in 1844 and follows three American adventurers (two whites and one black) who look for fortune in Mexico - where one day they meet an ancient crone who is also a teensy weensy into magic... A VERY GOOD STORY, brilliantly written, with drama, adventure, mystery and humour galore. TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Full Chicken Richness"" by Avram Davidson - an inventor/entrepreneur provides to his customers poultry meat of most exquisite, unique quality - but what exactly is his secret? A silly, but charming, well written and funny GOOD story.""Multiples"", by Richard Silverberg - in near future some people developed an ability to function and live in a satisfactory way when having multiple personalities, which they can switch more or less at will... A young woman, who is a ""single"", infiltrates this singular community... The concept is interesting but the story is a little bit bland. Still, a READABLE thing.""Cryptic"" by Jack McDevitt - an astronomer, who also seems to be a Catholic priest, manages an observatory which used to be part of SETI programme; one day, when putting order in the paperwork, he finds something at the bottom of the old safe inherited from his predecessor... This is a READABLE thing, even if the conclusion, which was probably supposed to be dramatic, failed to really impress me...""The Sidon in the Mirror"" by Connie Willis - now, here is a bad surprise. I usually like Connie Willis stories, and that one, about a kind of brothel (I think) standing literally ON a dying star seemed very promising initially. However it quickly became so bizarre, that I stopped understanding anything, including the crucially important concepts of ""mirroring"" and ""tying hands"". I couldn't even decide if the narrator is a man or a woman... For the first time ever I rate a story by this author as UNREADABLE. AVOID!""Golden Gate"" by R. A. Lafferty - a very strange, absolutely surrealistic story about a bar/cabaret, probably somewhere in an alternate reality. It is very hard to classify as it is definitely not SF or modern fantastic, not even part of ""magic realism"" - in fact it is simply a R.A. Lafferty story, and therefore clearly a literary genre in its own right. Oh, and of course it is a BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN, VERY GOOD THING and also a real pleasure to read. ENJOY!""Blind Shemmy"" by Jack Dann - in a decadent future, a very blasÃ© wealthy man plays a high risk game in a place where people gamble their organs; the story contains mentions or allusions to almost every deviant sexual behaviour imaginable, including paedophilia, bestiality and forcible incest (multiple counts)... It ultimately grossed me out... AVOID!""In the Islands"" by Pat Murphy - on a Caribbean island, populated mostly by mulattos, lives also a young man who is a ""half-breed"" of a different kind - and he now must make the choice between two worlds. An older man (fully human), who is, I believe, in love with the first man, tries to influence his choice... As far as my understanding of this story goes, this is a more modern and much, much softer echo of legendary Lovecratf's novella ""The shadow over Innsmouth"". It is also of course infinitely inferior to this great masterpiece, but still, it is a READABLE thing.""Nunc Dimittis"" by Tanith Lee. The title is from Luke, 2:29: ""Now Master, you may let your servant go in peace."" It tells the story of an old man who for a very long time served an ancient vampire princess - and now, as his death approaches, he tries to find his replacement... Well, it is always a pleasure to read anything by the Queen of the Dark Fantasy, but this story is ultimately rather banal and much less interesting that it seems at the beginning - still, a READABLE thing.""Blood Music"" by Greg Bear - a scientist creates intelligent microbes - and must live with consequences... A well written thing, but it is ultimately just another fear-mongering story about the ""threat"" of nanotechnologies, just with a bio twist... There were so many possibilities to explore in this novella and author just picked up the easiest one. A READABLE story, but also quite disappointing.""Her Furry Face"" by Leigh Kennedy - a scientist works with an intelligent female orang-utan; ultimately he starts become attracted to her - and you can imagine the rest... Sick, gross and abject, this is a story to AVOID!""Knight of Shallows"" by Rand B. Lee - a very average Joe, who may or may not be a homosexual, learns that somebody exterminates systematically his alter egos in parallel worlds - and starts to fear for his own life; the government offers him help to try to stop this person or persons, but there are some conditions... This was an ambitious writing project and this novella seemed promising on first pages, but quickly author lost the control of the story and everything went down in an uncontrollable spin into tedious nonsense... I hardly managed to finish it. AVOID!""The Cat"" by Gene Wolf - a very short story about a ghost cat, written in uniquely beautiful language - but having hardly any real content in it... Still, a READABLE thing.""The Monkey Treatment"" by George R. R. Martin - ever since I read ""A song for Lya"" and ""Sandkings"" I was in awe of this writer's talent - but it was also clear for me that he had a kind of dark, sadistic twist in his writing and it is also perceptible here (and much later ""The Song of Ice and Fire"" cycle, a.k.a. ""Game of Thrones"" confirmed it again - big time!). Here we have an obese man who decides to try one more regime - and boy, will he get results! Although not exactly SF, but rather modern fantastic, this is an ABSOLUTE JEWEL and THE BEST STORY IN THIS COLLECTION, mixing with great success ribs-breaking hilarity and most ferocious cruelty! A delicious, but spicy treat for gourmets! IMPORTANT: no monkeys were hurt during the creation and consumption of this story...)))...)))""Nearly Departed"" by Pat Cadigan - a highly specialised future company is charged to explore the brain of a recently deceased poet and try to recover the draft of her ultimate, not yet finished opus... An interesting idea, but it proved too much for the author as this whole thing ultimately doesn't deliver. Still, a READABLE story.""Hearts Do Not in Eyes Shine"" by John Kessel - now that is SF at its best! In near future selective memory erasing is possible and people do it to get a new start in life - a couple in the middle of a bitter divorce decides to try it, instead of terminating the marriage. This story describes brilliantly consequences of a new technology, both for society and for people involved. It is just a pity that author couldn't resist taking a dump on religion, as at one moment the baptism is included as a traumatising experience which has to be erased... Notwithstanding that little thing, this is a BRILLIANT SF story - the SECOND BEST IN THE WHOLE COLLECTION.""Carrion Comfort"" by Dan Simmons - three very old mind controlling ""vampires"" meet for a chat - and trouble will follow, in form of a dance (kind of normal for a story happening in Charleston) of death, betrayal and ancient hatreds... This is rather a horror or modern fantastic story than SF, but it is very well written, even if Dan Simmons was at that time still in the beginnings of his great career. A GOOD, solid thing.""Gemstone"" by Vernor Vinge - a young girl stays during summer holidays at her grandma's house, a place filled with memories of her late grandfather, who travelled a lot around the world and brought many strange souvenirs and artefacts - including the mysterious Gemstone... The story begins well, but I found the second half disappointing and also unnecessarily depressing. READABLE, but nothing more.""Black Air"" by Kim Stanley Robinson - fortunes and mostly misfortunes of a young African man pressed into service on board of one of vessels of Invincible Armada; this is not exactly SF, but rather fantasy - or magic realism...; for some reason Gardner Dozois considered this story as the best in the collection - I definitely don't share this appreciation; the description of tribulations of the Armada are good indeed - but the supernatural elements are actually a little bit ridiculous; this story contains also the description of some kind of morbidly grotesque and unpleasant parody of Christian mass ritual; considering the well-known anti-Christian and anti-religious bias of Gardner Dozois, may be that was the reason why he liked this story so much; me, as a Christian I found it revolting and as a regular Joe I found it also gross... Bottom line, as most of Kim Stanley Robinson historical stories (as opposed to those which happen on Mars) this is a READABLE thing, but definitely not any kind of masterpiece.-----------------------------------BOTTOM LINE, this is a honest anthology, but definitely not the best of those yearly collections (as of today I read thirty out of thirty one - the only exception being the second one, devoted to 1984). Considering that paper copies are very expensive and it is not really necessary to have them on the shelf, I advise to go for the electronic version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODCMS6UO7Z23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312944837#wasThisHelpful","R1ODCMS6UO7Z23","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best adaptation of my favorite Jules Verne book. I saw it no less than four times and every time I liked it even more. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Jules Verne's books were a major feature of my childhood and teenage readings and I will always keep in memory the wonderful moments I spend in their company. Sailing the seven seas ""In search of castaways"", navigating ""Twenty thousand leagues under the sea"", building civilization from scratch on ""Mysterious island"", exploring Africa during the ""Five weeks in a balloon"", shooting in space and going ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Around the Moon"", accepting the challenge to travel ""Around the world in 80 days"", trying desperately to survive with ""Dick Sand, a captain at fifteen"", spending ""The begum's millions"" and finally participating in ""The chase of the golden meteor"" - oh, the adventures I lived thanks to this great French writer... But the one that I always cherished the most, to the point of reading the book at least ten times, was ""The journey to the center of the Earth""...If you didn't read this book yet, I sincerely recommend to do it, if possible before watching this film - but on another hand, as the film changed the story a lot, it is also possible to see the movie before reading the novel.In the film the story begins in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1880. During the examination of an unusual sample of volcanic rock, professor Sir Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason), a very famous and quite eccentric geologist at the University of Edinburgh and his young student and more or less research assistant Alec McEwan (Pat Boone), find inside a plumb bob bearing a cryptic inscription. It turns out to have been written by a (fictitious) XVII century Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm, who claimed that he found a passage to the center of the Earth. This passage is supposed to exist in the extinct volcano Sneffels, on Iceland (""In Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm""). Lindenbrook and Alec then decide to go on an expedition, the journey to the center of the Earth... And then the film really begins.As I already stated, in the film the story was significantly changed. In the book the story took place in 1863, both main heroes were German, they lived and worked in Hamburg and they were not teacher and student, but uncle and nephew and their names were professor Otto Lidenbrock and Axel Lidenbrock. As this film was made in USA and it was only 14 years after WWII, the producers preferred to have Scottish rather than German heroes... Also, in the book, professor Lidenbrock and Axel go on their quest accompanied only by their Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke - in the film there are two more participants, both of female persuasion, albeit one of them (a very valiant one) is not entirely human...)))The film includes also a rival expedition, led by a sinister villain - no such thing existed in the book and this change I didn't like too much... On another hand the Plesiosaurus vs. Ichthyosaurus fight and especially the sighting of the Mastodon Herder, one of the most moving (and upsetting) moments in all Jules Verne's books, are very much absent... The conclusion of the whole quest is also slightly different from the one in the novel, but this change I actually rather liked. There are also other, less important changes - and most of them are nicely done.Still, many of the treasures and wonders from the book were shown on the screen, including the impressive mushroom ""forest"", the ""not-so-sunless"" sea, prehistoric creatures and the great finale in form of absolutely crazy high speed ride back towards the surface...Albeit old, this film still packs a terrific punch - and even if it is long (132 minutes), the good pace of events, the adventures, the twists, the scares and also considerable amount of humor make certain that we never get bored. As I already said in another review, good films never age, they just gain a vintage charm - and this is precisely the case of this one... A great SF/adventure movie, an excellent adaptation of one of major Jules Verne's novels and a recommended viewing. ENJOY!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36X55XQ4T5A7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007JMD8#wasThisHelpful","R36X55XQ4T5A7U","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't expect much from this film, after the putrid abomination that was ""Chronicles of Riddick"", but I was VERY pleasantly surprised! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.PRECISION: this is the review of 122 minutes long extended version of the film, 8 minutes longer than the cinema version; those additional scenes are quite welcome, but they are not really essential for the story.Twelve years after the events of Pitch Black, Riddick (Vim Diesel) finds himself again stranded at a hostile planet â€“ but this time he is alone and also badly wounded. This film tells the story of his struggle to survive and ultimately escape from this anonymous planet (which we know only as ""not Furya""). The escape will be made ultimately possible by arrival on this planet of two ships â€“ but it will be also a difficult thing, as the tough and experienced crews of those spacecrafts have terminally hostile intentionsâ€¦ I will not say more about the story.This is a very honest SF/adventure film, not as good as ""Pitch Black"", but still a well done thing. There are many treasures in ""Riddick"", not the least of which is the very limited place accorded to this whole ""Necromongers"" nonsense, which completely destroyed the second film in the series. There are two moments showing Riddick in his functions as Necromongers Lord Marshall (and allow Karl Urban to appear in a cameo), but they are mercifully short and all the rest of the story takes place on ""not Furya"" planet.This planet is a very hostile place, every bit as dangerous as desert planet in ""Pitch Black"" â€“ albeit not really as lethal as Crematoria from ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (incidentally the only thing worth watching in this latter film). Riddick's adventures in its deadly wilderness are shown very, very well indeed.People who come to the planet looking for Riddick are tough and unpleasant, albeit one of them, the youngest of all, seems to be in the wrong line of workâ€¦ Amongst those unpleasant bounty hunters there is a sadistic, machete wielding thug named Santana (Jordi Molla), a middle aged, highly professional and deadly serious guy named ""Boss"" Johns (Matthew Nable), who has a personal score to settle with Riddick and also, last but not least, a very athletic and very lesbian amazon/sniper named Dahl (Katee Sackhoff). Their interactions amongst them and with Riddick are actually better shown than in most action movies â€“ although some opportunities for better dialogs, more drama and better jokes were wasted, there was still a clear effort on the level of scenario here.This film actually reminded me of some old westerns as indeed we have here three groups of very different people (Santana's crew, Johns' crew and Riddick who is a kind of one man army) in an abandoned ""town"" (OK, a couple of barracks) in the middle of a deadly wilderness â€“ and we know that the Apaches (here known as Mud Demons) are never far and will ultimately show themselvesâ€¦There are some developments in this film, centred around character of Dahl, which are soooo deliciously not-politically correct, that I howled with admirationâ€¦))) It begins with giving to an athletic amazon/sniper lesbian character the name which is pronounced as ""doll""â€¦))) But it actually gets even better and I think that any feminist and especially a lesbian feminist who would dare watch this film would probably get a heart attack towards the endâ€¦))) So a friendly warning ladies, stay away from ""Riddick"" - in every posible sense of these wordsâ€¦)))It is worth noticing also that if two first films seemed indicate that Islam is the dominant religion in space civilization of future, in this one we finally have a devout Christian â€“ although the director couldn't resist the temptation to give him the name Luna (like in ""lunatic""). Incidentally, the existence of this character gives Riddick an occasion to place a killer one-liner, one of the best in the whole filmâ€¦)))In this film we also have one more time the confirmation that deep inside all men, even the most macho, are little boys at heart â€“ and it is well known that a boy should have a puppy to play withâ€¦))) Another thing we learn in this film is that in space ""everybody has a box""â€¦))) I am not explaining that one â€“ you will have to watch the filmâ€¦Even if liked ""Riddick"" much, much more than I expected, I still cannot rate it five stars as some moments are weak and the drama initially build into the confrontation between Riddick and ""Boss"" Johns ultimately doesn't deliver. Still, a nicely done thing. I think I will keep my DVD for another viewing in the future.

"I found this little known 2003 neo-noir crime film surprisingly good and I spend a nice moment watching it. It is not any kind of masterpiece, but a very honest, quite well done and well thought over thing - even if for once I saw the final twist coming like ten minutes in advance... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.IMPORTANT PRECISION: this film devotes a lot of its time to poker and I personally have NOT A CLUE about this game - but still, it didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie.The film is mostly the story of three small time con-artists, who want to finally make some serious money. The head of the trio is nominally the oldest of them, a certain Charlie Miller (Gabriel Byrne), but in fact the most clever and the most ruthless is his girlfriend Tiffany (Thandie Newton). It is however the third member of the gang, a talented card player named Vernon (Stuart Townsend), who has the most crucial set of skills for what they plan...The target of their scam is a very high stakes poker game, during which specially selected guests can try their forces against a legendary veteran player known as Dean (Sylvester Stallone). They need however first to raise some really serious money to buy their way into the game... I will say no more about the story.For me it is always a pleasure to watch Sylvester Stallone, even in his lesser films - and this one actually is one of the best in which he played. His role is rather unusual but he did VERY WELL.Jamie Foxx, who in 2003 was still a rising star, plays a secondary but very important role of Larry Jennings, a tough gangster/talented gambler who may well be interested in doing business with Charlie Miller and his gang...Melanie Griffith appears here also, as a slowly aging gangster moll and even if she was in this film clearly only for a pay check, she added a lot to it. Bo Hopkins (""Dynasty"") plays here Scarne, a ruthless corrupt cop. Veteran Hal Holbrook appears as Professor, now a mostly retired magician - who used to be Vernon's mentor.The scenario is not half bad and mostly makes sense, even if there is at least one moment completely over the top (it involves Thandie Newton and a really obnoxious jerk named Jeff). There are also many twists and all the cards are turned face up only at the end. Mob bosses, hulking goons, crooked cops, strippers, casinos, unclean watering holes, backstabbing, double crossing, cash money, potent beverages, cigarette smoke, greed, stupidity and people taken on a ride - all this was sprinkled all over the scenario in just right proportions.Bottom line, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and I am glad that I watched it, even if it is rather a thing to see once - so it is advised to rent rather than buy. Still, a very honest thing and a kind of nice tribute to old ""film noir"" classics. ENJOY!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BR1HCKWQLPI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002H6NVM4#wasThisHelpful","R1BR1HCKWQLPI1","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very disappointed by this seemingly promising 2014 crime film and I regret that I bought and watched it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.PRECISION: this film was initially supposed to have for title ""Whiskey Bay"" and on some webpages it can still be found under this nameSomewhere in Louisiana police officer Bud Stewart (Willem Dafoe) makes a seemingly rather routine arrest, but he quickly starts to suspect that the criminal he apprehended, Jesse Weiland (Matt Dillon), far from being simply a burglar, a fence and a gun smuggler is in fact something much worse - and also somebody much important. Initially very loyal to his bosses, Jesse ultimately agrees to turn informant, after his younger brother is murdered and it appears that his wife Lynn (Amy Smart) is not being taken care of and lives penniless. It is then revealed that he works in fact for a large criminal network, which was formed first in prison by numerous violent felons who also all share a visceral hatred of ethnic minorities. This organization is never named but it is clear that it was inspired by Aryan Brotherhood. And then the film really begins...A gumbo which mixes a really bad@ss police officer, a neo-Nazi gangster turned supergrass, gun trafficking, diamond smuggling, a mob lawyer, FBI, ATF, DOAs, GSWs, corrupt Washington lobbyist, a wire and an insane racist goon named Catfish (!) Stanton should in principle be at least a honest treat. To improve this combo they even threw in a Cajun (a bad un...) villain, who not only is covered in swastikas, but, supreme proof of evil wickedness, he even speaks FRENCH...)))!!! This pretty scary guy, played by Tom Berenger, is named Lutin Adams (Tom Berenger) and this is actually a pretty good joke, because ""Lutin"" means ""little elf"" in French...)))Quite a lot of good actors were hired for this film. Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon and Tom Berenger are of course major stars and always a pleasure to watch in anything. As for Amy Smart I admit that I have a major crush on her ever since I saw her next to Denise Richards in ""Straship Troopers"" - and notwithstanding the stellar beauty of Ms Richards I completely forgot about her and had instead a ""Who is THAT girl?"" moment... In this film, albeit her screen time is finally rather limited, she simply SHINES!There are also many familiar faces in secondary roles, like Bill Duke (Mac in ""Predator""), Kevin Chapman (Detective Lionel Fusco in ""Person of Interest"") and Frederick Weller (US Marshall Marshall Mann from ""In Plain Sight"").Sadly, all those good ideas and good actors were used poorly. After a honest beginning the film starts to turn into boring absurdity. Decisions made by all the protagonists usually don't make any sense. Interesting characters are destroyed quickly. Interesting possibilities are never explored - or closed as soon as they appear. F-bombs and shootings become quickly the whole plot. Cops ROUTINELY torture suspects - who seem to ignore even the fact that there are entitled to a lawyer... And let's not even talk about the last 30 minutes... Finally, action scenes are just ridiculous Chuck Norris style shootings (one bullet-proof guy who never misses against dozens of bullet-attracting guys who cannot shoot) - and Chuck Norris style shootings are fun only when they are performed by Chuck Norris...The only two things which are really worth seeing in this film are Amy Smart and the one short scene in which Willem Dafoe can finally pay back Tom Berenger for what he did to him in ""Platoon""...))) Otherwise this film is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I will not keep the DVD.

"I liked this 2006 BBC produced documentary film a lot - in fact even more, I was IMPRESSED by it!This is the story of 80-years of life of a bull sperm whale, beginning the day of its birth and ending by... well, you will have to discover it by yourself. When our ""hero"" is born, the world is still recovering from World War I, but for most of the sea creatures human affairs are of little concern - except when whalers appear... Our hero will live its long and eventful life mostly far from humanity and its concerns - instead it will explore the dark depths of the oceans...During the 116 minutes of this film we can follow the main character as it matures and grows, learns the secrets of sea, its creatures and the life itself. As it can dive deeper and deeper we keep discovering more things and thanks to the absolutely incredible CGIs we get a magnificent show of deepest (in all meanings of this term) secrets of the oceans and we meet some absolutely fascinating creatures, including the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne) and especially the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), the largest invertebrate known actually to the science...This film was made by Impossible Pictures, the same company which produced the amazing ""Walking with dinosaurs"" series and their sequels - and here they did again an amazing job. Images are of course splendid, but also the scenario is great.I learned A LOT from this film and I really didn't see those two hours passing by. I am so keeping my DVD! A RECOMMENDED VIEWING.

"I liked a lot this 1942 black and white western about Alaska gold rush, filled with action, humour, smart one liners and sexual tension. Below, more of my impressions - with some limited SPOILERS about ""Spoilers""â€¦)))The story takes place in Nome, Alaska in 1900, in full gold rush. Following on the trail of first prospectors and miners numerous shady characters (""spoilers"") arrived to Alaska, to steal most interesting claims by force, ruse or legal artifice. One of such claims, in fact a prosperous gold mine, belongs to Roy Glennister (John Wayne) and Al Dextry (Harry Carey) and their silent partner, saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Marlene Dietrich). Cherry and Glennister are also more or less in a relationship â€“ albeit it is a stormy oneâ€¦Knowing that they will be targeted by the ""spoilers"" the three partners are concerned for their claim, but hope that things will improve with the arrival of a new gold commissioner Alexander McNamara (Randolph Scott) and a new judge. However, the judge also brings with him his niece, Helen Chester (Margaret Lindsay), an educated, classy, sweet young thing. Glennister immediately falls for her - hard! In retaliation Cherry shows someâ€¦ responsiveness to McNamara's advancesâ€¦ And that is only the beginning of troublesâ€¦Well, you can immediately see that it is an old film, when John Wayne is billed thirdâ€¦))) But in fact this was already the FOURTH screen adaptation of the 1906 novel ""The spoilers"" written by Rex Beach. This book, which was one of bestsellers in 1906, was based partly on real events and the character of Alexander McNamara is based on a real man, Alexander McKenzie. This corrupt official indeed tried to steal gold mines from their legal owners in Nome in 1900, albeit in the real life no violence was involved (he ended by going to jail â€“ but served only little time). As for the character of Roy Glennister it is very, very distantly based on Japhet Lindeberg, one of ""Three Lucky Swedes"" who were amongst the most famous (and most fortunate) prospectors during the gold rush.This is a really good film. It aged surprisingly little in 73 years and is still a darn good watch. All five main actors offer a great show, but this film has also many colourful secondary characters, beginning with Idabelle (Marietta Canty), Cherry's black maid â€“ who in fact is more of a confidante and also occasionally a kind of partner in crime...))) John Wayne is excellent in this film and Randolph Scott offers all his snaky charm â€“ and menaceâ€¦ When those two finally clash, their fistfight is nothing short of epicâ€¦ Veteran actor Harry Carey is excellent as a no-nonsense old timer who trusts his faithful rifle more than lawyers â€“ and honestly, it is hard to blame himâ€¦))) Young Margaret Lindsay plays very well a ""fille fatale"" â€“ an ultimately-not-so-nice deceptively sweet seemingly innocent girlâ€¦It is however Marlene Dietrich who shines the most in ""Spoilers"". I always liked those old films which were as full of sex as today, but because nothing could be shown, everything had to be suggested â€“ and here we have a masterful display of those techniques. Innuendos, double-entendres, looks full of meaning, tricks of lights and shadows, musical moments, camera moving away in strategically chosen scenes â€“ all is hereâ€¦ Those scenes in which Marlene Dietrich navigates between two attractive males, teasing them, toying with them and occasionally verbally biting them, are a real treasure. Incidentally, Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne were in the same time having a real life affair â€“ and that helped in creating screen chemistry between themâ€¦Bottom line, this is a good, solid old western, still very watchable, with a lot of excellent dialogs, humour, tension, drama and one of the most famous fistfights in all history in cinema. A recommended viewing.

"I liked a lot this Irish-British tongue-in-cheek parody of SF/monster movies. It is not a masterpiece, but a well done, funny, highly entertaining film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.This film PRETENDS to be a serious SF/monster movie, so the opening scenes and premises follow strictly the rules of the genre. On a dark night (it is always a dark night) cruel invaders from outer space arrive on a meteorite (it is always a meteorite). They land in the sea in the middle of a storm (when sea is involved, it always begins in the middle of a storm), near a small isolated community (it is always a small isolated community), residing on a small coastal island (as everybody knows it is probably the best place to begin an extra-terrestrial infestation). They want to grab and eat people (of course they do) and also to spawn and multiply (I can understand that - spawning and multiplying is fun...). But they also have a special weakness (they always have one...).On their way will stand a lonely sheriff (they are always lonely - even if they have partners)... well, OK, in fact an An Garda Siochana agent named Ciaran O'Shea (Richard Coyle). This hero is a rather likeable guy, although definitely not the most elite element wearing the uniform and of course he has some issues (they always have issues). Just before the beginning of the invasion he is (of course) paired with a brand new partner, who is completely different from him (they always are) and in the beginning they don't get along well (they never do), but it will change (it always does).This partner is a chick (they frequently are), named Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley). Lisa is a by-the-book kind of cop and a rather strictly-buttoned-up kind of gal - and she also has a kind of little secret which makes her social contacts in Ireland a little bit difficult... She also TOTALLY hates being wolf-whistled...))) She is of course cute even if not exactly a kind of super-model beauty - because if she was one she wouldn't work on a one-dog island but go to Dublin and play in the movies... oh, wait...All this takes like the first five minutes of the film and of the rest I will not say much - you deserve to discover it by yourself. However it is also fair to say that, with the whole thing happening in Ireland, the consumption of potent potables, Catholicism and Polish immigrants will play some part, very important for the first point and very episodic for the latter two. Also, because this extra-terrestrial invasion occurs exceptionally in Ireland and not in USA, large firearms will NOT appear - instead, Earth will be defended and protected by most unusual but surprisingly efficient (and TOTALLY HILARIOUS) weaponry...)))...)))...)))I liked this film A LOT and I spend a really nice moment watching it. I laughed a lot and there was a couple of scenes in which I really ROLLED ON THE FLOOR! Alien creatures are very well done, secondary characters are excellent and the settings have a unique kind of charm. I cannot however rate this film five stars, because the two main characters switch roles in the middle of the film and that doesn't work so well. Also, the development of relations between Ciaran and Lisa was not handled well. Richard Coyle does a great job in this film, but he is a guy in his 40s and his character is too old and worn out to be credibly attractive to a young sweet thing like Lisa, who is barely out of her diapers...That two points notwithstanding, this is a good, funny, highly entertaining and very original film and I am glad that I bought it. ENJOY! Or rather, in this case, SLAINTE!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZUEN43J4NP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMAGIKU#wasThisHelpful","R19ZUEN43J4NP0","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked a lot this 1956 British war film, describing quite faithfully the first major naval battle of World War II which took place on 13 December 1939. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS. However, before going into the film itself, if you are interested, here is some basic information about the events which occurred before the battle itself.1. Pocket battleship â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€ and her cruise prior to the battle of River Plate.Unable to build quickly a navy which could challenge Great Britain and France in an open battle, Hitler decided that Kriegsmarine will mostly rely on submarines, as well as fast torpedo boats and naval mine warfare. As for the major surface combatants, their main purpose was supposed to be the raiding against commercial ships, which could disturb British economy and force Royal Navy to disperse its ships all around the globe, far from European waters. Three units of â€œDeutschlandâ€ class, the first major surface ships of the reborn Kriegsmarine were therefore designed precisely for raiding and as consequence they were unique, highly original vessels. It was even difficult to classify them, as they didnâ€™t fit into any pre-existing category. Germans initially called them simply â€œarmored shipsâ€ (Panzershiff), but they are mostly remembered under their British nickname â€“ â€œpocket battleshipsâ€.The idea behind the creation of those powerful ships was a simple formula â€“ they were supposed to be â€œstronger than anything that could catch up with them and faster than anything that could outgun themâ€. Indeed, armed with six 28 cm (11 in) guns in two triple gun turrets, those three ships could defeat any cruiser fast enough to catch them. Their top speed of 28 knots (52 km/h) allowed them also to outrun all British and French battleships.The only units in Royal Navy and Marine Nationale which at the beginning of the war were simultaneously faster and more powerful than them were the five battle cruisers: three British (HMS â€œHoodâ€, HMS â€œRenownâ€ and HMS â€œRepulseâ€) and two French (â€œDunkerqueâ€ and â€œStrasbourgâ€). But considering the immensity of oceans, even with those five units in service, finding and successfully engaging a German pocket battleship remained a tall order. On another hand, the absence of any friendly ports in which they could safely proceed to repairs if damaged was the Achilles heel of all German raiders. Exactly as predators in animal world they had to avoid serious wounds when hunting their prey, because each one could force them to interrupt their cruise â€“ and even prove to be fatal if it allowed hunters to catch up with themâ€¦In August 1939, anticipating the almost unavoidable war with Great Britain and France, Hitler ordered two of those units, â€œDeutschlandâ€ and â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€, as well as their supply ships â€œWesterwaldâ€ and â€œAltmarkâ€, to sail to Atlantic and hide away from navigation lines awaiting further orders. Even after war began the captains of both ships were not immediately ordered to attack â€“ Hitler authorized it only on 26 September, when it became clear that British and French will not negotiate for peace even if their Polish ally was on the ropes.â€œDeutschlandâ€ quickly developed engine troubles and she was finally forced to return to Germany in November after sinking only two ships and capturing a third. Things went very differently for her sister ship â€“ commanded by Captain Hans Wilhelm Langsdorff, a highly respected officer, â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€ went on a rampage and caused great grief and concern to British Admiralty.Her first victim was British cargo s/s â€œClementâ€, sunk on 30 September. On 5 October another British steamer, â€œNewton Beachâ€, was captured and first used as prison, to keep captured sailors - she was however unable to keep pace with German raider and she was ultimately sunk on 8 October. In the meantime, on 7 October, â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€ caught and sunk another British merchant ship, the â€œAshleaâ€. On 10 October cargo â€œHuntsmanâ€ was captured â€“ once again she was temporarily used as a prison ship, before being sunk on 17 October, soon after the captives were transferred to supply ship â€œAltmarkâ€. On 22 October s/s â€œTrevanionâ€ was sunk, after what the raider went to Indian Ocean. This proved to be a rather poor hunting ground â€“ only one small tanker, the â€œAfrica Shellâ€ was encountered and sunk on 15 November.This is the moment, at which the film begins, with â€œAfrica Shellâ€ burning and sinking and her skipper, Captain Dove, played by Bernard Lee, being brought on board of â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€. If you donâ€™t know yet the real story, my sincere advice is to NOT research it and discover it by watching this very good war film...WARNING! QUASI SPOILER ALERT! This is NOT said in the film, but it is worth knowing that on 19 December 1939, six days after the battle, Captain Langsdorff killed himself. Even if he served an evil totalitarian regime and his master was a beast from hell, he himself was not only an officer but also a gentleman, a real one, who always treated fairly and humanly defenceless British prisoners. For that reason even some Royal Navy officers came to pay him last tribute.2. The warships which appear in this filmIn order to make this film it was necessary to use no less than five large warships, to act as â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€, HMS â€œExeterâ€, HMS â€œAjaxâ€, HMNZS â€œAchillesâ€ and HMS â€œCumberlandâ€. It was relatively easy with the latter two, as they both still existed and were operational in 1956. HMNZS â€œAchillesâ€ was sold to India in 1948 and was still serving as INS â€œDelhiâ€ â€“ Indians graciously agreed for her participation in this film. HMS â€œCumberlandâ€ was still in service in 1956, albeit she was then an auxiliary ship and for that reason deprived of her artillery turrets. The short scene in which she appears, so completely defanged and defenseless, actually is a little bit sad... For second appearance of HMS â€œCumberlandâ€ in the film she was replaced by HMS â€œJamaicaâ€, a ship which was still in full possession of her means...For a variety of reasons other three ships didnâ€™t exist anymore in 1956 and had to be played by other units - which of course looked differently from those which really participated in the battle.HMS â€œAjaxâ€ was played by HMS â€œSheffieldâ€, a ship larger and more powerful, but whose general silhouette was at least to some extent similar â€“ they both had four turrets with 6inch guns, even if HMS â€œAjaxâ€ had two gun turrets and HMS â€œSheffieldâ€ three gun turrets.Heavy cruiser HMS â€œExeterâ€ was played by light cruiser HMS â€œJamaicaâ€, a ship of roughly similar size, but with a very different silhouette (four turrets instead of three). However the general impression of power given by HMS â€œJamaicaâ€ made her in a very plausible heavy cruiser.It was also fitting to give to both HMS â€œSheffieldâ€ and HMS â€œJamaicaâ€ this opportunity to play in this film, as they both greatly deserved this honor, if only for they last minute life saving intervention against â€œAdmiral Hipperâ€ and her screen of destroyers during the battle of Barents Sea (31 December 1942). HMS â€œJamaicaâ€ also participated actively in the battle of North Cape (26 December 1943) and was charged to give â€œcoup de graceâ€ to deadly wounded â€œScharnhorstâ€. Later she also participated with distinction in Korean War, including the crucially important Inchon landing. HMS â€œSheffieldâ€, after fighting in Mediterranean, taking part in hunt for â€œBismarckâ€ and sinking a German destroyer in the battle of Barents Sea battle also participated in North Cape battle.In order to play â€œAdmiral Graf Speeâ€ it was necessary to find a fully operational ship more powerful than anything Royal Navy had in 1956. Americans were contacted and US Navy volunteered to contribute one of her heavy cruisers, USS â€œSalemâ€. Commissioned in May 1949, she was in fact the last heavy cruiser ever build and in fact she was even somehow larger than ""Admiral Graf Spee"". Her aspect was also different, as she had three turrets instead of two. However, considering her speed, her powerful weaponry, the predatory aggressive beauty of her general aspect and finally the fact that she was still quite new (""Admiral Graf Spee"" herself was barely three years old on the day of the battle), USS ""Salem was probably the best possible choice. The success of most films relies more on the villains than on heroes â€“ and here ""Admiral Graf Spee"" is shown as a terrifying hunter: fast, powerful and filled with deadly menace. The three British ships are certainly shown as dangerous as panthers - but their opponent is the lion of this naval savannahâ€¦Large fleet oiler RFA ""Olna"" was used to play ""Altmark"" â€“ the scene of her rendezvous with ""Admiral Graf Spee"", albeit short, is a highly interesting one. Finally, cruiser HMS ""Birmingham"" was used for some shots of artillery fire and scenes which are supposed to happen under the decks of ""Admiral Graf Spee"", as Americans were NOT thrilled at the idea of huge crowd of civilians (actors and film crew), rampaging through the interior of their mighty ship, filled with highly classified electronicsâ€¦3. The castTwo most important characters are of course Captain Langsdorff and his cunning British opponent, Commodore Henry Harwood. The first is played splendidly by Peter Finch, who with this film achieved a major break and later appeared in leading or major roles in ""A town like Alice"", ""The nun's story"", ""The flight of the phoenix"" or ""The red tent"". He looks very differently than real Captain Langsdorff, but it was made on purpose â€“ indeed the director couldn't resist the temptation and he gave to this character the beard and moustache which made him look like one of those Spanish hidalgos, whom Elizabethan sea dogs mercilessly fought and frequently outfoxedâ€¦)))Although he appears late in the film, Commodore Henry Harwood, played by Anthony Quayle, completely dominates all the scenes in which he appears. For him too it was a big step forward in his career â€“ soon would come major roles in ""Ice cold in Alex"", ""Guns of Navarone"", ""HMS Defiant"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".Bernard Lee who plays Captain Dove, the skipper of unfortunate ""Africa Shell"", was at that time already a well-known veteran actor â€“ but of course his most famous role, ""M"" from James Bond movies, was still to comeâ€¦ The character of Captain Dove is quite important in this film and in fact part of the scenario was based on his own memories published after war under the title â€œI was prisoner on Admiral Graf Speeâ€.At that time John Gregson, who plays Captain Bell from HMS ""Exeter"" was considered as the greatest star from all those who appear in the film, but today he is less remembered than previous three actors. Patrick Mcnee and Christopher Lee also appear in smaller roles â€“ the latter plays somebody very different from his usual charactersâ€¦)))4. The filmThe two hours of the film are well filled with a mixture of tension, drama, fighting but also some humour â€“ and the mix was well done. The budget and the means devoted to this project were considerable, but of course couldnâ€™t match Hollywood super-productions â€“ still the result of all this effort on the screen is very, very pleasant indeed. Producers were greatly encouraged by the public â€“ when the work on the film began, the association of veterans of HMS â€œAjaxâ€ send them a message: â€œWe hope your shooting will be as successful as oursâ€...)))The result is a VERY GOOD war film, which I watched with mouth wide open as a kid on a small black and white TV during my childhood in communist Poland and recently I was glad to see that it didnâ€™t age AT ALL and is still a great viewing, even for the total military history freaks (guilty as charged) who know most of the details of the true story. A RECOMMENDED VIEWING.

"This collection devoted to what Gardner Dozois considered as best SF published in 2013 is slightly better than the one from 2012, because even if there were more very bad stories (no less than seven), on another hand fifteen are really worth reading (four being very good).Having now read twenty nine Gardner Dozois yearly collections (from third to thirty first) I couldn't help but notice a steady but regular decline in quality of SF writing, from the 80s to the modern times. OK, granted, this is just one of yearly anthologies amongst many, and yes, it reflects the very personal, subjective taste of the editor, but still, there is a clear trend towards a lesser quality. The main reasons of that, at least in my personal opinion and for my subjective taste, are the following:- a tendency to run after the developments in the world, rather than trying to anticipate them. Global warming hysteria, fear of nanotechnologies and GMOs and consequences of recent progress in informatics are the best examples of it. Few writers even try to think about something really new â€“ even less seem to have any intellectual capacity of doing itâ€¦- nihilism, pessimism and fear-mongering seem to be the leading motive in recent SF, as there is hardly any joy and exaltation linked usually with new discoveries and opening of new horizons. To the contrary, everything and anything seems to be a threat.- lack of humour. In this anthology there are at the best two stories, out of thirty two, which contain some humour and wit. The rest is mostly gloom and doom taken DEADLY seriouslyâ€¦- left winged politics. That is probably due to Gardnez Dozois personal choice, but at least in his anthologies anything conservative, religious and especially military is mostly the source of all evil in the world. Christianity seems to be particularly hated â€“ but almost everybody panders to islam.- poorly developed characters, with whom we cannot really connect.- poor endings â€“ or no endings at all. It seems that nowadays there are few writers able to find a good closure or a punch line.For all that reasons, reading those huge collections was frequently much less fun than expected â€“ and I distinctly remember that when I discovered SF with classic short stories from the 50s and 60s, well this was a much more enjoyable experienceâ€¦Returning now to this collection, out of the 32 stories, this year, for my personal taste, only four could be considered as VERY GOOD: ""Technarion"", ""The promise of space"", ""The Queen of the Night's Aria"" and ""Hard Stars"".On another hand there were also seven stinkers: ""The Discovered Country"", ""Martian blood"", â€œBiographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Princeâ€, â€œFleetâ€, â€œThe Irish astronautâ€, ""Only human"" and ""Quicken""Other stories ranged from GOOD (11) to READABLE (10).This collection includes also, as usual, an overview of what happened in SF (largely understood) in 2013 and that section is invariably always very precious. At the end there is also the very useful section of ""honourable mentions"" - stories which couldn't be selected for this collection because of lack of space (and this is already a HUGE book!), but which were also of good quality.Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The Discovered Country"" by Ian R. MacLeod â€“ the world is dying and so is humanity; obscenely wealthy people download into virtual reality to become immortal â€“ invited by the owner, a musician arrives to one of their ""residences""â€¦; this story was simply boring on the first ten pages and became a totally idiotic nonsense on the next twelve. AVOID!""The Book Seller"" by Lavie Tidhar â€“ surprise, surprise! I usually don't like things written by this author and I certainly never cared much for the stories about ""Central Station"", situated in the very strange, in fact freakishly weird, futuristic Israel. This one however completely broke through my defences, by its heart-warming, passionate message of love for books â€“ and also by the tribute it pays to one of the most important pioneering SF stories ever (""Shambleau"" by Catherine L. Moore). A GOOD, solid, honest ""Central Station"" story â€“ even if it still is very, very weirdâ€¦""Pathways"" by Nancy Kress â€“ in a near future, in an area of United States particularly ravaged by extreme poverty, a young girl who suffers from a rare incurable disease undergoes an experimental treatment. This dark, depressing and pretty scary SF story mixed with some social criticism reminded me a little of ""Winter's bone"" movie (which I LOVED by the way). A GOOD, honest, solid thing.""A Heap of Broken Images"" by Sunny Moraine â€“ years ago, on a distant exoplanet, human colonists committed a genocide, or maybe rather a xenocide (thanks, Orson Scott Card) against indigenous intelligent alien population; now, a young alien female works as a guide for human tourists who come to visit the sites of this atrocity. The initial idea is interesting and the story is quite READABLE.""Rock of Ages"" by Jay Lake â€“ this is the story of a strange adventurer, half-punk anarchist, half-radical environmentalist, a kind of green Snake Plissken aged 130 (but well preserved), who tries to prevent a great disaster; this 50+ pages novella is a little bit too long for its own good â€“ also, it seems to be attached to earlier novels by the same writer (the ""Green"" cycle) and if you didn't read them (I didn't) you may have trouble to fully understand what the heck is going onâ€¦ I didn't like the radical environmentalist ideology of this story and I struggled through it a lot, but I managed to finish it, so I rate it READABLE â€“ but barelyâ€¦""Rosary and Goldenstar"" by Geoff Ryman â€“ in XVI century, in a slightly alternate history, two Danes come to visit their England and meet people who, like them, are fascinated by astronomy; a young struggling actor, a certain Shakespeare, also participates in the meeting; this is a well written and quite amusing short story â€“ it's just a pity that the ending is weak. Also I wasâ€¦ wellâ€¦ surprised, that in a meeting of XVI century astronomers Copernicus is never mentioned, even once, unlike Galileo and Tycho Bracheâ€¦ Still, it is a GOOD, interesting thing.""Gray Wings"" by Karl Bunker â€“ in a distant future a very rich girl participates in a race of flyers (people who grew wings for this occasion) across Africa; in the opening lines circumstances force her to crash land in a very poor Nigerian villageâ€¦ A well written, GOOD, interesting story.""The Best We Can"" by Carrie Vaughn â€“ an extremely pessimistic, even depressing, atypical and for my personal taste incredibly STUPID description of First Contact; it is a READABLE story, but in my opinion also a totally ludicrous thingâ€¦""Transitional Forms"" by Paul McAuley â€“ genetically modified organisms created to cleanse a heavily polluted industrial area mutated and escaped all control; the whole area became a ""hot zone"" and its borders are patrolled; this is the story of one of guards who keep the ""hot zone"" off limits. A rather banal, although READABLE story.""Precious Mental"" by Robert Reed â€“ and yet another Great Ship 50+ pages novellaâ€¦ This time an immortal man who used to be one of the captains of the Great Ship is recruited (well, in a way of speakingâ€¦) for a salvage mission far, far awayâ€¦ I noticed that every time Great Ship stories actually live the Great Ship they get better â€“ and the further the Great Ship stories go from the Great Ship, the better they getâ€¦))) This one is a GOOD, solid, honest thing â€“ if only the ending wasn't so lame, it could be a masterpieceâ€¦""Martian Blood"" by Allen M. Steele â€“ first story ever by this usually very good author that I absolutely HATED! In an alternate reality, on a Mars quite different from what it really is, human immigrants are slowly but surely colonizing the planet â€“ and the less advanced natives are not happy with itâ€¦ One day, a Mars-born human guide is hired by an Earth scientist for a risky questâ€¦ The story begins very well, but then turns into nonsense and crashes in an abysmally IDIOTIC and morally REPUGNANT ending (which includes a very cruel and totally useless murder)â€¦ I was DISGUSTED by it â€“ AVOID!""Zero For Conduct"" by Greg Egan â€“ definitely NOT one of my favourite authors, but here he delivers â€“ BIG TIME. The story takes place in contemporary Iran and the main hero is a very, very gifted teenage girl, working very hard to get her high-school diploma. One day she makes a stunning discovery â€“ but as she belongs to a very vulnerable segment of society (she is an Afghan refugee, belonging to Tajik nation) she is concerned that it will be stolen from herâ€¦ A GOOD, well written, dramatic and profound story.""The Waiting Stars"" by Aliette de Bodard â€“ another story in the distant future/alternate reality cycle about a high tech future world dominated by rivalry between Chinese and Azteca empires. This time a Vietnamese woman goes to space to try to salvage a derelict sapient spaceshipâ€¦ READABLE but, as most of the stories in this cycle, freakishly WEIRDâ€¦""A Map of Mercury"" by Alastair Reynolds â€“ a human messenger tries to contact an artistic community of cyborgs ""living"" on Mercury; he carries an important message and needs a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. It is a READABLE story, but CREEPY and with some really unpleasant moments.""One"" by Nancy Kress â€“ a boxing story, in fact a kind of variation on ""Rocky"" by, who would ever believe that, Nancy Kress, of all peopleâ€¦ Well, she had also to throw in some LGBT stuff, probably to lessen the shockâ€¦))) A not so good boxer undergoes brain surgery â€“ and results are, well, surprising, to say the leastâ€¦ A GOOD, solid, well written novella â€“ it could have been a masterpiece, if the ending was just a little bit better.""Murder on the Aldrin Express"" by Martin L. Shoemaker â€“ obviously inspired by Agatha Christieâ€™s classic, this futuristic whodunit takes place onboard an Earth-bound space ship, bringing home the remains of a tragically ended Martian expedition. This is a GOOD, solid, honest story, with just the solution of the whole thing being a little bit disappointing.""Biographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Prince"" by Jake Kerr â€“ a collection of articles from various sources about Julian Prince, a Nobel-prize winning writer, who lived and wrote after the impact of an asteroid devastated North America. Even if it is a short thing, I found it boring â€“ and also stupid, depressing and unpleasant. AVOID.""The Plague"" by Ken Liu â€“ A short story about the meeting of two people after a catastrophic event linked to nanotechnologies â€“ one is a â€œregularâ€ human, the other descendant of victims of the nanotechnology linked plague. Unpleasant and shocking but original in its conclusion, this is a READABLE story.""Fleet"" by Sandra McDonald â€“ the story of a transsexual person living on a post-apocalyptic Guam â€“ and that is more or less everything I could understand from this thing. I donâ€™t usually care a lot for LGBT stories and this one I found particularly messy, weird and the obscene language certainly didnâ€™t help... AVOID!""The She-Wolf's Hidden Grin"" by Michael Swanwick â€“ humans colonized an alien world and its indigenous inhabitants are now extinct. But are they REALLY extinct? A very strange story, with a lot of LGBT elements, but certainly creative â€“ it is a great pity that author had to add one last line which makes the whole story almost impossible to understand... A READABLE thing.""Bad Day on Boscobel"" by Alexander Jablokov â€“ somewhere in outer limits of Solar System, inside a very much transformed asteroid exists a human colony, subsisting thanks to gigantic genetically modified trees. A single mother, raising a rebellious teenage daughter, struggles to keep her job and try to control the more and more problematic brat... The story is very boring and characters not very interesting either â€“ but the description of this strange world makes it a READABLE story.""The Irish Astronaut"" by Val Nolan â€“ an American man comes to Ireland to bury the remains of an American-Irish astronaut. A good story lies buried somewhere in this very boring narrative, which ultimately goes absolutely nowhere... AVOID.""The Other Gun"" by Neal Asher â€“ this story is situated in Polity/prador universe; a very dangerous man and his faithful female troodon sidekick/pet/friend search for a lost weapon of enormous power for a mysterious entity known as the Client â€“ but their quest takes them in an unexpected direction. This is a GOOD, solid, honest space-opera, with just the ending maybe a little bit weaker.""Only Human"" by Lavie Tidhar â€“ another short story related to Central Station universe, but this time dominated by LGBT themes â€“ it happens on Titan and main characters are a lesbian couple... I found the intrigue freakishly weird and the story impossibly boring. AVOID!""Entangled"" by Ian R. MacLeod â€“ This story about a radical youthful rebellion which went very, very bad and about the very Christian virtues of sacrifice, forgiveness, charity, love and mercy (even if there is no Christians in this story) is a really surprising, clever and interesting thing. It could be a masterpiece, if only author didn't decide to surf on the global warming hysteria and surrender to the ""upcoming collapse of capitalism"" fadâ€¦ Still, it is a GOOD, solid, shocking and moving story.""Earth 1"" by Stephen Baxter â€“ in a distant future our descendants start a quest to find the birth world of humanity â€“ it will be a long questâ€¦ There was potential for a masterpiece here, but the story was a little damaged by unlikeable characters and very stupid ending. Still, it is a GOOD, solid story.""Technarion"" by Sean McMullen â€“ this very original, in fact quite brilliant story happens somewhere around 1850 in England and I will say nothing more about the plot, because you deserve to discover it by yourself; let's just say that it will delight all people who hate computersâ€¦))) I don't fully agree with the ideology of it, but it is nevertheless a VERY GOOD, surprising and deeply shocking thing.""Finders"" by Melissa Scott â€“ in some kind of alternate reality universe three people go to an abandoned space station to salvage precious resources â€“ of course they will find more than they bargained forâ€¦ It is a quite banal and rather tedious treasure hunt, with pale characters and a very predictable ending. READABLE, but barely.""The Queen of Night's Aria"" by Ian McDonald â€“ this story occurs on Mars but in an alternate reality universe; here the Red Planet not only harbours life but even an alien civilization â€“ more than one in factâ€¦ Human soldiers are engaged in a merciless war against indigenous Uliri on Mars and an opera singer comes from Earth to entertain the troops â€“ it will be one helluva tourâ€¦))) This is a rather rare thing in modern SF: extremely well written, with interesting characters, fast pace of action, great originality, tons of wit and humour, twists on every page, very well chosen title and finally a terrific punch line! A VERY GOOD STORY â€“ the BEST IN THIS COLLECTION! TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Hard Stars"" by Brendan DuBois â€“ in a near future technologically outmatched USA face a massive drone attack by China, Iran and North Korea, which makes it almost impossible to use any advanced technological device; some federal agents try to carry a mission when avoiding drone attacksâ€¦ This is more a techno-thriller than SF, but it is a well written story, with a very powerful message â€“ democracies cannot afford losing technological and military edge, because authoritarian regimes will never miss a chance to destroy themâ€¦ A VERY GOOD, quite scary story.""The Promise of Space"" by James Patrick Kelly â€“ short but powerful story about the dangers and hardships of space exploration and Mars colonization; nothing more will be said, as you deserve to discover the details by yourselfâ€¦ It's actually pretty depressing, but, albeit a little reluctantly, I must admit that this is a VERY GOOD story.""Quicken"" by Damien Broderick â€“ a new technology makes it possible to ""rekindle"" (resurrect) the dead â€“ but those who come back are not very well received by the rest of the societyâ€¦ That was a great idea, but to my great regret this long-winded 59 pages novella is a total disaster. It becomes quickly boring, then turns into weird and on most pages delivers an incredibly insulting rant against Christianity and Christians, who are more or less compared to Nazisâ€¦ And all that only in the first part of the story â€“ in the second one we go in a kind of freaky absurdity which one usually associates with high-fever delusionsâ€¦ It is also occasionally obscene and in some other moments GROSS. Bottom line, this is a HORRIBLY BAD THING, the WORST STORY IN THE COLLECTION. AVOID!-------------------------------CONCLUSION: an average collection, slightly better than the one from 2012 â€“ but reading it was not always easy or pleasant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYLGENG2MBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWS04QS#wasThisHelpful","R1XYLGENG2MBG","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection devoted to what Gardner Dozois considered as best SF published in 2013 is slightly better than the one from 2012, because even if there were more very bad stories (no less than seven), on another hand fifteen are really worth reading (four being very good).Having now read twenty nine Gardner Dozois yearly collections (from third to thirty first) I couldn't help but notice a steady but regular decline in quality of SF writing, from the 80s to the modern times. OK, granted, this is just one of yearly anthologies amongst many, and yes, it reflects the very personal, subjective taste of the editor, but still, there is a clear trend towards a lesser quality. The main reasons of that, at least in my personal opinion and for my subjective taste, are the following:- a tendency to run after the developments in the world, rather than trying to anticipate them. Global warming hysteria, fear of nanotechnologies and GMOs and consequences of recent progress in informatics are the best examples of it. Few writers even try to think about something really new â€“ even less seem to have any intellectual capacity of doing itâ€¦- nihilism, pessimism and fear-mongering seem to be the leading motive in recent SF, as there is hardly any joy and exaltation linked usually with new discoveries and opening of new horizons. To the contrary, everything and anything seems to be a threat.- lack of humour. In this anthology there are at the best two stories, out of thirty two, which contain some humour and wit. The rest is mostly gloom and doom taken DEADLY seriouslyâ€¦- left winged politics. That is probably due to Gardnez Dozois personal choice, but at least in his anthologies anything conservative, religious and especially military is mostly the source of all evil in the world. Christianity seems to be particularly hated â€“ but almost everybody panders to islam.- poorly developed characters, with whom we cannot really connect.- poor endings â€“ or no endings at all. It seems that nowadays there are few writers able to find a good closure or a punch line.For all that reasons, reading those huge collections was frequently much less fun than expected â€“ and I distinctly remember that when I discovered SF with classic short stories from the 50s and 60s, well this was a much more enjoyable experienceâ€¦Returning now to this collection, out of the 32 stories, this year, for my personal taste, only four could be considered as VERY GOOD: ""Technarion"", ""The promise of space"", ""The Queen of the Night's Aria"" and ""Hard Stars"".On another hand there were also seven stinkers: ""The Discovered Country"", ""Martian blood"", â€œBiographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Princeâ€, â€œFleetâ€, â€œThe Irish astronautâ€, ""Only human"" and ""Quicken""Other stories ranged from GOOD (11) to READABLE (10).This collection includes also, as usual, an overview of what happened in SF (largely understood) in 2013 and that section is invariably always very precious. At the end there is also the very useful section of ""honourable mentions"" - stories which couldn't be selected for this collection because of lack of space (and this is already a HUGE book!), but which were also of good quality.Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The Discovered Country"" by Ian R. MacLeod â€“ the world is dying and so is humanity; obscenely wealthy people download into virtual reality to become immortal â€“ invited by the owner, a musician arrives to one of their ""residences""â€¦; this story was simply boring on the first ten pages and became a totally idiotic nonsense on the next twelve. AVOID!""The Book Seller"" by Lavie Tidhar â€“ surprise, surprise! I usually don't like things written by this author and I certainly never cared much for the stories about ""Central Station"", situated in the very strange, in fact freakishly weird, futuristic Israel. This one however completely broke through my defences, by its heart-warming, passionate message of love for books â€“ and also by the tribute it pays to one of the most important pioneering SF stories ever (""Shambleau"" by Catherine L. Moore). A GOOD, solid, honest ""Central Station"" story â€“ even if it still is very, very weirdâ€¦""Pathways"" by Nancy Kress â€“ in a near future, in an area of United States particularly ravaged by extreme poverty, a young girl who suffers from a rare incurable disease undergoes an experimental treatment. This dark, depressing and pretty scary SF story mixed with some social criticism reminded me a little of ""Winter's bone"" movie (which I LOVED by the way). A GOOD, honest, solid thing.""A Heap of Broken Images"" by Sunny Moraine â€“ years ago, on a distant exoplanet, human colonists committed a genocide, or maybe rather a xenocide (thanks, Orson Scott Card) against indigenous intelligent alien population; now, a young alien female works as a guide for human tourists who come to visit the sites of this atrocity. The initial idea is interesting and the story is quite READABLE.""Rock of Ages"" by Jay Lake â€“ this is the story of a strange adventurer, half-punk anarchist, half-radical environmentalist, a kind of green Snake Plissken aged 130 (but well preserved), who tries to prevent a great disaster; this 50+ pages novella is a little bit too long for its own good â€“ also, it seems to be attached to earlier novels by the same writer (the ""Green"" cycle) and if you didn't read them (I didn't) you may have trouble to fully understand what the heck is going onâ€¦ I didn't like the radical environmentalist ideology of this story and I struggled through it a lot, but I managed to finish it, so I rate it READABLE â€“ but barelyâ€¦""Rosary and Goldenstar"" by Geoff Ryman â€“ in XVI century, in a slightly alternate history, two Danes come to visit their England and meet people who, like them, are fascinated by astronomy; a young struggling actor, a certain Shakespeare, also participates in the meeting; this is a well written and quite amusing short story â€“ it's just a pity that the ending is weak. Also I wasâ€¦ wellâ€¦ surprised, that in a meeting of XVI century astronomers Copernicus is never mentioned, even once, unlike Galileo and Tycho Bracheâ€¦ Still, it is a GOOD, interesting thing.""Gray Wings"" by Karl Bunker â€“ in a distant future a very rich girl participates in a race of flyers (people who grew wings for this occasion) across Africa; in the opening lines circumstances force her to crash land in a very poor Nigerian villageâ€¦ A well written, GOOD, interesting story.""The Best We Can"" by Carrie Vaughn â€“ an extremely pessimistic, even depressing, atypical and for my personal taste incredibly STUPID description of First Contact; it is a READABLE story, but in my opinion also a totally ludicrous thingâ€¦""Transitional Forms"" by Paul McAuley â€“ genetically modified organisms created to cleanse a heavily polluted industrial area mutated and escaped all control; the whole area became a ""hot zone"" and its borders are patrolled; this is the story of one of guards who keep the ""hot zone"" off limits. A rather banal, although READABLE story.""Precious Mental"" by Robert Reed â€“ and yet another Great Ship 50+ pages novellaâ€¦ This time an immortal man who used to be one of the captains of the Great Ship is recruited (well, in a way of speakingâ€¦) for a salvage mission far, far awayâ€¦ I noticed that every time Great Ship stories actually live the Great Ship they get better â€“ and the further the Great Ship stories go from the Great Ship, the better they getâ€¦))) This one is a GOOD, solid, honest thing â€“ if only the ending wasn't so lame, it could be a masterpieceâ€¦""Martian Blood"" by Allen M. Steele â€“ first story ever by this usually very good author that I absolutely HATED! In an alternate reality, on a Mars quite different from what it really is, human immigrants are slowly but surely colonizing the planet â€“ and the less advanced natives are not happy with itâ€¦ One day, a Mars-born human guide is hired by an Earth scientist for a risky questâ€¦ The story begins very well, but then turns into nonsense and crashes in an abysmally IDIOTIC and morally REPUGNANT ending (which includes a very cruel and totally useless murder)â€¦ I was DISGUSTED by it â€“ AVOID!""Zero For Conduct"" by Greg Egan â€“ definitely NOT one of my favourite authors, but here he delivers â€“ BIG TIME. The story takes place in contemporary Iran and the main hero is a very, very gifted teenage girl, working very hard to get her high-school diploma. One day she makes a stunning discovery â€“ but as she belongs to a very vulnerable segment of society (she is an Afghan refugee, belonging to Tajik nation) she is concerned that it will be stolen from herâ€¦ A GOOD, well written, dramatic and profound story.""The Waiting Stars"" by Aliette de Bodard â€“ another story in the distant future/alternate reality cycle about a high tech future world dominated by rivalry between Chinese and Azteca empires. This time a Vietnamese woman goes to space to try to salvage a derelict sapient spaceshipâ€¦ READABLE but, as most of the stories in this cycle, freakishly WEIRDâ€¦""A Map of Mercury"" by Alastair Reynolds â€“ a human messenger tries to contact an artistic community of cyborgs ""living"" on Mercury; he carries an important message and needs a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. It is a READABLE story, but CREEPY and with some really unpleasant moments.""One"" by Nancy Kress â€“ a boxing story, in fact a kind of variation on ""Rocky"" by, who would ever believe that, Nancy Kress, of all peopleâ€¦ Well, she had also to throw in some LGBT stuff, probably to lessen the shockâ€¦))) A not so good boxer undergoes brain surgery â€“ and results are, well, surprising, to say the leastâ€¦ A GOOD, solid, well written novella â€“ it could have been a masterpiece, if the ending was just a little bit better.""Murder on the Aldrin Express"" by Martin L. Shoemaker â€“ obviously inspired by Agatha Christieâ€™s classic, this futuristic whodunit takes place onboard an Earth-bound space ship, bringing home the remains of a tragically ended Martian expedition. This is a GOOD, solid, honest story, with just the solution of the whole thing being a little bit disappointing.""Biographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Prince"" by Jake Kerr â€“ a collection of articles from various sources about Julian Prince, a Nobel-prize winning writer, who lived and wrote after the impact of an asteroid devastated North America. Even if it is a short thing, I found it boring â€“ and also stupid, depressing and unpleasant.

AVOID!""The She-Wolf's Hidden Grin"" by Michael Swanwick â€“ humans colonized an alien world and its indigenous inhabitants are now extinct. But are they REALLY extinct? A very strange story, with a lot of LGBT elements, but certainly creative â€“ it is a great pity that author had to add one last line which makes the whole story almost impossible to understand... A READABLE thing.""Bad Day on Boscobel"" by Alexander Jablokov â€“ somewhere in outer limits of Solar System, inside a very much transformed asteroid exists a human colony, subsisting thanks to gigantic genetically modified trees. A single mother, raising a rebellious teenage daughter, struggles to keep her job and try to control the more and more problematic brat... The story is very boring and characters not very interesting either â€“ but the description of this strange world makes it a READABLE story.""The Irish Astronaut"" by Val Nolan â€“ an American man comes to Ireland to bury the remains of an American-Irish astronaut. A good story lies buried somewhere in this very boring narrative, which ultimately goes absolutely nowhere... AVOID.""The Other Gun"" by Neal Asher â€“ this story is situated in Polity/prador universe; a very dangerous man and his faithful female troodon sidekick/pet/friend search for a lost weapon of enormous power for a mysterious entity known as the Client â€“ but their quest takes them in an unexpected direction. This is a GOOD, solid, honest space-opera, with just the ending maybe a little bit weaker.""Only Human"" by Lavie Tidhar â€“ another short story related to Central Station universe, but this time dominated by LGBT themes â€“ it happens on Titan and main characters are a lesbian couple... I found the intrigue freakishly weird and the story impossibly boring. AVOID!""Entangled"" by Ian R. MacLeod â€“ This story about a radical youthful rebellion which went very, very bad and about the very Christian virtues of sacrifice, forgiveness, charity, love and mercy (even if there is no Christians in this story) is a really surprising, clever and interesting thing. It could be a masterpiece, if only author didn't decide to surf on the global warming hysteria and surrender to the ""upcoming collapse of capitalism"" fadâ€¦ Still, it is a GOOD, solid, shocking and moving story.""Earth 1"" by Stephen Baxter â€“ in a distant future our descendants start a quest to find the birth world of humanity â€“ it will be a long questâ€¦ There was potential for a masterpiece here, but the story was a little damaged by unlikeable characters and very stupid ending. Still, it is a GOOD, solid story.""Technarion"" by Sean McMullen â€“ this very original, in fact quite brilliant story happens somewhere around 1850 in England and I will say nothing more about the plot, because you deserve to discover it by yourself; let's just say that it will delight all people who hate computersâ€¦))) I don't fully agree with the ideology of it, but it is nevertheless a VERY GOOD, surprising and deeply shocking thing.""Finders"" by Melissa Scott â€“ in some kind of alternate reality universe three people go to an abandoned space station to salvage precious resources â€“ of course they will find more than they bargained forâ€¦ It is a quite banal and rather tedious treasure hunt, with pale characters and a very predictable ending. READABLE, but barely.""The Queen of Night's Aria"" by Ian McDonald â€“ this story occurs on Mars but in an alternate reality universe; here the Red Planet not only harbours life but even an alien civilization â€“ more than one in factâ€¦ Human soldiers are engaged in a merciless war against indigenous Uliri on Mars and an opera singer comes from Earth to entertain the troops â€“ it will be one helluva tourâ€¦))) This is a rather rare thing in modern SF: extremely well written, with interesting characters, fast pace of action, great originality, tons of wit and humour, twists on every page, very well chosen title and finally a terrific punch line! A VERY GOOD STORY â€“ the BEST IN THIS COLLECTION! TO READ ABSOLUTELY!""Hard Stars"" by Brendan DuBois â€“ in a near future technologically outmatched USA face a massive drone attack by China, Iran and North Korea, which makes it almost impossible to use any advanced technological device; some federal agents try to carry a mission when avoiding drone attacksâ€¦ This is more a techno-thriller than SF, but it is a well written story, with a very powerful message â€“ democracies cannot afford losing technological and military edge, because authoritarian regimes will never miss a chance to destroy themâ€¦ A VERY GOOD, quite scary story.""The Promise of Space"" by James Patrick Kelly â€“ short but powerful story about the dangers and hardships of space exploration and Mars colonization; nothing more will be said, as you deserve to discover the details by yourselfâ€¦ It's actually pretty depressing, but, albeit a little reluctantly, I must admit that this is a VERY GOOD story.""Quicken"" by Damien Broderick â€“ a new technology makes it possible to ""rekindle"" (resurrect) the dead â€“ but those who come back are not very well received by the rest of the societyâ€¦ That was a great idea, but to my great regret this long-winded 59 pages novella is a total disaster. It becomes quickly boring, then turns into weird and on most pages delivers an incredibly insulting rant against Christianity and Christians, who are more or less compared to Nazisâ€¦ And all that only in the first part of the story â€“ in the second one we go in a kind of freaky absurdity which one usually associates with high-fever delusionsâ€¦ It is also occasionally obscene and in some other moments GROSS. Bottom line, this is a HORRIBLY BAD THING, the WORST STORY IN THE COLLECTION. AVOID!-------------------------------CONCLUSION: an average collection, slightly better than the one from 2012 â€“ but reading it was not always easy or pleasant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYMJ78YT6JNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFNNG1E#wasThisHelpful","R3DYMJ78YT6JNC","A4SY5RCGC5CH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SY5RCGC5CH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very much appreciated by my dog (picky Havanese) and my son's (Australian Labradoodle), are easy to break apart to divvy-up or sprinkle over food, but they seem to be ground-up and reconstituted  (stated nowhere in the write-up).  They are NOT just cut-up 'heart Medallions', but evidently are processed, ground up, and squirted out as equally sized pieces that are much like the Turkey Giblet paddy's I can buy for my dog through Amazon.  I can recommend them, though, will likely NOT order more, and I hope this helps. But be aware these are not just beef heart's cut-up into filet type Medallion's. Perhaps there would be too many spaces (ventricles and atria's, but I would prefer that form. I feel it is misleading to call these beef heart medallions. I just received an email on hidden poisonous preservatives in most fish animal food and treats for dogs, and the fish food makers do not disclose it in the ingredients. I do not like the idea of selling these as beef heart medallions when they are likely fish food, a mixture of processed ingredients) and the beef gives it the coloring. It is much like calling hamburger ground beef paddy clumps 'medallion's'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1436OCBATE329/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036VPFDM#wasThisHelpful","R1436OCBATE329","A2V1J3JT5OOZFO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V1J3JT5OOZFO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great product that seems to have finally caught up to the times. I returned the Surge and this with it. as it came with about 6 and my friend ha spares. I have several Fitbits and love them and The Surge but I have a Charge HR and it does most the Surge can but I cannot read it outside. My favorite for my needs is the Basis Peak and it costs about $50 less and I like it a lot better. For it, Amazon only sells 1 screen packs for about $16, from Germany (about a week to 2 wait). If you have extras that you like for a larger screen I recommend custom cutting it or spring for the one recommended. If you speak Deutsch well enough, fine, If you are not fluent they will communicate in English if asked. Highly recommended and I have only used one of each pack of 4-6 of these screen protectors; 1, or 2 max is all you need per unit. Recommended!

A little 2 yo girl told me their dog (a nice lab) was covered in body lotion, licked it off and died. No big deal, they just bought another pup and this little girl love to pick them up and give them a big squeeze! One almost died from eating 'Snarol Kills Snails'.

"My first ten pack was mixed good and defective pads but  it was a manufacturing mistake, it happens. Great/fast/efficient/friendly customer service from Amazon AND Bear's Best Pet Products!! I was refunded right away and the company's follow-up was great and I was sent a free pack. It was all fine, my dog hit the Bull's-eye the first time but I think that was just luck as he has missed it completely all of the other times and seems to avoid the bull's-eye. A great idea but one cannot tell if the scent is on the bull...., but the pads absorbed well. I bought this to retrain my long Havanese (3yo) to hit the center and it is working well and is very absorbent. I recommend, will likely buy more, and hope this helps. It is a little small for my 23x23"" holder. I think it is a great pad for puppy training and the replacement pads seem very absorbent.. This size pad is best for very small/short dogs.

"This was a very rare DNF for me. I got through about 70% and finally threw in the towel. I went to the Red Queen wiki page to see how it ended, and just as I thought, I saw the deception and the 'plot twist' from a mile away. The second you see what type of person Queen Elarais, and then find out that Cal is her stepson and Maven is her real son (this is not a spoiler, it's introduced as soon as you meet them), then you already know what's going to happen.I found the characters to be extremely wooden and stereotypical. The poor Red girl trying to fit into the Silver Elite that she suddenly find herself apart of...the rough boy/love interest from her village who always seems to be angry...the prince who's been trained his whole life to become the next king (another love interest)...the 'spare' who never seems to live up to his perfect big brother (yet ANOTHER love interest)...the Silver Elite bitch who can can control metal...and the Evil Queen with an agenda.***Snooze***I've read it all before, and done better.

"I got this case to protect my new iPad and allow me to type a little easier.  It served both purposes.  The protection this case provides is very good and I had no problems while traveling through multiple airports and even dropped it a couple times.  The keyboard is very useful and works like a normal keyboard as long as the bluetooth is activated.  When I shifted to airplane mode, and lost the Bluetooth connection and it no longer served a purpose except to protect my iPad.  Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for good protection from a case that also provides a keyboard.  There are better cases for protection but not with keyboards.

"I love this vacuum! It has awesome suction and for how big and bulky it is, it's incredibly light! There are a couple minor annoyances (hence the 4 stars), but they're easy to live with.The cord holder is in an awkward place. The bottom of the hose is so close to the bottom rung of the cord holder that it can be a pain to wrap up the cord. I find that if I remove the canister and pull the hose away, it makes it much easier to wrap up, then just replace the canister when it's done. Also, the attachments (mainly the skinny attachment) never stays in place and always fall off. I just take it off and set it on the coffee table until I'm done vacuuming, then replace it when I store it.Overall though, this machine is awesome. I love how easy it is to remove the canister for cleaning hard to reach areas (behind the couch, ceiling fans), and the filter is washable and reusable...no need to purchase replacement anything for this vacuum. I live in a super-split level with three flight of stairs (about 6-7 stairs per flight) and this is very light to carry up and down to each floor...a major plus for me. Overall, I absolutely recommend this vacuum. I have both hardwood and carpet, and this vacuum does a great job at cleaning both.

"Not a bad story. Was a bit basic in it's storytelling...almost like a friend was re-hashing a ghost story to you, but it wasn't terrible. I agree with everyone who says this book needs an editor, cause it absolutely does. I read a bunch of the reviews before starting this though, so I was expecting it...I'm not deducting any stars based on the editing.Overall, a decent little story. Loved the setting and the majority of the main characters (though Sweetie Pie was really starting to irritate me. Who lets their CAT outside for a walk numerous times a day and then puts her in the car to go visit friends?? It was weird. I don't get why the author didn't just make her a dog).

"I have a few Fintie cases and I've always been very happy with their quality. I have a super slim Fintie case for my Kindle Voyage, but wanted something with a little more protection, so I ordered this. I am extremely happy with it. It has the auto-awake feature that I love, and it's protective without being bulky.I do want to mention though, the case I received is a little different than what I ordered. I purchased the black and white damask. The stock photo shows the inside of the case, the part that your kindle slides into, as having the same damask design as the outside...it does not. Mine is black on the inside. This actually works great for me as I was concerned the damask pattern on the inside would be distracting while reading. I've included some photos so you can see what I mean.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. This case offers great protection, is stylish and had an awesome price tag.

"I tried, I really, really did. There was just so much STUFF going on that most of the time I had no idea what was happening or where Steptember even was. There was so much detail that the story itself started to get lost (as least for me).The book is really well written, and the author has an amazing imagination, but this is a tough book to get through. Not only do you have to pay super close attention to all the minute details, but her vocabulary is way beyond that of the recommended age group (ages 10-14).

The arrows always suction to the target (when he hits it) and pop off easily.My only issue was the way this was packaged...the target, bow and all the arrows were just thrown in an Amazon box...no packaging, no containment.

"This is a beautiful, sleek, modern faucet. It replaced an older 2 handle faucet and having the single handle is a great improvement. The pull out sprayer is convenient as is the flow to spray button which allows you to go from having a normal water flow coning directly from the faucet to a spray. The faucet is angled rather than pointing straight down which does give you more versatility as you move the faucet around. It was relatively easy to install, no need to call a plumber.One thing to take notice of is that it's an ""all in one"" design.  So if you have a sink with an older faucet you'll either have to replace the entire sink or buy a few plugs to cover the holes left by the handles of an older faucet.  What we did was cover one hole and added a built-in dish soap dispenser where the other hole was located...handy!Having said all that, do I like the faucet?  Yes, very much.  Do I love it?

The tips are this weird stretchy, rubbery material that can sometimes be difficult to pull off the target. My son had some trouble getting a few off, but aside from that, he really liked this.Aiming can take a little getting used to since there's no traditional trigger, there's a handle that you pull pack. My son kept shooting way too high at first cause when he would pull the lever, his other hand would aim the gun up toward the ceiling. After a little practice he got the hang of it.Overall, great toy. Not sure how long the target is going to last, it's already started bending and becoming more and more disfigured each time we pull the bullets off, but for now, he's happy with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XFUYZ60U4R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBW8NMO#wasThisHelpful","R25XFUYZ60U4R5","A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love its printer! Set up was simple (I was able to do it myself in about 20 minutes, and I'm am by no means a 'techie'). Wi-Fi works great and I get clean pages printed out easily from my laptop. Printing is fast and the black ink is sharp. It is a pretty hefty printer size-wise, but I have it in a location where it's hardly seen.

"I'm fairly new to the world of flat irons. Prior to receiving this I was using a $40 iron I purchased at Walmart. I don't use one often as I feel they're very damaging, but that one seemed to do what it needed to do just fine.This flat iron feels very sturdy and well made (in fact, it's pretty heavy). It heats up very quickly and will shut itself off should you forget to (I don't know after how much time though...never really paid attention). My issue with it is that it takes numerous passes over the same strands of hair to get them perfectly flat. It goes up to 395 degrees, and there's a lot of steam coming off my hair, but it's not flattening it as quickly as my other iron did. I don't know anything about 'Nanoe Technology', but I'm not really sure it does anything. This $140+ flat iron (for me at least) doesn't do anything any better or more efficiently than my $40 flat iron. If I had paid for this item, I would absolutely return it and stick with my cheaper model.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXFNAW8CGVRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR4SSPW#wasThisHelpful","R2EXFNAW8CGVRF","A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not quite as good as the first 2, but still funny. I thought the chapter where the twins end up in Brooklyn and meet Adam the author was a bit confusing and unnecessary. I did NOT like the kids leaving the fairy tale world and bring brought into our world...it really cheapened the story for me.The whole point of fairy tales is to escape to another time and place. To read about far away characters in far away places having amazing and fantastical adventures. Having Jorinda and Joringle wander into 21st century New York City is just wrong. It took me a few chapters to shake my head of that and return to the Marchenwald. I kind of felt like I'd been awakened from a really great dream, then tried to go back to sleep and recapture some if it's magic. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same for me after that.Overall though, this was a highly entertaining series. I'm really glad I found this little trio of books. They're certainly dark, and not at all for children, but they're fun as well. A little misstep with this last book (in my opinion), but a great collection of stories as a whole.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20O1LS30IPB85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5UJAUC#wasThisHelpful","R20O1LS30IPB85","A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just as good as the first one! Where 'A Tale Dark and Grimm' focused on the adventures of Hansel and Gretel, 'In a Glass Grimmly' follows the travels of cousins Jack and Jill. While Mr. Gidwitz sticks to the original fairy tales a little less in this book, his stories are still just as good! He draws inspiration from many different places, but the gist of each chapter is made up of his own warped ideas (seriously...the giant story? Bleck!).If you like re-imagined dark fairy tales, then this is definitely the series for you. As soon as I finished this book I purchased and downloaded the final book to this series, 'The Grimm Conclusion'.

"My hair dresser showed me this tool last time I went in for a cut. I have pretty straight hair, but the underneath part of my hair is EXTREMELY curly. Just in one spot though (happened after I got pregnant years ago and ever went back). It's very, very difficult to get this part of my hair perfectly straight since it's so curly.Using this comb along with my flat iron has been fantastic. It took a little getting used to, but I quickly got the hang of it. The wand end is great for picking up sections of hair and running the straightener over without having to use your hands, and the comb helps pull the hair straight for the flat iron to go over.Overall, this was an awesome purchase. I'm not a fan of hair 'gadgets', and have used the same products and styling tools for years and years, but this was one new 'gadget' that I absolutely needed. I use it every time I wash and straighten my hair...now that I have it, I couldn't live without it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YWMNPL79IW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CA6O2ZG#wasThisHelpful","R6YWMNPL79IW2","A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R6DKN9YQ2YU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I looked everywhere for these out in town...no one carries them for children. My son (6) has seasonal allergies and gets very stuffy at night when he lays down. We have a humidifier in his room, but it only helps a little. These have been wonderful.At first I wasn't convinced that these would stay on. The first one I applied looked like it was coming up at the ends. I left it on for about 5 minutes but thought it was coming off. I went to pull it off and realized that no, it was in fact on there securely...it just LOOKED like it was popping up at each end. I applied a fresh one and we haven't had any issues with them in the week we've been using them. Each morning they're still firmly in place and my son says they help a LOT with allowing him to breath through his nose at night.So glad I was able to find these at Amazon, and for such a great price. I much prefer putting one of these on my son each nice than giving him allergy medicine. I'm not against medicine, but it's nice to have a drug-free solution to sleeping comfortably with seasonal allergies. I use the adult size myself in the spring and fall and they're amazing.

"I used this case for 2 days before removing it and stuffing it in a drawer. Set-up was simple and it worked perfectly fine, but it made things more difficult.First, once you set this up, the iPhone keyboard will no longer come up...EVER. So for simple tasks, like entering something in to my calendar, I had to tilt the screen and open this up. I use symbols in front of all my calendar events so I can easily identify things at a glance (a bowling ball and pins in front of Sunday Bowling, a needle icon in front of the days I have to take my shots, a money bag on 'pay rent' days, etc), but since they symbols are part of the iPhone keyboard, I could no longer access them.Also, you lose things you didn't even realize you used all the time....double-tap the iPhone space bar to add a period, automatic capitalization of the first letter of a sentence, even auto-correct for spelling goes away!

"I was sent this thermos to test and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review based on testing the product.The first thing that I noted is the thermos has a tiny cup on the lid. It is something fairly useless due to it being so very small. It only holds a few ounces. It is also plastic and the handle broke off after I dropped the thermos. Not a big deal, and the slim line of the thermos means that the cup has to be small in order to fit. Just be aware that the cup is tea cup sized.The box is covered in Asian writing, the only part in English is ""Stainless Steel Thermos"". Everything else is not readable. If that is going to bother you, skip this. (Not sure why it would as the thermos works as it should.)The thermos was tested with hot coffee. The coffee stayed hot for 4 hours and then the heat began to drop off after that. The lid has a flip top that I found a bit hard to drink from, it seems designed for pouring the liquid into a cup vs. drinking directly from it.The mouth is a narrow mouth, so do not expect to be able to use this for stews or to be able to fit a spoon inside to eat. This is better suited for use with liquids. It is hard to clean without a bottle brush, so be sure you have a bottle brush handy when the thermos arrives. This will help to keep it squeaky clean and remove coffee or tea stains from the inside easily.I am guessing this is not dishwasher safe, but the narrow mouth of the bottle would make it hard to get clean in a dishwasher, so that is probably for the best.The biggest flaw I found with it was the enamel like paint on the bottle is smudged in one spot and the stainless shows through. Quality control checks appear to have missed this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QG8RK4EWDO6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UOF3US#wasThisHelpful","R2QG8RK4EWDO6S","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this set of blackhead remover tools for free. The following is my unbiased review based on product testing over the course of a few weeks.These tools are an inexpensive but useful set. The case is cute and well made. The zipper functions without sticking or jamming on fabric or the stitches.Inside, the tools are durable. They are not flimsy nor easily broken. I am finding them to be of good quality. I rinsed one and left it to dry to test if it would rust. It didn't. That is important as I need to be able to clean these after use. There are no sharp edge and the tips are fashioned just thick enough to where my skin is not being cut, bruised or otherwise damaged. Blackheads and pimples are gently removed with a small amount of pressure using these.The tools are very effective at removing blackheads. There is a slight learning curve if someone has never used these before, do a search for how to use them, and find some good tips.This is a nice set. I already had two of my Aunts try to talk me out of the set. I had to nearly pry it out of one Aunt's hands, she was insisting that she needed it.

"I received this item for free from the seller. The following is my unbiased review based on product testing.This cute sofa arrived and I blew it up. It takes a very long time to blow up using breath. It was far easier after I switched to the pump for the air mattress. (What possessed me to try blowing it up by mouth??? Duh.)This tiny chair is adorable. It is toddler sized. The face is cute, it looks exactly like the picture. I found no leaks, and the air holes are the type that have a blocker piece of plastic so that all the air you blew in does not escape while you are taking another breath.The chair does smell of plastic as expected, but airing it out for a few days has helped. (It arrived Friday. By Monday, much of the strong odor had disappeared. There are no flaws that I can find other than it takes a lot of air to blow this up. Don't attempt if you have recently been ill or are short of breath. This took around 20 minutes to blow up using breath. 3 minutes to blow up using the electric pump.

"I was offered this bottle for free to evaluate and test it out. This is my honest review.I am going to start by saying I try to review objectively. I don't care if I was given an item for free or if I paid full price. I base my review on if I feel the item works as promised, how easy it is to use, etc... I want to be sure that someone reads my review, they get an honest look at the pros (if there are any) and the cons so they can judge for themselves if they wish to spend their money. I do take into account if the item is a $5 dollar store type of product and mention that it will ""do the job if you just need cheap"", but I also take into account if it doesn't even do that.This bottle is interesting. I didn't look at the blender ball before I ordered it. I was expecting a little metal coil thingie that most shaker bottles have now. This has a plastic ball that has little plastic spikes. My ""skeptical"" side kicked into high gear upon seeing that. I washed the bottle carefully, allowed it to dry and put it into product testing.The first thing I did was make sure to add gooey stuff to my bottle. Chia seeds, honey, chopped blueberries and then in a snarky mode, as it shows oatmeal on the tag, I tossed in some for good measure. My plan was to prove that after one use that silly looking ball was going to be cemented with food that would need dynamite to blast it off.To my surprise... The ball mixed this concoction with my juice nicely. Washing it up was easy. The few bits of seeds and oatmeal that remained came off with a bottle brush. I was happy to have been proven wrong. This ball, unlike those flexi spring things actually mixes thicker drinks. It won't grind up fruit for smoothies, but it will mix those premade smoothies with other stuff added in! (Yes I tried it!)On to what is great about this bottle. There are two small snack containers included. One fits inside the bottle. I would not leave it there when it was full of a drink because the bottom of it would be coated with liquid. Either one snaps onto the bottom of the bottle for transport. I have never had a bottle that did this before, but it is a good idea. One option for the inner container is to fill the bottle with veggie pieces, then use the container for dip or cheese and nuts. Or even ice.The bottle washes up easily. It is dishwasher safe. It says it is microwave safe. It is freezer safe. BPA free too. All these are bonus points. I do not like the fact that is not at least opaque but we can't have everything!I would recommend this bottle to anyone who needs a multi-use bottle. If you are looking for just a basic bottle without the extra containers/freezer/microwave safe functions, there are other slightly less expensive bottles out there, but this bottle is a good one. It is very well made. It passes the drop test without breaking or the lid popping open. (Yes, I test that stuff because I have had bottle failures when dropped. I drop stuff, it's a fact of my life. I am that person going to die from choking on food after tripping over the cat.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KEIXDWB81C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OT7J6U#wasThisHelpful","R37KEIXDWB81C8","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this set of headphones to test and review. The following is my review based on testing the product. I hope that the honest people will vote this as being helpful, the unscrupulous people are going to vote it unhelpful to hide it.I wanted to like this set of headphones. I really wanted to like them. If I grade them only on the look, the product packaging and the excellent directions, they would get a 5 star review. I was excited to try this great looking set of headphones.The reason they are getting two stars is the headphones stutter. Not once or twice for a few seconds per hour, the set sent to me stutters and cuts out more than it is smooth. I wore them on a 15 minute walk to the corner market and back, and couldn't wait to turn them off. I only caught half of the story because it  was tting in d o t lik this. (Oh, you can't read that? Well, that was how my audio book sounded! That should read it was cutting in and out like this.) There were a few smooth patches, but testing while sitting still, walking, having the phone sitting right against them, all of it, it stuttered and cut out.I didn't test the bass. I did test the controls which are great. The noise canceling is good. I really, really, REALLY love the controls buttons that are easy to find and use. The overall fit was good, there was a slight bit of slippage from my ears but I changed to the alternate set of ear pieces sent and they fit excellently after that. I like the magnetic part that keeps the headphones from slithering off my neck when I remove them from my ears. I really wanted to like these, they fit, look and the sound I could hear that was smooth, was great.It boils down to this, a fully charged set of headphones stuttered more than they played smoothly over a 15 minute test, giving me a headache. I do not recommend this model based on the product testing I was able to perform before a migraine began trying to push my eyes from my skull. Bear in mind that the product I receive might or might not be a good representation of the overall quality of a product. I could have been sent a perfect or an imperfect unit, you might receive a better or worse working unit and your experience might vary greatly from mine. I can only base my review on what arrived for me to try out. This set was a dud.I don't this is a case of ""you get what you pay for"", I think this is a case of not every set is going to be made perfectly. Some mistakes slip through. The problem is, if this was a set I paid full price for, and they showed up not working, would I pay to ship them back? What about the shipping money I would have lost if I didn't have Prime? I am sorry to the people who are down voting the helpfulness of this, and as always, I make the following offer to the seller.. Offer me a second pair that is fulfilled by Amazon (so I get the same headphones anyone else would receive when ordering) so that I can test the second set. This set is malfunctioning.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5Y601GDPQ9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168G56MQ#wasThisHelpful","RQ5Y601GDPQ9F","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this bra to test and review. The following is my unbiased review based on product testing.The bra fits like a minimizer. My breasts were not cradled by the cups as I had hoped they would be. Instead, the cups are slightly smaller than they should be for a C cup. I am doubtful that a size up would have helped. The way the bra cups are shaped, this bra feels overall uncomfortable. My breasts felt compressed, and it wasn't because the fit was small, it was because of the shaping.Overall comfort of the bra was okay, but not fantastic. The left strap seemed to be sewn slightly off kilter. Adjusting did not help, it was positioned on my shoulder slightly too far off my arm, over my shoulder joint. It made for a very odd feel.I was going to wear the bra today to test how it held up and felt after a day's use, but I decided against it after trying it on and disliking the way it felt.

"I received this for free for testing. The following is my unbiased review based on testing this waist cincher.I consider a true corset to have lacing, this does not have lacing. The boning is lacking in stiffness, it flexes with my curves. I could feel it almost rolling up as I tried bending. The boning bends in half with no pressure. If you purchase it and are too large for it, it will most likely cause the boning to tear through the fabric.The first thing to note is this is latex, spandex and cotton. It smells of latex. Do not order this if you have or suspect you have (or your partner has) a latex allergy! The corset is heavy with the the fabric weight, this says it is four seasons, I wouldn't trust the breathibility of the fabric if you are prone to overheating.This is a decorative cincher that will not provide waist training. It will provide support to help keep your extra weight a bit flatter. Remember, the boning bends, it is not going to make your size 12 body resemble a size 8! It won't compress your body like a true corset or waist trainer. This is a body shaper garment.This is a longer line cincher, but with the bendable boning that can be good and bad. You could end up with destroyed or rolling boning if you purchase a size that is too small for you. Order your true waist size, not what you are hoping to achieve.This product is a good piece of shape wear. Have patience and work up to wearing it for longer than an hour or two at a time at first. It can cause a back ache if you normally slouch. If you cannot wear a girdle, this will be uncomfortable also. Use common sense when you purchase.If you must have stiff or are a plus sized lady, spend the extra at a custom shop to purchase a corset. If you are looking for a photo shoot costume, fantasy play or a way to make a pretty dress fit more smoothly, this will fit the bill","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95ZFV8QIMF8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016M67OAY#wasThisHelpful","R95ZFV8QIMF8O","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these changing pad liners for free or at a deep discount. The following is my unbiased and honest review based on having tested the liners.I have never used this type of liner before. I have always used thin receiving blankets or cloth diapers. I didn't realize I was missing out by not investigating this type of liner before.These liners are nice. I like the fact that despite the waterproof backing, there is no plastic smell. I am very sensitive to odors and these arrived fragrance free! I like the bamboo being used,  bamboo can make a great fabric.The liners are thin enough to be used in several different ways. They are thin enough to be tossed a diaper bag or even rolled up and put in the glove box. They can be used as a bib for an older child, or used as a place mat. I hesitate to mention it, but I used one this weekend as a liner for a cat carrier for a young kitten. (It worked great to keep food contained! Kittens walk and crawl in their food dishes!)These liners clean up fast, no stains, not even stains from the squash baby food that dripped on, and was left on over night in the diaper bag. It came out with a wash, no bleach or stain removers needed!The liners are soft to the touch, absorbent and handy to keep around. They are large enough to place a child on them for changing, even for those ""maybe we better just wash the kid down outside with a hose"" messes.Five stars for versatility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EEANOY1W0M8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176U1SOS#wasThisHelpful","R1EEANOY1W0M8C","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was sent free for evaluation. The following is my unbiased review.This is a dual sided grinder. It arrived in a plain unmarked box. No directions were included, but I was able to find directions by searching on line. Annoying because I had no idea how to fill it.This opens on each end by unscrewing it. One side can be filled with salt and the other with pepper or two kinds of pepper if you prefer. The grinding attachment is adjustable and it takes a small twist to adjust.This is an inexpensive grinder and the grinding parts are inexpensive. It will grind your pepper or salt for a year or two before it needs replacing.The one flaw I see is that it is a pain to have to pop the end caps off and put them back on after grinding. I would prefer these were not needed, but it does keep the counter and the grinding apparatus clean by leaving them on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P60ENBNTE0Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQV9PB6#wasThisHelpful","R3P60ENBNTE0Z7","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this set of headphones for free to test and review. The following is my initial review after testing the item out, my review is unbiased and reflects my honest opinion. This and all my reviews are subject to be changed if my opinion changes or the device has issues at any time during testing.The first thing I am going to say is that I am waffling between a three and a four star review due to functionality. Let me explain my reasoning. These headphones are designed to fasten around my neck like a circle. That's okay, I don't mind that part. That keeps them from getting lost, too many headsets slide off when out of the ears, this is a bonus. The neck cord does not flop around too much for power walking or jogging.The buttons are in an awkward spot on the cord. There is a way to pause the music or sound, but the buttons are small and hard for cold fingers to find. Or I have to miss a few seconds of audio book to remove them from my ears and click them together. I am not impressed with that. Finding the volume control buttons is also awkward, it requires me to stop walking to find them.The sound is clear and crisp for music and other audio. Bass is moderately good. Not as strong as it could be, but not limp either. Skipping happened around once per hour for 10-30 seconds at a time. The skipping increased as the battery wore down. (Expected.) I was able to listen to music for 7 hours and 20 minutes before the battery died. I was able to wander into another room and the headset kept connection.These headphones do not have ""bleed through noise."" On high, with the headphones hanging around my neck but not clicked together, I cannot hear the sound. That means no one else will be able to hear my music either when they are in my ears, even if (and I don't) I choose to listen at top volume. It means that if you like loud music, no one on the bus or subway will be listening along with you. This is a bonus.The directions for using the headphones are mostly clear and easy to read. Everything is broken down and is in decent though not perfect English. The only thing that is not made clear is the warranty period.The headphones are not as comfortable or as easy to use as I was hoping. The buttons need to be made slightly larger and the commands for use need to be made easier. Pushing the multi function button to pair the device, turn it on, turn it off, etc... is not easy to use while around my neck. Granted, it is slightly easier than if the buttons were on the earpieces vs. hanging slightly down on the cord, but it would be easier if it were lower on the cord.The microphone is in the same spot as the buttons and I found that people were having trouble hearing me properly. I gave up after two calls and placed my phone against my ear.  Persons on the other end said they were getting wind noise and background noises, and said that my voice was cutting in and out. I could hear them without a problem. I tried calling from inside but apparently my voice was still not as clear. That means that for me, as a blue tooth calling device, this headset is useless for business calls. For casual or brief calls where I ask the client to hold momentarily while I switch off blue tooth will work. I am often outside and need a good quality headset for speaking to clients, this one is not going to work for that.All in all, these have a few more cons than pros for me. These are going to be tested for the next two weeks but then will be passed on to someone who is not as picky as myself. I wish I could leave a better review for the first review written on these headphones, but I write honest reviews because I do not ever want someone to buy something that doesn't work as hoped.For music and audio listening, these are a 4. For phone use, they are a 3. I cannot give this set a solid 4 in good conscience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLI2669UQB88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017BAA8VC#wasThisHelpful","R2VLI2669UQB88","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This backpack was given to me for free to test and evaluate the usability of it. The following is my unbiased review after testing the backpack.I received the color â€œnew blackâ€.  The pack arrived in a plastic zip lock bag, and was zipped into a â€œbackpackâ€ looking shape. There is a small handle for carrying or to clip it to my luggage, bike rack, etc.This backpack is rated at four stars because of the following bonuses I found when examining the pack.*Several pockets and places to stash goods. There are two mesh side pockets. There is a front zipper pocket, a main compartment and a small pocket inside the main compartment.*The bag is well sewn together. I found no loose threads, no missed stitches. Everything was sewn properly, and will hold up.*The bag is light weight. This makes it easy to stow and carry with me before use. It can be packed into a suitcase or thrown in the back of the car for day trips.The straps are lightly padded, they wonâ€™t protect against a heavily filled pack, but this pack is not designed to stuff full of heavy objects. I will not be using it to carry more than 10 pounds of stuff, whatever that stuff might be.The zippers are all working, none are jamming. They should hold up to handling.All in all, it is a good light use pack that can be taken along on trips, or used for errands. I love bags that fold up, it makes it easy to grab them when going on tourist excursions or day hikes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JYGJJB4DAYQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017168E6W#wasThisHelpful","R1JYGJJB4DAYQE","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Offered this bracelet for free, I instead accepted free shipping and paid full price for the bracelet. The following is my unbiased opinion.This is not the same bracelet as is pictured. These beads are either smaller or the cable length is far longer. There is at least 1.5 inches of bare cable. There is the exact amount of beads shown in the picture and in the description, minus any gold beads. (They meant silver.)There are six beads on one side, the heart in the ""center"", and seven beads on the other side. They should make the sides even in amount. People who need symmetrical objects will be annoyed.The beads are beautiful but the overall look is not as shown, the colors are pink vs red & pink, which is fine, but the vast amount of bare cable is displeasing. I am not happy with the look. The beads are beautiful but marred by the overall look. This length of cable needs more beads to make it look completed. Now, it looks as if they ran out of beads.The lack does show even when on my wrist. This is a beautiful bracelet that needs extra beads, the larger bracelets must look even more bare.The latch closes firmly and is not easily bumped open. The safety chain will keep the bracelet from slipping off by accident. This could be a fantastic gift by adding a few more beads. Or slightly larger beads.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XG45R7GSJVYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MERVU#wasThisHelpful","R2XG45R7GSJVYI","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this backpack mat bag for free from Gecko Active to try and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review based on trying out the bag.Update: This has become my new favorite bag. I love all the pockets! I can organize everything neatly!The bag is very impressive. It is a well made backpack, made from heavyweight material. The bag feels substantial when hefted before it is filled. I carefully checked all of the stitching points and found it to be correctly sewn with no sloppy stitching. The backpack passed their quality control checks with flying colors. All zippers function smoothly without catching on fabric or snagging on themselves.The straps that hold my yoga mat or even my rolled jacket, are easy to fasten snuggly without being too tight so that my mat has marks. I was concerned about that at first, wary that the straps might compress my mat too much, but that was not an issue.The main compartment of the backpack is ample and sized to fit many different things. I can fit a spare change of clothes and shoes, to be able to change out of my work out gear if I desire. I liked that my stuff did not feel crammed inside.The outer pocket is almost large enough for my walking shoes for after class, I could make them fit by not zipping it all the way closed. The smaller zipper pocket will hold my cell phone and a wallet plus my keys nicely.The cross body strap is ideal, I do not feel choked and my neck is not being rubbed against, this is a problem with some cross body bags. It was easy to adjust to fit me.This is a very well made backpack and I can see that it has many other uses besides a yoga bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4OYV1VKKWRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150BPXOQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C4OYV1VKKWRH","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this set for free. The following is my unbiased opinion based on trying the shampoo and conditioner as labeled.The shampoo and conditioner both have light fragrances that have almost a honeysuckle scent to them. I found the smell to be pleasing.The shampoo was great. It lathers, it felt as if my hair was well washed after using it. I had no complaints in this department. The shampoo is worth using. I would give the shampoo 5 stars.The conditioner is the problem. I used the conditioner, leaving it on for five minutes and using a copious amount of it as my hair tends to tangle depending on the type of conditioner. It rinsed out entirely. The problem was, my hair tangled as if it was felted wool. I had to spend nearly twenty minutes detangling my hair, normally this is a three minute process of simply combing out the tangles. After using the conditioner, my hair was a mass of snarls. I combed it out and the next day it was tangled just as badly. I will never use this conditioner again.The good side of the combo was that my hair had no fly away pieces and looked shiny. The bad side was the tangles. I cannot use a combo that is going to leave my hair in snarls.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFSKAV1SIIYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GRXWCO#wasThisHelpful","R1KFSKAV1SIIYN","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using MidNite for several years. For the most part it works and helps me drift off to sleep.There are some nights where my own brain will not turn off, those night, nothing helps other than prescription anti-anxiety or other prescription medication to turn off my brain. I have learned the difference and can take what I need to help me sleep.With MidNite, as promised, there is no problem with next day drowsiness. I wake up and feel as if I slept. No drugged feeling, no sluggish morning (unless I waited until 1 am to take it and wake as usual at 4 am)The pills are lightly flavored, nothing heavy to stimulate my taste buds or set off my heart burn.

"I was offered this door stop for free for product testing and evaluation. The following is my unbiased review after testing the product.This door stop has grip. The rubber pieces go all the way around the door stop so that it can be used on either side. The rubber grips the tile and kept my door from slamming closed. I was skeptical due to the light weight, but it held fast and did not allow the door to slam shut. This does the job and is not ugly. The rubber will keep the metal from scratching my floor. (Metal is rounded and not sharp.)The lack of a star is for quality control problems. The rubber was cut sloppily, there are several jagged pieces not removed from the straps. This is petty, but I feel items shouldn't be sent out looking less than perfect. Either sell slightly imperfect ones at a discount or return them to the manufacture for replacement. If no one speaks up, the assembly line won't slow down long enough to ensure perfect specimens are being sent off. The scraps left behind do not affect anything except aesthetics, but aesthetics are important also. Yes, even for a door stop. The second issue with aesthetics is one of the rubber pieces is placed on slightly crooked. Again, yes, it matters because a product put together in a sloppy way makes me wonder if it will hold up long term, or if the metal quality was skimped on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IUAIFHVF8H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HOSZ22#wasThisHelpful","R35IUAIFHVF8H1","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This quick charge USB cable and plug was sent to me for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased review based on testing the unit.This seems to be working great. The plug itself is a slim-line plug so it fits into power strips without taking up two or three spaces, that is a major bonus as I dislike plugs that are bulky.The USB cable works great with my Samsung S3 and S6. There were no problems with either phone. Both of my phones charged as quickly as they normally charge, and they charged without the dreaded errors. I also tested the cable in a few other devices, including a Bluetooth headset, a set of headphones and a small night light that all use the same adapter. Again, no problems, the cable charged all devices.As with all of my reviews, I base my review on the sample provided to me and not on what the manufacture claims it can do. I test all products and leave them in testing for several months to ensure that the product working was not a one week fluke as items do fail.

"I was offered this bike pump for free to evaluate.Sadly, the pump is being given the ""it's okay"" rating of three stars. This is not a horrible rating, but it does mean that I found a few issues with it while testing it.This is made of alloy aluminum so it is very lightweight. It is a compact size as well. These two things combined to mean that it isn't perfect. It takes quite a bit of pumping to get the tire pumped up. It also takes a bit of effort to make the seal tight enough to actually pump up the tire vs letting all of the air out of it. Once everything is connected properly, the pumping must begin.I am used to larger more efficient pumps. This is not one of those, this is a small pump that will allow you to add a small bit of air to an under-inflated tire. This took me 10 minutes to connect and pump up an inner tube. I felt as if I were trying to blow up the Goodyear Airship for all of the effort it took.This bike pump looks great and it very light, but for function, it isn't as good as I hoped.

"This bra was sent to me for testing and evaluation. The following is my unbiased review.I fall within the range of the XL 36ABC cups so I ordered this size. I was worried after seeing that others said it would not fit.This bra fits my 36C body fasten in the tightest loops. The support is non-underwire, but it works well for support. I am not sagging. The cups provide full coverage of my breasts without them bulging out the top or under the sides. The overall feel is comfortable.This bra is true to color, the dark blue and the polka dots are very cute. I did not find the lace to be scratchy at all. It is soft and did not show through my thinner shirts.There is an extra extension included with the bra so that in case it did not fit, this would add an extra inch to the bra band. Thankfully, I do not need the extension.The bra cups are made with enough padding to keep cold nipples out of site and there are places to slide in absorbent pads if those are needed.This is a cute bra, it's not a ""sexy"" bra overall, but it is a good looking bra without the matronly looking of many nursing bras on the market. The polka dots and dark color make it just flirty enough to be fun, though the dark color means it needs to be worn under darker shirts to prevent show through. (Needs to be said, I see many women who don't think to look at their bra being on display under their light colored shirts.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEBHAMGWEJND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ054NQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HEBHAMGWEJND","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this lock for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased review after trying out the item.The first thing that struck me as hysterical about this lock is that it arrived with the keys firmly attached to the hasp. I had to remove one key from the split ring in order to open the lock. Seems to be a silly way to ship keys, and I have not purchase a padlock of any type where the keys were attached like this.The padlock itself is obviously not for use in locking up anything of value as it shows the pins inside. Anyone with a bit of lock picking skill could pick it. (That being the point.)The lock is easy to use and rather fun to practice on. The biggest problem is that the lock opens so fast, it is a blur of motion. When the pins are exactly right, it's open in a flash. I would have liked to be able to see the lock open in slow motion so that I could watch it in action more precisely. That would make it easier for a beginner to learn.This lock is well made and seems to be durable. It is going to be fun to learn the craft of picking a padlock just for the heck of doing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKVM3W1STDVKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJAVS00#wasThisHelpful","RKVM3W1STDVKW","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Product recieved for free with understanding that I would evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.This supplement is very well made. It is what I look for when I seek out turmeric, it is 500mg curcumin.These pills have worked well for me as an anti-inflammatory as I hoped they would. I will not make my claims here as this not allowed. They do work for me and that is the main thing.The one thing I will note about properly made supplements is they give me heartburn. My stomach dislikes it and that is the first clue I took high quality turmeric vs something that won't work as well.These pills have no taste, strong but not overpowering smell, only a touch of aftertaste due to my heartburn that results. These pills are providing the anti- inflammatory response I was hoping for. The lowered inflammation equals less soreness for me.

I have no real idea how much to give as over the top of food dressing since feeding as a whole treat doesn't work. Even the whole treats were mostly crumbled and all different sizes.I vote no.

"I received this item for free from the vendor for product testing. When the grater arrived, I examined it, tried it, then gave it to my cousin who is a chef to try out.This is the combined opinion from both of us. The grater is a great one.The grater has several small extras that many other graters do not. This one is all metal. All stainless steel means it is less prone to rust and less prone to breakage. (Why do they sell plastic graters? Graters are pushed on and abused!)This grater has a good handle for pressing down on and helping to hold it steady. The rubber bumper on the bottom keeps the grater from sliding across the counter. It also helps to keep scratches off my cousin's marble countertop. (He says he is ""a man and he doesn't always have time to grab a cutting board."") The non skid is especially useful for me because it means it stays where I am holding it. Having a grater slipping around means that I put my hands at risk for being grated.This grater has one flaw in my opinion. I prefer a smaller zesting side and a wider small holed grater. I tend to use the small grater more than the large or the zester side. The sides are ample and I have no problem grating on the smaller side, but it seems out of place. I am nit picking to be sure, but my brain wants the small grater on the larger side instead of the zester.All in all, despite my perceived flawed placement of the small grater holes, this is a grater that is a must have for a kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QTVHD52R0K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SBG2TU#wasThisHelpful","R11QTVHD52R0K3","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered these nipple clamps for free, but declined the code and paid the asking price for them. Why? Because I felt like doing so.I am going to get the con out of the way first. The chain in the center is not quite long enough, it should be a bit longer so that the center of the chain can be placed in the bottom's mouth to give a bit of an extra tugging sensation if wanted. Nit picking, I know, but it should be a few inches longer.These are not a high class set of clamps, they are not meant to be, hence the term ""beginner"". They can be adjusted to make them tighter or looser which is important for those who are just starting out. The clamps can be made moderately tight, true masochists will want them tighter, but for beginners, it is important to start lighter. Too tight can turn a bottom off of nipple play in a hurry if they do not have a good pain tolerance. We call that breaking our toys and it's not a good idea. (It can also get you thrown in jail, play safely and sanely, if both of you are not saying yes, it's no longer consensual. I don't give a darn what they print in books like Shades of Gray. Consent is a MUST, period.)These have padded rubber on them that helps to alleviate the ""bite"" or ""pinch"" somewhat. The tightest is still not as tight as other types of clamps which is good for beginners.They are an inexpensive set as expected by the price, but still are quite nice and for the amount of use a beginner will be giving them, they will hold  up nicely. They are metal but light weight. (Needs to be light weight for beginners or there would be too much of a tug against the nipples.) If heavier clamping/more weight is desired, the person can move up to a better quality set.One other minor flaw to note is that they are for small nipples, not the nipples found on larger breasts that are larger than a lady's pinky nail. For bigger nipples and a beginner, the clamp must be placed slightly behind so that they do not pinch unmercifully.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314KU73B9Y8BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQIB3SC#wasThisHelpful","R314KU73B9Y8BC","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item for free to test out and evaluate. I have no prior connection with the company, and was not coerced into any type of review.Not very sexy, a shower hose, I know. But needed because who can feel sexy when they aren't clean. (Okay, I guess some of you are into that.)This hose comes with just what I needed to hook it up. Gaskets are included, I just needed a roll of plummer's tape. (I actually didn't even need that, this hose fit correctly with no places spraying water around the threads, but after initial testing, I reinstalled it with plummer's tape as I was taught that this is the correct method of installing shower hoses.)This hose is properly threaded so the water actually goes through the hose, not out the threads. The hose holds securely and screwed in place without cross-threading. The hose allows for good pressure but also have enough space that I could add a flow restrictor (CA drought) before screwing on the shower head.This hose does not tangle easily which is a bonus, and it seems as if it will hold up to lots of showers, dog washing (Boxer won't fit in the laundry sink) and is long enough to use to rinse the shower and tub or wash my hair.All in all, it is a good hose and I am hopeful that it will last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RSP1GYK2WAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OJEH94#wasThisHelpful","R37RSP1GYK2WAL","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this hand held sprayer nozzle for free to test and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.I truly enjoy being able to write honestly good reviews. I try to only accept items that I can use. This is something I have needed for the laundry room sink for a while. I decided to agree to accept it, after all, if it turned out to be junk, I could toss it in the trash.It is not junk. This little sprayer is great! I am a happy girl to have it attached to my sink. (I rigged up a dual attachment so that this is attached to one side with a hose and the other is free to use as a regular faucet. My garage is dark and cluttered as are most garages so I didn't take a picture.)This sprayer has more power than I expected it to have. There are two modes, one is press on the handle for short use or for washing the Chihuahua, leave it in ""always on"" mode. (Got to, the Chihuahua is like washing three angry badgers at the same time, I need extra hands to wash him.) I can now use my laundry sink for good rinsing of dogs or delicates.I can also wash the sink properly. My sink functions as the washer drain which means that there is a lot of dirt and who knows what else going into the that sink. I like clean sinks. With this attached to a short hose, I can now rinse the entire deep sink after scrubbing it out with my magic blue cleaner. I was rinsing it before with a small bucket, which was a pain in the neck.This is a plastic gadget that seems to be sturdy enough (ignoring the tooth marks from the angry dog) and it has enough pressure to rinse sinks, dogs or delicates without blasting the skin or lace off any of the above. I am happy with this little sprayer. My only small complaint is that it is a bit small for male hands and is more suited towards smaller hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QHQSQUEO73JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODYAE2#wasThisHelpful","R3QHQSQUEO73JK","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this shower head for free to test the quality. The following is my unbiased review.This shower head is plastic. That doesn't worry me because the shower head I am replacing is plastic, it lasted for years.  I am not sorry to say that I slammed this Purelux model around a bit to see if it broke easily before I installed it. I drop things, this is going to bang on the tub, smack against the tile, get grabbed by the dog while he is being washed, it has to hold up! It passed my dropping tests, no dings. Drop test passed, I installed it.This has power! My long hair needs pressure and this shower head provides it. I was able to wash my hair without standing there for five minutes rinsing. The massage feature is nice, and it is easy to change between them or go half/half. My roommate was impressed. He said that there is enough pressure that he only needs to turn the water half on to get the same pressure as the other shower head. (Not me, I use it full pressure. I have long hair, I need pressure! It's why I replaced my old shower head, the mineral deposits were building up.)This is a good shower head for my needs. It is plastic, but I am not living in a picture perfect home, so I do not mind like some would. This has good pressure and was easy to install. Those were the things that mattered to me, not the name brand or a metal shower head. Function and cost efficient is more important. I have used some of those uber expensive shower heads at friend's houses and haven't been impressed with the pressure. Sure, they look gorgeous but this shower head spiffs up with a microfiber towel, vs fighting the water spots and fingerprints on the fancy metal ones.The shower head spigots/nozzles (? what are the spots where the water comes out called?) are easy to rub minerals off so that they do not build up on the head, stopping the flow and the wonderful pressure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E4T3RO1BH3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODXQVU#wasThisHelpful","R3E4T3RO1BH3X","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these bulbs for free to test them out. I tried them in a desk lamp, the following is my unbiased review.I wish I could say ""they are light bulbs, how hard is it to review? Who cares about a light bulb review?"" I care.Light bulbs are supposed to work as promised and I would be angry if I purchased a dud set. Thankfully this set is not a dud.I tested each and every bulb. Yes, really, I did. I had to make sure that the first and second bulb were not a fluke. Every bulb in the batch worked as promised.The light is clear and free from shadows. (Seriously, I have tried bulbs that cast odd shadows due to bubbles in the glass!) I do not have a watt tester to ensure that the wattage listed is spot on, but I will say that the bulbs cast the light I expected for a non led 20 watt bulb. These were tested in a desk lamp.The product says they will last for 20 years. I am not sure if this is true or not, I did not receive them 20 years ago. I have had one of the bulbs in use for 12 hour days for 3 weeks, not close to 20 years, but a good test for me to say that the bulbs are lasting as I expected them to last. They are at least not burning out after one or two days or even after two weeks of steady use.These bulbs only fit in sockets that have pins. They do not fit in any other socket. Be sure you are purchasing the correct replacement bulb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344FUZKU8X5CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGU01KY#wasThisHelpful","R344FUZKU8X5CF","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item for free to test and evaluate. The following is an unbiased review from a newbie to yoga and straps.The straps arrived. I looked at them dubiously. I did not see a PDF with instructions, nor did I receive one. I was baffled regarding how to use these straps.Off I went to the Internet for guidance because I was not going to ask a yoga guru what must be a newbie question. Information was granted. Armed with my new knowledge, I began to use the straps.Here are my thoughts about the straps, coming from the perspective of a newbie. The straps are soft enough to use without chafing my skin and are comfortable to hold. They made it easier to stretch while following the instructions on the webpage I found.The straps are very well made, the stitching is firm and they appear to be made from good quality fabric. I don't think they are going to fall apart anytime soon.The downfall to these straps is the buckles! These buckles are hard to use. I gave up trying to use the buckles, it shouldn't be as frustrating as it is to buckle them. This is why I downgraded them from a 4 to a 3. The buckles being hard to use are keeping me from being able to fully use the straps.I am going to be looking around for a set of straps that have easier to use buckles. These straps are good for helping me stretch, but are not good for cinching. Hats off to those with patience to fasten them, I am not going to take my time to fuss with the buckles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8G694KPPMMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTNWVGG#wasThisHelpful","RL8G694KPPMMG","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered the WineCubby free to evaluate and test out. The following is what I found when I tested it.This is an interesting item. It is one of those things that at first glance, you think ""Why?"" Then, as I began to look at it and think about it, I realized why.This consists of three parts. There is a teeny funnel that is amply large enough to use for transferring a bottle of wine into the cubby. There is the cubby that has a screw top to keep the wine inside the bag. There is also a bag that is designed to go around the cubby.Let's talk semantics for a minute. Pour the wine into the bag.. Sounds easy enough, right? Nope. Add me, a klutz of the first order. Trying to hold the bag, hold the bottle and manage to pour wine into the funnel should have been videotaped. Thankfully, I know that I am less than graceful and I set the cubby in the sink for filling. After I poured about half a cup of wine down the drain, I put the wine cubby in a tall vase for support. Now I could hold the funnel in one hand, the wine bottle in the other and not make a mess. Filled bag. Done.The outer bag has a very inexpensive zip-lock type of fastener. Air can be squeezed out while it is properly closed. I won't be relying on this to keep any spilled wine inside, so I am not going to use it. It needs an upgrade to make it easier to seal and needs to seal properly. I do not expect it to last more than a few uses, the seal reminds me of the dollar store storage bags. It's not really that important for the overall function of the WineCubby.The uses... Wine, water, juice or even mixed drinks that do not need chilling. This can be taken places where glass is not allowed or wanted, such as around the swimming pool or at the beach. It can be taken on picnics, backpacking or packing by horse/mule back. The only real limit is your imagination. Real wine aficionados will want to skip it because half the point of expensive wine is uncorking, inspecting the cork, verifying the name on the bottle. If you don't care about that, and just wish to carry your favorite wine along, this is an option.There is a bit of a bonus here as well. Use an aerator to put your wine into the bottle and presto, you have wine that has breathed and is ready to go when you arrive at your destination. (Don't leave it packed for days and it will be fine.)As you can probably tell, I do not drink bottles of wine that cost more than $50 or I wouldn't be agreeing to cart it around in this WineCubby. I am above Two Buck Chuck and Wine in a Bag (wait, THIS is wine in a bag!) but not in the 25+ year old exclusive stuff either. This WineCubby will suit my needs fine and goes nicely with my set of silicone wine glasses. It can travel to the lake and bounce inside a cooler strapped to a jetski on the way to the distant shore.

"I received this digital scale for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased review after testing the scale.This scale is typical of most sold. The directions state that it is not a medical grade scale. It also says not place more then 11 pounds on it.This scale is easy to read and easy to use. I was able to quickly cycle through the different displays to find the measurement I wanted. (grams, ounces, pounds, and even cups and milliliters if I want to measure liquid.)As a person who is beginning to get into bread making, measurements are vital. Until I began weighing flour, sugar, etc, I had no idea that one cup could be so different in weight. Or that an egg's volume actually makes a major difference in the way a recipe turns out!This scale is large enough to hold my mixing bowl or measuring cups securely so that I can measure my ingredients. I didn't realize that size matters with digital scales until I began testing this one out. My bowls are not balanced on a surface that is better sized for weighing letters than items inside bowls.This scale is easy to tare out so that I only measure my ingredients, not the bowl also. (Amazing how much a plastic bowl weighs and how much of a difference being off by just that much under the amount of flour will matter.)The biggest flaw I can find is due to its size it is hard to find a place to store it. I have a gourmet cooking brain, forced to work in a condo sized kitchen. Storage cannot be under anything and it cannot be stored on its side. I finally decided to store it on top of the fridge. This is too nice a scale to give up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFSQW4XX1WZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WU0FUO#wasThisHelpful","R1KFSQW4XX1WZG","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this wallet for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.The wallet arrived. I opened it and looked it over. The first thing I noticed about the wallet was that there was residue on a half inch section from something, perhaps a price or quality control tag. I was able to clean this off using a small drop of leather cleaner.The inside of this wallet case has lots of pockets and space inside. It easily held my phone. The one thing I really dislike and that would keep me from using it, is the wallet does not unzip so that I can open it completely. It is built so that it opens and I can look inside, like an accordion folder, it does not open and lay flat like a file folder. It would be more useful to me if it opened flat. Other people might not care, I mention it for those who do care.This leather is thankfully tanned correctly, there is no foul odor as there sometimes is when improperly tanned leather is used.. It is a pretty wallet and the bright pink color is uniform with no dull patches or odd marks.It is a good wallet, though I was less than pleased with the sticky substance on it.

"I was given this ""camping lamp"" for free to evaluate and review. This is my unbiased and likely unpopular opinion of this lamp after testing it.UPDATE: 11/8/15 my handyman took it. He was greatly impressed with it. He said it was perfect for using in dark corners and it provided enough light. He didn't mind the design.First mark against it, a lack of directions. This package doesn't even say what it does or should do. There is a panel that says ""levels"". The levels are Normal, Dim, Bright, Supernova and Blinking Flash.I surmised by the included cable that this is charged via a USB cable. There is a red light that comes on while it is being charged. The red light goes steady when it is charged is my assumption.The light comes from the side vs from the end as a flash light would. This struck me as odd but I do note that the light is not prone to rolling around. when I set it down, it stays with the lighted side pointing in the direction I place it.The ""normal"" light is not very bright at all, like a dim nightlight. The dim is even dimmer. Each click of the switch makes it brighter and brighter, then it turns into a blinking light.The side panel shows that it can be used for camping, hiking, bicycling, fishing, reading, walking at night, ""inside the house"" (picture of a house at night) and for working on the car. Reality is, this light would be okay to help change a tire, as an emergency light inside a house and for inside a tent camping.It is not a flashlight, it isn't bright enough to use on a moonless or partial moon night and it turns itself off after being on for around 20 minutes or so. I am unsure how it would work under the hood of a car, unless you attached a tiny cord through the little bitty holes. It might work as a reading light, but I am not sure that it is going to be fantastic at that, it would bother anyone sleeping beside you as the light is not focused enough. If you carry it in your hand, it is easy to cover up the light bar. It simply is not for walking except perhaps in an emergency situation.It has a few specialized uses, and is not nearly as versatile as the package proclaims it is. All in all, despite it being well put together, I do not find any real uses for it other than as a temporary light to use in the event of a blackout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPZFOJCQ127X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SSTTQE#wasThisHelpful","R3VPZFOJCQ127X","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I offered this for free to evaluate and test out. The following is my unbiased review.This arrived and I was surprised to see that it was longer than I expected. It has netting on both sides for air flow.The packing cube is well sewn. The zipper works just as I expected for them to work, with no snagging. It is smooth and does not catch on anyting when opened or closed. Tugging on the sides and overstuffing the cube did not cause the zipper to hitch nor did the zipper separate.There are no loose threads and the workmanship seems to be good. If you do not use packing cubes, you are missing the helpfulness of them. I find that by using them, I can do several things at once. I can separate certain types of clothes from others. Undergarments or socks that would normally manage to drift to the bottom my suitcase will stay where they are easily reached. It can also be used to stow electronics inside so that they are easily corralled in my case, again, not drifting between folds of clothes when my luggage is tossed about on conveyers. One more thing that is nice about packing cubes is that it can help keep my clothes from becoming too wrinkled to wear. My clothes are kept in the neatly folded stacks that I place them in, vs sagging to the bottom of the bag when the bag is placed upright for dragging through the airport and hotel corridors.I used to scoff at packing cubes until a friend used them to pack for a trip and I did not. Her suitcase and belongings were neat and tidy when we arrived. My belongings looked as it a weasel had been playing in my bag during the journey.The sample provided to me of this slim packing cube was a very good one.

"I was sent these sliding door locks for free to test and evaluate.Do they work? Yes, moderately well. They are child resistant, not childproof. Here is my unbiased assessment of this product.They arrive in a package that is translated from another language into English. This renders the directions impossible to follow, you must use your own instincts to install these gadgets.Installation consists of peeling off the protective covering from a piece of strong double sided sticky tape. You then place this close to the place where the doors overlap. By popping the latch into a triangle position, you keep the overlapping door from opening. The latch stops it. To open the door, you gently pop it out of the triangle position and slide the door over it. You must make sure before installation that there is enough space for the overlapping door to slide over the flattened latch. (Otherwise, if you want to open the doors, you must pry the double sided sticky tape off and remove the latch from the door. Test for clearance before sticking it down.)This should not be used instead of another form of break in proof fastening for sliding windows or doors. This is not an overly secure latch, a good jostle can open it. I will take great care if I use it on furniture that could have the finish or paint damaged as this is not easily removed. It will likely pull paint off when I take it off.If you are looking for something to keep a supervised child from using sliding doors or windows, to keep fingers from being smashed or even broken in the overlap, this will work. If you are looking to prevent break-ins or to keep medications/poisons from being accessed by toddlers, rambunctious puppy or extra smart cat, these should not be trusted.  These are for making the cupboards child resistant, not inaccessible.They are made well enough to prevent casual access, but a determined child/puppy/cat/thief could open this with enough shoving and wiggling, these latches do not hold up to stress or strong jolts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3838QAPQ72SBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QX1WUE#wasThisHelpful","R3838QAPQ72SBP","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was offered this small 12-LED UV light for free. The following is my unbiased review.This light is not quite strong enough to use except in a very dimly lit room. Total darkness is best for using this light to make sure that everything is found.Speaking of everything being found, what I found was horrifying. My carpet next to the washer is disgusting. I am including a picture of the carpet with and without the light. The carpet has mild stains that are visible, but with the light, they pop out in color. The carpet cleaner has been called to help. I am going to have a talk with the housekeeper. I believe these stains are dripped detergent or other cleaning products. I will be putting a small throw rug there to catch future drips. What looks like mildew in the unlit picture is not glowing.I also found the source of the cat urine smell, a chair was doused according to this light. I will ask the carpet cleaner to clean the chairs also while he is here.The other thing these lights can be used for and another reason why I like having one at home, is some forms of ringworm and fungus luminesce. It isn't fool proof, but pets with ringworm need to be quarantined (all should be quarantined for 14-21 days when entering new house, no matter what) and extra precautions must be taken to prevent humans or other pets getting it. With this light, it is easy to quickly scan a pet for glowing and catch some of the problems ahead of time.It can be used to find the spray marks from cats on walls. (Males and females can spray! Altering does not always stop the problem.) It is hard to clean up what you cannot find. I had one piggy cat who was too lazy to find the box all the time.Going out to a club? Use this light in a dark room with a mirror to spot check yourself. Some clothes don't work under black lights, find out before you leave for the club.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LIBVHNE9TZ6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PQZASU#wasThisHelpful","R1LIBVHNE9TZ6O","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this iPhone 6 case by Rinker to test and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.This case is a scratch resistant case for the body of the phone. It is not drop protection, or at least not what I consider ""drop protection"". It will protect it from scratches and minor dings. That will protect the resale value by keeping the case looking pristine.The case is a pretty color and it looks to be the same color I saw on my monitor. I love that it allows my hand to grip the phone without feeling as if I am going to drop the phone. The buttons and camera cut outs fit neatly around the phone without gaps or overlap. It was made with care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YK2T3UF1ICPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MQ4OEU#wasThisHelpful","R2YK2T3UF1ICPA","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit was provided free to me via promotional coupon. The following is my unbiased review.Thermometers are like potato chips, you need more than one. When I was offered this one, I agreed quickly. Thermometers have a tendency to be sent home with ailing friends or in the case of my household, get used on a critter. There have been days where I could find three in the pet first aid drawer but none in the people shelf. For some reason the family feels perfectly okay snatching the human thermometer from the bathroom but don't reverse them. (All pet ones are magic markered for id)This thermometer is waterproof, but I never plunge mine under the faucet except for the probe part that is washed with soap and warm water. Waterproof really isn't a bonus with me, I am not checking the temperature of underwater creatures nor do I plan to use it in the jacuzzi. This one is accurate temperature wise.There is no backlight. That is the one flaw, the backlight really does help to read it. The numbers are as large as they normally are on a digital thermometer, but the backlight makes a difference.This is a reasonably priced thermometer. This one works in under fifteen seconds depending on if it is used rectally (according to directions) or orally (6-9 seconds, tested).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZ3QR6DFLPP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTMDRES#wasThisHelpful","RSZ3QR6DFLPP2","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I do with any textile is launder it first. These were washed without fabric softener and dried without a dryer sheet. I find that helps with absorbency. They washed as is typical, the edges curling a bit, Very minimal shrinkage. I expect my microfiber towels to dry a bit crooked so it never bothers me if they end up that was as these did, slightly off square.They are for washing dishes, not for drying dishes. They are not super absorbent. I will use the green one for wiping down the bathroom sinks, and toilets. When I tested it, it worked with no problems. The ridges distinguish them from other microfibers I use. (Color coding at my house.)These are easily washed and are durable so far. I trade dish cloths for clean ones every other day or immediately after washing greasy items.I am loving the scrubby side. I wish I had videotaped cleaning the waffle iron. The waffle iron lives on top of the fridge next to the stove. My roomie cooks with grease. Grease drifts up to coat things on the top of the fridge and dust coats the grease. End result is a sticky mess. I wet the dish cloth in hot water and using the scrub side, effortlessly wiped the grease and dust off the outside of the waffle iron. My roommate stood slack jawed and watched, asking where I bought ""those amazing rags."" Even I was impressed, these are as good at many tasks as the magic erasers, except these can be used over and over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137BTTIQBJHPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZZK646#wasThisHelpful","R137BTTIQBJHPI","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.The bra fit as I expected it would fit. I am not currently nursing, but this is a bra that can be slept due to it being comfortable, that is why I agreed to evaluate it.The bra I chose is in nude which disappears under clothes, even white semi sheer blouses. The cups are soft and there is no wire to press against my chest/underarms. It is comfortable enough to sleep in if I wanted to nap in it. This is a comfortable bra, not one that I am eager to remove the second I arrive home.The bra, being a soft cup bra, is not as supportive as an underwire, so it does change my silhouette slightly when I wear it. If I want a more professional profile, I need to wear an underwire.I hand washed the bra as per the directions, but I see that it could probably be put into my bra ball and washed in the machine.

"I was offered this probiotic for free to evaluate. The following is my unbiased reviewed after testing it out.This probiotic requires refrigeration. I understand why it does, but the recommended refrigeration means that it is in the kitchen downstairs and not upstairs with my other medications. This makes it hard to remember to take it. It also means swallowing cold pills, something I find abhorrent. It's a personal pet peeve of mine and has nothing to do with the efficacy of the drug.Refrigeration aside, I put a note by the door to remind me to take my meds as I don't venture into the kitchen before work except to turn off the porch light.. The note is helping make sure I take the pills.The probiotic is working. I have not had a gastric upset from it, despite the small amount of guar gum added. I do not have a dairy intolerance so the small amount of dairy doesn't matter to my system. So far, so good, I am a week into the new bottle and my system is sensitive enough to begin sending up flares within 36 hours if I am intolerant of a product.The product was shipped with a small ice pack to keep it cool and it was inside an insulated bag, I feel this was a nice touch and made sure that the probiotic bugs did not arrive ineffective. (I once received a batch from another company that was pretty much dead on arrival.)I would like to see a pill count vs just ""30 day supply"". There are two dosing schemes, one requiring one pill daily, one requiring two pills daily. Tell the consumer how many pills are in each bottle. I would never purchase this item on my own due to that omission. If I am paying $30 for a bottle of pills, I want to know in advance what is considered a 30 day supply! I have removed a star due to that factor. I feel that sellers need to be transparent to their buyers. A 30 days supply sounds like a good deal until you consider how many pills that actually means. If you are on the two pill a day routine, it could mean purchasing two bottles. $60 a month vs $30 a month is a big difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5D1B36I4QA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HL3QSC#wasThisHelpful","R2T5D1B36I4QA4","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light bulb was sent to me for free as a sample for evaluation and review. The following is my unbiased review.Please note, this is not a regular sized light bulb. This bulb has a base that is designed to fit candelabra type fixtures. This bulb is not a standard based bulb!This bulb fit in the candelabra over what used to be my dining room table but is now my desk. It fits perfectly. The bulb dims or brightens by turning the dimming switch.One thing I will note is that this bulb is very bright due to it being an LED. I find the light from this bulb to be brighter and clearer than the other 3 non-led 40w bulbs. My OCD is not going to allow me to leave one bulb brighter, I had to remove it until I purchase three more.It's a light bulb that goes in your candelabra base, it is a small diameter base so be sure that you are purchasing the correct bulb or you will be disappointed when it arrives.I like this bulb, no cons that I could find, it works exactly as it is supposed to work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTX9J15CRMCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWZB8DA#wasThisHelpful","RUTX9J15CRMCN","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so very happy the author let me know she had written this sequel. The first book was charming, the second book is equally charming.Taking a rabbit camping can (and is) done but when it is not planned for in advance, it can be a comedy of errors. I laughed my way through this book because I imagine all of the issues happening when there are no plans in advance.The characters are true to life, the stories are believable and it is an enjoyable read. It also shows rabbit owners what they should be doing vs what they are doing. Rabbits can be a great source of frustration if you don't know how to live with them. They sure have their quirks.I will say this, the book shows why parents need to be sure they are involved in the double checking of the pets before vacation to ensure there are no unexpected stowaways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCDNMY72HX1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010424WV6#wasThisHelpful","RNCDNMY72HX1N","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These natural shoe deodorizers do work. They suck up the moisture and seem to be helping with the odor.My roommate insists that sneakers should be worn without socks because socks bother her feet. The resulting sweaty feet syndrome was making me stay out of the living room after she comes home from work. I could not handle the odor. She was embarrassed by her sweaty feet but didn't know what to do. She was going to buy a pair of odor eaters when I found these.She would take her shoes off and sit them under the end table which is right next to my chair. The smell of the shoes was gagging me. I decided to try these out to see if they would help. I have her used to stuffing these into her shoes as soon as she gets home. These are helping.They are not magic, they aren't ridding the shoes of every single bit of stink, but they are taking away 80% of it. I need to buy a second pair as I made sure she had a second pair of sneakers. She alternates the sneakers so that each pair gets a 24 hour rest between wearing, that helps with the odor problem also.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XZV97N7L0QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088Y0PRS#wasThisHelpful","R28XZV97N7L0QF","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this light for free in the mail to test and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review.I put this light outside to charge for around 3 hours in the sunlight before I mounted it on the wall outside the garage door. I wanted to test it first, before I put it up to be sure it was working.The test worked brilliantly. Just in case you missed the directions, there is an on/off hole on the light. Peek at the directions to find it on the side that has the leds. You can use the little tool they sent or you can use a paperclip. Either way, press in until you feel it move. You can now test this little light in the bathroom or in another dark spot as it is light sensitive. It will not turn on when in bright light.I installed this lamp right beside the garage door. There is ample sunlight in that patch so it will stay charged.The lamp has a motion detector which makes it great for walking from my garage, across the patio and into the house. The patio is dark and if the roommate moved something, that can mean banged shins, stubbed toes and even a fall! This light sensed me and turned on, lighting up the patio enough to see obstacles.The lamp dims itself when there is no motion detected so it is a continuous light. I like this better than the fixtures that are only on when there is motion. This could be placed on a porch to provide porch light. I get people who arrive late at night after the sun has dropped, and my regular light is a motion light. This means my porch is dark until they approach it. Because this is solar, it is not costing in electric bills and it didn't need to be wired into the electric system.This lamp is easy enough that a 5 year old could turn it on or off by poking the little paperclip like wire into the hole. The off button is nice for those nights when you do not want it lit. If you wish to use this function, be sure to install it in an area where you can easily reach it, or can reach it with a step stool.All in all, it is easy to install, bright enough to provide ample light when it on, and it provides a steady dim glow when there is no one around. This light can provide a deterrent for thieves as well as prevent you from tripping over anything that might be in your path.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BRB1Y72EVGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01264B218#wasThisHelpful","R14BRB1Y72EVGV","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Ultrasonic Aromatherapy diffuser was sent to me for free to test and evaluate. The following is my unbiased review after trying out the unit.The first thing I found very nice is this is a beautiful looking diffuser. It is elegant enough to leave in many places around the house. It is also harder to spill the water than in some other ones I have tested.It does not leak. (Whew, not much is worse than having essential oils and water soak into a nightstand or desk before you notice!) It is easy to fill and the directions are easy to follow.This has several modes as the description says, I like that I can have the mist intermittent or continuous or only use the lights for mood lighting. (Note, this will not take the place of a lamp, it creates a dim light that is enough to see in the room but not enough to read by.)I tested the auto shut-off and it does work, so I am less worried about it burning down the house if it runs out of water and the components catch fire. (I put all items like this on a timer so there is a second back up, just in case something malfunctions internally with the unit.)This works, it is pretty, it appears to be sturdy and is quiet.

It is a strange velvet like fabric, slightly rough. This is on both sides and it was not comfortable against my hands. I wasn't going to try it against my eyes. I think it would keep me awake from the distraction.The pillow had the same odor and fabric. Due to the odor, I did not attempt to blow it up.

"I received these lights for free to evaluate and test. The following is my unbiased review and observations.These lights arrived and I rushed to charge them. On two of the sunniest days in Southern CA I had trouble finding a sunny patch. That is ironic. I got these charged up and tried them.The light is a pale glow, not bright enough to read under but bright enough to look pretty. The light looks much like the picture shown in the description, a diluted vanilla color. These lights would define a path at night or decorate a railing. I put them around the pond to define it at night.The lights charged quickly, and after charging they stayed on for around six hours. They can be turned off manually many they can be made to blink.They are very beautiful in looks when off or when on.

"I received these chalkboard vinyl pieces for free for evaluation. The following is my unbiased review. Free does not equal a fabulous review. I review because I enjoy testing products and helping people steer towards great products and purchase less than five star items with open eyes.These are thick vinyl pieces, eight of them. They stick on fairly easily but be warned, they pull paint off when removed. Do not stick these up if you can't afford to repaint after removal. (Thankfully I tested this inside a closet.)The chalk included did not erase easily, I had to press slightly harder than expected to write. This caused indents on the vinyl. I tested a liquid chalk marker, that erased as it was supposed to erase and left no indents.This would be more practical cut up to make tiny chalk boards for jars or as little chalkboards on notebooks for messages written with liquid chalk. I will not be putting any more on the wall. I will be looking into sticking them on with removable tape which is a better option if I want to repurpose the wall later. I am using one on my fridge, held on with magnets for a easy shopping list. Again, only using liquid chalk markers.I am only giving three stars because it does not work as expected.

"I was offered this backpack for free in order to evaluate it and write an honest review. If you have read my reviews, you will find I am sometimes brutally honest about flaws. When I give five stars, it was deserved.Update: 9/30/15 pack is crammed with a 15.3 laptop, charger and a few other things like my ipad. Total weight inside is about 10 pounds. The straps adjusted to help keep the weight centered on my back. A friend saw me with it when she drove me to the train, said liked the look and needed a good sturdy back pack. She hinted strongly that she wanted it. Laptop is a snug fit, but very easily done. Padded pocket helps protect my pack.This pack is cute, it is a nautical type of theme. The pack is made from thick canvas like material that is heavy. I tested a backpack several months ago that looked the same, but in terms of quality, this one wins. This one is much thicker material. The other one was equally cute, but this one is the sturdier of the two. Like buying jeans and jean leggings that look exactly the same, this one is the winner of the two packs.The pockets are great. I can fit everything from a camera to a sports bottle in them. The inside will hold books or clothes. Take it to the beach, use it as a trendy carry on bag. Front pocket holds an iPad mini in an otterbox case for size of the pocket idea. The front is a magnetic snap closure, not a buckle. That could be important to some of you.The bag is well sewn, I don't think it is washable except by hand washing and it might bleed blue onto white.

"This cooling pad is larger than many, but is a fair price. Reality is, most of those cooling pads are made of the exact same material, they are simply different sizes.This one is no different from others I have tried that do not say they have ""phase change material"". Phase change material is a fancy name for something that absorbs and releases energy. It is what most of these cool pads are made from, even if they do not use the fancy terms.These are not designed to stay cold long term, unless you are using one that is connected to electricity or to a cooling unit. These are designed to feel cooler than the ambient temperature in the room. Because they feel cooler than your skin, they feel as if they are ""sucking heat from your body"". It feels that way because it is doing this in a round about way. By the way, don't make the mistake of ""touching it with your hand"" and deciding it isn't cool. Put it on your skin for a few seconds, trust me, it is cool.The problem with many of these pads is that the heat from your body goes into the pad as you press your warmer temp against it. It does not take long for your body to heat up the pad, sometimes in as short a time as ten minutes. (Think of a nice hot day. The pool is 83 degrees. When you first jump in, it's freezing! Then you adjust to the temp and it feels good. This is a good explanation of why these pads are initially so cold feeling but warm up fast.) When this happens, the pad no longer feels cool to the touch and is not as refreshing as it was. The pad needs to be traded for a second pad that has been allowed to reach room temp. Putting the pad in the freezer for an hour or two or even in the fridge can help cool it down faster and keep it cooler for longer periods of time.This pad has ""sections"". That means that the sections heat up, but the rest of the pad does not heat as quickly. The way I use it is as follows.. I only rest on one or two sections at a time, then I can turn the pad around and rest on one or two other sections while the first two begin to cool back off by dissipating the heat into the air.  This is a larger pad so there is room to do this if you are not resting your torso on it.This pad does stay cooler for a longer period of time, I never reached more than 30 minutes per section, but that 30 minutes was ample time to stop a hot flash, cool me down enough until the a/c kicked in, or cool me off if I was waiting for a fever reducer to kick in. What amazes me is that this pad feels freezing even after sitting in a room that has a temp of 83 degrees. When placed against my body, it can make me shiver at first. Often, if you are a ""leg out from under the cover"" type of person, you can put your leg or a foot on a pad to help cool your body off. I keep mine where I can place my forearm on it if needed.These pads work great for hot flashes because they provide instant coolness. If you keep three of them, then you have one that in use, one that is warmer and cooling off and a spare cool one. This will allow you to switch between them and it is what I do when needed. Don't fall under the assumption that you only need one and it will keep you cold all night. You need at least two. Purchase one and try it. If it helps, purchase a second one.These are not ""soft"" like pillows so if you have a problem with sleeping on anything that isn't pillow soft, try using it under your shoulder/neck, under your arm or under a leg as I suggested above. They are a firm surface that isn't very yielding. They aren't stiff like plywood, they are more like carpet without padding, they have a slight amount of give.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109BQDAHVF6HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M5YAVQ#wasThisHelpful","R109BQDAHVF6HT","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this power bank for free for testing and evaluation. The following is my review after testing the unit. I am writing my review based on the performance of the unit sent to me. I base my evaluation on the asking price at the time I am sent the unit.First thought is that it is way too heavy to carry around with me. The whole reason for having a power bank in most cases is that it is a portable power source. This unit weighs just over half a pound. That is heavy. It is not going to be carried comfortably in my tote, is too heavy to take backpacking and really is too heavy for a carry on for airport travel. If you were planning on taking it along with you, be sure you plan on it weighing half a pound. Seller says it only weighs 9.5 ounces so I should revise saying it weighs half a pound because I don't understand. I stand corrected, it is slightly over half a pound. I weighed it in grams also, because the seller wrote back protesting that I was misunderstanding and should weigh it in grams, not ounces. It is still equal to slightly more than half a pound. It is a lot of power and that is why it is heavy. I am not arguing that more power requires a heavier unit, but I am not going to budge on my saying it is too heavy for me to consider it portable.Second thought was, it took a very long time to charge. I plugged it in and there are four blue leds that tell how much power it has. Two of those were lit. I plugged it in at 8 am and when I left the office at 1:30 pm, it was finally charging the last blue light. (Indicated by blinking.) I left it plugged in overnight. I arrived to find it apparently fully charged this morning. The seller wrote to tell me the cable included could be substituted for one that charged faster.This is a device that is currently costing around $20 at the time of my posting. At this price, it is fair deal. Is it a great deal? That depends on your outlook. This is not a lightening charger. It requires around 6 hours to charge the power source and it charges items as slowly. I am currently testing it on my mini iPad. So far, in 4 minutes, despite saying it's charging, my ipad has budged from the 75% it was at when I started charging to 76%. If it continues to charge at that rate, it will take 1.5 hours to reach 100% charge from 76%. Too long in my opinion. FYI, I was using the lightening cable that came with my iPad to charge it when I tested it.All in all, I will pass on this. It is going to placed in the SHTF bag because it is not practical for routine use. For routine use, I do not have time to wait for my phone to slowly charge to make a call. In an emergency, I would not have time to wait. This battery is too heavy to carry around. Unless I need a battery back up while I am sitting at home or at the office and the power is out, this isn't a good choice for me personally. It has a lot of juice which is good but heavy. It makes it impractical for travel that requires checking bags. I am not wasting 1/2 a pound on a charger when the airlines charge too much extra now for overweight. I prefer to throw several smaller chargers in my bag.With more strength comes more weight. Choose wisely Grasshopper. You will have to carry this around with you. There are better chargers that cost more, but are lighter and charge more quickly, if you don't mind having less charges per back up battery. I can't justify this one for myself. Slow rate to refuel the power pack will eat up emergency power is forefront in my mind. This would be something I would use until it ran out, then would not recharge it using emergency power. (Used to teach emergency preparedness, I am versed in this stuff. Shelter in place and all that. This recharges devices slowly, even using a faster cable. I will plug my devices in before they are low on power, and only charge them in airplane or off mode to reduce the energy output while charging.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7UQGO3T2DS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013B8TK4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1O7UQGO3T2DS8","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this unit for free via promotional coupon. My unbiased review is offered below. If at any point during use I find the collar is not holding up to the quality I feel it should, I will update immediately.The collar arrived and has directions that are clear enough to understand. The directions are easy to follow.There are (as is standard) several sizes of ""prongs"" so it is suitable for long or short furred dogs. This is a unit for a medium to large sized dog, not a dog under 20-25 pounds.I like the fact that there are three options. Tone, vibrate and shock. I find that using the least amount of either is more effective for distraction. The vibrate can stop my dog from barking long enough to hear ""leave it"". The distraction of the vibrate can be used for stopping other behaviors as well. And, it can be used to train.The vibrate, when used correctly can be a signal to the dog that he did it right when he can't hear my clicker. The static shock is high at the strongest level. Personally, I will be refraining from shocking my dog. There is no need with proper training. Shocking has it's place, but I won't discuss that here. 90% of the general public don't need shock aversion to train their dogs.The collar has suited my uses and I am glad to test it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8GDHE7IRGBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CDYQHA#wasThisHelpful","RX8GDHE7IRGBC","A1MF83RMFXN6TF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MF83RMFXN6TF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This would probably also be pretty handy to someone who wants to change jobs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XZUL9D0N2YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119015944#wasThisHelpful","R27XZUL9D0N2YI","A2XIOXRRYX0KZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XIOXRRYX0KZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just what you'd expect. It's a working lightning cable, properly certified by Apple, and it connects to an iPhone or iPad to charge it and transfer data. It's very short, which is handy if you plug your phone in right next to an outlet or your computer, but not so useful if you were planning to plug it into the wall while you lie in bed.The build quality is good, as Amazon Basics stuff tends to be. I don't like it overall quite as much as a Belkin cable that I have, but the Belkin also retails for more too, and really either one will get the job done just fine.

"I would take the 'starters' that it says on the front seriously. These are attractive and their shape does keep them from rolling away (which might be handy for anyone who has some dexterity issues, not just little kids) but they're also hard enough that they don't write as smoothly and as comfortably as other colored pencils that I've used. I definitely don't think they're a good fit for someone who's serious about art or looking to pick up coloring as a relaxing activity; the bit more you'd have to spend for a more premium and adult-oriented colored pencil will probably be well worth it.These, though, are nice for little kids because they won't break too easily, the fact that they're mechanical should keep them from being easily broken in half altogether, and they have an unusual and attractive appearance as well. So take the 5-star rating as only being for a pretty specific target market. I'm not recommending these to everybody.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AL7C37K9XW7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105U1YV8#wasThisHelpful","R1AL7C37K9XW7Q","A2XIOXRRYX0KZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XIOXRRYX0KZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog likes this stuff! That's saying a lot, because she's a picky little thing who's been offered a wide variety of fancy and expensive dog foods that she either gave a lukewarm reception to or did her best to ignore. For this, though, she ate up the portion that we gave her immediately and then started nudging around to try to see if there was any more under the plate.For some reason she also enjoys Cesar dog food (always been baffling to me that I've struggled so much to find higher-quality foods she'd accept...) and I did the math and the price actually works out to be about the same. She's not actually a large breed, so she can get 3 meals from a can if we're feeding her an equivalent amount to one container of the Cesar stuff, and therefore cost per serving is actually very close. I was a little worried that the size of the chunks in this would put her off since she likes her kibble very very small, but she seems perfectly content thus far.I'm really happy to have found a better food that she'll eat without significant coaxing.

"This looked silly at first glance (mainly the idea of a bow you could use indoors), and then caught my interest a little more firmly, and ultimately turned out to be pretty fun.You really can get some decent flight range out of it once you get a feel for how it should work, and it's made for kids so there isn't a ton of force required. I can't say I'm brave enough to use it anywhere near a lamp, television, or anything else breakable that I don't care to either live without or replace, but I could definitely see doing something like turning a hallway into a miniature shooting range for fun.

"This kit works well for me, but it's worth noting that I think that's partly because salicylic acid in general works well for me. Some people don't do well at all with that and end up always using benzoyle peroxide and that kind of thing. On one hand, that means this is gentler and won't likely cause more acne due to irritation. On the other hand, if you need really strong stuff, this may not do the job very well.Beyond that, it's nice to have everything together in one kit so you kind of have a whole instant skin care regime going. That's particularly helpful because if you're using products you bought separately, it's easy to overdo it and end up irritating your skin with too much medication. I'd say that if you haven't already ruled out salicylic acid as a good option, this is worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVREL6NWYKZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W16JAC#wasThisHelpful","RFVREL6NWYKZK","A2XIOXRRYX0KZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XIOXRRYX0KZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice building project with enough pieces to make it an evening of family time. Once it's built, you have a pretty cool truck with enough figures along with it to allow kids to have a lot of fun playing at battles, whether they've seen the movie or not. I'm actually thinking this truck would make a good combo with some of the Call of Duty themed sets, because they have a sort of similar gritty war look to them, and it could be fun to see robots and zombies team up to attack the truck next time we're ready to play with it.Difficulty will depend a lot on your experience with these sets. I think the age range they give is pretty appropriate for a solo build by a motivated and fairly mature kid, but other kids (or younger ones) will need some help and guidance. That's not a bad thing, though, since building something really is a great family activity. It's a situation where no one goes into it knowing what they're doing exactly, so everyone's having an experience of learning and experimenting together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VWW438HDDEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9AG#wasThisHelpful","R29VWW438HDDEL","A2XIOXRRYX0KZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XIOXRRYX0KZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Barefoot yoga is relatively common, however, it is not something that I would want to do within a studio/classroom setting. The reason is simple: I really do not want to contract athleteâ€™s foot or a fungal infection within my toenails. Yet, socks can slip and slide across the smooth floors of many classrooms, and wearing tennis shoes is rather uncomfortable (not to mention can be damaging to the surface of a yoga mat). Fortunately, there is an option out there: YogaAddict Non-Slip Socks, no doubt influenced by those lovely blue socks that you get in the hospital.ConstructionThe YogaAddict Non-Slip Socks feel well-made. The fabric is thick and heavy-duty: these socks are premium quality. The ankle band is a bit padded, with a â€œVâ€ notch on either side. When worn, this band hugs the leg snuggly, with the padding preventing the usual indentations that some elastic socks can leave on the skin. The sole of the socks are also soft, providing a gentle cushion for your feet as you move about. Finally, the tacky dots and infinity symbol on the soles are noticeable as you walk, but soft enough that the socks are not uncomfortable.FunctionThe YogaAddict Non-Slip Socks will keep your feet nice and toasty as you pad about your house or yoga classroom. The socks will remain firmly in place and not shift around as you switch yoga positions. The tacky dots on the soles perform well: your feet will not slide on any smooth surface, including a yoga mat. The thick cushion of the socks also add a bit of comfort that certainly helps near the end of a grueling workout. Other benefits include:1) The socks will help to protect your feet from bacteria and fungi that can hide on gym floors, including Athleteâ€™s Foot and yellow toenail-causing fungi infections.2) Conversely, these socks will hide any embarrassing infections that you may have, as well as reduce the likelihood of spreading them to other yoga practitioners.3) The cotton does breathe, allowing your feet to sweat and wicking away that moisture.4) Bonus: you can make both fashion and safety statements.5) If you flip them inside-out before you wash them, the tacky surfaces on the soles will last longer. With that said, I have washed these socks at least 30 times and have not noticed any deterioration of the dots.Final SayWhether you want socks for warmth, to protect your feet from potential infections, or just safety as you work out on smooth floors, the YogaAddict Non-Skip Socks will not let you down. They are high-quality in their construction, and perform the Non-Skip portion of their function with flying colors. In short, if you want comfy, durable, and very functional yoga socks, then you canâ€™t go wrong with these. 5 stars of 5.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"While snack baggies do a respectable job of keeping foods contained and separated within your lunch bag, they do not offer much protection from the contents being crushed, nor are they really a great method at storing liquid. Sure, the ubiquitous Tupperware® product lines are one potential solution to this dilemma; however, finding containers that fit into a lunch bag can be frustrating, especially if you want to use more than one TupperwareÂ®. Thus, undoubtedly in an attempt to resolve this conundrum, MIRA developed a three-piece set of Stainless Steel Nesting Bowls. But, do they work?ConstructionUpon opening the packaging for this set, you will first see the thick blue lid of the largest bowl. Peeling back this lid Ã  la matryoshka-style will reveal the light-blue lid of the middle bowl of the set tucked neatly inside; repeat this step for the third (and smallest) bowl.The bowls are relatively lightweight, and the rubberized lids are stiffer than those found on most TupperwareÂ® containers. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the lids of the MIRA Stainless Steel Nesting Bowls are of a higher quality than most TupperwareÂ® sets. True, the MIRA lids are less flexible and a bit tougher to remove, but overall this is a minor issue and does more to increase the quality of the MIRA products than as a detraction. Finally, each lid secures to the top of their corresponding bowl tightly, and when inverted they prove to be leak-proof.UseAs mentioned above, finding storage containers that fit inside a standard lunch bag or box is not difficult; the problem is being able to fit more than one without sacrificing space for other things (such as a sandwich). The other issue is durability: sure, TupperwareÂ® makes rigid plastic containers, but they can crack. The disposable containers offered in their product lines are simply a waste of money, not to mention that they are usually too big for lunch bags. Thus, without further ado, here are the perks of the MIRA Stainless Steel Nesting Bowls:1) No more stains from tomato-based products! The MIRA SSNBs will not discolor or stain.2) The lids are leak-proof and secure tightly, even if jostled about heavily.3) The bowls will not scratch. No more bacteria hidden in the scratches of plastic bowls.4) More than one bowl can be fit into a lunch bag, allowing for a variety of meals.5) Hot, soapy water with the occasional light scrub is all that it takes for cleanup.6) Storage is a cinch, taking up little cabinet space. Oh, and no more lid hunting!While the above six points are most likely enough for most, there is one major drawback to the MIRA Stainless Steel Nesting Bowls: they are not microwaveable. Thus, if you hope to bring a food to warm up at the office, you will need to swap containers. For this reason, I strongly recommend investing in a ThermosÂ® or other insulated container for your hot food needs; aside from more space, you wonâ€™t have to fuss with a microwave at all.Final SayIf you are in the market for a moderately-sized set of nesting bowls that are perfect for snacks, lunches, or myriad other storage uses, I strongly recommend the MIRA Stainless Steel Nesting Bowls. The quality is excellent, the lids are secure, and they store neatly in a cabinet or drawer. Since the lids fit each bowl as it is nested in another, you will no longer have to hunt down a properly-sized lid. Finally, they are much more sanitary than their plastic cousins, and cleanup is a breeze. Being unable to place them into the microwave is certainly a drawback, and as such, my final score is 4 stars of 5.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"In addition to having huge pores over my nose and cheeks, I also suffer from minor bouts of acne that peppers my chin with lovely, red, deep zits. Sure, I have been trying to figure out a way to clone the flawless skin of Nicole Kidman, but the government grants arenâ€™t coming through and Ms. Kidman doesnâ€™t want to donate some DNA (something about a restraining orderâ€¦), so I opted to try out the decidedly less expensive MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush.ConstructionUpon receiving the MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush, I noticed that it is very well-made. This is not a cheap plastic device; the textured body and soft cleaning head definitely feel durable. The rubber-coated power button operates flawlessly, and the 60-second timer is wonderful for 1) ensuring that you are not overly enthusiastic with your facial scrub, and 2) preventing the batteries from going dead should the button be accidentally â€œbumpedâ€ during travel. Finally, as indicated in the product description, the brush head can be removed to allow for thorough cleaning and sanitation. When finished, snap the brush back on, replace the cover, and set your MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush on the shelf for the next use.EfficacyUsing sonic waves to clean is not a new concept; SonicareÂ® Toothbrushes spearheaded the use of this technology for personal hygiene. Thus the MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush is almost like an overgrown toothbrush (minus the Colgate, although a dab of toothpaste is wonderful for spot treatment of zits). After inserting the batteries (not included), the SFCB is ready-to-go; just make sure that you apply the soap to your face and not the brush, or you will end up with a mess when you turn on the unit.I do not wear makeup, but I do use acne medication and lotions, so my impressions of how well the SFCB cleans is based upon removal of the above substances. In addition, I used a blackhead remover tool over known problem areas after each cleaning to determine if any â€œgunkâ€ remains in my pores. Here are my impressions:1) I use BiorÃ© Blackhead Cleanser; it contains eucalyptus oil that gives a cool sensation to the skin. When using the SFCB to massage the soap across my face, I did notice that the cooling sensation felt much more intense, and it felt immediately cleaner underneath the soap.2) When I used the blackhead remover on my nose and cheeks, I noticed a significant drop in blackheads. In addition, for those pores that did have â€œgunkâ€ within them, the quantity was much fewer as opposed to the times I massaged the soap onto my skin with my fingers.3) Those craters, errâ€¦. Large pores across my nose we so clean that I did notice that they diminished slightly; they were still there, but they were nowhere near as obvious as they had been. This is a huge plus in my book.4) After using the SFCB, my skin feels so baby-smooth that I could compete with my infant niece! Her Aunty Stacy could give her a run for her money! Even better, the promise made by MIRA about the improved absorption of acne medicine, lotions, creams, and so forth, is accurate. Even creams that are a bit thicker and/or serums are going to be more effective once applied to your exfoliated skin.Finally, if you follow a cleaning routine that includes the MIRA SFCB, you will notice that acne and other blemishes will be less of a problem over time. I stress, though, that you should only use the SFCB when your skin is healthy; during use, if you feel pain from the brush bristles, turn the device off immediately and give your skin a few days to heal.OverallIf you are looking for a quality-made facial cleaning brush that also has sonic technology to â€œshake the debrisâ€ from your pores, look no further than the MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush. This brush, with proper care, will last you quite a while, and is perfect for home and travel. You are able to remove the brush head to clean it easier; keeping the unit sanitary is important to ensure a proper scrub. Finally, the best aspect of the MIRA Sonic Facial Cleaning Brush is its efficacy: softer skin, better absorption of lotions/creams/medications, and over time, a reduction of pimples and other blemishes.My final say? 4 stars of 5 due to the fact that there is not a carrying bag (or other container) for packing this brush for trips. It is definitely a minor complaint, however, so do not let it discourage you from giving this great face cleaner a go!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"As an avid canner, the need to label jars clearly is rather important. Sure, you can look through the glass and probably figure out what is inside each jar, yet without labeling, over time you will forget exactly WHEN that food was canned. Possibly more important, almost all canners have multiple jars to share with family and friends. A clearly written label will let them know the contents, especially for relatively â€œsmoothâ€ concoctions that may not be easily discerned (for example: mild vs. hot salsa). Enter: liquid chalk and chalkboard labels.ConstructionThere is not much to say here; included with this set are sheets of labels of various sizes and shapes. A liquid chalk pen is included along with a test swatch for preparing the aforementioned pen for use. In terms of stickiness, I feel that they are durable enough to adhere to a standard glass jar, or other non-porous surfaces that are not exposed to the elements. Once the â€œliquid chalkâ€ is dry it will not smudge or smear; a lightly damp rag will erase the text, however, allowing adjustments to test/drawings for corrections and/or reuse.UseThis is complicated, so make sure that you follow these steps EXACTLY!1) Apply pen to the desired label.2) Write the text desired.3) Allow the liquid chalk to dry, and then carefully remove the sticker from the backing sheet.4) Apply the sticker to the desired surface.5) Admire your handiwork; a glass of wine for your hard work. Cheers!Snark aside, the above steps are all that need to be used when applying the labels fresh from the package. As aforementioned, a damp cloth will clear off any text, and after the label surface is dry you can repeat steps 1-5. Also, if applied to a smooth surface, these labels will adhere well and perform admirably. Just make sure that you allow that liquid chalk to dry or you will have smudges!If I have a frustration with these labels, it lies with the liquid chalk pen. You will need to shake it many times (think of spraypaint) and press the tip down (it is spring-loaded) on the test swatch repeatedly before the liquid chalk will â€œflowâ€. While far from being a major issue, just be prepared to fuss with the pen for a while before you can use it.Final SayIf you want reusable labels that come in a variety of shapes and sizes, you really cannot go wrong with this set. The snazzy black background with the white text adds a touch of elegance to your canned jams, jellies, preserves, salsa, and a multitude of other containers. Being able to reuse them is a huge plus, also, and allows you to make corrections â€“ something not possible with â€œstandardâ€ labels. For the price you really cannot go wrong, and even the minor irritation with the liquid chalk pen is not enough to dissuade me from recommending these.

"Laptops are amazingly convenient devices. When they first arrived on the consumer market, they weighed a ton, had small screens, and very little (if any) memory storage. As with all technology, however, soon laptops were smaller and smaller, with larger screens, better battery life, and able to perform as well as, if not better than, your average desktop computer. The caveat being the portability. Yet, the very thing that makes laptops so great is also a major liability: just as easily as you transport it to a coffee house, so too can a thief transport it to their home.Thus, I am taking a look at the RUBAN Laptop Security Cable, a simple device that is very similar in design to a bicycle lock, yet specialized for the Lock slot on most laptops.ConstructionThe first thing that I noticed upon opening the RUBAN Laptop Security Cable is the heft: the tumbler head feels heavy, and if dropped on your foot would definitely hurt. The cable portion of the lock is also thick, with a rubber coating over the steel cables to ensure both comfort while handling it and strength underneath. Also included with the cable is a simple sheet with instructions; it is important that you read this carefully so that you know how to program your desired code. All-in-all, the thickness of the cable, durability of the locking mechanism, and ease of setting my personal code is definitely a huge plus for this product.UseAs with any cable-style lock, the thickness of the cable and the durability of the tumblers are all for naught if you do not secure the lock around a proper â€œballastâ€ point. Thus, when you are choosing a location to loop the cable around before you engage the lock, make sure that the chosen point is sturdy, not easy to transport, and also gives you enough length to comfortably use your laptop while locked into place. Fortunately, the cable is just over 6 feet long, so you have a good length that will enable you to find an appropriate location to secure your laptop.Going back to the setting of your personal code, the default is â€œ0000â€. In order to change it to your own four numbers, you simply depress a button on the side of the unit and dial in your choices. Once done, let go of the side button, and voila! One personalized code for your cable; the best part is that you can change it at any time should you feel that your initial security code was compromised, or even if you simply want to rotate the code periodically. The easy â€œprogrammingâ€ of the RUBAN Laptop Security Cable is just one more nice feature amongst a list of excellent design points.Final SayIf you are in the market for a laptop security cable/lock and do not want to break the bank, I can honestly state that the RUBAN Laptop Security Cable is an excellent choice. The thick cable, heavy-duty tumbler head, flexibility to customize the combination, and a length that allows you to secure your computer to larger â€œanchor pointsâ€, all work together to result in an inexpensive cable lock that will be indispensable for travel, studying in a cafÃ©, preventing your child from taking their laptop to school, and so forth. Thus, I give this product a solid 5 stars of 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WK2J7T4ZRGD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3YG93O#wasThisHelpful","R1WK2J7T4ZRGD3","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taking a temperature is easier than ever as technology has improved. No longer is there a glass thermometer filled with (potentially) toxic mercury, dipped in Vaseline (or KY Jelly) so that insertion for a basal temperature reading is more comfortable; digital, plastic thermometers can obtain readings in a fraction of the time with greater accuracy. Moving from doctor's offices into the consumer markets is the intra-ear infrared thermometer, a device that I recommend to any parent, especially if they have an infant. So, is the ChoiceMMed Infrared Ear Thermometer worth the price?ConstructionThe ChoiceMMed Infrared Ear Thermometer is constructed from plastic, and comes packaged with two AAA batteries, twenty disposable probe covers, and a felt drawstring storage bag. The thermometer unit is fairly lightweight, even with the batteries inserted. That being said, it is not ""chintzy"" or cheap, but I do think that if dropped onto a hard surface from a sufficient height, it could crack. In addition, when you remove the battery compartment cover you will notice that there are SDA/SCL pins extending from the motherboard below the battery tray (see image below). This is a bit unusual, although it does not affect the performance of the thermometer in any capacity.PerformanceEven though the instructions provided are written in horrible English, using the ChoiceMMed Infrared Ear Thermometer is easy. As the product pictures indicate, there is a grey probe cap that protects the sensor tip; simply remove the cap, push the probe head into a plastic cover, and then tug upward on the ear before inserting the tip as comfortably deep into the ear canal. Press the ""Scan"" button on the back and one second later you will hear a beep. VoilÃ ! The display will show the temperature of the most recent reading for fifty-five (55) seconds before timing out and turning the unit off.Since the product description indicates the other features of the ChoiceMMed Infrared Ear Thermometer, I will not delineate them here within this review. I will, however, comment upon the performance of the unit. In terms of ease of use, the CIET (for short) gets a silver star. Preventing the unit from having a perfect score is the fact that the digital display is not backlit, as well as the instructions indicating that the thermometer should be ""acclimated to room ambience"" before use. As such, if you pack this device for a trip and it has been in your suitcase in a hot car, you will need to let it lay in a room for about a half hour in order to ensure that the reading will be accurate. When I used the CIET I simultaneously took my temperature with my Easy@Home Infrared Thermometer, and over three tests the Ciet was consistently .1Â° F lower than the Easy@Home unit (which is very accurate).Finally, while the ease of use and unobtrusive nature of the probe placement makes this thermometer wonderful for babies and young children, the fact that ChoiceMMed does not sell replacement probe covers on Amazon means that after the twenty included are used, you will either have to improvise, risk a generic brand, or contact ChoiceMMed directly to obtain refills. I personally find this to be more hassle than it is worth, however, your mileage may vary.Final SayIf you would like to have a quick, unobtrusive thermometer in your home to help with squirmy kids, then the ChoiceMMed Infrared Ear Thermometer is an economical choice. The readings are accurate, there is a memory for the last ten readings, and it can convert between Â°F and Â°C with the simple press of a button. With soft probe covers, the thermometer is also very comfortable to use, and when combined with the one-second scan time, you really cannot go wrong. Unfortunately, the inability to purchase replacement probe covers, a display that has no backlight (meaning no quick readings without disturbing the ""patient"" at night), and the soft-sided drawstring storage bag combine to drag this unit from being ""Must Have"" to ""Potential Contender"". My final score: 3 stars of 5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R130K762XTUE6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V52O7ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R130K762XTUE6E","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When out in the wilderness camping, I am aware that access to a shower is a bit of a luxury. That being said, driving a few hours in a car with another person who hasnâ€™t been able to bathe for a few days is not an experience that most people enjoy. Sure, there are camping showers that are little more than a bladder filled with water, using gravity to drip slowly over you is okay, but having access to pressurized water is better. That is where the RinseKit comes in.ConstructionThe RinseKit is constructed from durable plastic and is roughly double the size of a lunch cooler. As the pictures indicate, there is a latch on the front that keeps the kit securely closed, so carrying it around will not result in sloshing water everywhere. Upon opening the lid, you will notice that there is enough room to store the hose, spray handle, and faucet adapter, as well as the instructions (if needed). As a result, packing the RinseKit for a trip is easy due to everything being self-contained.The RinseKit is designed to hold two gallons of water, and using the faucet adapter enables a fast connection for filling the storage portion of the kit in 20 seconds (at the quickest flow). Pop off the adapter from the spigot, connect the spray head, and you will be able to use a pressurized spray of water for four minutes. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a spigot, you can still fill the RinseKit by pouring water into the fill hole on top of the storage tank. Finally, the accessories for the kit are of a decent quality, even though they are plastic (the hose is not). Since plastic spray heads have a tendency to crack easily if dropped, I strongly recommend ensuring that the person using it has the appropriate hand strength so that the pressure, while not overly strong, will not result in the handle slipping out of the hand and falling onto the ground.UseThe RinseKit, in short, does its job well. As indicated in the product description, there is no need to pump or charge the RinseKit; simply filling it is all that you need to do in order to achieve the pressurized spray. That being said, it will only last for four minutes, so you do not have a huge amount of time to utilize the RinseKit before you will need to refill it. Fortunately, the two gallon tank refills quickly, so it is not a huge issue (unless you have a line of people waiting for a quick shower).In addition to being useful for a quick shower, the RinseKit is also great for spraying off dishes, cleaning off equipment, or more mundane tasks such as watering plants. Since the RinseKit has a handle, you can carry the unit with you to take care of whichever chores needing completion. The unit is a bit bulky, and with two gallons of water it could be a bit heavy for smaller children, so I again recommend that you supervise kids while using this product.While the pressure that the unit dispenses is sufficient to rinse off sand, dirt, soap, shampoo, and so forth, do not expect it to scour embedded dirt and grime. As the name of the product implies the RinseKit is sufficient for rinsing items off; if you need to spray off siding or clean a driveway, you will want to invest in a standard powersprayer.Final SayWith the ability to be self-contained, fill quickly, and provide four minutes of spraying, you will quickly find that the RinseKit is indispensable for camping, boating, or a day at the beach. No more waiting to use a communal shower (and walking over those icky floors), simply fill up the RinseKit, connect the hose and sprayer, and voila: instant personal shower. Alternatively, the RinseKit is great for cleaning sand and saltwater off of equipment, or cleaning off food residue from a barbeque. Whatever you find a use for, the RinseKit is a surprisingly utilitarian device that will soon become a regular part of your gear when packing for an outing. The price is a bit steep, but the ability to take a shower after trekking through the woods will make camping not only cleaner, but much more pleasant, too. My final verdict: 5 stars of 5.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"With the advent of smart watches, the ability to have Dick Tracyâ€™s communicator watch is finally at hand! True, the digital watches of the 80s were the first step toward living the crime fighter dream, but when it came to doing more than addition & subtraction (Iâ€™m looking at you, Casio Calculator Watch!), they simply could not pull it off. So after careful consideration, I grabbed my yellow trench coat & fedora, $360, and purchased the LG UrbaneÂ® Smart Watch. Two days later I had the chic watch in-hand, and gleefully went about setting it up. Thus, without further ado, here is my review!Quick note: I opted for the black strap/silver face version of the LG UrbaneÂ®.ConstructionThe LG UrbaneÂ® arrives in a nice box and includes the watch, charging base, and USB cable. The watch itself feels durable, with a large screen that is bright and easy to read. As with all new electronic devices, I placed the watch on its charger to top it off while I perused the instruction manual. It only took about thirty minutes to charge it completely upon arrival; from completely drained it only takes about an hour to recharge, a truly speedy timeframe. The leather wristband is a bit stiff, but it will become more flexible over time. The watchstrap has many holes cut into it, more than a traditional watch, and thus offers a comfortable fit for a variety of wrist circumferences. This aspect is especially great for me as I have always had terribly skinny wrists (7in around); with the UrbaneÂ® I am able to cinch the watch snugly against my wrist, ensuring both the watch not spinning around my arm and proper contact for the fitness tracker.After owning this watch for nearly two full months, the contrast stitching on the watchband has not started to fray, and the two loops that you feed the end of the strap through to keep them from sticking out are still in-place and have no damage. In addition, even with no screen protector the LG UrbaneÂ® looks brand new still, with the only cosmetic issue being the lack of shine around the silver face. There are no scratches, nicks, or other signs of wear-and-tear, which is amazing considering how brutal I am on watches. Definitely impressive!Sure, It Looks Great, but How Does It Perform?First and foremost, FOLLOW THE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER! It is absolutely imperative that you download the Android Watch app to your phone/tablet and initiate the pairing through that software. If not, the watch will not be able to sync with your phone, resulting in the incorrect time being displayed and other issues. I made the mistake of not following the instructions and had to factory reset the watch in order for my phone to recognize it. Donâ€™t make my mistake!Once setup, the UrbaneÂ® will scour your device and copy compatible apps to the watch. Paypal, as an example, will allow you to browse items to purchase, and if you wish to check your transaction history the watch will open the app on your cell phone so that you can see more detail. In fact, whenever the watch is not able to display an app, it will tell you that it is opening the corresponding app on your phone/tablet. While this tends to happen more often than not, I did not find this to be inconvenient.Whenever you receive a phone call, the watch will display the caller ID and vibrate; likewise whenever you receive a text or email, you will be able to see the contents, but not any attached images. App messages will also appear, and with the P-OLED display and tweakable font size settings, you will be able to see everything clearly. The Urbaneâ€™sÂ® screen is simply beautiful, and it can be dimmed if it is too bright (this can be the case in a movie theatre), or even made brighter if you want to use the Flashlight function!The Fitness Tracker enables you to monitor your steps taken, distance traveled, and heart rate, and then track this information to approximate calories burned. Need to set a reminder? The watch allows you to do that with its Google Voice software, even enabling you to set a reminder for a specific place through the GPS capability. Thus, if you are running errands and think of something that is not on your list, simply set an alert for that item to pop up when you are in the store! Convenient!Some other features include:1) Calculator: I guess CasioÂ® left their mark!2) Navigation: use it for GPS information if you need directions!3) Say â€œOk Googleâ€ and give a command for the watch to perform, such as sending a text, placing a call, or setting an alarm. No hands needed.4) Navigating the screens is easy: swipe up, down, left, or right.5) Contacts: swipe right twice and browse your contacts list to make a call.6) Download a wide variety of faces for the watch, including weather radar, Pac-Man, and more; the Android store means more than a handful of faces (as opposed to the Apple Watch).7) Water resistant: wear it in the shower or while doing dishes and donâ€™t worry about frying it.The battery life is phenomenal; I can get about 24 hours of use out of it from one charge, a little more if I am not fiddling around on it much. The heavy-duty processor included with the UrbaneÂ® also means that it is not clunky. I have not experienced any lag or other performance issues.Final SayIf you want an Android watch that looks professional, is easy to read, has a whole host of features including a fitness tracker, GPS and alarm settings, weather tracking, and more, then the LG UrbaneÂ® is definitely one that you should consider. Cheaper (by far!) than the Apple watch, the UrbaneÂ® is sleek, sexy, and amazingly convenient to use. Whether I am checking the time and temperature, skimming an incoming text message, or checking my pulse, the LG UrbaneÂ® performs flawlessly. Plus, with the open Android market, there are tons of apps and features being added every day!So, with this said, I give the LG UrbaneÂ® a solid 5 out of 5 stars, and recommend this investment. You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPYNCE822T6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3E5FYW#wasThisHelpful","R3PPYNCE822T6X","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Task lighting is something that can be amazingly frustrating to obtain. Whether it is too bright, not flexible enough, or just not able to deliver the amount of light that you need, finding a gooseneck lamp that does what it needs to is a hunt at times. Enter: the IvationÂ® Multipurpose Gooseneck 7-LED Dimmable Clip Light with Stand. With a long name like that, it has to be good, right? Letâ€™s settle in and see what it can do.ConstructionThe IvationÂ® Multipurpose Gooseneck 7-LED Dimmable Clip Light with Stand (or IMG7, to save my hands), is a solidly-built task lamp that enables the user to set it up in a variety of ways. One of the first things that you will notice is that the lamp can be USB-powered or run on three AAA batteries (not included). In addition, the lamp can be securely clipped onto the edge of a surface or balanced on its base by flipping out the silver side arms. Finally, a button on the base of the lamp head controls the lighting at a touch: simply hold it down to select the desired setting and release, then continue with your task.FunctionAs a task light, the IMG7 functions well. It is plenty bright enough to illuminate the smallest of objects, enabling you to work on painting miniatures or thread a needle, for example. The gooseneck is flexible enough to move into a desired position easily, yet strong enough to remain in place. This, of course, is a hallmark of a good gooseneck lamp, and the IMG7 thus far fits the bill. When clipped to the edge of a table it remains in place securely, and the clip has a rubber padding that prevents damage to the table surface, in addition to helping the lamp remain in place.The only area that I found to be problematic involved using the lamp base as a stand; with the arms flipped out on the side it remained in place and also would not tip over in most instances. However, if you do not have batteries in the base and are using the USB cable with the stand feature, tipping the headlamp down low at an angle did result in the base shifting and the lamp tipping over. While three AAA batteries do not have a huge amount of mass, I did find that using them as the power source while the lamp was free-standing did result in the lamp being a bit more stable. As such, if you want the lamp as a free-standing unit, I recommend using it when you do not need to manipulate the neck much for a complicated task. In that instance, you are better clipping it to something.Finally, while the power cable included is USB (and thus, can be plugged into an outlet with an adapter â€“ not included), the end that plugs into the lamp is a pin plug. As a result, if you lose the cable, you have to buy a specialized replacement. I wish that the lamp had a micro-USB port for charging, thus enabling the average consumer to utilize a variety of cables about the house, rather than having to buy a specialty (and potentially more expensive than it is worth) secondary/replacement cable.Final SayThe IvationÂ® Multipurpose Gooseneck 7-LED Dimmable Clip Light with Stand is utilitarian: it is flexible, able to be dimmed to virtually any light level needed, and can run on either batteries or the included USB power cable. In addition, you have the ability to use it as a free-standing lamp or clipped to a surface, dramatically increasing the functionality versus a clip-only gooseneck light. Thus, for the average consumer, this lamp is going to be a perfect task lamp for a variety of tasks, whether reading, computing, or crafting.All of this being said, I stand by my earlier statement: I wish that the USB cable did not have a pin plug for the lamp, and rather a much more common micro-USB plug. This would dramatically increase its usability, as you wouldnâ€™t have to worry about 1) losing the aforementioned pin plug cable, and 2) buying the properly-sized pin-plug cable should you wish to replace/add a secondary one for another room. For me this is an important aspect of the functionality, and I removed one star from the overall ranking as a result. Thus, my final say: 4 stars of 5.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Bluetooth headsets are one of those conveniences that you take for granted. While I loved my [[ASIN: B001DETCUG PlantronicsÂ® 520 Headset]] (which I have had for several years), the technology on it was becoming outdated and the sound quality was noticeably inferior to even my Bluetooth speakers. Thus, the quest for a new, modern, and functional headset began. In short order the aLLreLiÂ® K6 Bluetooth V4.1 came into my purview, and thus, here is my review of it.Before I get started, I want to point out that I am using this headset with my [[ASIN: B00IZ1XA94 Samsung Galaxy S5 (G900A)]] cell phone, running Android 4.4.2 (KitKat).ConstructionAs indicated in the product images, the aLLreLiÂ® K6 Bluetooth V4.1 Headset comes neatly packaged with the headset, instructions, and charging cable. What is not shown is the variety of ear pieces that are also included, enabling you to adjust the size/style to suit your preference (and thus, comfort). The headset arrives with the white, mid-size silicone earpiece on by default (you can see it on the box picture); included are two more silicone pieces, one smaller and one larger, and three form fabric covers like those on earbuds. Swapping these out is easy: simply pop the silicone piece off and replace it with the desired size with or without the black fabric covering.The charging cable is a standard micro-USB connection, so you can either use the one included with the package or any other cable that you already have on-hand. The headset arrived nearly fully charged, and while this will most likely vary among purchasers, it only took about twenty minutes to reach a full charge after I plugged it in. A small light appears at the base of the earpiece that changes from red to blue to indicate a full battery level.Finally, there are two sets of buttons on the headset, the first being the volume control on the back of the earpiece, and the second being a button that is actually on the round hinge of the microphone (opposite side of the silicone/foam-covered earpiece). The volume button is a paddle that you flip up or down to adjust the level, and the button on the hinge is used to power on/off the headset and also for syncing with your device. When you are finished with the headset and have it plugged in to charge, you can twist the boom mic so that the unit is flat with the earpiece facing inward toward the back of the headset. This helps to keep the earpieces clean and also prevent breakage due to the mic sticking out.FunctionSyncing the aLLreLiÂ® K6 Bluetooth V4.1 was easy as pie: while the instructions indicate the password to use for setup, my phone did not require me to enter it. This, of course, will vary between devices, so be sure to reference the instruction manual, written in English and German, should yours prompt a password entry. Two great features: the silicone piece (which I replaced) was VERY comfortable, and the headset was comfortable and not clunky. I was not a fan of this style of headset beforehand, and the lightweight feel surprised me. I wore the headset for a full day (eight hours) and never felt irritation or discomfort. In addition, the headset remained fully charged. I took it off and left it on my end table overnight without re-charging it; the next day when I put it on I realized that the K6 had turned off automatically to conserve power. I turned it back on and it worked like a champ; all-in-all I was able to get nearly a full week of functionality in stand-by mode without needing to recharge it. Talk time was approximately 8 hours, including playing music for one hour as well.The sound quality of the K6 is really where the awesomeness of this unit lays. The aLLreLiÂ® description indicates that it is â€œHDâ€, and I can attest that this is very accurate. Talking on the phone was crystal clear, and the volume controls enable you to adjust to a loudness that is much better than other models out there. I found myself lowering the volume on several occasions; while I am not hearing impaired, this headset could benefit someone who is. I never had any problems hearing a call or song, even if that person was in a noisy environment. My conversations were clear, also. The K6 boasts of noise cancellation and delivers in spades. I was in a storm walking back into a building and the person on the other end heard me clearly.The default incoming call sound is Wagnerâ€™s â€œRide of the Valkyriesâ€, which made me smile the first time that I heard it; unfortunately, it is also the source of one issue with this headset: the incoming ring is not loud at all, and I found myself belatedly realizing that a call was coming in a few times. Finally, the first headset that I received died after the first use; it worked great for a day, but when I came back the next day it would not turn on. Indeed, when I plugged it in the light indicating the charge did not illuminate. I received a replacement headset and have had no issues thus far. I am chalking up the first headset to a glitch at this point; should my second headset also do the same thing, I will update this review.Final SayIf you are looking for a headset with amazing sound quality and a great battery life, the aLLreLiÂ® K6 Bluetooth V4.1 Headset is going to give you the most bang for your buck. Both music and voice are crystal clear, the headset is lightweight and comfortable, and the battery life is amazing. Little things, such as being able to swap out earpieces to suit your comfort level and being able to swivel the mic so that the headset lays flat add a touch of refinement that only increases my love of this model. In short, if you want a solid headset that will perform for ages, looks good, and can charge with any micro-USB cable, buy the aLLreLiÂ® K6 â€“ you will not be disappointed. Final say: 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I7EDV02EEKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9WH2A2#wasThisHelpful","R17I7EDV02EEKK","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have lupus, more specifically systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease with ride-ranging effects and no known cure. In fact, the FDA approval of the lupus medication BenlystaÂ® in 2011 marked the first time since 1955 that a new treatment for lupus came to be; in the interim, patients deal with the myriad symptoms through a combination of therapies. This, of course, brings me to my review: VITAMINSÂ® shampoo, designed to promote hair growth for women who have experienced loss/thinning. As you have no doubt surmised, all forms of lupus are known to cause hair loss in some patients, and while not as horrific as other aspects of the disease, having beautiful hair is very important for self-confidence, as well as a positive mental outlook, possibly more so than having scars, rashes, or other noticeable physical symptoms.Presentation, Packaging, and AppearanceVITAMINSÂ® shampoo comes in a standard plastic bottle, however it is a bit thinner than others that you may see in stores. The shampoo itself is clear and of a decent consistency, not too watery and not as thick as a conditioner. The lather is rich; a little bit goes a VERY long way, which is especially beneficial as each bottle costs $40. The smell is pleasant and â€œearthyâ€, a cross between sandalwood, roses, and coconut. After worked into a lather, the shampoo is pleasantly cool on the scalp, although milder than some eucalyptus oil-derived products. All-in-all the packaging and physical aspects of VITAMINSÂ® shampoo are professional, pleasant, and does not sacrifice too much space in the valuable real estate of a bath/shower.EfficacyThe bread & butter of VITAMINSÂ® shampoo is its claim that the ingredients used will promote hair growth; thus, without meeting this criteria, VITAMINSÂ® would become nothing more than an overpriced shampoo. So, does it work?As a result of the thinning of my hair due to my disease, it wasnâ€™t unusual for me to see decently-sized clumps coming out with every shower. Drano is a regular purchase for our household as a result. Thus, it was with a great deal of hope, not to mention skepticism, which I gladly accepted the opportunity to test out this product. So the burning question, then: does it work?The short answer? Yes. The long answer? Most likely.When I first started using this product to assess its performance, I was careful to include my boyfriendâ€™s â€œanalysisâ€ of my hair to curtail the â€œPlacebo Effectâ€. Even with skepticism, it is still possible to succumb to inflated perceptions while using a product when you are desperate for results. Thus, some of the opinion listed above is based upon his input.For the first week, showering every other day, while my hair felt clean and my scalp had a cool sensation even a couple of hours post-application, I really did not notice any difference with my hair. By week two, however, my hair felt thicker and had more body. Week three further expanded this result, and my boyfriend said that running his fingers through my hair he definitely noticed a change. Since I have medium-long hair that is all one length, I was able to check for new growth relatively easily; sliding my hands through it just now resulted in finding several strands that were shorter than the hairs around it. While some of these are no doubt from â€œregularâ€ growth patterns, the sheer number have me convinced that VITAMINSÂ® shampoo really does work.The manufacturerâ€™s description indicates that stopping this shampoo will return my â€œproductiveâ€ hair follicles back to their dormant activity. While I have not run out of the shampoo nor stopped using it long enough to verify the veracity of this statement, I will admit that I am disappointed in this fact. Being disabled, I cannot afford the price of this shampoo; even if I could, I wince at the price. Yes, my hair is important to me, but the cost of each bottle makes me want to embrace my â€œnaturalâ€ hair and just live with the painful effects of my lupus.In the EndVITAMINSÂ® shampoo surprised me; it truly does work. Combined with a formulation that only uses a small amount for each shampoo, the pleasant smell, and the undeniable effect of having thicker hair, I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who wants gorgeous hair. Note: this product is not a miracle hair-grower and maximizing the benefits of this shampoo will require time and continued usage. Thus, due to this aspect as well as the $40 price tag that is a smidgen too rich for my blood, I am happy to grant 4 stars to VITAMINSÂ® shampoo by Nourish BeautÃ©. In short, if you can afford to shell out $40 on a bottle of shampoo and will be diligent with its usage, you too can have thicker, shiny, and pleasant-smelling hair.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Iâ€™m siiiiiiiiiiiiiiinginâ€™ in the rainâ€¦ and scaring the pets! Who doesnâ€™t love being outside in the rain, with the smell of the newly-cleansed Earth, the grey skies inviting you to go home and curl up in a blankie, and sipping a hot beverage or bowl of soup? While tolerances for allowing the droplets to fall freely upon your hair/person/clothing varies, a rainstorm is a unique phenomenon in its ability to alter mood AND the Earth. That said, for those of us who do not enjoy getting wet and/or are dressed up and want to protect your hair/makeup/clothing, a way to prevent the rain from hitting the aforementioned items is necessary.While there are a variety of items that can help you with protection from the elements, at issue here is the Big Ben Automatic Umbrella. Being relatively compact, this umbrella is designed for easy portability and rigid function. So, without further ado, here is my review.ConstructionThe Big Ben Automatic Umbrella is just that: a compact umbrella with a cover sleeve that pops open when you depress the button on the handgrip. It opens fully within two seconds, and is the size of a standard umbrella; you can fit two people underneath, as long as they are not obese. When finished, you pull down on the central slide, use the attached strip of fabric to streamline the umbrella, and slide it back into its protective sleeve.UseNot much to say: open the umbrella and hold it over your head to protect you from rain, snow, or sunshine. It repels water well and fits neatly into a tote bag, backpack, or large purse. While many umbrellas have sleeve covers, the unusual aspect of the Big Ben Automatic Umbrella is that the sleeve has a long handle attached to it. This strip of fabric is long enough that you can sling the umbrella over your shoulder; a tensioner that slides along the handle enables you to tighten the sleeve around the umbrella and thus prevent it from falling out of the holder.The only issue that I experienced is that the spring-loaded tension that enables the â€œautomaticâ€ function is a bit stiff and makes it a bit difficult to close the umbrella. While I was able to close it successfully, when my fingers act up from my lupus this aspect of the Big Ben Automatic Umbrella may pose difficulties. I am going to assume that it is solely my umbrella that has this problem, so hopefully other umbrellas will not present this issue to other customers.Final SayIf you want a stylish umbrella that includes a long handle to carry it about, opens at the touch of a button, and is compact enough to fit neatly into a variety of storage bags/backpacks, I recommend the Big Ben Automatic Umbrella. While closing it requires a bit more force that I expected, the umbrella serves its purpose and is well-made. Thus, I give it 4 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Mosquitos, being the disease-spreading vector that they are, are absolute heathens. Recent studies have shown that certain blood types are more prone to attracting them, and as one of the people with the corresponding blood type, I abhor summer evenings. Living near the Missouri River (which is less than a full city block from our back yard) means that any time outside results in me batting bugs out of the way, avoiding water, and generally scratching my skin around the newly-minted red sucker bites left from the small bugs from hell.Enter: the Kinven Mosquito Repellent Bracelet. Constructed of nylon with a mesh â€œholderâ€ attached to it, it claims that the malignant carriers of West Nile Virus are repelled due to the combination of â€œ100% Natural Ingredientsâ€. So, does it work?ConstructionThe bracelet itself is soft and doesnâ€™t irritate the flesh, and loading the repellent packets into the mesh holder is not rocket science. After securing the braceletâ€™s Velcro around my wrist, I was ready-to-go within 5 minutes of opening the package. I should note that the instructions indicate that the packs have a shelf life of 3 years, and each one is designed to give you 15 days of protection. The ingredients listed:CitronellaGeraniumPeppermintLavenderEfficacyAs anyone who has ever lit a citronella candle knows, their efficacy is dubious at worst, and â€œmildâ€ at best. After going outside with my new Kinven Mosquito Repellent Bracelet, I went about my business of tidying up my garden and generally building up a sweat (to better attract those vile little buggers). An hour later, my arm was covered with sucker bites. I even had a mosquito walking over the bracelet, obviously nonplussed by the â€œall naturalâ€ ingredients that are purported to prevent sucker bites.I tried again the second night, and again, the mosquitos landed on the bracelet and generally made a mockery of my futile attempts to ward against them. True, I am not likely to develop malaria in the wilds of South Dakota, but being able to enjoy an evening outside without developing a cornucopia of insect bites along my very pale skin is a simple enough desire.In The EndLong story short: if you want effective mosquito repellent, get something with DEET in it. While the Kinven Mosquito Repellent Bracelet does smell pleasant, it does absolutely nothing to help you if you are unfortunate enough to be a mosquito magnet in the first place. In the interim, I have tossed my Kinven Bracelet in the trash; if I had paid for this I would return it ASAP.Play it safe, people, and use bug spray with DEET. Not only will you stop mosquitos, other nasties like biting flies will leave you alone, too.

"For anyone who has a long-haired cat, you quickly learn that, while it is a cute fuzzball, hairballs become somewhat routine. If you have the added bonus of a thick fur coat, the other problem is helping your cat to remain cool during the summer months. While grooming cats can sometimes require the use of a full set of maille armor, falconer gloves, and the wish that you could give your pet Benadryl beforehand in the hopes of knocking it out, it is a necessary evil. Fortunately, our monster cat is sweet and has never bit anyone (nor do I think that he ever will), and so we were elated to shave down Smoke the cat's belly.Or, at least, that was the plan. After fifteen minutes of frustration, Smoke's belly looks more like the result of a drunken bet gone awry. And, before you think that it was the cat who caused this to happen, that was not the case.It was the Pet MagasinÂ® Pet Clipper Kit.ConstructionThe hard plastic case with egg crate foam feels durable enough and has plenty of room for the included grooming supplies (all of which are shown in the product images). The clipper itself feels fairly heavy, and has a screw on the side that allows you to adjust the power output; the machine oil that was used on the clipper blades somehow leaked and smudged the sticker next to the power adjustment screw and blurred the instructions. A small metal ""key"" for the power adjustment screw is the only other maintenance accessory than the cleaning brush.The clipper heads are the first source of frustration. In terms of their construction, they all look like those found in ""human"" clipper kits. Indeed, the metal plate on the back of each gives you the impression that they are of a high quality. This is misleading. The tips of each comb are sharp, and poke into your fingers when you are attempting to attach it to the clipper head. The biggest problem?The comb adjustment heads are not wide enough; in short, THEY DON'T FIT THE CLIPPER HEAD!UseAfter plugging in the unit, I grabbed the shortest guide comb and attempted to attach it to the clipper. It would not fit; the back of the head has metal ""hooks"" that look like they should snap onto the back of the blade assembly, but this is not the case. After fiddling around with it, I consulted the instruction manual to see if there was some trick to getting the guide combs into place; there were no directions, illustrations, or any other explanation of how these are supposed to fit onto the clipper. Even after my boyfriend fiddled with it and appeared to have the guide in place, once I turned the clipper on it vibrated off.Giving up on the guides, I opted to just use the clipper blades to trim the fur off of the cat's belly. After making a few passes there was a *thud* noise as though something dropped. Not seeing anything, I continued attempting to shave the cat with little success. When I went to adjust the clipper, I noticed that one of the screws holding the upper clipper blade in place had fallen out; no wonder I was unable to shave anything! Fortunately, I located the screw, put it back in, and was able to continue with the grooming session.The end result of navigating a cat's belly, fighting with the Pet MagasinÂ® Clippers, and using a fur rake was a noticeably thinner cat who should be much cooler come summer. That being said, his belly looks like he lost a bet and allowed a buddy to shave him. The clippers were able to clip his fur, but never in a smooth pass. I had to use short ""strokes"" in order for the blades to cut the fur properly. In fact, I was able to remove more fur by using the undercoat rake than through shaving the belly.Final SayWhile the low price of this clipper set may seem enticing, with guide combs that won't fit/stay in place over the blades, screws that fall out during use, and an ineffectual cutting capability, you are better off spending more money on a higher-quality kit. Or, barring that, take your cat to the groomers. If I purchased this with my own money, I can assure you that I would return it.

"Jewelry is a highly personal thing, something that jewelers are all-to-willing to tackle through their designs. The Zodiac Necklace from RUINUO exemplifies this mantra through their Stainless Steel Zodiac Pendants, allowing you to choose a piece that matches either your Zodiac, or that of a friend or loved one. But, are they worth the price?ConstructionAs indicated in the product description and images, the RUINUO Zodiac Constellation Necklace, or RZCN to prevent hand cramps from typing that out, comes with a cubic zirconia-laden zodiac constellation traced in black that is superimposed over a stylized cross; the name of the constellation is engraved at the bottom of the cross and also traced with black to ensure readability. In addition, there are two necklace options; one is a stainless steel rolo chain, while the other is black satin with a silver lobster clasp and jump ring. Overall the design is unique, even if the constellation is a bit cramped with the â€œstarsâ€ being relatively closer together than in reality.FunctionItâ€™s a necklace. It wraps around your neck with the length of the chain causing the pendant to rest against your chest. I chose the black satin, and the pendant dangled just below my collarbone. The measurements are:ChainsStainless steel: 21â€ (inches), or roughly 54cm (centimeters)Satin cord: 19â€, or roughly 48cmPendantLength: 2â€Widest Point: 1.25â€As you can see by the measurements, this is a rather large pendant. While I wouldnâ€™t call it gaudy, it is something that will dwarf most necklaces. If you wear more than one necklace, this one will most likely â€œdrown outâ€ the other. That being said, the stainless steel chain and the pendant itself are of very good quality, and with proper care should last a while.The satin cord has considerably cheaper quality jump rings for the clasp, and it has already snagged a few times on my other necklace. If you prefer a black cord for this pendant, you may want to have a replacement on standby.OverallThis is a nice necklace that allows you to proudly display your zodiac constellation, or as a nifty gift for another. The pendant is a smidgen large, however, and may look awkward with certain outfits. That being said, using it as a hanger for your rearview mirror is a good second option if the necklace ends up being too large for your taste.The quality is good, and overall the necklace is a neat piece of jewelry. I just wish that the included satin cord wasn't so lousy. Final say: 4 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Mixing up a drink after a hard day, to celebrate with friends, or as an accompaniment to a fine meal is something of an art. Sure, you can argue that pouring alcohol and various other ingredients into a glass is as much an art as video game animations are (Iâ€™m sorry Roger Egbert, you were wrong), but the fact remains that in order to get the flavor you want you need to follow a recipe. Just as important as having the best ingredients you can afford, so too is having the proper bartending tools. Fortunately, TeiKisÂ® has a very competent all-in-one set for every budding connoisseur.ConstructionSince the product description lists all of the items included, I will not delineate them here. I will, however, comment upon the quality of the items. Overall each of the included pieces are well-made, with no burrs, splinters, rust spots, or other issues. Measurements are clearly marked on the glass and jiggers, and the glass opening fits inside of the Boston Shaker neatly so that you can shake up your drinks. The set cleans up easily, although I recommend against putting the muddler in the dishwasher, as it will dry out the wood during the drying cycle. Aside from lacking a sugar spoon for absinthe, this set has everything that you need to make virtually every mixed cocktail in existence (including those not invented yet!).UseSince the primary function of this set is for alcohol, mixers, and other ingredients to be poured into it, I could dumb this review down and say that the containers hold liquids well. Short of springing a leak, the TeiKisÂ® Cocktail Set will be able to hold liquids/mashes with no issue. However, that oversimplifies the uses for this set, so I will elaborate a bit further.This set is great for both experienced and newbie bartenders, the casual at-home drink, or for a dedicated lush. The glass included in the set not only indicates measurements on the sides, but includes recipes for a Manhattan, Margarita, Bloody Mary, Daiquiri, and/or Dry Martini. The double-sided jigger is nice for quick measuring, while the individual jiggers are perfect for exact one and two shot measurements. The Hawthorn Strainer is very solid, and not like the cheap models you often find in sets. The body of the strainer is heavy and the stainless steel coils are thick and will not warp easily.Finally, while the muddler is made from a lightweight wood, it is smooth and comfortable to use. The spoon is also heavy duty, and short of intentionally trying to bend it, I do not see it breaking or otherwise being ruined through regular (even daily) use. The masher end has a one inch (1â€) diameter, and while not huge, should be sufficient for most mashing requirements. If you are working on a larger quantity, you may want to run it through a blender; otherwise mash it in small batches.Final SayWhether hosting a party or for a party of one, this is a great set to help anyone make the perfect cocktail. No more eyeballing; you can control whether you want a â€œheavy-handedâ€ pour while still maintaining the flavor of the drink that you have in mind. With the high quality of the items included in this set, you will get a lot of use out of it. If not for yourself, the TeiKisÂ® Cocktail Set will make a wonderful gift for a friend or family member. Just remember: drink responsibly!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"I remember the first time that I heard Cranius; I was bopping around YouTube and came across a blurry video of an Alliance mage PvPing in Arathi Basin. The wonderful lyrics of ""Big Blue Dress"" played while a human mage bounced around while nuking everything in sight. When the chorus came with three gnomes singing in accompaniment, I was hooked. The awesome music and wry lyrics that poked fun at the many elements of World of Warcraft were masterfully interwoven into a tapestry of pure awesomeness. Oh yea, and unlike other popular YouTube WoW videos (I'm looking at you, Nimh), Cranius can actually sing!While being a gamer and playing World of Warcraft adds another layer of comprehension to the songs on this CD, it is not necessary. Cranius's songs have a blend of folk, rock, and a touch of country musical styles, primarily played through acoustic & electric guitars and drums. Cranius himself is the vocalist, although you can hear a trio of higher-pitched backup singers during some chorus lines. The recordings of these songs are clear, with the singing being audible and clearly understood.The songs on this CD are few, but each one will make you smile and laugh. Whether Cranius is poking fun at male mages having to wear the eponymous ""Big Blue Dress"", being ganked by a high-level player while you are minding your own business on your low-level toon, or singing a sad ballad about the ruins in Darrowshire, I can guarantee that you will be humming each one after listening to this CD. The songs are also amazing in that they draw in everyone, regardless of your normal tastes in music. Oh, and gearing up your male mage character will never be the same again.So, if you would like some awesome music to play while you are kickin' ass in World of Warcraft, mentally wishing that you could summon a fireball to nuke that rude driver while stuck in traffic, exercising, or cleaning your home, ""Big Blue Dress"" is a great addition to any record collection. The catchy songs and clever writing will leave you hooked and wanting more. Definitely a 5 star CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XYCE7CD8T3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LP17JK#wasThisHelpful","R8XYCE7CD8T3W","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most cell phones have some sort of camera; likewise, most people have a phone with a camera that is on or near their person all of the time. This omnipresent capability to photograph life has given the world the ability to see things through the unbiased â€œeyeâ€ of the camera. Thus, for the first time in history humanity is documenting its existence thoroughly and in amazing detail, with all of it being saved for posterity. With this philosophical drivel out of the way, cell phone cameras have one major drawback: you cannot change the lens.ConstructionThe YOPOÂ® Universal Clip Lens LQ-001 is comprised of an aluminum clip, a felt bag, lens caps, and the eponymous lenses. The YUCL set contains three lenses: one each of a wide angle, macro, and fish eye lens. As the product name indicates, the lenses screw into a spring-loaded clip (think of a clothespin) that opens to clamp onto a cell phone in a manner that places the YOPOÂ® lens over that of the cell phone. The inside portion of the clamp that rests against the phone have rubber gaskets in order to prevent damage to the cell phone lens and/or touch screen.UseThe phone that I tested this set with is the Samsung Galaxy S5.So, at this point I would elaborate upon my impressions of how well the lenses function. After all, the premise behind their use makes a world of sense, and clipping a lens onto my phone is childâ€™s play. Here is the problem: I was only able to test out the fish eye and macro lenses. Of those two, only the fish eye lens produced the desired result. The macro lens was blurry, no matter the distance of the subject or the settings on my phone. Insofar as the fish eye view goes, every other picture resulted in a black arc covering the top of the frame; I moved and readjusted the lens in every position that I could manage and I was unable to get rid of that black arc.In regard to being unable to use the wide angle lens, there is the design flaw. As aforementioned, the lens bases are threaded in order to screw them into the spring clip (the wide angle lens is too narrow and instead screws over the macro lens). I tried and tried to screw the wide angle lens into the macro lens base with no success. The overall height of the male and female threading is very short, meaning that there is not a lot of room for error. In addition, trying to twist the wide angle lens by finding a starting point on the macro lens is nearly impossible due to the threads being the thickness of a hair. I finally got so angry that I packed up the entire set; when you anticipate being able to use the lenses to achieve three different views, only to be able to see with one lens that also has issues, there is no point in clogging up my bag by carrying this set around.The other problems that I encountered had to do with the portion of the clip that rests against my touchscreen. While the YUCL did not damage my screen, it did interfere with my ability to navigate through my menus by either slowing the input detection of my finger or by blocking my display so that I could not see my camera settings. Finally, the clip also partially blocked the flash, resulting in odd lighting results (and the shadow of the lens appearing in my pictures).Final SayI wish that I could say that the YOPOÂ® Universal Clip Lens LQ-001 Set is all of the goofy fun that it should be. Unfortunately, there are too many flaws; the sturdy construction of the clips and lens bodies are ruined by the inadequate threading and a design that ultimately results in poor pictures (or none at all in the case of the wide angle lens). I know that it could just be the design of my phone that contributes to the pictures having shadows or the view being blurry. That said, not being able to screw the wide angle lens into the macro lens is just a bad design and has nothing to do with my phone. In the end, I cannot recommend this set at all, and I strongly recommend that you look for one with a larger lens and/or better design that wonâ€™t make you want to chuck the entire affair across the room.

"While I feel that women carry around way too much stuff in their bags, even with just the bare necessities they are pretty much indispensable. In order to prevent me from loading my handbag with entirely too much stuff, I make sure that I use the smallest model available. Recently though, I realized that I needed a smidgen more room, so I opted to try out the Avber Western Style Cow Leather Cross Studded Shoulder Bag.ConstructionThe Avber Western Style Cow Leather Cross Studded Shoulder Bag, or ASB to save my hands from developing carpal tunnel, is a soft leather purse with an interchangeable shoulder strap or wrist loop. There is one main compartment with two open pockets on one side and a zippered pocket on the other. The bag is large enough to hold most wallets, a checkbook, pens/pencils, makeup, or other items. The two open pouches on one side of the main compartment are wide enough to hold most cell/smartphones. The zippered pocket can hold smaller items, such as a Swiss Army Knife, eye drops, nail file, asthma inhaler, and other knick-knacks.The metal fleurs-de-lis ornaments on the outer body of the ASB are securely attached, and during the past two weeks I did not experience any issues such as snagging or other damage related to these. In relation to the construction, there are two portions that I feel detract from the overall design of the bag. These are:1. The zipper for the main compartment does not connect to one end (the base of the zipper), and instead is unattached and hangs over the side of the purse (imagine if your jeans had the base of the zipper [when unzipped it is where the grasp is] not sewn into the jeans, instead allowing the base of it to hang loose inside of your jeans). While the end of the zipper strip gives you a grip to open and close the bag, it does mean that there is a small opening at the end of the compartment where the zipper is not attached. Thus, even if the bag is zipped shut, it is still possible for smaller items to slip outside of the bag should it be upended. Granted, this is likely to only occur during specific types of falls, but the bigger issue of possible damage to the zipper because it hangs over the edge of the bag is another potential problem.2. The shoulder strap for the bag is not one contiguous piece of leather, rather, it has several pieces sewn together. For the price of the bag, especially considering that even â€œcheapâ€ purses at WalMart have shoulder straps with no seams along the length, it really detracts from the overall appearance. It is especially puzzling, as the rest of the seams and fabric construction of the bag are well-done and professional.FunctionWhile the ASB is large enough to hold a great deal of items, you are limited in the sub-compartment department (say that three times fast!). As a result, you have to cram everything into one of four pockets, meaning that you will be shuffling through the bag frequently when you are trying to find smaller items. In addition, the pockets for your cell phone and/or other electronic gadgets are not overly deep, and may stick out above the top of the bag altogether, preventing you from being able to zip it closed. Yes, the main compartment and inner zippered pocket are roomier, but the lack of more pockets (and a sorely-needed secondary â€œmasterâ€ compartment) hinders you being able to sort contents neatly.The bag itself looks good and has that lovely smell of leather. It is very soft to the touch and supple to the skin. If you are using this as a dress purse, you will definitely receive a lot of compliments. In fact, I feel that the best use of the ASB is to attach the wrist strap and use the bag for dressier occasions. Otherwise, you will face a constant battle with 1) locating a smaller item amongst the contents, and/or 2) not having enough room to carry essentials, especially items that you may want to keep out of sight (such as feminine hygiene products).Final SayThe Avber Western Style Cow Leather Cross Studded Shoulder Bag, the bane of carpal tunnel sufferers everywhere, is constructed from soft, lovely leather. It has a chic design with fleurs-de-lis and cross metallic ornaments, solid metal clasps, and professional stitching. That being said, the pieced-together shoulder strap, severe lack of compartments, and unattached zipper work in conjunction to really make me hesitate to recommend this bag. Sure, it looks great and has several quality features; not being able to carry my medications or organize my â€œstuffâ€ adequately, even forcing me to remove some items from my usual inventory, conspire against the positive aspects. The final nail in the coffin, though, is that odd zipper.Just to clarify: before I composed this review I contacted the manufacturer to ascertain whether I received a defective product or not. They told me that the design of the zipper was intended, and that it should hang over the edge of the bag.I wish that I could say that the chic appearance and overall craftsmanship outweighed the flaws listed, but I cannot. Thus, if you are eyeing this for a main bag, I would recommend another type. If this is meant as a dress purse and not daily use, go for it. Otherwise you may find yourself frustrated by all of the stuff that you canâ€™t fit into it. Final say: 3 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"While pre-ground coffee is convenient, any coffee connoisseur can tell you that the full flavor of the beans, regardless of brand, is sacrificed during the packaging process. Sure, the best flavor for coffee is obtained from freshly-roasted beans that are ground while still hot, but most people (I dare say!) do not have coffee plants, much less the necessary roasting equipment, on-hand to prepare the pinnacle of morning caffeine ablutions each day. Thus, it is up to us plebeians to resort to grinding pre-roasted whole beans purchased from a supermarket/specialty store as the next-best solution. This is where the IdylcHomes KONA Coffee Slim Grinder comes in.ConstructionThe IdylcHomes KONA Coffee Slim Grinder (IHKCG, for short) is roughly the size of a peppermill, with the marked difference of having a glass jar to collect the ground material coming from the grinding burrs. The hand crank and tension nut are constructed with heavy stainless steel, while the hopper and its clear guard are made with food-safe plastic. My first impression upon opening the IHKCG box and removing the grinder was positive: the construction quality is excellent and with proper care, the grinder will last for a long time â€“ or at least until the ceramic grinding burrs are worn.FunctionFirst and foremost, just to reinforce the product description, this grinder is not going to grind up enough coffee to fill a 12-cup pot of coffee, not unless you plan on grinding three to four batches each time that you want to make some. The IHKCG is only meant to prepare three cups at max, maybe more if you prefer weaker coffee. With that out of the way, letâ€™s get to the â€œmeat & potatoesâ€ of this review.Filling the hopper can be a bit tricky, especially since it is cross-divided. Due to this, you may need to fine-tune the amount of beans poured into each of the four compartments since the walls prevent the beans from spilling over into the other areas. In addition, the mouth of the hopper is not overly large, so you may find yourself scooping in only a few beans at a time to prevent spills. Once you have some practice loading the beans into the IHKCG it does help in cutting back the time spent, which can take several minutes overall to complete the grinding process.The instructions for the IdylcHomes Grinder indicate that the handle should only be rotated in one direction â€“ clockwise â€“ so as to prevent any damage to the ceramic burrs. Thus, when you are turning the crank, if it â€œjamsâ€ or â€œlocks upâ€ you cannot reverse the crank to loosen the blockage. Rather, you need to shake the unit in the hopes that you will work it free. Unfortunately, this sometimes does not work, and you will find yourself disassembling it in order to stick something into the bean chambers and shuffle the beans around (in my case it was a metal chopstick). Fortunately, jams are not too common, but be aware that it can be frustrating.In terms of the quality of the grind, the beans are reduced to a slightly coarse ground, one that works equally well in a single-serve coffee pot or French Press. That being said, in order to obtain a full jar of grounds you will need to refill the hopper at least twice, more if you want a stronger brew. While it does not require a lot of strength to use this grinder, it can be tedious if you are making more than one cup of coffee. So be sure to have one of your kids handy for free labor!In the EndIf you like to grind your own coffee and want to make just enough grounds for one to three cups of joe, then the IdylcHomes KONA Coffee Slim Grinder is a great choice. The construction quality is excellent, the grind useable in a coffeemaker or French Press, and it is easy to use. That being said, I need to spill the beans: the design of the hopper, the narrowness of the opening, and the chambered compartments do mean that you will have to fiddle around when loading the grinder so as to not create a mess. So, depending upon the kind of timeframe that you have, this is probably not the type of grinder that you want to deal with when you are preparing for work in the morning.So, in short, this is a great gift for a bachelor, yourself, or another coffee lover who would like to make freshly-ground coffee in small batches. The design quality is very good overall, and the price isnâ€™t too shabby either. Still, the aforementioned flaw of the hopper prevents me from giving this product a perfect rating. 4 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Kitchen timers are one of those things that you never really think about until you need one, and as technology has improved, the type, features, size, and more can truly be overwhelming when ascertaining which model to purchase. If you prefer a digital display, which is no doubt why you are on this page, allow me to introduce you to the Fontiene Digital Timer & Clock.  This palm-sized unit has a bevy of features, and I will do my best to let you know whether this timer is worth the cost. Without further ado, here we go!ConstructionThe Fontiene Digital Timer & Clock (henceforth referred to as FDTC) is constructed from thick plastic, a large LCD display, and plastic buttons that allow you to utilize the unit. The product packaging is written entirely in Mandarin, although the included instructions are translated into English. Finally, two button batteries (the size is L1154) are included to power the FDTC; simply press the spring clip on the back side, slide the battery cover off, drop in the batteries, and replace the cover. While a minor detail, the clip on the back (which also has the magnet stuck to it) has a spring-loaded, flip-out piece of metal that locks into place each time that you press down on the clip; this allows the timer to upright on a surface similar to a picture frame.The FDTC is relatively lightweight, and if dropped off of the countertop it will most likely chip/crack. I also want to point out that the hanging loop listed in the product title is not included with the timer. In fact, the only evidence of it is a small hole on the top of the clip in the back.UseSetting up the Fontiene Digital Timer & Clock is fairly straightforward and somewhat intuitive, and moving in between the four available timer slots is fluid. The clock uses the 24-hour reading for the display, so be aware that 1 PM will display as 13:00, 2 PM as 14:00, and so forth.The FDTC is able to simultaneously track four different timers at the same time. Setting up the timer is easy: press the desired button on the right side (T1, T2, T3, or T4), and once the display appears, press the Hour (H), Minute (M), and Seconds (S) buttons on the left side of the display until you have the desired timer programmed. If you make a mistake, simply press the â€œClearâ€ button and start over. Once finished, you can either start the timer straight away or go to the other slots to program any other needed timers, and then come back to start the countdown. Once you have the timer(s) active, a flashing T1, T2, T3, and/or T4 will appear along the upper part of the digital display. If the timers are not counting down, the only time a T1 â€“ T4 message will illuminate is when you are in one of the menus for the timers, and then it will only show the corresponding button (solid, not flashing, if the timer is off).The alarms are fairly audible, and unless you have a loud TV or radio, should be heard from another room. Each timer beeps in the same octave, but the beeps change depending upon the timer that is alerting. For example: T1 will have one beep, T2 a double beep, and so forth; each alarm will continue to chirp every second for one minute past the completion of the countdown. Finally, the display will show how long it has been since the timer finished and will continue counting until you hit the ST/SP button.This is the point where I advise you that the Fontiene Digital Timer & Clock has a few flaws. While its primary function of maintaining time and allowing you to setup four different timers is adequate, the design of the unit itself can be frustrating. To wit:1. Upon pressing a button, sometimes the unit does not detect it. While not common, this is annoying when you want to move between timers.2. The magnet to mount the timer is attached to the clip on the back, which is a narrow strip that sticks out from the rear of the unit. As such, after you hang the timer from your fridge/stove, if you attempt to press the buttons on the sides, you will flip the timer off of wherever it is hanging. Either embedding the clip/stand or having the magnets along the edges with raised points so that they stick out as far as the clip would stabilize the unit and eliminate you having to pop it off of the fridge to program it in your hands each time that you want to use it.3. There is no backlight on the LCD screen, and under certain lighting conditions, it can make seeing the numeric display a little difficult.4. If you hold the unit up to your ear (without the timer beeping, of course), the unit does have a high-pitched noise that can be heard. It isnâ€™t truly loud, but I do wonder why a relatively simple device that does not have a huge power requirement would produce an audible â€œelectronicâ€ noise.Final SayIf you are in the market for an economical timer that is easy to use and enables you to set multiple timers for different purposes simultaneously, then the Fontiene Digital Timer & Clock is a product to consider. Even with the four issues that I listed above, most of them are relatively minor, and you can decide for yourself if they are â€œdeal-breakersâ€, so to speak. Personally, the FDTC does its job, and the large LCD display does make it easier to see the time and program it accordingly. That being said, the flaws that I mentioned keep me from giving the unit a perfect score; thus, my final say: 4 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"I decided to pick this set up because the tongs that we had, while similar in appearance, were starting to show significant wear. So, when I saw this set on sale as a Gold Box special for only $6, I jumped at the chance. I figured that at $6 even if they were crappy tongs that I could get some use out of them before I needed an upgrade. So $6 and three days later, my Chef's Star Heat-Resistant Silicone Tongs arrived. Since there were other items in the moderately-heavy package, I figured that it was these other purchases that weighted the box down.Boy, was I wrong! These tongs are heavy-duty and GREAT quality for the low price. The metal is smooth and has some heft to it, so I don't have to worry about accidentally bending the heads (which have happened to me on occasion). Secondly, the red silicone is smooth and comfortable, also enabling you to have a sturdy grip so that the tongs won't slide out of your hand. Finally, the silicone heads of the tongs again have smooth silicone with no burrs along the sides, and squeeze shut securely.Oh, I forgot to mention that the loop on top of each tong is not only used to hang them from a hook, but can be pulled up to lock the tongs closed. This is a great feature, as it reduces the space required in a drawer (should you store them that way, as I do), and also prevents damage to the tongs and/or spring control that may occur when stored with the arms spread apart.Oh, and the beauty about these tongs is the silicone! Silicone is heat-resistant, and as such, you can use these tongs to flip items in the oven, reach into a boiling pot of water to retrieve an object, even flip steaks on a grill. When you are done, some hot, soapy water or a spin in the dishwasher will clean the tongs up and make them look good as new!Final SayIf you are in the market for a nice set of kitchen tongs that lock closed, have silicone heat-resistant tips, are well-made and durable, and clean up easily, I completely recommend this set, even moreso if you can catch it on sale! That being said, even at $16 this set is a steal, and will make a wonderful addition to your kitchen or that of a loved one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTFW4GN917VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNE0QO6#wasThisHelpful","R1YTFW4GN917VK","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julienning vegetables is time-consuming and a pain in the butt if you do not have a mandolin, food processor, or specialized peeler. With this in mind, the Ultra Sharp Dual Julienne peeler is a stainless steel hand peeler that has a misleading name. There are actually four different cuts that can be made with this item, and with the solid, heavy construction you will find that you invested in a kitchen gadget that you will be able to use for a long time.ConstructionAs indicated above, the Amenco Ultra Sharp Dual Julienne peeler (aka AUSDJP) is a stainless steel peeler with two different julienne peeling blades on either side of the head. One side has small, narrow teeth for shallower peels, while the other blade has larger teeth that are further apart. Thus, you will be able to peel off thicker pieces of the vegetable/fruit that you are peeling. As with straight-blade veggie peelers, the blades are designed to pivot back-and-forth within the frame of the unit, enabling the blade to flex across the decidedly uneven surfaces of most vegetables.The two other blades that are left off of the product name are actually exterior to the frame and on either narrow side of the peeler. These blades loop out from the frame that holds the julienne blades, with one having a larger arch than the other. These are designed for use in peeling the skin off of citrus, making notches in strawberries/radishes for decoration, scooping out the eyes/bruised spots from a potato, and myriad other uses that require a â€œdiggingâ€ tip. As a final observation, there is a loop that protrudes from the base of the handle (which is smooth and very comfortable to hold) that enables you to hang this peeler from a hook for storage.UseDue to the smooth, oval-shaped handle and the sturdy construction of the peeler as a whole, the VERY sharp AUSDJP allows you to have a firm grip while you pull the blade(s) along the veggie/fruit that you are peeling. If you are more accustomed to using peelers that have the blade along the side (as opposed to the top as in the AUSDJP), it can be a bit awkward to use at first. Fortunately, this is short-lived and soon you will be zipping along like a pro.Either julienne blade digs into the flesh of a veggie/fruit hungrily, with the pressure that you provide offering a minor boost to the thickness of the strips. The teeth are also short (even on the side with the larger teeth), thus trying to obtain large julienne strips will require you to carefully trace the peeler completely around a potato (for instance) in order to acquire the length desired. That being said, the thickness of the strips do mean that you can peel a carrot over a salad for perfectly-sized strips, or use the larger teeth to peel off strips of squash (or carrots) to boil for vegetarian pasta.If you are looking for truly chunky strips, the blades on the sides of the peeler can help with that, but you will want to be careful until you are accustomed to the sharpness and pressure required. These side blades are also great for quickly digging out the eyes of potatoes, dark spots, or any other â€œdivotsâ€ that can be created with them. As alluded to above, these side blades are also great at cutting flaps into vegetables/fruit, allowing you to give a truly artistic flare to your presentation without spending hours using a paring knife. Effortless aesthetics: what is not to love?Finally, this peeler cleans up easily with hot, soapy water (just be careful while cleaning it so that you do not accidentally cut yourself). Alternatively, the AUSDJP can be placed into a dishwasher for even easier clean-up.In the EndIf you want a durable, dishwasher-safe julienne peeler that can also create â€œprettyâ€ garnishes, look no further than the Amenco Ultra Sharp Dual Julienne Peeler. The quality construction and the multiple uses will make this gadget invaluable in a busy kitchen. Whether peeling carrots for a delicious salad or creating hash browns from fresh potatoes, this peeler makes quick work of any task set before it. With the added bonus of quick clean-up, you really cannot go wrong with this purchase. Definitely recommended for the cook in you, or your life!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"As any gamer knows, the ability to communicate with your team is critical, especially when facing down a raid boss or defending against the attack of the enemy team. While most games have a text interface, I the heat of battle you may not have the time to type out instructions/comments, especially if you are not a proficient typist. Thus, the need for a voice chat is evident, and in order to participate you need to have a good microphone/speaker setup. That is where gaming headsets come in; SenteyÂ® has created a model called the Arches Gaming Headset, a USB 2.0 unit with Virtual 7.1 Dolby Surround Sound. Whew, what a mouthful!But, is it worth it?ConstructionThe SenteyÂ® Arches Gaming Headset (or SAGH for short) is constructed from heavy-duty plastic with metal screens for the speaker vents and the knobs that hold the earpieces onto the headband. The loops on the upper portion of the headband at constructed from metal that has a rubberized shield; the strap underneath the arches has light padding and feels soft to the touch, like kid leather (note: the material is not actual leather). The microphone can be rotated into an upward position for storage, and it is flexible enough to curve the mouthpiece toward your mouth while retaining the desired placement. Finally, the USB cable is heavy-duty and has a fabric sheath covering the length. Midway down is a plastic control box that controls the in/out volume, as well as housing the â€œMuteâ€ and â€œPush-to-Chatâ€ buttons.When powered up the Sentey logo on the outside of each earpiece will light up; the microphone tip will also glow red when the microphone has been muted. This is a nice feature and enables the user to quickly ascertain if they accidentally muted the headset. While the glow from the earpieces serves the practical purpose of showing that the unit is receiving power, it is also a nice aesthetic touch, to boot.FunctionOnce I had the SAGH plugged into my computer, the earpieces resting against my earlobes, and the mouthpiece curved toward my lips, I fired up TeamspeakÂ® and gave it a whirl. I had to tweak the volume settings at first so that my friends could hear me, but with a simple twist of the volume knob located on the control box on the USB cable, I was able to quickly adjust my settings so that I was heard (and could hear) clearly.In terms of audio quality, the sound is rich, especially if I am listening to music (such as the in-game soundtrack for World of Warcraft). Whether a song has significant bass, a tenor melody, or the powerful vocals of a diva, the Arches Gaming Headset translates those sounds into clear, loud, and beautiful sound. When listening to my fellow teammates in Teamspeak or Ventrilo, I was able to hear the chatter clearly, even when more than one person was speaking in a moment of confusion. What amazed me the most was the ability to hear people who are always soft-spoken, something that I struggled to do prior to trying out the SAGH. I have to say, I am both grateful and impressed by this feature of this headset.Finally, my teammates indicated that my voice was clear with no static or background noise interfering with my speech. When chatting on Skype my family indicated that they could hear me with no issues. The best part about the SAGH is the ease with which you can address any softness in your speech delivery: the knob that controls the volume for your earpieces also controls the microphone. The downside to this is that you may have to adjust the volume in-game or through your computer should you find that you have to set the microphone so high that it makes the earpieces too loud for comfort. Fortunately I never experienced that issue.Finally, the SAGH is VERY comfortable, with the fabric band resting comfortably against the top of my head. The ear cushions are comfy, too, although I wish that they were a bit larger. When wearing the headset for an extended period of time, you will need to adjust the earpieces, especially if your ears are a bit bigger than the opening within the foam. I want to caution that even with the size being an issue, there is no pain involved with the discomfort mentioned, more that my ears need a break from having a headset pressed against them over the duration of a raid (roughly two hours, if not longer).In the EndIf you are looking for an economical headset that sounds great, has a flexible microphone that picks up your voice beautifully, and is comfortable to wear, I highly recommend the SenteyÂ® Arches Gaming Headset. The construction is solid and very durable, and with proper care the headset will last you for a very long time. The USB connection doesnâ€™t require any software installation in order for the Arches Headset to function, and your system should pick up the unit with no issues. With the ease of adjusting the volume, microphone output, and the thick, durable USB cable, this is a quality headset that I could see costing much more than it does. If you have the extra $40 handy and want a nice gaming headset, the Arches may be for you.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Cats are little furry balls of neuroses. Over the last five years of cat ownership, I have learned that anything that is sparkly, crinkly, moves suddenly, or even sits still, can be the target of a random kitty attack of DOOM! While I love our kitties, having the little one run about the living room, creating total havoc, just to chase the shadows moving across the wall from traffic outside, went from cute to â€œokay, this is destructiveâ€ when she broke my great-grandfatherâ€™s pocket watch.Enter the Pet MagasinÂ® Cat Tunnel set. Two different collapsible tubes of crinkly fabric wrapped around a flexible wire frame, with one end having a small toy dangling from the opening. Now, as anyone who has owned a cat can attest, felines are notoriously fickle creatures, and I hoped fervently that the new tunnels would stoke their interest.Fortunately, they did!ConstructionThese lightweight cat tunnels are made from colorful fabric that is both tear-resistant and durable. The larger tunnel has loops on one end and plastic, oval â€œbuttonsâ€ on the opposite that enable you to collapse the chute and hook the buttons through the loops, securely keeping the tunnel flat for easy storage. The smaller tunnel has nothing to keep it compressed, but you can use the dangling plastic ball as a rope and wrap the cord around itself. Just a note: if you do this, the tunnel may not stay closed. Therefore, you may want to use Velcro strips or cotton string if you need to store the cat tunnels for any reason.UseBe prepared to endure the loud, crinkly noise that these tunnels create for your kitty! For that reason, you may want to set these up when you have no plans to watch TV, play video games, and/or listen to music; alternatively you can keep these tunnels in another room so that the sound will not disturb you and your family.The noise aside, our kitties love these! They run through them, poke their heads out of the center â€œport holeâ€ on the top of the larger tunnel, and bat the dangling toys like it is going out of style. For added fun, we sprinkled a little bit of catnip into the tunnels, and bore witness to our monster tomcat staking a claim on them. His draconian attempts to hog the tunnels were foiled by the simple fact that he cannot physically be in two locations at the same time, and that our smaller kitty is much more agile than he is.There is also added fun when the cats attempt to sneak through the tunnel to attack the other cat who is on the other side. The crinkle of the fabric betrays their intentions, and watching the cats bounce around and play together is certainly worth the loud noise created by the tunnels.Final SayIf you want a toy that your cat(s) will enjoy, that gives them a place to hide, make noise, and play with dangling toys, the Pet MagasinÂ® Cat Tunnels will fit that niche. Be forewarned, however, that the claim of the tunnels being crinkly is VERY accurate, and the sound can be distracting if you are trying to concentrate on another task. Fortunately, if necessary, both Cat Tunnels can be collapsed flat and stored away until a more convenient playtime presents itself.If you are in the market for toys that are constructed well, offer lots of stimulation for your cat(s), and are relatively inexpensive, you cannot go wrong with these tunnels. So, with this being said, I give these a solid 4 stars. I deducted one star since the smaller tube doesnâ€™t have the built-in buttons that enable you to collapse it easily, forcing you to find another way to keep the tunnel collapsed when you need to store it. Otherwise, this toy is absolutely purr-fect!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Silicone has proven itself to be absolutely amazing for the kitchen. Whether you have silicone oven mitts, cake pans, silicone-dipped tongs, or a variety of other gadgets, silicone is truly an amazingly heat-resistant and flexible product. In keeping with this trend, Home-Complete has developed silicone cupcake liners available in a rainbow of colors. But, are they worth it?ConstructionThere is really not much to say here that isnâ€™t already obvious; these molds are the same shape/size of traditional paper liners that you would use in a muffin pan. The silicone is relatively thin, however, the cups are sturdy enough to maintain their shape even after the cupcake batter is ladled into them. Thus, while you could simply place the liners on a jelly-roll sheet (aka cookie sheet), doing so can result in lopsided cupcakes as the batter expands during baking.UseWhile the Home-Complete Silicone Cupcake Liners are designed for use with muffin tins, I have found that they are wonderful for forming chocolate and other candies that can â€œsetâ€ within a shape. As with most silicone products, these baking cups are naturally nonstick and thus peel off easily from both cupcakes/muffins and cold-set chocolate. No more torn cupcake liners and having to pick off small pieces!Baking with these liners ensures that the heat for each cupcake is spread evenly. While paper liners can sometimes scorch or result in the bottom of a cupcake browning a bit too much, the silicone baking cups prevent that from happening. Unless your oven needs to be recalibrated, the Home-Complete Silicone Liners result in flawless cupcake/muffin results every time. No more scorched cupcakes!Cleaning up the liners is a cinch; all that you need is some warm, soapy water and a little elbow grease. I want to point out that the only aspect of using silicone cupcake liners is that a cake residue does stick to the insides of the cups. Since the cups are fluted the cake â€œgunkâ€ may need a brush to clean the liner thoroughly. That being said, these liners are easier to clean if you flip them inside-out; this exposes all of the inner creases and makes it exponentially simpler to scrub off any residue.Final SayIf you bake a lot of cupcakes and/or muffins, or desire a baking-cup mold in which chocolate or other candies can set, you really should consider purchasing the Home-Complete Silicone Cupcake Liners. In addition to creating less waste, they are wonderful for ensuring that you have wonderfully-baked cupcakes every batch by significantly reducing (if not eliminating outright) the possibility to burn the bottoms of each treat. If anything, the most difficult decision that you need to make is whether to invest in one set (12pk) or two (24pk).So, if you want reusable muffin tin liners that ensure even baking and are easy to clean up, I whole-heartedly recommend the Home-Complete Silicone Cupcake Liners. Definitely five stars!**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"While flashlights (or torches for you Brits) are convenient and a necessity for all sorts of situations, they are cumbersome if you are working on a project that requires the use of both hands. Short of enlisting another person for assistance (I know that kids are free labor and all, but some of us donâ€™t have that option), having to coordinate the positioning of the light while both hands are in your engine compartment is an exercise in madness. Sure, if you are in a house you can always invest in a stand or clip lamp to direct light where you need it, but there will invariably be a project or other situation where these light sources will be irrelevant, not to mention holding a flashlight.Enter the Divine LED Headlamp, the hands-free way to light up whatever is in front of you. Whether it is illuminating your footpath or brightening up a work area, the purpose of the Divine LED headlamp is to make your life easier. So, does it function as well as the manufacturer claims?ConstructionAs the pictures for the Divine LED Headlamp shows, the unit consists of a plastic lamp unit thread through an elastic band. The band can be adjusted to accommodate virtually any head circumference, while the lamp can be tilted from facing straight ahead to facing down at an angle perpendicular to the forehead, along with several angles in-between. A rubberized button on top of the unit is soft to the touch and makes a clicking sound each time it is depressed; there are three different light configurations, the first two can be dimmed to allow you to set just the exact amount of illumination that you need, with the third being a strobe effect. As indicated in the product description, the body of the lamp is waterproof, a fact made easier due to the unit being powered with three AAA batteries (as opposed to requiring a charging cable).As an aside, the â€œRedâ€ unit is actually closer to pink in coloration. The strap is reddish, however.FunctionWhile the Divine LED Headlamp provides hands-free lighting and is comfortable to wear, what sets this headset apart is the fact that you can hold down the power button in order to dim/brighten the LED currently illuminated. Thus, should you have a project that requires lighting but a bright light would not be ideal, the Divine LED Headlamp is a great tool to keep in your home improvement and sporting toolbox. Are you planning to walk through a darkened room but do not want to disturb others? Are you working on a project with a mirrored surface and do not want a lot of glare reflected back toward you? This headset is the answer.The elastic band used with this headset is thick and comfortable, and the buckle enables you to adjust the size of the headband to suit whomever is using it. The band can be small enough to fit a child or large enough to fit around the biggest melon in the house. You can also move the headlamp along the strap so that you can arrange for it to rest against your head without the buckles being nearby. Finally, the battery case is easy to access but also seals tightly, thus ensuring that the Divine LED Headlamp remains waterproof. If there is any complaint about this product, it would be related to inserting the AAA batteries into the unit; I had them pop out a few times before they would remain in place and allow me to close the headset. This is a minor issue, however, so I am only pointing this out to warn you ahead of time.In the EndIf you need a headlamp that can be dimmed, is waterproof, and feels well-made with an adjustable headband, then the Divine LED Headlamp is just what you need. Sure, the â€œredâ€ headlamp is actually pink, and futzing with the batteries is a bit annoying at first, the actual function of the lamp and being able to dim it make this a great investment. Whether you keep this in your car for emergencies, the toolbox for home/work repair, or to use around the house and for safety for events such as Halloweâ€™en, the Divine LED Headlamp will quickly prove itself invaluable. Sure, flashlights may be the go-to method as a portable light source, but having a hands-free method to illuminate what is in front of you is so much more convenient. All-in-all, I give this product 5 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"The first thing that you will notice upon opening your shipment of the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes is their heft. These are not lightweight, cheap brushes; iLoveCos has created a product with thick handles and soft bristles to ensure both comfort and accuracy when applying makeup. In addition, due to the chunkiness of the grips on the brushes, they are comfortable to hold even with arthritic hands. No clawed hands or painful cramps while applying makeup; just like fat crayons for younger children, the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes are useable by anyone.Another feature of the iLoveCos Brushes (henceforth abbreviated as ILCCB) are the dense bristles used in each brush. Whether applying rouge or putting the finishing touch on your smoky eye makeup, the ILCCB set will pick up and retain enough makeup that you may only need one application, rather than having to return repeatedly to the makeup. If there is any complaint involving these brushes, it has to be the lack of a truly fine-point tip. Otherwise, chiseled, straight, narrow, and every other type of makeup application necessity is present within the set.Going back to the comfort aspect, as someone who suffers from lupus, there are times that holding a pen and/or thin brush can be difficult if not downright impossible. With this in mind, iLoveCos created a set of brushes with thick, wooden handles, which allow me to grip each brush with a minimum of discomfort. Even the narrowest brushes exhibit â€œfatterâ€ handles, thus allowing you to apply finishing touches and still have the best grip for maximum control.Final SayIf you are looking for a set of makeup brushes that are well-made with WOOD handles, comfortable to grip, have soft, dense bristles, and have nearly every brush head (cut) needed, then you cannot go wrong with the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brush Set. If you have difficulty grasping traditional makeup brushes, these are practically a godsend as well. So whether for yourself, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient. In short, I give these 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQAIDYQJ1IV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKDRQ30#wasThisHelpful","RKQAIDYQJ1IV4","A3V79KXIY09MOE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V79KXIY09MOE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finding a good Bluetooth speaker can sometimes be frustrating. This difficulty is compounded when you are seeking a waterproof model; the quality of these waterproof/water resistant speakers vary, with the differences increasing exponentially depending upon the features desired. With all of this in mind, the IvationÂ® Boomering Bluetooth Speaker has risen as a contender for the title of â€œBest Waterproof Bluetooth Speakerâ€. As the product description indicates, IvationÂ® promises stellar performance, natch. After a few weeks of use, here are my impressions.ConstructionThe IvationÂ® Boomering Bluetooth Speaker is constructed in the form of a brick, thus following the status quo. There is a rubberized plastic that surrounds the unit on the narrow sides, ensuring a solid grip through the â€œtackyâ€ surface. The control buttons on the rounded and sink into the top of the speaker, however, the control icons are embossed and protrude enough to enable you to feel each button cleanly. The microphone is located on the top of the Boomering near the aforementioned control buttons.The Boomering Bluetooth Speaker, while sharing a similar design with other portable models, separates itself from the rest of the pack through a flap on the short side of the unit. The primary function is to cover the ports that are located underneath it, and to that end it seals thoroughly and is flush with the unit so that it maintains the â€œwater resistantâ€ claims of the manufacturer. More than that, though, is that the Boomering Bluetooth Speaker can also function as a charging unit. Underneath the water seal flap are the micro-USB, DC 5V In, and Audio/Auxiliary cable ports that are used to charge the speaker and connect a non-Bluetooth audio source, respectively. There are additional slots, though: a micro SD memory card, DC 5V Out, and a standard USB port. These ports are used for the Boomeringâ€™s Power Bank capability.FunctionBefore I address the sound quality of the IvationÂ® Boomering Bluetooth Speaker (or IBBS to save my hands from cramping), I want to comment upon the performance of the above-mentioned features/ports located on the side of the speaker. The IBBS was designed as an all-in-one device that functions as a speaker for audio devices (including a cell phone), but also enables the user to connect said audio device to the speakerâ€™s 5V Out power outlets to keep the unit charged. That being said, the standard-sized USB port leaves me confused; when I connected a cable to the speaker and plugged in my Bluetooth headset for charging, no power was sent to the headset. I then plugged the speaker into a wall outlet, thinking that using the IBBS for charging/powering may require the speaker to be connected to a power source; long story short, this did not work either. Seeing as how other reviewers have been able to successfully utilize their Boomering to charge their devices, I am going to chalk my unitâ€™s lack of function as a manufacturing anomaly.Moving on, the IBBS is a Bluetooth speaker with amazing sound given its size. While the bass is not going to result in the unit bouncing around on a tabletop, the loudness and balanced sound quality more than makes up for this. Lyrics, subtle song chords, and nuanced sounds in general are all clearly heard through the IBBS, thus giving larger and more expensive Bluetooth speakers a true run for the money. Whether you are listening to rock, reggae, classical, Gregorian chant, and everything in between, you will be able to enjoy and appreciate your music as loud as you can tolerate. Speaking to this, the claims of the manufacturer that you will have 16 hours of music even when the volume is maximized is a very accurate statement; the IBBS can fill a room and even be heard over the soft chatter of guests. Finally, the IvationÂ® Boomering can be synced through Bluetooth (and it does so quickly) or through NFC, with either method working with no issues, thus eliminating the frustration that can occur when a device decides to be fickle with an established connection. Once you have synced your device the first time, the Boomering will locate it quickly each time the speaker is powered on.Now, while this is all great, there are a few small issues that resulted in my deduction of one star for this review. The sound quality and the speakerâ€™s flexibility in using an audio source through a variety of connection possibilities is great and worth the price of the IBBS alone. However, I found that the control buttons are not as intuitive as I would like. In order to save space the buttons on the top of the unit serve double-duty. While this is not a major issue for the Play/Pause/Answer Call, Power, and Syncing buttons, it is the + and â€“ functions for which I feel there should be dedicated buttons, or at the least, programmed differently. To wit:1) To advance a song, you must double-click the + button; the same rule is required with the â€“ button in order to rewind/go to the previous song.2) To adjust the volume, you only have to push the + or â€“ once per increment. If you press and hold the buttons it will adjust the sound rapidly in either direction (based upon the button pushed). Once you have reached the highest volume, the speaker will beep to alert you to this fact; lowering the volume simply results in the sound disappearing with no beep to let you know that the speaker is at its softest volume.3) Factoring in 1 & 2 above, using the speaker to shuffle through multiple songs is more tedious than it has to be. To that end, if the functionality of the buttons was reversed (so that advancing a song is one button push, while adjusting the volume is a double-press), it would be a bit more convenient.OverallEven with the minor issues mentioned, I still feel that the IvationÂ® Boomering Bluetooth Speaker is a great, water-resistant device that sounds great and accommodates a variety of audio sources to increase its appeal. The sound is great, the battery life is amazing, and you can use the IBBS as a power source to keep your audio device charged while you are enjoying your favorite songs or speaking a friend on a phone call. If you are looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that you can use at home, work, or out by the spa/pool, the Boomering is definitely worth considering. A solid 4 stars.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"Whether your children have several bath toys to gather or you want to store your various bath accoutrements in one location, keeping a bathtub or shower clutter-free can sometimes be problematic. Most showers do not have a lot of storage space, and what space is available is usually occupied by shampoo/conditioner, soap, razors, and other bathroom staples. So what options do you have that are cheaper than installing a new tub/shower surround?ConstructionThe VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer is a mesh bag that hangs from two large suction hooks. Upon opening the bag that it arrives in, I discovered a product that was higher quality than expected. To begin with, the mesh bag is constructed from heavy-duty nylon cord that is woven into a fine-mesh honeycomb pattern. The sides and the bottom of this bag have a white fabric hem that is sewn into place, reinforcing the bag itself and substantially improving the durability and capacity function of the VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer. Finally, the same white fabric that is used as edging for the bag is also used to form the loops from which to hang the organizer from the enclosed hooks.The two hooks that are included are rather large and have a locking design; when the hook is suctioned to the wall, flipping the hook down into the locked position intensifies the suction power and greatly increases the amount of weight that can be hung from it. In addition, the hooks are easier to remove than a standard suction cup; simply lift up the hook to â€œunlockâ€ it and the suction will break. In many instances this would result in the hook coming loose, however, should it not fall off immediately, you can flip up a corner of the suction pad to break the seal (just as you would with a standard suction cup). Another thing to note about the VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer: the included instructions also indicate that you can use alternative hooks and/or â€œpegsâ€ should you wish to use the mesh bag for storage in other locations (such as the laundry room, kitchen, and so forth). It should be noted that these other hanging methods are not included with the Organizer; you will need to purchase those on your own.UseYou cannot really elaborate upon the use of a bag, so I will keep this brief. The hooks are surprisingly strong, as I was able to hang the bag within my bathtub/shower and then load the bag with two full bottles of shampoo, a face cleanser bottle, and bath pouf with no issues. The best aspect, though, has to be the fact that this bag is HUGE, with my bag having room for more bottles of shampoo if I had any to place within it. The internal storage dimensions are 16â€ L x 13â€ W, giving you plenty of space to store your toiletry needs and/or bath toys. Finally, the bag is mildew resistant, so you do not have to worry about wet toys or other contents ruining the bag over time. With all of this taken into consideration, it is safe to say that the usability (and thus the function) of the VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer meets and even exceeds my expectations.Final SayIf you are in need of some way to store your childâ€™s bath toys, toiletry items, or anything else within your tub/shower, the VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer is worth the investment. The bag is large and mildew resistant, the construction is solid, and the hooks that are included are both strong and decently-sized. Whether as a necessity for yourself or as a gift for another, this is a nice product that will help keep your bathroom (or laundry, or kitchenâ€¦) tidier. When you factor in the modest price, the VIVAÂ® Bath Toy Organizer is a no-brainer. I definitely recommend it.**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.
